			<p>In March 2024, NCSOFT Acting Chairman <strong>Park Byeong</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-3-was-reportedly-greenlit-by-ncsoft-but-dont-get-too-excited-yet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">let it slip</a> during an investor meeting that Bellevue-based subsidiary <strong>ArenaNet</strong> had already started working on <strong>Guild Wars 3</strong>. Of course, the studio was not ready for a proper announcement yet, so its response was that they were focused on new <strong>Guild Wars 2</strong> updates and expansions (which have been released annually since 2023). Not a confirmation, but crucially, not a denial, either.</p>



<p>Nearly two years later, <strong><a href="https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/arenanet/jobs/7536965" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new job ad</a></strong> was spotted by the Internet sleuths from Reddit, reigniting discussions around the project. The ad seeks a 'Contract Senior Writer/Narrative Designer' for an unannounced project, so definitely not for new Guild Wars 2 content. The most interesting part, though, is where ArenaNet details the expertise that the would-be employee needs to have: <strong>MMOs</strong> and <strong>Unreal Engine</strong>. The former is another hint that they are indeed talking about Guild Wars 3, or whatever the next installment in the series will be called, and the latter suggests <strong>the studio might switch from its proprietary engine to Epic's game-making technology</strong>. </p>



<p>Here's a full list of what you'll need to actually have a chance, just in case anyone reading might be looking to apply:</p>



<ul>
<li><em>Bachelor’s degree in literature, creative writing, screenwriting, or related field or an equivalent combination of education, training, and experience.</em></li>



<li><em>5 years of experience as a professional writer or copyeditor, with applicable portfolio samples, including <strong>2 years of experience developing MMORPGs</strong> and open-world games</em></li>



<li><em>Experience shipping one or more AAA-quality product(s) or nongame equivalent(s), in a writing or editing capacity.</em></li>



<li><em>Understanding of general writing and narrative design concepts</em>.</li>



<li><em>Dramatic writing skills, preferably in writing for games and at least one other narrative medium (e.g., screenwriting, playwriting, prose, etc.)</em>.</li>



<li><em>Copyediting skills</em>.</li>



<li><em>Practical and philosophical editing/writing knowledge</em>.</li>



<li><em>Understanding of breaking serialized stories at the season and episode levels</em>.</li>



<li><em>Understanding of or experience in interactive and non-linear storytelling, using non-traditional and non-verbal delivery systems (e.g., environmental storytelling, in-engine storytelling without cutscenes, etc.)</em></li>



<li><em>Knowledge of character creation, story arc design, and dialogue writing</em>.</li>



<li><em>Able to learn and use proprietary tools to create content.</em></li>



<li><em>Familiar with gameplay systems</em>.</li>



<li><em><strong>Experience using Unreal Engine</strong>.</em></li>



<li><em>Excellent written and verbal communication skills.</em></li>



<li><em>Excellent organizational skills.</em></li>



<li><em>Able to work independently and in a team</em>.</li>



<li><em>Understanding of and ability to use&nbsp;The Chicago Manual of Style</em>.</li>



<li><em>Familiar with video game narratives, <strong>preferably MMOs</strong>.</em></li>



<li><em>Familiar with narrative game systems.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>ArenaNet has been posting job ads about a new online game since 2022, so it might not be long until the studio shares something in an official capacity, but there's no telling exactly when. Still, given the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/is-the-mmo-genre-dead-for-western-aaa-developers-we-asked-three-industry-veterans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">near-complete absence of new triple-A Western MMORPGs</a></strong>, Guild Wars 3 might be the only hope on the horizon.</p>

<figcaption><em>Trails Beyond the Horizon </em>has a refreshing attitude to PC tinkering.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Amusingly, Thoman points to one instance in <em>Trails Beyond the Horizon </em>in which in-game settings are hard-capped at "high"; the scene is a grain field, and without this cap, "utterly absurd amounts of individual, fully modeled stalks of grain being rendered" would become an issue at Ultra.</p><p>If, however, you do want to crank this hard-capped setting up for some reason, you can find a parameter in the settings file marked "allow_silly_grain_levels", and switching this to "true" will let you render those stalks. As Thoman says, though, there is "absolutely no reason to do this".</p><p>As well as discussing the pitfalls of porting games to PC, Thoman also says <em>Trails Beyond the Horizon </em>is being optimized to work with as many hardware configurations as possible.</p><p>He points to the example of one of the game's testers, who still uses an Nvidia GTX Titan, a GPU that was current about 13 years ago but which has since begun to lag behind. Surprise surprise, <em>Trails Beyond the Horizon </em>will support that GPU.</p>
<p><em>Trails Beyond the Horizon </em>is the latest game in <em>The Legend of Heroes</em>' ongoing <em>Trails </em>sub-series, continuing story arcs from various other <em>Trails </em>games including <em>Cold Steel </em>and <em>Daybreak</em>.</p><p>The game is available now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3316940/The_Legend_of_Heroes_Trails_beyond_the_Horizon/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10012789" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/the-legend-of-heroes-trails-beyond-the-horizon-switch/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch</a>.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-framerate-dlc-2000660149</link>
            <guid>1407025</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-review-ps5-open-world-rpg-capcom-1851766113"><i><span>Monster Hunter Wilds</span></i></a><span>‘</span><span> performance on PC has been notoriously bad <a href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mhw-tu4-title-update-4-pc-fixed-2000652579">going back to launch</a>, and nobody is quite sure why. One new theory suggests part of the problem could be related to all of the game’s DLC add-ons and how it checks for them. It sounds wild, but video footage has made it one of the most convincing possibilities yet.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Yesterday, user u/de_Tylmarande published a rather lengthy post on the r/MonsterHunter subreddit titled “</span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1qcy3hn/mh_wilds_bad_performance_mystery_solved/?share_id=sKxGG694fIAcaycKb_Qhd&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1"><span>MH Wilds – Bad performance mystery (Solved?)</span></a><span>” As they explain, they discovered the issue by mere chance after playing </span><i><span>Monster Hunter Wilds</span></i><span> through a friend’s Steam account. They immediately noticed that, even though they were using the same machine, </span><i><span>Monster Hunter Wilds’ </span></i><span>FPS was dramatically better when playing the game through their friend’s account than on their own.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>After some testing, u/de_Tylmarande came to a bizarre conclusion: the only difference was that their friend had bought all of </span><i><span>Monster Hunter Wilds’ </span></i><span>downloadable content on Steam. As they explained, “on the account with no DLC I get heavy and stable FPS drops down to like 20-25 in hubs, while on the account with all DLC bought it’s 80+ FPS.”</span></p>

  <p><span>Obviously, this claim was a little hard to believe for some users on the subreddit, so u/de_Tylmarande </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uf5cICpDXX0"><span>provided a video</span></a><span> of themselves utilizing a custom mod they created that essentially bypasses </span><i><span>Monster Hunter Wilds</span></i><span>’ DLC checks. The theory has gone viral online as a result. </span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>But the story gets even weirder, because u/de_Tylmarande revealed that this isn’t the first time they’ve discovered a performance fix for one of Capcom’s PC games. According to them, </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1qcy3hn/comment/nzmfveb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>they contacted Capcom</span></a><span> with an FPS fix for </span><i><span>Dragon’s Dogma 2</span></i><span> back in 2024. They claim that fix was then incorporated into the next patch for the open-world RPG on Steam.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>It’s also worth noting that </span><i><span>Monster Hunter Wilds</span></i><span> players on PC </span><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/monster-hunter-wilds-steam-reviews-absolutely-tank-as-players-lose-patience-with-its-technical-woes-every-time-the-game-gets-updated-my-performance-decreases/"><span>have felt</span></a><span> like performance keeps getting worse with each new update. Each new update for the game also comes paired with new DLC. As of writing, </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/dlc/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/list/162627"><span>190 individual pieces of DLC</span></a><span> are available for the game on Steam. This new theory would explain a lot.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>Capcom hasn’t yet confirmed the modder’s findings or substantiated how much of the performance issues might be attributable to the DLC checks. The Reddit sleuth also made clear that they don’t think Capcom is doing any of this on purpose to incentivize players to buy DLC. “I did NOT mean Capcom did this on purpose,” de_Tylmarande wrote in an addendum. “No, no, and again no…it’s just a bug in the code they need to fix.”</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>No word from Capcom’s end yet on the veracity of de_Tylmarande’s findings, but it will be interesting to see if the issue is suddenly resolved once the next patch for </span><i><span>Monster Hunter Wilds </span></i><span>drops on PC.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Overwatch 2 Teases Its Next Hero And Fans Are Already Underwhelmed]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-anran-hero-tease-leak-voiceline-echo-wuyang-2000660148</link>
            <guid>1407022</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>As a competitive game, </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span> is in the best state it’s ever been, but its story and hero selection are in a much more tenuous place. Blizzard is finally </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-story-pve-canceled-campaign-null-sector-2000641177"><span>moving the hero shooter’s narrative along</span></a><span> and teasing heroes fans have been </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-emre-sarioglu-freja-animated-trailer-who-is-1851771309"><span>waiting to learn more about for years</span></a><span>, but it’s still mostly just gesturing at forward momentum rather than making significant leaps. Now, the team is teasing the next hero coming to the game, and the character in question is arguably emblematic of the rut </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>’s found itself in.</span></p> <p><span>Anran, a fire-wielding hero and the older sister of Wuyang, has been teased already as an upcoming hero, but it seems now she might be imminent. Blizzard released a short audio drama of gorilla scientist Winston sending out invitations to join the Overwatch team while looking at footage of Anran and Wuyang fighting Omnic soldiers.</span></p>

  <p><span>If that wasn’t enough confirmation, fans have datamined voice files of Echo, a hero who can transform into other characters, replicating what seems to be Anran’s Ultimate voice line.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">❗ Anran ultimate voicelines are ALREADY in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Overwatch2?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Overwatch2</a> game files</p> <p>You can find them among Echo phrases (her imitating other heroes ultimates). Fun fact: in non-English versions of the game these lines were voiced by a new voice, potentially voice of Anran in the corresponding… <a href="https://t.co/OeIpxCVa44">pic.twitter.com/OeIpxCVa44</a></p> <p>— OverFire / Overwatch (@overfire_news) <a href="https://twitter.com/overfire_news/status/2011521527468941516?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 14, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Anran could be a great hero, but her moving this quickly up the hero queue means a few things. First, it likely means that </span><i><span>Overwatch 2 </span></i><span>is once again passing up a chance to add a new tank hero. We’ve seen Anran in action </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytZnOGwEq9s"><span>in Wuyang’s promo trailer</span></a><span>, and she seems very light on her feet and offense based, unlike the usually bulky, brawling, defensive tanks in the game. 2025 came and went without a new tank being added to the roster, with Blizzard opting to release one support character in Wuyang and two damage heroes in Freja and Vendetta, so tank mains are feeling a little burned right now.</span></p>

 <p><span>Second, </span><i><span>Overwatch 2 </span></i><span>fans have criticized the game for what they perceive to be characters “made for skin sales,” which usually means young, conventionally attractive characters who aren’t quite part of the main story, and who some feel </span><a href="https://x.com/Kagamine_asheOW/status/2011493297731375575?s=20"><span>get skins churned out for them</span></a><span> but little other attention from the devs. Some also have called out that </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>, a game often celebrated for its diversity, has been </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-kiriko-mercy-venture-reaper-season-12-skins-1851626893"><span>showing favoritism to its east Asian heroes</span></a><span> when it comes to skins, and Anran would be </span><a href="https://x.com/LALALLALLALA21/status/2011492390415053159?s=20"><span>another character</span></a><span> who falls into that category.</span></p>

 <p><span>Not everyone is upset, mind you, but Blizzard has said a few questionable things about upcoming heroes that have fans worried about the future of the game’s hero designs. Though the team did walk it back, there was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-oddball-aspirational-character-hero-design-2000617761"><span>a brief controversy</span></a><span> last year about the game moving away from “oddball” heroes like Winston and the robot-piloting hamster Wrecking Ball in favor of “aspirational” characters. Fans took this to pretty much mean “young and hot,” and Blizzard quickly responded saying that “oddities” were still important to the game, and that a character who matches that description is in the works. We’re still waiting on them, though. I guess we’ll see them sometime after Anran, who all evidence points to being the next new hero joining in a future season.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Playtika, the mobile developer behind games like Bingo Blitz and World Series of Poker, has announced plans for mass layoffs at the company.</p>



<p>In an SEC filing on Wednesday, the company revealed its plans to cut staff as part of company-wide restructuring.</p>







<p>Playtika says that the decision comes <strong>“as part of a larger adjustment to the company’s cost structure and reallocation of<br>resources within its portfolio of games.”</strong> Overall, the company is looking to let go around 15% of its staff during the first quarter of 2026.</p>



<p>That amounts to roughly 450-500 employees for a company with over 3,000 employees globally. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-playtika-told-employees-about-the-layoffs">What Playtika Told Employees About The Layoffs</h2>



<p>As part of the SEC filing, Playtika provided the email that CEO Robert Antokol sent to staff announcing the decision.</p>



<p>In his email, Antokol said that it<strong> “was not made lightly”</strong> and that it reflects a <strong>“fundamental shift in how we operate so we can invest in the future and remain a leader in a highly competitive mobile games market.”</strong></p>







<p><strong>“For years, we operated with a broad growth mindset, applying similar resourcing models across our portfolio of games,”</strong> Antokol said. <strong>“The economic reality of our industry has shifted.”</strong></p>



<p>He continued to say that if the company didn’t adjust their strategy, it would compromise its <strong>“ability to invest in tomorrow”. </strong></p>



<p>As far as what the future holds for Playtika, Antokol said that the company is <strong>“moving away from headcount-heavy operations to streamlined teams powered by AI and automation.”</strong></p>



<p>He said that with this move, it allows Playtika to offer clearer career paths and better compensation to the employees being kept. For those being let go, Antokol said that they are “committed to treating all impacted employees with respect and compassion.” All employees will be given severance packages and “support to help ease this transition”.</p>

This relates to the Space Wolves army set that launched in May last year, and which you can see in the image below. It contains 28 brand-new miniatures, a Codex Supplement for the Great Companies of Fenris, a set of datasheet cards, and a new transfer sheet. In terms of minis, the army set includes a Wolf Guard Battle Leader, a Wolf Priest, three Wolf Guard Headtakers, 10 Blood Claws, and 10 Grey Hunters.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/15/sundaypreview-may18-40k-image1-spacewolvesarmyset-0fwzioojgu-1768482702571.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Space Wolves army set. Image credit: Games Workshop.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Rountree called the army set format one that is “specifically designed for hobbyists who want ‘all the new miniatures’ in a release.” Clearly, it proved popular. This army set benefited from amazing-looking minis, the amount of time since the Space Wolves had seen a refresh, and the enduring popularity of the Space Wolves themselves. The Space Wolves army set is sold out at Games Workshop, leaving fans faced with the prospect of paying a markup from the likes of eBay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For the uninitiated, the Space Wolves are a long-running and legendary chapter of Space Marines heavily inspired by Norse mythology and Viking culture. They’re a savage, in your face group who like getting up close and ripping their enemies to shreds with the help of actual space wolves. Their primarch (demigod sons of the Emperor who led the original Space Marine legions before the Horus Heresy tore them apart), is Leman Russ, one of the most popular in the setting despite the fact he has never been active in the 41st millennium (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-warhammer-40000-narrative-finally-looks-set-for-a-significant-jolt-forward-after-500-worlds-book-teases-long-awaited-meeting-of-primarchs-roboute-guilliman-and-lion-eljonson">there are rumblings he may return, as Ultramarines boss Roboute Guilliman and Dark Angels chief Lion El'Jonson have</a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Space Wolves — as evidenced by their army set sales record — are right up there in terms of Space Marine chapter popularity. Without having hard data to back up this claim, I’d suggest the Ultramarines are there or thereabouts given they’re the poster boys of Warhammer 40,000, and Ultramarines captain Titus, protagonist of the hugely popular Space Marine 2 video game, is leading the tabletop wargame's next narrative expansion. But I suspect the Blood Angels (glorious space vampires with a dark secret), and the Dark Angels (righteous space crusaders) aren’t far behind.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So! I’ve put together a poll, below, with what I suspect are the likely candidates for most popular Space Marine chapter, so that IGN’s readers can vote for their favorite. For science! For the Emperor!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In other Warhammer news, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-maker-games-workshop-bans-its-staff-from-using-ai-in-its-content-or-designs-says-none-of-its-senior-managers-are-currently-excited-about-the-tech">Games Workshop has banned the use of AI in the making of its various products</a>, much to the delight of fans.

For instance, Super Mario World players might know that bringing Yoshi into the last battle with Bowser shouldn't be possible. Well, it's not without a glitch putting the green dinosaur in the reserve item box--which houses power-ups like the Cape Feather or mushroom. The latter comes into play to consume Peach, as timing is important to have Yoshi trying to eat that as the mushroom falls and then it's replaced with the princess. Basically, this isn't an easy trick to pull off while defeating Bowser.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/MarioBrothBlog/status/2011493949412982845" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Using a combination of glitches in Super Mario World, Yoshi can be taken into the final battle, where he can eat Peach upon Bowser's defeat.

<p>The game's launch, however, was only the beginning. Following Season 1 which brought back both fan favorites like Andy Bogard and Joe Higashi and iconic characters from the Street Fighter series like Ken and Chun-Li, Season 2 will bring even more iconic characters like Wolfgang Krauser, Blue Mary and Kim Jae Hoon, as well as two mystery characters - one<a href="https://x.com/SNKPofficial/status/2009414900343558604"><strong> teased to be none other than <em>Kenshiro</em> from <em>Hokuto no Ken</em></strong></a> (<em><strong>Fist of the North Star</strong></em>)</p>



<p>Ahead of the Season 2 announcement, we had the chance to speak with <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">FATAL FURY: City of the Wolves</em> Producer Shinya Tamaki and Director Hayato Konya to discuss the new character additions, the balance changes coming with a big balance patch launching on January 22 and what's in store for the future.</p>

<p><strong>Wccftech: FATAL Fury: City of the Wolves Season 2 brings back heavyweights like Blue Mary, Kim Jae Hoon, and the legendary Wolfgang Krauser. The latter, in particular, hasn’t been a playable character of the "main" timeline for quite some time. How does his return fit into the game with the presence of Rock Howard and the legacy of Geese?</strong></p>

Please look forward to his release for further details.</em></p>



<p><strong>Wccftech: Wolfgang Krauser is fondly remembered by long-time SNK fans for his iconic Dies Irae music track. Can fans expect a new arrangement of this classic to debut alongside him, or is the sound team exploring a completely new musical direction for his arrival in South Town?</strong></p>



<p><strong>(Konya):</strong> <em>This is also something we cannot talk much about at this time, so please look forward to his release.</em></p>

<p><strong>Wccftech: Including Nightmare Geese as a new character is definitely an interesting choice. Since Rock has spent his life trying to escape his father’s shadow, does Nightmare Geese appear as a literal haunting/vision for Rock Howard, or is he a simple gameplay addition to bring back an iconic character in some way?</strong></p>



<p><strong>(Konya):</strong> <em>Since Geese himself has died, he cannot be involved in the main storyline. Therefore, this time he appears in the game solely as the “Nightmare of South Town.” Even after death, we believe he would still be a “nightmare” for those living in South Town.</em></p>



<p><strong>Wccftech: With Jae Hoon joining the roster, the Kim family legacy is now front and centre. How does his playstyle in CotW evolve from his Garou: Mark of the Wolves days, and can we expect any "family reunions" in the future?</strong></p>



<p><strong>(Konya):</strong> <em>We wanted Jae Hoon to have a different evolution than his brother. We figured he would carry and refine his father's techniques more accurately, so he will have a distinct playstyle to his MotW version. We hope you look forward to it. If both sons continue to do well, we may even see their father again someday.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-the-monthly-cadence-and-guest-characters">The Monthly Cadence and Guest Characters</h3>



<p><strong>Wccftech: Season 2 will also see the debut of two other mystery characters. Without giving too much away, can you say if the two unannounced challengers in Season 2 follow the trend of "legendary fighters" from SNK's history, or should fans expect more guest characters like Ken and Chun-Li in Season 1?</strong></p>

We are sure fans will be delighted to see who they are, so please look forward to it.</em></p>



<p><strong>Wccftech: Speaking about guest characters, what is it that would make a character a good fit for FATAL FURY: City of the Wolves? Ken and Chun-Li were designed to feel like their SF6 versions but adapted to the REV system, but for the future, would you be looking for guests that contrast the South Town style, or guests that feel like they’ve always lived there?</strong></p>



<p><strong>(Tamaki):</strong> <em>As you said, we think that characters that match the world and themes of Fatal Fury make for the best fit. However, we also want to challenge ourselves in terms of game design and make this a game where you can enjoy various kinds of fighting styles and characters with unique traits. Any character that adds to the world of Fatal Fury by their inclusion, as well as a character that fans would enjoy being added, these are the two things we want to prioritize.</em></p>

<p><strong>Wccftech: Releasing a character every month is a very aggressive pace for a modern 2D fighter. What led to the decision to move to this monthly cadence for Season 2, and how does your development pipeline support a quick turnaround without sacrificing quality? Is a new character every month something that should be expected in future seasons as well?</strong></p>



<p><strong>(Tamaki):</strong> <em>Since this is our first Fatal Fury release in 26 years, we heard from a great number of fans that they wanted to use "this character" or "that character." As developers, we wanted to respond to the players' requests as quickly as possible, so we immediately worked to expand our development scope and capacity. As a result, we finally have the resources to be able to add one character per month starting from October 2025. We will work hard to maintain this cadence for as long as possible going forward, aiming to deliver character additions and updates to the players at a rapid pace.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-upcoming-balance-changes">Upcoming Balance Changes</h3>



<p><strong>Wccftech: With the game changing every 30 days as a new fighter joins the roster, how do you expect the competitive landscape to keep up?</strong></p>



<p><strong>(Tamaki):</strong> <em>While new characters will be joining the fray, the core gameplay remains unchanged. We hope that players will leverage the skills they've honed thus far to compete and enjoy fighting with these new characters as well.</em></p>



<p><strong>Wccftech: FATAL Fury: City of the Wolves Season 2 will be accompanied by a major system-wide balance patch. What are some of the most notable changes? And what's the philosophy behind all the upcoming balance changes?</strong></p>



<p><strong>(Konya):</strong> <em>In Season 1, so-called "Standard" characters stood out a bit too prominently, and we felt like characters with other concepts did not get much opportunity to shine. Starting from Season 2, we want to make adjustments that allow those kinds of characters to thrive as well.</em></p>



<p><strong>Wccftech: It has been mentioned that the update will feature system adjustments based on player feedback. What was the #1 request from the community that you were able to address in this upcoming update?</strong></p>



<p><strong>(Tamaki):</strong> <em>This update releasing on 1/22 includes changes in response to the many things fans have been asking for. We believe that the long time fans have been waiting has allowed us to thoroughly refine the game, so please look forward to it and enjoy it.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-the-future-of-the-game">The Future of the Game</h3>



<p><strong>Wccftech: FATAL FURY: City of the Wolves has successfully brought the series back into the global spotlight. As we look past Season 2, what is your long-term vision for the game? Do you see City of the Wolves as a platform that will continue to grow for years to come?</strong></p>



<p><strong>(Tamaki):</strong> <em>Thank you for your kind words. As developers, we are extremely happy that we were able to bring an IP as cherished by both us and the fans as Fatal Fury back after 26 years. We are deeply grateful to the fans for the positive messages and feedback as well. This has only made us more determined to continue showing off the appeal of the wonderful world of Fatal Fury to even more players. We will continue to work hard as developers to meet fan expectations, so please look forward to the continued growth of FATAL FURY: City of the Wolves.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It looks as though Sony has just deleted the entire back catalog of a certain publisher from the PlayStation Store, which means that if you're a PS5 owner, you now have significantly fewer shovelware games to slog through when you're browsing for discounts.</p><p>As spotted by self-proclaimed "trophy hunter" <a href="https://x.com/robthanatos/status/2011487254724952207" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">RobThanatos on X</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-wiped-over-1000-shovelware-games-off-the-playstation-store-without-warning-all-from-a-single-developer" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eurogamer</a>), all of publisher ThiGames' titles appear to have been removed from the PSN Store, which amounts to precisely 1,194 titles.</p><p>If you're unfamiliar with the work of ThiGames, perhaps some of the studio's game titles will jog your memory; it's responsible for trophy-centric games like <em>The Jumping Food Memory</em>, <em>The Jumping Orange 2</em>, and <em>The Jumping Cheese Maze</em>. You may have spotted a pattern emerging here.</p><figure role="group">

  </article>

<figcaption>If you've browsed the PSN Store during sales, you've probably seen stuff like this.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As RobThanatos points out, ThiGames enjoyed the distinction of having the fourth highest number of games on the PlayStation Store prior to Sony's cull, beaten out only by similarly low-scope publishers Webnetic and Ratalaika, as well as niche studio eastasiasoft.</p><p>It doesn't look as though games ThiGames has yet to release have been removed, however; at time of writing, the store page for <em>The Jumping Food Memory </em>(which I'm sure will buck the trend and turn out to be an all-timer) is <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10009259" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">still up</a>.</p><p>ThiGames' titles are, or at least seem to be, low-effort releases designed to rack up trophies quickly rather than to engage or stimulate. It's often possible to collect all of the trophies in a ThiGames release in a handful of minutes.</p><p>The games are usually incredibly simple in terms of gameplay and visuals, often consisting of a single backdrop accompanied by a familiar and very basic take on an existing genre (assuming the gameplay isn't just, well, jumping, that is).</p>
<p>Whether or not this is part of a wider effort on Sony's part to crack down on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/shovelware-importance-games-industry" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9ec3beae-77dd-466c-9dbd-b14356e65d73" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">shovelware</a> on the PlayStation Store remains to be seen, but at the very least, your trophy hunting has just gotten more difficult, it seems.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <guid>1406980</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple wasted no time ushering in the new year with a compelling deal on one of its most popular laptops. Just weeks into 2026, the 2025 MacBook Air has already received a notable price drop, making it far more accessible for students, professionals, and everyday users alike. Amazon i<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5068/">s currently offering the M4-powered MacBook Air with 256GB storage for $799, a substantial reduction from its original $999 price tag</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5068/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>At just 2.7 pounds, this latest MacBook Air remains an ideal companion for commuters, travelers, and anyone who prefers a lightweight setup without sacrificing capability. The slim chassis hides impressive hardware, including a 10-core CPU and up to a 10-core GPU, along with support for as much as 24GB of unified memory. Powered by Apple’s M4 chip, the laptop delivers a major leap in speed – up to twice the performance of the M1 Air and dramatically faster than older Intel-based models (23 times faster to be exact).</p>
<h2>Everyday Performance</h2>
<p>Apple engineered the M4 chip to work seamlessly with its growing suite of Apple Intelligence features. This means smoother multitasking, quicker responses, and improved efficiency across demanding applications. Whether you’re juggling spreadsheets, editing photos and videos, or running multiple apps and browser tabs, the MacBook Air handles it all with ease while staying cool and silent even with its fanless design.</p>
<p>Battery life remains one of the Air’s strongest advantages. With up to 18 hours of use on a single charge, it’s built to last through long workdays or extended study sessions without constantly searching for an outlet.</p>



<p>The upgraded 12MP front-facing camera captures crisp 1080p video, making it a solid choice for remote work, online classes, and video calls. Paired with a three-microphone array, voice clarity is excellent even without additional accessories.</p>
<p>Everyday usability features are well covered. The backlit Magic Keyboard offers a comfortable typing experience in any lighting condition, while Touch ID provides quick and secure access. Connectivity includes two Thunderbolt ports for high-speed data transfers and external displays, MagSafe charging for added safety, and – thankfully – a traditional headphone jack for wired audio fans who refuse to give up their AUX-powered headphones.</p>
<p>For users already invested in Apple’s ecosystem, the MacBook Air integrates effortlessly with other devices. Features like AirDrop, iMessage, and Handoff make switching between an iPhone, iPad, and Mac feel seamless.</p>
<p>Several configurations are currently discounted. The base 256GB model starts at $799, the 512GB version sits at $999. Each of those comes with 16GB of RAM. A higher-end option with 24GB of RAM and 512GB of storage is priced at $1,199. All represent a $200 cut from their original prices and are available in four finishes: sky blue, silver, starlight, and midnight.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The countdown to IEM Rio 2026 is well underway, and in the run-up to the event, ESL has unveiled the complete lineup of teams set to compete at the upcoming CS2 spectacle. The tournament kicks off on April 13 and will run for <strong>six days</strong>, with all comers battling for the biggest piece of the $1 million prize pool in Rio de Janeiro.</p>



<p>ESL confirmed the full roster of direct invites sent on January 15, along with the spread of teams selected for the GCQ and ACQ. From these qualifiers, another three teams will surface, two coming from the global bracket and one from the Americas bracket.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-teams-confirmed-for-iem-rio-2026-by-esl">All Teams Confirmed for IEM Rio 2026 by ESL</h2>



<p>The ESL posted a graphic on social media revealing the split of teams invited to IEM Rio 2026. Here’s the full rundown:</p>



<p><strong>Direct Invites</strong>:</p>



<ul>
<li>PASSION UA</li>



<li>FURIA</li>



<li>Team Vitality</li>



<li>Team Falcons</li>



<li>Spirit</li>



<li>Natus Vincere</li>



<li>MOUZ</li>



<li>Aurora Gaming</li>



<li>B8</li>



<li>Legacy</li>



<li>G2 Esports</li>



<li>Team Liquid</li>



<li>3DMAX</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Global Closed Qualifier Invites</strong>:</p>



<ul>

<ul>
<li>Imperial Esports</li>



<li>Fluxo</li>



<li>BESTIA</li>



<li>YNG Sharks</li>
</ul>



<p>Fans noticed a few notable absences, namely from the organizations that were quick to decline their invites: Astralis, NiP, and FlyQuest, for instance. In the Americas Closed Qualifier, PaiN, NRG, and M80 all declined a spot.</p>



<p>There’s more than the face-value price pool to play for at <a href="https://pro.eslgaming.com/tour/2026/01/iem-rio-2026-invited-teams/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IEM Rio</a>, of course. The tournament is one of the main contributors to the ESL Grand Slam, which awards <strong>one organization </strong>$1 million. It’s the most prestigious prize in the Counter-Strike 2 space, and it’s what many of these teams play for.</p>

Don’t worry, grandma pulls her weight.</p><p><strong>Case the Joint</strong></p><p>Plan ahead to lay the groundwork for a beautiful masterpiece of an escape. Check the getaway route, fiddle with puzzles and obstacles, and find spots to recruit the help of the right teammates.</p><p><strong>Get In. Get Out.</strong></p><p>Once you’ve set the stage carefully and the artifact is sitting all pretty—looking quite not-stolen, but no worries, you’re gonna fix that ASAP—this is the moment to perform. Plucking an artifact from its resting spot starts the countdown timer, and with Nomali’s flow-based parkour abilities, escape should feel like you’re in the fun, montage part of a heist movie. But if you slacked on the planning phase, you’re gonna pay for it!</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Pull Off Heists</strong> – Plan and prepare your escape route by solving puzzles and placing teammates in the right place. When you’re ready, take the artifact and escape with Nomali’s flow-based parkour abilities.</li><li><strong>Recruit a Crew</strong> – Meet and gradually recruit different team members with their unique abilities.</li><li><strong>Explore an Africanfuturist Setting</strong> – With a Hideout based in South Africa, you’ll see parts of Johannesburg imagined in the future.</li><li><strong>Reclaim Real Artifacts</strong> – Recover 70 artifacts that exist in real-life, all of which are of huge cultural, historical, and spiritual significance to the people they were taken from.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Relooted (2026) | Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iM311P33398?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/relooted-launches-february-10]]></content:encoded>

<p>Afghani said he refers to himself as "the second guy who's doing Mario," with Martinet forever standing as "<em>the </em>guy."</p><p>"There is such an unbelievable respect for Charles. He is amazing," Afghani said.</p><p>Afghani began his career as Mario with 2023's Super Mario Bros. Wonder. Asked if he now gets recognized for his role, he said it "doesn't happen very often," in part because the job he does is mostly off screen.</p><p>"Nobody thinks about who does the voice of Mario. Ever. Everybody knows who Mario is. But the second you're like, 'He has a voice actor,' it's like, 'Oh, yeah, I guess he must,'" Afghani said.</p><p>Also in the interview, Afghani dispelled the rumor that he previously did narration work for Nintendo Directs in the past. It isn't true, he said. "There's this weird narrative online I was in Nintendo Directs; I narrated Nintendo Directs. I never worked for Nintendo before being Mario," he said.</p>

<p>The three Switch 1 SKUs combine for 46,360, while the PS5 models total in at 46,753 — talk about a close-run contest!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>launched almost a year ago, and since it released, players have been complaining about poor PC performance despite having machines more than capable (theoretically, at least) of handling things. Now, we might know why.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1qcy3hn/mh_wilds_bad_performance_mystery_solved/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">lengthy post</a> on Reddit, user de_Tylmarande outlines an experimental process by which they attempted to glean the reason behind <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' PC performance, which Capcom has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-optimizations-winter" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="69cb0344-d686-4265-ba86-2163d899fb4c" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">acknowledged and pledged to fix</a> (the performance, not the post).</p><p>To boil the post down, de_Tylmarande essentially noticed that when playing <em>Wilds </em>on their friend's Steam account, which owns all of the available DLC, the frame rate was stable and there were no drops. On their own account, however, de_Tylmarande experienced frequent drops.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>The cause of <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' poor PC performance may have been solved.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This naturally led the user to conclude that <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' frame drops and PC problems are down to what they call "an insanely crooked and aggressive DLC ownership check function".</p><p>In order to prove their theory, de_Tylmarande created a sort of mod that essentially fools <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>into thinking the player owns all of its associated DLC. The mod doesn't actually unlock any of that DLC; instead, it just tricks the game into passing the check.</p><p>According to de_Tylmarande, once that mod was in place, "performance went through the roof". They stress that they don't recommend trying this solution and don't promote "using mods of this type" in <em>Wilds</em>, but that they did so in order to prove a point.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1qcy3hn/comment/nzlrkxg/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">response</a>, a user suggests that this issue might be an example of "good enough for now" code being left in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, then never being fixed, leading to unpredictable problems later down the line. It's entirely possible.</p>
<p>In any case, unless you're looking to create a mod like de_Tylmarande's yourself (which they don't suggest), it's unlikely you'll be able to solve this problem for yourself. Still, it's an interesting thing to ponder.</p><p>The poor PC performance players have reported didn't stop <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-8m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a0bfff7f-18bd-4b40-b07b-fe8c94d70a1a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">selling like hot cakes</a> in its initial <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-10m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3047bd12-37c9-4b65-bd39-064968be79fa" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">launch window</a>, although sales have since slowed, with Capcom blaming that slowdown not on the PC version, but <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-ps5-barrier-capcom" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a0c5ff11-5fb9-4929-804b-8a8d4f7adae0" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">the PS5 release</a>.</p><p>You can check out <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/monster-hunter-wilds/9NMT6XFN0LVD" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and you can read our very own Tyler's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/monster-hunter-wilds-review-new-frontier" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4b7be4a2-09a5-4299-a13c-a7bff937e081" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">review of the game here</a>.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <title><![CDATA[Here’s Sophie Turner As Lara Croft For The New Tomb Raider Show]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/sophie-turner-lara-croft-tomb-raider-2000660139</link>
            <guid>1406920</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sophie Turner, best known for her roles as Sansa Stark in <em>Game of Thrones</em> and Jean Grey in<em> X-Men: Dark Phoenix</em>, is the new Lara Croft for the streaming <a href="https://kotaku.com/tomb-raider-lara-croft-amazon-sophie-turner-2000623124">adaptation of <em>Tomb Raider</em></a>. Amazon MGM Studios revealed a first look at the actor in costume and, yup, I think she nailed it.</p> <p>Does that mean the show itself will be any good? Who knows. But it should help limit any skepticism about whether Turner is cut out to take over the English archeologist who moonlights as a puzzle-solving treasure hunter. The role was previously played by Angelina Jolie in the early 2000s and later by Alicia Vikander in the 2018 reboot. Here’s the first photo of Turner in costume, which essentially recreates Croft’s look from the 1996 game beat-for-beat:</p>   <p>The show has already started filming but we still don’t know what the live-action adaptation, helmed by <em>Fleabag</em>‘s Phoebe Waller-Bridge, will entail. Jason Isaacs will play Croft’s Uncle, Atlas DeMornay, while Martin Bobb-Semple plays Croft’s side-kick, Zip. Bill Paterson, meanwhile, will play her butler. Celina Imrie is also onboard as a museum curator while Sigourney Weaver plays someone “keen to exploit Lara’s talents,” according to Amazon.</p>

 <p>There’s no release date for the show yet, but given the production schedule I wouldn’t be surprised to see it pop up sometime in 2027. It follows Amazon’s success in spinning another hit game franchise, <em>Fallout</em>, into a streaming hit, and is part of Hollywood’s broader goldrush to exploit gaming IP instead of creating new ideas. It couldn’t be coming at a better time for the franchise, though.</p>

 <p>A reboot of the 1996 game called <a href="https://kotaku.com/heres-our-first-look-at-tomb-raiders-new-lara-croft-2000652781"><em>Tomb Raider Atlantis</em></a> will launch later this year, followed by the next sequel sometime in the years ahead. That game has been in production for a while. The last new entry was <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em> back in 2018.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dji-offloads-mini-5-pro-drone-bundles-now-at-a-record-low-with-rc2-controller-and-three-batteries-2000659926</link>
            <guid>1406917</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’ve been thinking about adding aerial shots to your creative toolkit, the DJI Mini 5 Pro Fly More Combo makes a compelling case for taking the leap. Designed to balance performance with portability and ease of use, this drone <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6316/">bundle is currently available for $1,099 (down from $1,599) which is a sizable 31% reduction from its usual price</a>. That discount alone makes it eye-catching, but the real value lies in how complete the package is for anyone eager to start flying immediately.</p>
<p>Inside the box, you’ll find multiple intelligent flight batteries, a dedicated RC2 controller, a charging hub, and a travel-friendly carrying bag. Whether you’re heading out for a weekend hike or planning a more deliberate filming session, everything you need comes along without added hassle.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6316/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Drone for Every Skill Level</h2>
<p>The DJI Mini 5 Pro’s capability comes from its compact, lightweight body. It’s small enough to toss into a backpack, yet powerful enough to record sharp 4K HDR video at up to 60 frames per second. The camera’s Dual Native ISO helps maintain image quality across a wide range of lighting situations, so footage stays clean and detailed whether you’re filming under bright midday sun or chasing golden-hour shots.</p>
<p>Performance in the air is equally impressive. A long-range video transmission system delivers a smooth HD feed over great distances, while strong wind resistance and a 3-axis mechanical gimbal help ensure stable, shake-free footage. Even when conditions aren’t perfect, the drone remains reliable and controlled.</p>



<p>The included DJI RC2 controller adds to the seamless experience: Its <strong>built-in 5.5-inch HD screen</strong> provides a clear, responsive view of your live feed, removing the need to rely on a smartphone. This makes flying more intuitive and lets you focus on framing the perfect shot rather than juggling devices.</p>
<p>Content creators will also appreciate the drone’s flexibility when it comes to framing. With support for both landscape and vertical shooting, it’s easy to tailor footage for different platforms. From cinematic YouTube videos to vertical clips optimized for Instagram Reels or TikTok, the DJI Mini 5 Pro drone can adapt to how and where you want to share your work.</p>
<p>Extended flight time is another major advantage. With three batteries included, you can spend hours in the air across multiple flights, rather than cutting sessions short. When it’s time to recharge, the two-way charging hub keeps downtime to a minimum.</p>
<p>Add in generous internal storage and fast wireless transfers to your phone, and the DJI Mini 5 Pro Fly More Combo becomes an all-in-one solution for aerial photography. At its current discounted price, it’s a smart investment for beginners and a capable upgrade for experienced pilots.</p>

<p>Prime Video has uncovered our first look at Sophie Turner as Lara Croft, ready and in costume for the upcoming live-action adaptation, the first since 2018’s reboot starring Alicia Vikander.</p>



<p>Fan feedback has been mixed so far, with the Tomb Raider community divided on whether they approve of the casting or not. The team at Prime Video has opted for a classic reimagination of the traditional Lara Croft from the original games, but not everyone is happy.</p>







<h2 id="h-sophie-turner-s-lara-croft-is-dividing-fans">Sophie Turner’s Lara Croft is Dividing Fans</h2>



<p>It was just a few days ago that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amazons-tomb-raider-announces-multiple-castings/">Prime Video uncovered</a> an array of castings for the upcoming live-action Tomb Raider <strong>series</strong>. It has been several months since Sophie Turner was confirmed as playing the iconic lead, but others have since moved into the frame, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Sigourney Weaver</li>



<li>Jason Isaacs</li>



<li>Martin Bobb-Semple</li>



<li>Jack Bannon</li>



<li>John Heffernan</li>



<li>Bill Paterson</li>



<li>Paterson Joseph</li>



<li>Sasha Luss</li>



<li>Juliette Motamed</li>



<li>Celia Imrie</li>



<li>August Wittgenstein</li>
</ul>



<p>The more recognizable characters among the roster are the likes of Zip, Atlas, and Winston, all of whom have previously appeared in the decades-old series.</p>



<p>Sophie Turner, who will assume the role of Lara Croft, recently underwent a wardrobe test, appearing in a shot posted on social media earlier today by Prime Video. While the outfit is very much on point, fans aren’t entirely sure if she fits the <strong>look</strong>. In recent months, Turner revealed a physical regime designed to get her in shape to play the adventurous archeologist, but that’s not enough for some.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>In the comments under the post, one user wrote, ‘It’s difficult seeing anyone in this role besides Angelina Jolie.’ Another wrote, ‘I don’t see Lara anywhere. Sorry.’</p>



<p>The feedback is mixed but leaning in favor of the general acceptance of Turner’s portrayal.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag is many fans’ favorite in the series. The seamless blend of traditional AC gameplay and movement was woven beautifully with pillaging and pirate pilates. There have been endless talks about an Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake for an eternity, so here’s the latest on the rumored title.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-black-flags-steam-page-adds-new-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Black Flag</a> is a special game, and anyone who’s played it can sense this very quickly. You could argue that no other game has perfectly captured the feeling of being an exploring and exterminating pirate assassin. Nostalgia is kicking in even while writing about this—might need a lie down and a pint of grog to comfort the soul.</p>



<p>Before that, here’s a look at Black Flag Remake rumors and leaks.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-assassin-s-creed-black-flag-getting-a-remake">Is Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Getting A Remake?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It should be a whale of a time. Credit to Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Insider Gaming can confirm that an Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake is happening, and you can start preparing yourself for its inevitable launch.</strong></p>



<p>If you haven’t been following Insider Gaming’s coverage, you have missed out on a wild adventure so far. The first confirmation that an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-flag-remake-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake was in development</a> started in January 2024. A Tom Henderson exclusive then pulled back the curtain on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-further-details-on-the-assassins-creed-roadmap-and-what-games-to-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Roadmap, and what games to expect</a> over the next few years.</p>



<p>It revealed that the Black Flag Remake was happening. These suspicions grew stronger after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-flag-remake-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft reuploaded Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Soundtracks</a> in January 2026, </p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-assassin-s-creed-black-flag-remake-coming-out">When Is Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake Coming Out?</h2>



<p><strong>Insider Gaming exclusively confirmed that the Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake is coming out before March 31, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>Given that it’s January 2026, you should start getting excited, if you aren’t already! The exclusive story said <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-black-flag-remake-set-to-launch-before-march/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake is set to launch before March 31</a>.</p>



<p>Additionally, the <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/33qBiRpCj1Z9Ib5bbfbg5r/d4ab539ca9edd1fa28ebc0aec5b1af27/Ubisoft_H1_FY26_Slideshow_vFinal.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ubisoft H1 FY26 EARNINGS</a> from November 21, 2025, mentioned several games for 2026, with one game listed as an “Unannounced Title.” This is expected to be the Black Flag Remake.</p>



<p>There’s still no exact launch date, but it’s getting closer than a pirate is to water after reaching the end of the plank.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-assassin-s-creed-black-flag-resynced">What Is Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Resynced?</h2>



<p><strong>Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Resynced is reportedly the new title for the Black Flag Remake.</strong></p>



<p>Everyone has been referring to a reimagining of the fourth mainline game as the ‘Black Flag Remake’ for a while. Ubisoft has seemingly mooted this with the appearance of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-appears/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Resynced on the PEGI Ratings site</a>.</p>



<p>As long as it keeps ‘Assassin’s Creed Black Flag’ in the name, it could add ‘Reimagined Pirate Paradise’ on the end, and everyone would still buy it!</p>



<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-black-flag-remake-rumors-amp-leaks">Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake Rumors &amp; Leaks</h2>



<p><strong>Some of the biggest Black Flag leaks and rumors include suggestions that the game will be more RPG-Heavy than its original incarnation.</strong></p>



<p>Surprisingly, we haven’t heard too many inner details about the actual gameplay, more its release window. Leaks have indicated that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-new-details-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Remake is more RPG-Heavy</a>: “Similar to Origins and Shadows.”</p>



<p>Resynced will allegedly also get rid of the modern-day aspects that many dislike about Assassin’s Creed.</p>

                <p>This year marks the 15th anniversary of Re-Logic's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/terraria/" data-ref-id="5000-105503">Terraria</a>, and the developer is still making new content for the game after all of this time. For months, Re-Logic has teased the release of the next update, Terraria 1.4.5. Now, the release date is set for later this month.</p><p>On <a href="https://forums.terraria.org/index.php?threads/terraria-1-4-5-the-launch-date-revealed-at-last.145833/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the official site</a> for Terraria, Re-Logic announced that Terraria 1.4.5 will launch on January 27. The studio noted that the latest delay was caused because it needed to, "resubmit a few things, which pushed us back a bit further than expected."</p><p>Re-Logic hasn't shared a full list of the new features or improvements coming with the latest update, but it has teased a few during the game's monthly news updates. As an example, villagers will no longer need a house in order to show up in the game. However, they will ask the player to build them a house if there isn't one already.</p><p>One of the most intriguing additions to Terraria 1.4.5 is the RC Car, which was inspired by the Kwad Racer Drone. With the car, players can race around Terraria worlds and climb up backwalls. The racetracks will be customizable, and Re-Logic has invited players to "share them with us when the time comes."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1837/18375603/4635633-terraria.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4635633" data-ratio="0.56230769230769" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1837/18375603/4635633-terraria.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4635633"></a><figcaption>Promo art for Terraria.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1837/18375603/4635633-terraria.jpg"></figure><p>Last summer, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/terraria-is-invades-palworld-later-this-month/1100-6532584/" data-ref-id="1100-6532584">a collaboration with Palworld</a> brought Terraria content into that game. Terraria 1.4.5 will return the favor by adding Palworld content to Terraria. The only confirmed Pal at the moment is Digtoise, who can help players when mining. However, there will be other Pals coming.</p><p>Re-Logic has also noted that nearly 900 bugs will be fixed with Terraria 1.4.5, as well as the "countless little things ... that go into each update." More details will follow later this month when the update arrives on January 27.</p>
