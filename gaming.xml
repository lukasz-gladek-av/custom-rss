            <p>
You know, with there being so many games set in ancient Rome, most of them being strategy games, I'm not sure I've ever seen a pixel art game with that setting. I bring this up because <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/romestead">Romestead</a>, a pixel art game with that exact setting, just got announced at the Future Games Show. From the offset it looks a little bit <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a>, a little bit <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/terraria">Terraria</a>, and according to the publisher behind it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/three-friends">Three Friends</a> themselves, the latter is in fact a source of inspiration, alongside SNES classic The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Described as a survival town-builder, Romestead lets you rebuild civilisation from ruin as a Roman leader (which as a concept considering publisher Three Friends is made up of former <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/valheim">Valheim</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/minecraft">Minecraft</a> devs). That involves things like putting your people to work by farming crops, smithing weapons, rounding up resources, all things you appear to be able to do yourself too, so I imagine you can't be tyrant right from the get go, as was typical of many Romans back in the day.
</p>
<p>
There's a worship system where you can pray to a bunch of Roman gods to unlock various buildings, upgrades, technologies, all of which I find amusing very conceptually. "You have prayed enough to me so I give you the gift of a slightly bigger house" is how I imagine to play out, which tickles me in a "aren't video games so quaint?" kind of way.
</p>
<p>
That Zelda element comes in through dungeons that you can explore and bosses you can face off against, and a big ole world to explore too. And to boot you don't have to do it alone as there's multiplayer co-op too.
</p>
<p>
Romestead doesn't currently have a release date, but it is planned for an early access release. If this all takes your fancy, then you can wishlist the game on Steam right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1805320">here</a>.

Blending historical figures and supernatural folklore in feudal Japan, the story follows a new hero, master swordsman Jubei Yagyu, who sets out on a quest to defeat Nobunaga Oda and his army of demons. As players engage in intense swordplay, they must also make choices that impact the narrative in unexpected ways.</p><p><em>Onimusha 2: Samurai’s Destiny</em> also features a range of new game mechanics, including an affinity system with Jubei’s allies and branching narrative paths along with new quality-of-life features such as the ability to swap weapons without pausing the action and the power to choose when Jubei transforms into an Onimusha. Modern improvements like auto-saves, skippable cutscenes, multiple aspect ratios, and more are included, along with an in-game gallery expansion with 100 newly added pieces of artwork and the original soundtrack.</p><p>Additionally, Capcom revealed a special bonus for players who pre-order <em>Onimusha 2: Samurai’s Destiny</em> or pick up the “<em>Onimusha 1</em>+<em>2</em> Pack” bundle early, which will include the “<em>Onimusha 2</em>: Orchestra Album Selection Pack,” featuring orchestral music tracks and helpful in-game items. Players with save data from the 2019 remaster of <em>Onimusha: Warlords</em> can also unlock a special outfit for Jubei inspired by Samanosuke, the protagonist from the original game.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

Today, during the Future Games Show, the Polish studio not only announced a new development studio in Broken Mirror Games, but also the label's first project: I Hate This Place, an adaptation of the popular comic series via a partnership with Skybound Entertainment.</p><p dir="ltr">I Hate This Place is an isometric survival-horror game that puts players into the role of Elena, who finds herself dealing with a supernatural evil she mistakenly unleashed into the world. Elena will fight her way through hordes of monsters with both melee weapons and firearms, while also crafting important supplies in her bid to reach each safehouse before nightfall.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4462412-ihtp_screen3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4462412" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4462412-ihtp_screen3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4462412"></a><figcaption>I Hate This Place</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4462412-ihtp_screen3.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4462413-ihtp_screen1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4462414-ihtp_screen2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4462415-ihtp_screen3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4462416-ihtp_screen4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4462418-ihtp_screen5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4462413,1300-4462414,1300-4462415,1300-4462416,1300-4462418" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4462413-ihtp_screen1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4462414-ihtp_screen2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4462415-ihtp_screen3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4462416-ihtp_screen4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4462418-ihtp_screen5.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4462413-ihtp_screen1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4462414-ihtp_screen2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4462415-ihtp_screen3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4462416-ihtp_screen4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4462418-ihtp_screen5.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">A brief teaser trailer shows off the adaptation's visual style, which will use a retro comic-book theme similar to its source material. We also see a few of the giant monsters Elena will face off against, as well as a brief tease of the Horned Man at the center of it all.</p><p dir="ltr">The original comic version of I Hate This Place, written by Kyle Starks and drawn by Artyom Topilin, launched in May 2022 through Image Comics and Skybound Entertainment. The series saw 10 issues released between May 2022 and July 2023, with two hardcover collections releasing later in 2023.</p><p dir="ltr">I Hate This Place is set to launch later this year for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</p>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/33-immortals/" data-ref-id="5000-590941">33 Immortals</a> couldn't be further from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/spiritfarer/" data-ref-id="5000-497656">Spiritfarer</a> if it tried. Developer Thunder Lotus made an impression with its cozy and, at times, tear-jerking management and platforming mash-up, but is trading its glistening seas and carefree exploration for a far more dangerous expedition. 33 Immortals is all about action, thrusting you and over 30 others other players into chaotic PvE skirmishes and even greater challenges as you attempt to ascend through the different floors of the underworld and wage a rebellion against the forces that keep you there.</p><p dir="ltr">33 Immortals attempts to distill the rush of an MMO raid into smaller, run-based encounters that you can participate in with up to 32 other players. Each run starts on a relatively large map that revolves around PvE encounters. You're encouraged to quickly link up with other players in order to survive, while also empowering yourself by killing enemies and collecting resources for upgrades. Dotted around the map are 12 Torture Chambers, which are your initial objectives to tackle. These combat arenas only allow six players in at a time but through two intense waves of enemies at you in a confined space. Clearing these rooms offer rewards, but also work towards the greater goal of unlocking an ascension challenge. The stakes shift here, with a more involved combat encounter waiting for a larger group of 11 players. Those remaining outside can use the time to continue getting stronger before attempting the challenge too, with the final, climatic boss fight waiting once everyone still alive manages to succeed.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4462537-01_screenshot_33-players-5574056faa05b22c011e.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4462537" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4462537-01_screenshot_33-players-5574056faa05b22c011e.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4462537"></a><figcaption>As its name implies, 33 Immortals sees you teaming up with 32 other players.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4462537-01_screenshot_33-players-5574056faa05b22c011e.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The structure that each run follows offers an easy to understand process that you need to follow to ultimately succeed, stripping out a lot of the guesswork usually associated with raid-like activities in games like Destiny and World of Warcraft. This not only allows runs to be significantly shorter, but also means you can easily hop in and out of sessions without having to commit potentially a few hours at a time to make progress. This streamlining is exactly what 33 Immortals is aiming to achieve, but right now it comes with the caveat of reducing your focus solely down to its combat, which doesn't yet exude a level of depth that suggests it'll be enough to carry run after run.</p><p dir="ltr">It's easy to feel weak when setting out on your first few runs in 33 Immortals, but this feels by design. Cooperative play isn't optional: It's required. Attempting to traverse the PvE areas alone won't get you far, as even small groups of enemies present significant challenges to your survivability. Your combat abilities also rely on synergizing without other player classes, each of which is determined by the weapon you select before each run. At this stage, there are four weapons available: a greatsword that can deal and block a lot of damage, a bow that lets you fire and recall projectiles through enemies, a magical staff that prioritizes slowing enemies down, and a pair of daggers that let you quickly cut down foes. Each weapon also has an associated ultimate ability that requires two other players to trigger when cast, further establishing teamwork as the only means of utilizing your full skill set.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4462538-03_screenshot_dante-b1ede2ecc33e03a03c29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4462538" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4462538-03_screenshot_dante-b1ede2ecc33e03a03c29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4462538"></a><figcaption>You can unlock perks to cultivate your experience.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4462538-03_screenshot_dante-b1ede2ecc33e03a03c29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">No singular weapon makes you feel like you can tackle every enemy you encounter, but the ways in which they determine loose class-based play is lost in the chaos of the frantic and fast action. It's difficult to parse what other players are doing at times, especially in Torture Chambers where space is extremely limited. This diminishes the ability to effectively work off the strengths and weapon choices of other characters, which might only become more of an issue as additional aspects of each weapon are unlocked. That's coupled with movement that can feel sluggish at times, and a dash with a range that is too limited and a cooldown that is far too long to make use of when you really need it.</p><p dir="ltr">There's a roguelite element to each run, too, in that various buffs and gear will disappear once you return to your camp after death. Altars around the world let you trade in resources you collect from killing enemies for boosts to health, damage, and more. You can also collect gear of various rarities, each with their own abilities, that you similarly lose at the end of a run. Permanent upgrades are acquired through completing feats: challenges that are collected into groups assigned to different weapon types, specific world interactions, and basic actions that you'll likely complete without giving much thought. The list of feats is extensive, with each category featuring a subset of six other categories, each with three or more challenges to complete. 33 Immortals makes it clear that progress is intrinsically tied to completing feats, which unlock permanent buffs to your health, damage, and weapon abilities. It's easy to feel overwhelmed by the sheer number of them, however, and it's slightly disheartening that a weapon's feats only unlock after you've completed a run with it, negating any progress you might have initially made.</p><p dir="ltr">It is, however, difficult to make a firm judgment on an experience that is clearly designed to keep you engaged for a long time, as you slowly improve your abilities and weapons in order to more easily make your way through each level and its associated bosses. The content on offer is also limited, with the first two of three stages unlocked, and most tutorials missing still. There's a strong sense that Thunder Lotus has established this base experience to really test its approach to condensing a raid experience, and will hopefully be making bold and sweeping changes to the elements that don't work. The limited time ahead of the game's early-access launch just gave me a sense of the ideas 33 Immortals is attempting, and it left me wanting to explore it more. But it also made clear that there's already work to be done to make each run a more engaging experience.</p>

The talk, like the game, included a massive amount of content that explored unique stories in the game and how they were implemented.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Narrative director Cat Manning opened the talk by breaking down how </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Civilization VII</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s overall narrative system—consisting of design elements like storylets and narrative tags—let writers tell stories across ages in any given playthrough. The system was so powerful and large that, once launched, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Civilization VII</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> included 1,262 narrative events.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="A powerful narrative system">A powerful narrative system</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We wanted enough events so that players would get a pretty good number," Manning said. "We also wanted those events to be relevant to the player's game state."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those narrative events relied on how well </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Civilization VII</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> would track player actions, remembering the choices they made, the natural disasters their civilizations went through, the units that passed away, and many other elements that this narrative system considered important. Every writer on the Firaxis team could add narrative tags to certain events, those tags could then trigger events that would lead to other events and so on.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/consume-me-wins-grand-prize-nuovo-award-at-the-2025-igf-awards" target="_self" data-discover="true">'Consume Me' Wins Grand Prize, Nuovo Award at the 2025 IGF Awards</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That system allowed Firaxis storytellers to engage players with fascinating stories that came from throughout history, including fascinating chapters like the The Great Republic of Rough and Ready, a California city that voted to secede from the United States during the gold rush and a fictitious character in Roman history that Firaxis called "the first wife guy."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The first wife guy is a narrative event in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Civilization VII</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that involved a man erecting a commemorative stone in honor of his wife, who managed the man's affairs while he was in exile. The monument was "a flashpoint in the discussion on civic virtue," as read in the description found in-game. The player could then choose to "repossess the exile's property, move the stone to an honored place, or even teach the inscription found on the stone as rhetoric" to their people.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Civilization's VII</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s narrative system allowed this story to live on much longer, if the player chose to engage with it. Changes to the series archaeology system often led to players digging up artifacts that were sourced from events that took place earlier in their playthrough.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/-balatro-plays-winning-hand-at-gdca-2025-receiving-game-of-the-year" target="_self" data-discover="true">'Balatro' Plays Winning Hand at GDCA 2025, Receiving Game of the Year</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Digging up the past">Digging up the past</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Players who interact with "the first wife guy" narrative event may use the game's archaeology system to dig up a great slab of rock, described as a "funerary monument to a long-dead woman." It's the same monument that was established many years before by the wife guy.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Archaeology is storytelling, not a cold [retelling] but a perspective on a sequence of carefully chosen events," said narrative designer Nell Raban. "When we use the narrative system to procreate a story with the player in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Civ 7</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, we're building that history layer by layer. With archaeology, we're able to excavate that history."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Civilization has always had a humorous relationship with history—as players often shared screenshots of Mahatma Gandhi threatening the player's Civilization with war. Narrative designers and historians working on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Civilization VII</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> wanted more from the game's relationship with world history this time around. It obviously would never be anything close to accurate the majority of the time, but could provide an alternative history that still had bits of truth in it.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/the-bleak-humor-and-desperate-power-of-consume-me" target="_self" data-discover="true">The bleak humor and desperate power of Consume Me</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"When we say fiction, the word comes from a meaning of being fabricated,"&nbsp; said senior historian Andrew Johnson. "Here I want to think about fiction as not necessarily something that's not true, but as stories that fill in the gaps between images and snapshots and data points. They are what we in our everyday lives use to give meaning to the way that the world works."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Stopping to remember">Stopping to remember</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Gameplay in Civilization doesn't seek to replicate the progression of history, instead it wants to reference it as a possibility, according to Johnson. Players are often given the power to explore histories that could never exist, like Abraham Lincoln fighting against the Roman Empire in previous games. It also pushes players to fill in the gaps of their civilization's history through the small narrative events they experience.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But as Civilization games span the entirety of human history, it's important to stop and remember the stories of individual towns, relationships, and people. That's why Firaxis worked so hard to create narrative moments like that of the first wife guy.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Clearly, this guy's love for his wife endures, and so does history if we care enough to preserve it," Raban said. "When you span all of human history, you need those moments when you stop to remember."</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/633481/netflix-gaming-strategy-alain-tascan-interview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Netflix’s gaming strategy to date has been scattershot. Since Netflix gaming debuted in 2021, the streamer has launched <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/8/23340894/netflix-lucky-luna-platform-game-iphone-android">indie darlings</a>, streaming tie-ins, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/19/24249136/netflix-civilization-6-street-fighter-4-game-releases">blockbuster ports</a>. There have been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22699241/netflix-night-school-acquisition-oxenfree">studio acquisitions</a>, attempts at original AAA games, and experiments with cloud streaming. A few years on, it’s not entirely clear what the strategy is — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/8/23296545/netflix-games-1-percent-subscribers">or if it’s really working</a>.</p><p>So when Alain Tascan, former executive VP of game development at <em>Fortnite</em> maker Epic Games, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/23/24204447/netflix-president-of-games-alain-tascan">joined as Netflix’s new president of games last year</a>, his assessment was to “readjust and focus on fewer areas with more intention.” As he explains it: “we need to find our voice.”</p><p>According to Tascan, that means focusing on games that fit into one of four categories. These include narrative games, like its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24171526/netflix-games-too-hot-too-handle-interactive-fiction">interactive fiction titles tied to Netflix reality shows</a>, along with multiplayer party games and games aimed at kids. Rounding out the quartet is what Netflix calls “mainstream” releases, which basically means anything with the potential for a huge audience. That could be a licensed tie-in like last year’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/20/24325810/squid-game-unleashed-netflix-mobile-game"><em>Squid Game: Unleashed</em></a> or original games like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/632526/spirit-crossing-netflix-games-mmo-spry-fox">just-announced <em>Spirit Crossing</em></a>, an ambitious MMO that looks like a cross between a Studio Ghibli film and a larger-scale <em>Animal Crossing</em>.</p><p>Tascan likens this strategy to the early days of Netflix’s original programming. It started with a few series, like <em>House of Cards</em> and <em>Orange Is the New Black</em>, and now Netflix produces a huge range of shows, movies, and live programming. For games, the idea is to focus on titles that fit into the four (admittedly broad) categories and then, eventually, expand from there. “We’re starting with those,” he says. “Down the road we might add more if it makes sense, but I think starting first from these four is already a lot.”</p><p>This also means scaling back in some areas. Last year, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/22/24276700/netflix-gaming-studio-closure-blue">Netflix shut down an internal studio focused on AAA titles</a>, helmed by industry veterans from franchises like <em>Halo</em> and <em>God of War</em>, before it even released a game. And while Netflix has become a notable publisher of indie games on mobile, it sounds like that, too, will become a smaller part of the overall plan. “We will continue supporting some of them, but I feel that indie gamers are not really coming to Netflix to find indie games,” Tascan says. Everything has to fit with the overall strategy. “If a game that has been created independently fits one of those categories nicely, we’ll probably go after it,” he says.</p><p>The eventual goal is to become, well, the Netflix of games — a sort of one-stop shop where it’s fast and easy to find something new to play. Part of achieving that is having a broad range of games meant to appeal to Netflix’s existing audience and potential new subscribers. But just as important, according to Tascan, is reducing the friction to playing games. Unlike a Netflix show, which simply involves pressing play, getting into a game involves more steps, like finding it in an app store and downloading it.</p><p>While that’s the case right now, Tascan wants the service’s gaming efforts to eventually be playable “instantaneously” and to make them platform agnostic, meaning you can play them on any device. Right now, due to a combination of technical hurdles and app store restrictions, the process isn’t exactly smooth. “Being accessible instantaneously on any screen is the ultimate goal,” he says. “I’m coming from a world where I’ve seen success by taking walls down. <em>Fortnite</em> was one of the first games to really do cross-play, and I feel that was one of the big reasons for its success.”</p><p>He believes this future will happen within the next five years, citing various converging elements like streaming technology improving and becoming cheaper; an audience that now expects experiences to carry over between devices thanks to games like <em>Fortnite</em>; and Netflix’s growing global audience. “We’re getting really close,” Tascan says. “It’s all evolving in the same direction.”</p><p>As a first step, the streamer will be launching its first TV-focused games by the end of this year. Currently, all Netflix games are mobile titles. But these new, unannounced games will be playable via a smart TV and controlled via a smartphone, removing the need for game controllers — another point of friction.</p><p>Perhaps even more ambitious, Tascan believes that one or several of these unknown games have the potential to have a similar impact to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report">Travis Scott concert in <em>Fortnite</em></a>, a moment that took players by surprise and permeated pop culture in a way that games rarely do. “I hope that some of the offerings we have at the end of the year will create this type of moment,” he says.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In a <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/games/articles/2025/03/gdc-2025-opening-a-billion-doors-with-xbox/">blog post</a> about Xbox “opening a billion doors,” Microsoft briefly revealed a new Xbox UI that looks a lot more console-like across multiple devices and even appears to list Steam games.</p><p>After briefly posting an image of a new Xbox UI across multiple devices, Microsoft quickly removed it once <em>The Verge</em> inquired about it. The image has a new Xbox UI that can be seen on a TV, where you can clearly see the Steam label listed. The same UI, with the Steam mention, is also shown on the tablet and handheld versions.</p><p>While the image appears to be a mockup, with owned games listed twice as well as action-adventure titles, I don’t think the Steam label here is necessarily a mistake. Sources familiar with Microsoft’s plans tell me that the company is currently working on an Xbox app update that will show every game you have installed on your PC. That includes games from Steam and the Epic Games Store, and I understand Microsoft will label these games accordingly.</p><p>I’m told Microsoft is still in the early stages of this Xbox app update, so the company might never ship the feature to list all your Steam games, but this mocked up image shows how they might show up eventually. Xbox chief Phil Spencer has also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/26/24112591/microsofts-gaming-chief-hints-that-xbox-could-get-pc-stores-one-day">previously hinted</a> that PC stores like Epic Games Store and Itch.io could one day arrive on Xbox consoles.</p><p>Microsoft has also been working on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/11/24318799/microsoft-xbox-app-new-games-homescreen">making the Xbox app the home of PC gaming</a>, and listing Steam games in this app would certainly help. GOG has a similar system in place, so you can see games you own on PC across multiple launchers.</p><p>I asked Microsoft to comment on the appearance of this Xbox app UI, but the company didn’t respond in time for publication.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This is similar to the Game Pass option, as its part of the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/play/gallery/buy-and-stream" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"stream your own game"</a> perk for Ultimate subscribers.</p><p>If you're new to GeForce Now, the appeal of this service--and cloud gaming platforms in general--is that you can play new games without needing powerful, expensive local hardware.

The free tier has one-hour session lengths; the $10/month tier has a six-hour session limit; and the $20/month package has an eight-hour limit.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-seasons-change-nature-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure><figcaption><span><p>The hills are perfect in Assassin’s Creed Shadows. Credit: Ubisoft.</p>
</span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>Honestly, I wasn’t particularly excited to play <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>. Part of this had to do with the <a href="https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-yasuke-racism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">year-long racist smear campaign directed against it</a> by deeply cynical people that is simply hard to put out of mind. The larger factor, however, was general series fatigue: It’s Assassin’s Creed,<em> </em>and I’ve played more than a dozen of those at this point. I have now devoted more than 15 hours to the newest entry, and I’m pleased to report that it is the most fun I have had with one of these games in years, in part because it just gets nature right.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Streams often are clear paths in otherwise dense areas.</figcaption></figure><p>Before I start complimenting <em>AC Shadows,</em> it’s worth noting that it takes its sweet time to get off the ground – <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/47-hours-with-the-astounding-assassins" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">former bossman Stephen Totillo noted as much in his review of the game</a>. The first hours are highly tutorialized and serve to set up the stories of both Naoe and Yasuke, the latter of which takes far longer than you’d expect to actually kick into effect. I have taken my time with the story and he has not shown up again. However, once you are free to explore and get a feel for Sengoku-era Japan, the sheer care and attention to detail is startling.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>I would like some tea.</figcaption></figure><p>That immense care has been taken to accurately depict any era is not shocking for this series: At its best Assassin’s Creed is a big-budget fantastical history simulator. What’s more, depictions of Japanese culture from western developers, <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> excluded, have historically not been thorough. <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> excels here. Though vaguely fantastical, I have never had a game that nails Japan, at least in a rural setting, quite like it. From Bunraku puppet shows on the street to Biwa players to the countless beautiful shrines, there is a density and care here that is rarely seen in games. The setting and story of warring states Japan is so immediately conducive to an Assassin’s Creed game that it is shocking that they did not attempt it before, although I am glad they took their time to do it.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Wooded paths in Assassin's Creed Shadows feel appropriately claustrophobic without being artificially walled in. </figcaption></figure><p>But aside from the overall worldbuilding, <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> gets something right about Japan that other games simply don’t: It’s hilly as fuck, and the brush can be thick. In <em>Shadows </em>nature is, for lack of a better word, dense. This is not just a problem that games set in Japan have; it’s a problem that open world games set in nature have on the whole. Forests do not feel like forests, they feel like video game forests.</p><figure><figcaption>Colors pop when the seasons change. Credit: Ubisoft</figcaption></figure><p>“Video games are normally either ‘this is lightly wooded, you can go here’ or ‘This is a dense forest, this is impassable,’” fellow Aftermath writer Luke Plunkett summed up aptly in chat. “<em>Shadows </em>is one of the only games I have ever played where it says ‘this is a dense forest, you can try and get through here, but not on your horse, and you're gonna have a bad time.’”&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>I have rarely felt woods that feel difficult to traverse in the way that woulds should. Credit: Ubisoft.</figcaption></figure><p>In addition to just getting hills and shrubs right, <em>Shadows</em> does weather right, particularly bad weather. Outside of driving simulators I have never seen an open world game so accurately nail the feeling of a sunny day getting tremendously shitty in a matter of minutes: wind that sounds like it’s going to knock you sideways, blizzards that come on suddenly, and rain storms that make you want to stay indoors. On top of this, <em>Shadows </em>has a seasonal weather system akin to my favorite Forza game, <em>Forza Horizon 4</em>. These shifts in the weather have meaningful consequences, as I was quick to find out when I tried to infiltrate a castle and found that the moat had frozen. Add on beautifully simulated wildlife that you do not need to hunt or kill, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/zackzwiezen.com/post/3lko7qwys4s2p" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as Zack Zwizen pointed out</a>, and the natural world starts to sing.</p><figure></figure><p>As much as I respect <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>, at no point when I played it did the world ever feel like Japan to me. The elevation was incorrect, and the rendering was so cartoonishly saturated and alien that I may as well have been playing a game set in Narnia. I think there is validity and even beauty to creating something impressionistic like that, and this is not an impulse that <em>Shadows </em>fully shies away from. But what <em>Shadows </em>is doing with environmental design is more interesting to me, and more complicated than sheer fidelity. There is a power and a beauty to just making a forest feel like a forest and a hill feel like a hill.</p><figure><figcaption><span>The transition between bad and good weather is done wonderfully. </span></figcaption></figure></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/valnet-report-freelance"><h3>Report: Valnet Blacklisted Freelancers Who Complained About Pay Rates</h3></a><p>A new report from The Wrap highlights low pay and a list of blacklisted writers at the company</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/apple-cider-vinegar-common-side-effects"><h3>Is It The Right Time For Shows About Wellness Conspiracies?</h3></a><p>Recent shows Apple Cider Vinegar and Common Side Effects both debunk and amplify current conspiracies</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/two-point-museum-review-impressions"><h3>Two Point Museum: It’s Great</h3></a><p>No tombs were raided in the making of this video game</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warmachine-shadows-and-scum-review-sneaky-villainy<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><i>Warmachine</i>, a tabletop wargame that initially came to life to focus on balanced and competitive gameplay, has been around since 2003 under Privateer Press, until last year when Steamforged Games announced that they had <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/steamforged-games-acquires-warmachine-and-whole-iron-kingdom-ip-0" rel="nofollow">bought the IP</a>. <em>Warmachine</em> had recently moved into a new edition of the rules, and SFG has continued to run with that, kicking off a <a href="https://steamforged.com/en-gb/blogs/brands/iron-kingdoms-manifesto-part1?srsltid=AfmBOoqbPX8-yaogfTtpMsWSffAvNYYnSy0vGEqaKdAeX5njSJbqbpHm" rel="nofollow">roadmap</a> of new and exciting releases. These releases started with a brand new 2-player starter set which we reviewed <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warmachine-2-player-starter-set-review-metal-and-magic" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and in this article,&nbsp;we'll have a detailed look at a brand new starter set, <em>Warmachine</em> Shadows and Scum, featuring 2 very different factions from the first starter set.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warmachine-shadows-and-scum-2.jpg?itok=V369PE9E 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warmachine-shadows-and-scum-2.jpg?itok=Vqpo6Xbd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Metal and Magic</h2>

<p>Games of <em>Warmachine</em> begin with each player's selection of a Warcaster, a powerful mage that sets the tone for the rest of your army. While each faction has a distinct feel, the Warcaster you choose, each with a unique once-per-battle ability, can change how the force functions. Backing up the Warcaster are Warjacks, powerful metal constructs that pack a punch on the battlefield.&nbsp;Further supporting your Warcaster and Warjacks are Solos, individual warriors, and Units, groups of warriors, who flesh out the rest of your force</p>

<p>All of the rules and unit stats are available for free on the <a href="https://steamforged.com/en-gb/pages/warmachine-app" rel="nofollow"><em>Warmachine</em> app</a>, and we covered some of the cool mechanics in our <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warmachine-2-player-starter-set-review-metal-and-magic" rel="nofollow">2-Player Starter Set review</a>, so check that out if you want to know more about <em>Warmachine</em>.</p>

<p>Like the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warmachine-2-player-starter-set-review-metal-and-magic" rel="nofollow">Blood and Thunder</a> starter set before this, the Shadows and Scum box comes with 2 30-point forces, with a spread across unit types to give new players a look at how they play. This time though, the forces are led by Warlocks (rather than Warcasters) and contain a Warbeast (rather than Warjack). Warlocks/Warcasters and Warjacks/Warbeasts are different in name only and use fury rather than focus. This harks back to the days when Warmachine and Hordes were sold as different systems, sharing the same rules, but are now combined into just Warmachine. Both forces also have 2 solo units (rather than the single solo in Blood and Thunder), and all the miniatures are still Cadre for their respective factions,&nbsp;which means they can be used across all forces in the faction.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As before, this starter set only contains miniatures for the 2 forces; all the rules and unit cards are on the <em>Warmachine</em> app. If you want to use this set straight away, you'll also have to have some 6-sided dice, a measuring tool and some tokens. The box does make this clear, and this is similar to many other systems now, taking their rules almost entirely digital.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;Khymaera troops in Shadows and Scum are the&nbsp;Shard Nocturnes, elite and stealthy killers led by&nbsp;Vallyx, Fate’s Eclipse. Vallyx gives all friendly Shard Noctures the Flying High ability, which means that all attacks against them suffer -3 range, which reduces the range threat as they close the distance with their enemies. Vallyx's feat also makes all friendly hits within their control range Critical Hits, which means you can set up a pretty devastating round of combat. Vallyx is backed up by the warbeast Akylss, who can deploy a caustic mist to cover the Shard Nocturnes advance. Akylss has a corrosive ranged and melee attack, that gains an additional dice against construct and undead enemies.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warmachine-shadows-and-scum-5.jpg?itok=S1g5Axm2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warmachine-shadows-and-scum-5.jpg?itok=bkc-_nQh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The Shard Noctures in Shadows and Scum come with 2 solos, Pythia, who attaches to your factions' leader at the start of the game and allows them to channel spells through them, and also upkeep a spell for free if they're nearby, and Regulus, who along with being super stealthy, has a special action, that if they are within 8 inches of the enemy leader, they can move a nearby friendly unit 3 inches. The stealthy Shades are the Shard Nocture's unit, and they gain an additional dice on attacks and damage against character models. Along with a high threat range due to reposition and unpredictable movement abilities, they can strike straight for the enemy leader.</p>

<p>The Shard Nocturnes like to make fast, explosive plays for the enemy leader, with several of their units stealthily advancing with boosted attacks and threat ranges.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warmachine-shadows-and-scum-6.jpg?itok=_fpCitit 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warmachine-shadows-and-scum-6.jpg?itok=F0S0kTJd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Arrrrrrrr!</h2>

<p>Foulblood's Armada is the Southern Kriels army in the Shadows and Scum box, led by Commodore Foulblood himself. Foulbood has some great overlapping abilities with Battle Plan: Open Bar, which gives any friendly units Stumbling Drunk, which means they can't be knocked down, then as a Feat, Foulblood can use Happy Hour, which gives all units that are Stumbling Drunk, +3 armor for the turn. Foulblood's shoulder-mounted monkey also reduces enemy melee attacks by 2. Foulblood is backed up by the huge Chum, who has incredible healing with D3 wounds whenever they activate, and also D3 wounds if it boxes a living model and removes it from play. They also have critical consume rules on their Great Maw attack, which allows them to remove a small model from a critical hit.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warmachine-shadows-and-scum-7.jpg?itok=GG0g1f37 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warmachine-shadows-and-scum-7.jpg?itok=s5_SUEjh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Foulblood's Armarda are supported by 2 solos, Sully a flying albatross who drops explosives from the sky, with a fantastically thematic Albatross special rule that gives all enemies -1 to attack and damage rolls for the remainder of the turn when Sully is taken out, and Mr Bogs, who's adept at taking out enemy warbeasts, and who's massive rifle pushes both them away from their target, and their target directly away from them when hit. The 3 model unit, the Lochabash Brothers round out the force, who can charge into combat, and if grouped together can get up to +4 on damage rolls, then side step out of combat, and with snap fire, can fire twice if they take out an enemy with their first ranged attack.</p>

<p>Foulblood's Armada are pretty hard-hitting. Bunching up and smashing into enemies gives them boosts to attacks and defense, supported by Sully dropping fire from the skies, and Mr Bogs softening up the larger enemies.</p>

<h2>Warmachine Shadows and Scum Final Thoughts?</h2>

<p>Both of the 2 new Cadres in <em>Warmachine</em> Shadows and Scum offer interesting playstyles, very different from those in Blood and Thunder. The Shard Nocturnes like to stealthily work their way up, and make explosive and often devastating assassination attempts, whereas Foulblood's Armarda are solid in both ranged and melee attacks and like to smash into combat together, benefitting from overlapping buffs. Both factions are set up for new players, with 30-point forces with a variety of different units. The cadre rules also allow them to be used in any force of their faction beyond this box as well. While both forces have less straightforward playstyles than some, they're fairly easy to pilot, but there are still several rules to keep track of for new players.</p>

<p>As with Blood and Thunder, this set is just miniatures, as the rules and stats are all available for free on the <em>Warmachine</em> app and you will have to add a couple of accessories (dice, measuring tool, and tokens) to get playing, but once you have those, getting started with Shadows and Scum is easy.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/forteller-games-announces-sunset-ttrpg-about-confronting-and-processing-death<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A TTRPG studio has announced a new project. Forteller Games, a company mostly known for creating immersive audio material for games like Gloomhaven, has announced <em>Sunset</em>, a TTRPG tackling the heavy subject matter of death.</p>

<h2>The Sunset TTRPG Announcement</h2>

<p>According to a press release, <em>Sunset</em> is the first TTRPG being developed by Forteller Games. In <em>Sunset</em>, players, known in the game as Threads, are actively facing their deaths through a process called Life Review.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sunset-ttrpg-thread-artwork.jpg?itok=2Trb0qbZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sunset-ttrpg-thread-artwork.jpg?itok=xwsMpsXL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The Death Master guides these Threads through a series of pivotal memories of their life. If the Threads want to parlay with Death to get more time in life, they must unweave lies within these memories.</p>

<p>The game is a rules-lite experience utilizing the Deck of Many Dice. Each game is played in a series of memory locations called a Weave. This Weave is made collaboratively by the players and the Death Master. These Weaves can be anything from bustling cities to quiet meadows to anything in between.</p>

<p>Players draw cards from the deck to determine the outcome of their actions. Alternatively, actions can be resolved with a pool of D4s and D6s.</p>

<p>Despite the intense subject matter, <em>Sunset</em> is described as a hope-punk experience. It has explicit content warnings regarding death, violence, and the human psyche, but creators Michael Tomasek, Adam Lehenbauer, and Thomas St. Pierre state the intended feeling of the game is hope in the face of challenges and a counter to pessimism.</p>

<p>The design team also contains strong industry talent. The writing team includes Sebastian Yue (<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/pathfinder" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Pathfinder</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/brandon-sandersons-cosmere-rpg-kickstarter-raised-5-million-in-one-day" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Cosmere RPG</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-daggerheart-miniseries-announced-featuring-age-of-umbra-campaign-frame" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Daggerheart</em></a>), Kage Freudigmann, Omnis Strader (<em>Paragons: The Roleplaying Game</em>), and Alicia Marie (<em>Idle Champions of the Forgotten Realms</em>).</p>

<p>If you are curious about the tone and gameplay mechanics of <em>Sunset</em>, the Quickstart Rules are available on <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/499582/sunset-quickstart" rel="nofollow">DrivethruRPG</a> for free in PDF format. The game will be released sometime next year through a Kickstarter campaign.</p>

However, the ESA says the timeline for the implementation of the tags will be “determined on a company-by-company basis and is always voluntary.”</p><p>“The timeline for implementation of the tags is company-dependent,” Aubrey Quinn, ESA’s senior vice president for communications, tells <em>The Verge</em>. “While we cannot speak for them about their plans, we know companies are working with the relevant departments across their individual organizations to bring the tags to their consumers.”</p><p>The five founding members and Sony Interactive Entertainment “first developed” the initiative. When we asked why Sony isn’t a founding member, Quinn told us to reach out to Sony, which didn’t reply to a request for comment. Amazon Games, Riot Games, Square Enix, and Warner Bros. Games have joined the initiative, too.</p><p><em>The Verge</em> has asked all of the companies involved when they might implement the tags. Here’s what we’ve heard back.</p><div><ul><li><span><strong>Google</strong> spokesperson Zoe Ortiz declined to comment.</span></li><li><span><strong>Riot Games</strong>: “As part of the accessibility steering committee, we played an active role in defining these tags, and our accessibility team is building a plan to implement them,” says Enid Brown Nelson, director of product accessibility at Riot Games. “We want everyone to have the chance to play and enjoy our current and future games, so we’re always looking for ways to make them more welcoming—no matter who you are or how you play.”</span></li><li><span><strong>Ubisoft</strong>: “Ubisoft is actively planning the integration of these tags into its product pages and will have more to share soon,” says David Tisserand, accessibility director at Ubisoft.</span></li><li><span><strong>Xbox</strong>: “Team Xbox is working to implement Accessible Games Initiative tags across titles,” says Anna Waismeyer, senior gaming accessibility research lead at Microsoft. “Once ready, players will be able to find both Xbox Game Accessibility Feature Tags and Accessible Games Initiative tags digitally in a variety of Xbox experiences.”</span></li></ul></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/inzoi">InZOI</a> kind of looks like an exercise in pushing the uncanny valley to me, something I'd wholeheartedly respect if that were definitely the intention behind the game, but I have a hunch that it really is just meant to be <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a>, but if it looked like real life. Whether that's enough to win over Sims lovers or not, I'm not sure, its early access release isn't until next week so we'll all know more then. However! You do now have the opportunity to try and test the limits of its character creator, as like a few games have done in recent years, its Create a Zoi feature is available to download as its own thing… if you're happy to do a bit of homework.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
In order to get a code for the inZOI: Creative Studio, you'll need to watch someone play the game on Twitch, SOOP, Chzzk, or through a livestream on the official inZOI <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2456740/inZOI/">Steam page</a>. They all have <a href="https://playinzoi.com/en/news/8324">different requirements</a>, mind - on Twitch and Chzzk, you need to make sure you have your <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/krafton">Krafton</a> ID linked to whichever streaming service you're watching on, have inZOI in your Steam wishlist, and watch someone play the game for at least 15 minutes. Alternatively, you can just watch the stream on Steam for 30 minutes to get a key. 
</p>
<p>
I can't tell you how to watch it on SOOP because Krafton didn't explain how, and it's a Korean streaming service, and they don't seem to have posted what to do on their English socials, so honestly if you're desperate you should probably just watch someone on Twitch.
</p>
<p>
It's not just the Create a Zoi feature you'll have access too, as a Build Studio mode will be included too. This one lets you have a fiddle with building different rooms. It's not the full package, obviously, but seems like a good demo to check out if your greatest passion in The Sims is making Sims and building houses, but aren't sold on those features in inZOI just yet. Personally, the Zois scare me, so I'll leave it to you to try it out.

Stop. We’re going to put you in timeout for like a day. There’s no reason to be making comments like that.”</p><p>“I’m going to make this clear. If you’re just coming here to get into this weird fucking race shit about a historical figure that existed in Japanese history, I’m just gonna remove you. And guess what? That means you ain’t gonna be around for <em>Kazan</em>, or <em>Night Reign</em>, or <em>AI Limit</em>, or any of that shit. I don’t give a fuck what your opinion is of this game. I don’t care. Your opinion is worthless to me.

Here’s the rest of his viral rant:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>We’re not doing this shit. It’s a fucking video game. If you are upset that there’s a Black guy in a video game, fuck off. I don’t want you here. I don’t care. <em>Stop</em>. I’m not doing this fucking argument.</p><p>Every <em>goddamn </em>game these days. “Oh, it’s woke. Oh, there’s a Black guy. Oh, there’s a trans person.” Shut the fuck up. Either play the game or go the fuck outside, bro. It’s not that hard. God damn! I’ve been on this earth 37 fucking years! When I was a kid, guess what? If a game came out and I didn’t want to get involved with it, I didn’t fucking play with it. I didn’t go on the internet and cry like an entitled little child, “wah wah wah the game doesn’t have stuff that I want!” So shut the fuck up and leave, bro!</p><p>Are you that much of a fucking loser that you’re seeking out streams of a game you don’t like just to be like, “Wahh, I don’t like this! There’s a Black guy!” Shut the fuck up! Nobody cares. Nobody cares! That’s all. This is the only rant. I’m getting this shit out of the way now. Stop. Because any comment, any fucking comment, I’m just going to ban you. I don’t care. I’m just going to fucking ban you. I don’t care. I don’t have time for it, bro.</p><p>I’m here to play a fucking game, not listen to you cry about a Black dude that existed in history that was brought over to Japan as a slave and then taken on by Nobunaga and made a fucking retainer, all right? If that upsets you, if that makes you not feel like you’re in your special place that’s not my fucking problem—go talk to your therapist about it!</p></blockquote><h2 id="h48056"><a id=""></a>There’s too much drama in video games</h2><p>I reached out to FightinCowboy via email and asked him about the moment and if this rant was a reaction to the reality that nearly every big game has an army of angry gamers attacking it for being woke, progressive, or diverse. </p><p>“It’s definitely something that’s been on my mind,” FightinCowboy told <em>Kotaku</em>. </p><p>“I consider myself a variety creator and will typically cover 20-30 games per year, including most AAA releases and it feels like nearly every game in the last yearly cycle has some type of manufactured drama surrounding it.” </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@FightinCowboy&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/@FightinCowboy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The streamer, who has over 1 million followers on YouTube</a></span>, tells me that most of his non-gamer or online friends have no idea about all of this “drama” but that as a video game creator, he’s “subjected to it 24/7.” </p><p>“Personally, I just reached my breaking point with it,” he explained. “After the <em>Stellar Blade</em> drama last year I had mentally clocked out from most of it and I think the back to back drama with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-gay-trans-non-binary-romance-1851690152&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-gay-trans-non-binary-romance-1851690152"><em>Veilguard</em></a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/avowed-microsoft-obsidian-anti-woke-dei-twitter-1851714901&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/avowed-microsoft-obsidian-anti-woke-dei-twitter-1851714901"><em>Avowed</em></a></span>, <em>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</em>, and then it culminating with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-day-1-patch-notes-shrine-1851771221&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-day-1-patch-notes-shrine-1851771221"><em>Assassins’ Creed Shadows</em></a></span> was enough to where I had to get it off my chest.”</p><figure id="" data-id="5cdac9e45ace8597253fc41b0a6b5311" data-recommend-id="image://5cdac9e45ace8597253fc41b0a6b5311" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1500" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="5cdac9e45ace8597253fc41b0a6b5311" data-recommend-id="image://5cdac9e45ace8597253fc41b0a6b5311" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1500" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As for whether he’s surprised by the positive reaction to his rant online, he says that while he didn’t expect it to go viral, he’s not shocked that others feel the same way he does.</p><p>“As someone that just wants to enjoy games, the conversation constantly devolving into drama is exhausting. I’m not sure why people insist on engaging with things they’re not interested in just to proliferate hate, either buy it or not and move on with your life,” said FightinCowboy. </p><p>“I’ve never been a fan of baseball but that doesn’t mean I’ll suddenly go to baseball stadiums and throw insults at the attendees and audience. That’s deranged behavior and I feel the same way about these people invading gaming spaces to stir up drama.”</p><p>According to the creator, after his rant earlier this week chat cooled down and he mostly had no issues as everyone was on the same page. He plans to return to <em>Shadows </em>eventually after he wraps up some other games he’s currently playing for review. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>An official blog post released by Xbox today, the company inadvertently included a mock-up of the Xbox user interface that included a tab labeled Steam. Microsoft and Xbox have already removed the image from the post, but might have shown their desire to release an Xbox that could play games from your Steam library.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-xbox-players-finally-get-to-play-games-from-their-steam-library">Will Xbox Players Finally Get to Play Games From Their Steam Library?</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/games/articles/2025/03/gdc-2025-opening-a-billion-doors-with-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a> in question was penned by Leo Olebe, VP of Global Partnerships at Xbox, and titled “GDC 2025: Opening a Billion Doors with Xbox.” The original featured image, as discovered by XboxEra, highlighted a number of devices displaying the Xbox games library interface, including on a laptop, a phone, and an ROG Ally. In the background, a closer look at the library UI could be seen. And next to filters like Installed, Game Pass, and Recently Added, is one that simply reads “Steam.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Considering that it’s placed between Game Pass and Owned, the implication is that players in the future can access games owned on Steam though their Xbox library. This leads to speculation that the next Xbox could allow players to play Steam titles on the Xbox. Xbox is also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-is-partnering-with-asus-for-upcoming-gaming-handheld-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly working on a new handheld in partnership with Asus</a>.</p>



<p>The blog post that remains up features numerous statements that support the “open” philosophy that Xbox has supported the past couple years. “We believe that gamers should be able to play the games they want, with the people they want, anywhere they want,” Olebe wrote. “Central to this vision is empowering game creators to deliver exceptional content across all platforms seamlessly. Our goal is simple: to make every screen in the world an Xbox.” Olebe also touted the Stream Your Own Game service which lets Game Pass subscribers to purchase and stream games “across PCs, mobile devices, and Smart TVs.”</p>



<p>Will the next Xbox let players play games on their Steam library? Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>Ubisoft has just announced that Assassin’s Creed Shadows surpassed 1 million players on the first day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The official Assassin’s Creed account on <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1902802072640295067" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> has just posted, “It’s not even 4 PM here in Canada, and Assassin’s Creed Shadows has already passed 1 million players!” The developers have thanked the community for helping them reach this meaningful milestone. Ubisoft’s Day One release plans on Steam <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-shows-success-as-day-one-steam-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seem to be going well</a> for the game, too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows had to undergo several <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-march/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delays</a> before releasing today, March 20. However, it seems the delays have helped, as the developers’ constant effort to polish and improve the experience has helped Shadows cross the 1 million mark on its first day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is the franchise’s latest entry, taking players to Feudal Japan. This time, you play two characters: Yasuke, the Legendary Samurai, and Naoe, the stealthy assassin. The developers want you to explore this era of Japan to the fullest, and they have built the open world with castle towns, ports, peaceful shrines and war-ravaged landscapes for players to explore. Moreover, the game features changing seasons and reactive environments, too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, the Japanese government worries about ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/japan-government-worried-attacks-assassins-shadows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">imitation attacks</a>’ based on Assassin’s Creed Shadows. Also, here’s where to find&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-to-find-legendary-animals-ac-shadows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">all the Legendary Animals</a>&nbsp;in the game.

There are also going to be new content additions for the roguelike No Return mode.</p><p>Naughty Dog provided four PC presets: Minimum, Recommended, High, and Very High. On the low end, the game runs at 720p at 30fps and on the very high end, while the target experience is 4K resolution at 60fps. The game requires at least 16 GB of RAM, but the Very High setting requires 32 GB. As for the GPU players will need at least a Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650 / AMD Radeon RX 550XT, while  the high end requires a Nvidia GeForce GTX 4080 / AMD Radeon RX 7900XT.</p><p>PC features include adjustable texture quality, LOD distance range, volumetric quality, shadow quality, ambient occlusion, and reflections quality.

While he can't dodge, he has increased defense against melee attacks. Marlene has a "risk taker" playstyle and can reroute her path in the game once per run.</p><p>There are also four new maps: Overlook, School, Streets, and Nest. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-is-offering-some-sweet-treats-if-you-play-its-pc-games-with-a-psn-account/1100-6529100/" data-ref-id="1100-6529100">While the game on PC won't require a PSN account</a>, players can log into their accounts to gain 50 in-game points to spend on bonuses.

<p>A new comic book one-shot inspired by the immensely popular <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/?s=marvel+rivals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a> game, titled Marvel Rivals: Ignite #1, is coming to comic book shops this summer. The series features stories from some incredible Japanese comic book artists, including some who’s character designs have already appeared in-game.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-ignite-first-of-likely-many-game-inspired-comics">Marvel Rivals: Ignite First of Likely Many Game-Inspired Comics</h2>



<p>Marvel <a href="https://www.marvel.com/articles/comics/marvel-rivals-ignite-new-comic-book-series-variant-covers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> today that Marvel Rivals: Ignite #1 will feature a trio of stories from comic book artists Peach Momoko, Yuji Kaku, Mitsuyasu Sakai and Ryusei Yamada. Each of the three stories will feature two playable characters doing head-to-head. Sai (Psylocke) will take on Venom, Luna Snow will travel to Asgard to face Hela, and Punisher goes “face-to-face” with Peni Parker.</p>



<p>Momoko, who is authoring and drawing the Venom vs. Sai story, became a popular face in the comic book world though her own “Momoko-verse,” where she reimagined various Marvel characters through the lens of Japanese folktales. She’s currently writing the Ultimate X-Men series, but she’s contributed designs for in-game Peni Parker and Spider-Man skins based on her own unique style. It’s possible these skin designs of hers eventually launch in-game around June 11th, when Marvel Rivals: Ignite hits stores. Today’s announcement says that “Momoko’s new wave of in-game costumes take center stage” in Marvel Rivals: Ignite #1.</p>







<p>Manga artist Yuji Kaku is writing and drawing the Punisher vs. Peni Parker story. Kaku has only contributed to a couple of Marvel projects recently, but is famous for penning the Hell’s Paradise: Jigokuraku manga, which was adapted into an anime in 2023. Finally, writer Mitsuyasu Sakai and artist Ryusei Yamada will take on the story featuring Luna Snow and Hela. Sakai has written scripts for Japanese animation for nearly 30 years, including the episode “The Duel” from the Star Wars: Visions series. Ryusei Yamada adapted the anime REVENGER into a manga series in 2023.</p>



<p>Today’s announcement from Marvel implies that more one-shots inspired by Marvel Rivals could hit comic book stores in the future. Will you be heading to the comic book shop to pick up Marvel Rivals: Ignite #1 on June 11th?
