              <p>Matt Ryan, the actor behind <a href="https://kotaku.com/lets-rank-the-assassins-creed-games-worst-to-best-1844019813?_gl=1*5o1ks5*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MjMwOTA2MS4yNDkuMS4xNzQyMzEwMDQyLjYwLjAuMA.."><em>Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag</em>’s</a> main character Edward Kenway, recently told a fan that they <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-voice-actor-teases-remake-1851785327">might have a reason to replay the 2013 pirate game</a>. The <em>Constantine </em>actor said this at a convention signing, and fans took this as a tease of a <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-4-black-flag-remake-skull-bones-1850596271">potential remake or remaster</a>. However, it sounds like Ryan wasn’t in the clear to even say this much to a fan, as Ubisoft apparently threatened legal action against him after video of the interaction spread online.</p> <p>TikTok user kylo_hd659 posted a video of them meeting with Ryan at Comic Con Manchester at his signing table. When the topic of the <em>Black Flag </em>remaster came up, Ryan explained that he didn’t realize the previous interaction was being recorded, and now that it’s put him in hot water with Ubisoft, he’s keeping his mouth shut on the matter.</p> <p>“The thing is, when that happened, someone was doing this and I was being very free and open and I didn’t know that they were actually recording me on their phone,” Ryan said. “Then the company threatened to sue me. So I say nothing.”</p>

   <p>Ryan points to the camera during this back and forth, so it seems like he’s well aware of it this time. I guess that’s one way to get the word out for people to stop asking about something you aren’t supposed to be talking about. We’ve reached out to Ubisoft for comment and will update the story if we hear back.</p> <p>While Ryan hasn’t returned to <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>or video games since <em>Black Flag</em>, he’s spent much of the decade since playing John Constantine in several DC Comics projects, both in live-action shows like <em>Legends of Tomorrow</em> and in animated shows and movies. Hey James Gunn, if you’re gonna bring the warlock to <a href="https://kotaku.com/superman-israel-palestine-woke-clark-kent-punk-rock-1851786212">the new DC Universe movies</a>, you should bring Ryan back as a personal favor to me. Please, and thank you.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-preview-destruction-classes-bf3-bf4-1851787384</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/after-4-hours-with-battlefield-6-i%E2%80%99m-convinced-it-has-the-juice.1259157/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>My first introduction to <a href="https://kotaku.com/bf6-battlefield-6-leak-october-launch-early-access-beta-1851786824"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> came via a trailer in a large warehouse in Los Angeles. The video featured Limp Bizkit singing about a chainsaw. It was loud, bombastic, and frankly a bit embarrassing. But then I sat down and got to play over four hours of EA’s upcoming military FPS, and somehow, by the end, I was so won over by this new game that I almost forgot about Limp Bizkit. Almost.</p> <p>A lot of ink has already been spilled covering <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-crossover-skins-rick-morty-call-of-duty-1851786919"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a>, from the leaks to the multiple alpha tests to various rumors and reports claiming it might cost over $400 million. This is a game that has four different studios (previously five) working on it. A game that EA is seemingly betting the farm on. A game that is meant to return the franchise to greatness after it stumbled in past entries, like <em>BF 2042. </em></p> <p>And EA and Battlefield Studios’ plan to pull all this off with <em>Battlefield 6,</em> launching this October, is simple, but smart: <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-bf6-reveal-trailer-teaser-sp-ea-gameplay-1851786894">Make <em>Battlefield 4</em> again</a>, but with better visuals, improved gunplay, and a few ideas to freshen it up. That’s the fan favorite entry. The one people compare every other installment against. It might seem cynical to frame <em>BF6 </em>as “<em>BF4 Again</em>” but it’s practically what EA said during the on-stage event before I played the game. “A spiritual successor to <em>Battlefield 3 </em>and <em>Battlefield 4</em>” were exact words used by one developer. And as a fan of those games, I’m happy to report they (mostly) nailed it.</p>

 <p>I and a whole army of other journalists, critics, and content creators got to play a handful of maps and modes in L.A. as part of a preview event ahead of the game’s full multiplayer reveal that happened on Thursday. (Travel and accommodation were provided to <em>Kotaku&nbsp;</em>by the publisher.) This wasn’t a finished build, but what I played felt good enough to ship.</p> <p>Set in 2027, <em>BF6 </em>returns the franchise to a contemporary military setting. There are no crazy laser guns or robots. Instead, it’s M4s, Abrams tanks, shotguns, dusty streets, and frag grenades. This is a more grounded and gritty military shooter compared to recent <em>Call of Duty</em> entries.</p>

 <h2>Dangerous guns and different classes</h2> <p>Combat is loud and dangerous. The time to kill is fairly short, and headshots are extremely lethal. Every gun I used packed a punch and felt destructive. <em>Battlefield 6</em>, more than anything else, nails its gunplay and combat. Firefights are chaotic, but moving around the very dense but easy-to-navigate maps is a breeze thanks to improved controls.  You can jump out windows, slide, roll when landing, sprint while crouched, and even shoot guns while lying on your back. Even when I was getting my ass kicked by some popular streamer, I still had a good time when playing the franchise’s famous Conquest mode because moving and shooting in <em>BF6 </em>is a joy. But like in <em>BF4 </em>and <em>BF3</em>, you move slowly and deliberately in <em>BF6</em>. Characters feel heavy, as do vehicles, making combat feel less like a twitchy arena shooter and more like a digital simulation of a real war.</p> <p>Adding to that feeling of chaotic, gritty combat is the ability for any player to grab a downed player and drag them to safety before reviving them. I did this many times in my time with the game, often pulling fellow squad members out of harm’s way or out of the scope of a pesky sniper. It’s a small, simple, but surprisingly engaging mechanic that everybody I spoke to after the event loved. I expect some other games might steal it from <em>BF6 </em>in the future.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000614036" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614036"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614036">Screenshot: EA / Battlefield Studios</figcaption></figure> <p>Classes return to <em>Battlefield </em>after being absent from <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-2042-the-kotaku-review-1848123654"><em>2042</em></a><em> </em>at launch (and then later shoved back in via a post-launch update), and they work like they did in <em>BF3/BF4</em>. You can play as Assault, Support, Engineer, and Recon. Each class has a few key abilities and traits that help make them feel different during combat.</p> <p>For example, the Assault trooper takes less fall damage and readies assault rifles quicker than anyone else, helping give them the edge in one one-on-one fights. Meanwhile, the Support trooper—my favorite—can place down chest-high bulletproof walls to provide cover, and can also provide ammo refills to teammates. They can also instantly revive players, which is faster than dragging them out of combat, but not as fun.</p> <p>Having the traditional classes return in <em>Battlefield 6 </em>is both a nostalgic return to what I loved before and also a great reminder that, yeah, this is the best way to do a class-based shooter. However, one big change here from <em>BF4 </em>and <em>BF3 </em>is that classes can now spawn with any weapon. While there are some advantages for picking the specific weapon type suited to each class—like snipers getting to reload scoped rifles without leaving aim-down-sight—this new open weapon system does rob the classes of some individuality.</p>

 <p>This is extremely noticeable in the smaller, more combat-focused modes that take place on specific sections of the larger maps. Here, a sniper becomes less useful, but the Recon troopers’ motion sensor is still nifty. So many players I fought during the event just swapped out a scoped rifle for an SMG. It ended up feeling less like <em>Battlefield 3</em> and more like a <em>Call of Duty </em>clone. Thankfully, EA says <em>BF6 </em>will ship with playlists that feature locked class weapons, which is nice, but I worry how that will split the game’s fanbase in the weeks and months after launch.</p> <h2>Lots of destruction, but smaller maps</h2> <p>On the plus side: <em>BF3 </em>tank lovers, rejoice. Your armored mechanical beasts are very powerful in <em>Battlefield 6.</em> When an enemy tank would appear, I’d panic and dive for cover or try to get as many walls between me and it as possible. And thanks to <em>BF6 </em>bringing back <em>Battlefield’s </em>beloved destruction, tanks and other vehicles can quickly turn the tide of battle by ripping holes in walls or even demolishing sections of buildings. One of the funniest moments involving destruction that I experienced involved someone using a tank to knock out the wall and floor of a building I was camping in, sending me falling below into debris and enemy gunfire.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000614037" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614037"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614037">Screenshot: EA / Battlefield Studios</figcaption></figure> <p>This is what EA is calling “Tactical Destruction,” which is the idea that levels should be extremely breakable and that destruction should not only look cool (which it does) but that it should serve a purpose. A single grenade or rocket can alter a shortcut or change up a hiding spot. I’ll need to see how other maps feel, but so far, what I’ve played has me excited to see how EA and Battlefield Studios design maps to be destructible in tactical ways.</p> <p>Speaking of maps, all of the ones in <em>BF6</em>‘s preview were smaller than what was found in <em>BF 2042</em>. This is a good thing. It means you spend less time looking for action and more time fighting other players in chaotic shootouts. The maps also look gorgeous, with lots of lovely details, most of which get destroyed by the end. I also felt like they all funneled players into firefights efficiently and didn’t feel too barren or busy.</p> <p>The devs at the event said they went back and got inspired by some of the classic maps fans love, and I can feel it. And all but one of the nine maps launching with <em>BF6 </em>are new. (The one exception is the return of Operation Firestorm.) This strikes me as the <em>BF6 </em>devs feeling confident in what they have made, and they should feel that way. These are some damn fine <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-2042-bf2042-season-7-last-ea-motive-future-1851397390?_gl=1*au54e4*_ga*MjA2NzM0ODM3MS4xNzQ5ODUxOTU4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTM5Mzg3MzEkbzE1JGcxJHQxNzUzOTQwNzgwJGoxMyRsMCRoMA.."><em>Battlefield</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>maps.</p> <p>I was sad when my four hours with <em>Battlefield 6 </em>were over. As someone who played way, way too much <em>Battlefield 3</em> and<em> Battlefield 4</em>, <em>BF6 </em>is exactly what I wanted. It’s a return to the slower, grittier, louder, and smaller digital battles I (and other fans) prefer. It’s not a confusing and overly large mess, like <em>BF 2042</em>. Instead, <em>BF6 </em>feels like a refined, improved, and perfected version of a game people already loved. It might not be the most original or fresh spin on <em>Battlefield</em>, and that might limit how many new players it brings in. But what’s here is <em>really </em>good, and I can’t wait to play more when <em>Battlefield 6</em> arrives on October 10. Hopefully, I won’t have to listen to Limp Bizkit before I play again.</p> <p>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-switch-2-key-cards-persona-3-octopath-1851787455</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo%E2%80%99s-game-key-card-showcase-leaves-fans-severely-underwhelmed.1259151/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>The line between a bad video game showcase and a great one can be exceedingly slim. Often it only takes one or two surprise reveals targeting the right genres and nostalgia centers for most players to come away with generally positive vibes. The July Nintendo Direct failed on that count. It didn’t help that a fresh flood of Switch 2 game key cards is sapping even some of the most diehard fans of any surplus enthusiasm.</p> <p>The<em> Mario</em> maker’s revelation that Thursday’s presentation would be a “Partner Showcase” instead of an all-out Nintendo Direct was the first blow to ambient online hype levels. Okay, no new 3D<em> Mario</em> announcements or<em> Metroid Prime 4</em> release date. But hey, at least fans could count on some major third-party reveals, including another raft of big ports. Surely Microsoft, rumored to be bringing the big guns to Switch 2 any day now, would show up.</p> <p>Alas, no. Instead, the July Direct offered only a few smaller new game announcements—<em>Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection, Octopath Traveler 0</em>, and <em>The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</em>—and mostly spent its time rehashing stuff we already knew about like <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, <em>Borderlands 4</em>, <em>Madden 26</em>, and <em>FC Sports 26</em>. Even a quick look at the next <em>Hyrule Warriors</em> felt thrown together and supremely underwhelming. And there was no big “oh shit!” moment like, say, <em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em> also coming to Switch 2.</p>

   <p>The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1me1wgt/gotta_say_that_rat_game_dont_look_half_bad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">litany of Switch 2 fan wish-casting</a> prior to the showcase had gotten out of control, but not even one of the numerous highly anticipated third-party updates made it into the showcase. No more footage of<em> Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>, no release date for <em>Hades 2</em>, and no mention of the rumored <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> port. Switch 2 versions of other recent blockbusters were also MIA. No surprise port of <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, or <em>Lies of P</em>. There weren’t even updates on when players will be able to get their hands on the Switch 2 versions of <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> or <em>Elden Ring</em>.</p> <p><em>Chillin’ by the Fire</em>, one of the more unusual games announced during the Direct, now serves as the unlikely encapsulation of this disappointment. It’s a multiplayer game where you sit around a campfire with friends. “Your goal: Campfire Level 10,” reads the description. “The sense of accomplishment you feel when the firebed turns into bright red embers and the pillars of flame illuminate the night sky is more powerful than any scoreboard.” The gimmick is that it works with webcams to put players’ faces around the campfire. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1me35oe/peak_nintendo_switch2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fans were not impressed</a>.</p>

 <p>A Switch 2 port of last year’s <em>Persona 3: Reload</em>, one of the better pieces of news from the event, highlights the other prong of player disappointment. Diehard Nintendo fans like their physical games, RPG players more than most, but the physical version of<em> Persona 3</em> is the latest to rely on a game key card instead of an actual cartridge with the game on it. It was far from the only game key card game announced during the Direct.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Nintendo Game-Key Card Partner Showcase 😭 <a href="https://t.co/EUdnlDWPrq">pic.twitter.com/EUdnlDWPrq</a></p> <p>— Genki✨ (@Genki_JPN) <a href="https://twitter.com/Genki_JPN/status/1950954931621630231?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 31, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em> is key card only too, as well as <em>Pac-Man World 2 Re-Pac</em>. <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> is a game key card on Switch 2, but fortunately it’s also coming to the original Switch where it will have a standard cartridge. Unfortunately, that version of the game <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3lvbir7e7lc2l" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will not have an upgrade path</a> to the Switch 2 version, so anyone who opts for the only physical version of the game on a Nintendo platform won’t be able to take advantage of any upgraded performance from the Switch 2 version.</p>

 <p>There are still notable exceptions when it comes to the third-party publishers opting to cut corners with game key cards. At launch, the big one was<em> Cyberpunk 2077</em>, which fit the entire base game and its massive expansion on a 64GB card. <em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em> is another, as is <em>Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion </em>which arrives in September. It can be done, and it’s unfortunate to see many of the publishers of games whose audiences care the most about that sort of the thing being precisely the ones to opt out. No one cares if<em> Madden 26</em> comes on the cartridge, but why is <em>Final Fantasy Tactics </em>on Switch 2 <a href="https://store.jp.square-enix.com/item/NXS_J_A43UA.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just a download code in a box</a>?</p> <p>Does any of this matter to the average Switch 2 owner? Probably not. The console is good and there will be no shortage of games to play this fall. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/708909/nintendo-switch-2-donkey-kong-bananza-exclusive-release-schedule" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo’s slow-drip strategy</a> is, all things considered, probably the smart thing to do. God knows there are more than enough games to keep everyone busy until long after they become worm food. But the last few years of the Switch 1 weren’t exactly blowing fans’ lids off, and the Switch 2’s first summer, with the notable exception of <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, has been a bit of a snoozefest. The first Nintendo Direct since the Switch 2 launched could have jolted fans back awake. Instead, the post-launch lull continues.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/hideo-kojima-metal-gear-solid-3-remake-stranding-1851787440</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kojima-on-whether-or-not-he%E2%80%99ll-play-metal-gear-solid-3-remake-lol-nope.1259142/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>The upcoming remake of <em>Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</em> is certainly ambitious. Taking one of the most elaborate gaming projects of the early 2000s and sprucing it up with modern third-person stealth and shooter mechanics along with a fresh coat of graphical paint is no easy task, and the challenges involved go well beyond the technical. The <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> games are pretty sacred works of art in gaming history, so diehard fans are certain to shine a critical eye on this game once it releases. But there’s another person who may also be interested in what’s going on with this project: Hideo Kojima, the man who wrote and directed the original game. Well, if you thought Kojima was going to be all in on sneaking around in the jungles and chomping on snakes in 2025, you’re wrong.</p> <p>Speaking with writer Kevin Nguyen in a piece for <a href="https://www.ssense.com/en-us/editorial/culture/hideo-kojima-death-stranding-interview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canadian fashion retailer Ssense</a> (<a href="https://www.ssense.com/en-us/women/product/alexander-mcqueen/black-cobweb-lace-miniskirt/17724101" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1700 bucks for a miniskirt</a>, anyone?) Kojima discusses a range of topics, from needing eye surgery right as the pandemic hit to gaining inspiration from art installations and what he thinks of modern games, which overall he seems to find very predictable. One notable modern game that gets a mention is the upcoming remake of <em>Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</em>. Asked point blank if he’ll play it, Kojima is reported to have laughed before saying, “No, I won’t.”</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Metal Gear Solid Δ: Snake Eater - Gameplay Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sKMayCD1u3w?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Now to be clear, in the same interview, Kojima also expresses that he simply doesn’t have time to play many games right now. The dude’s busy being the enigmatic creative wildman that he is, and so time he could spend playing games is spent seeking out fine art and, naturally, watching films. He’s also critical of the industry in general, noting we’re in a period of perpetual studio closures and even taking a shot at Summer Games Fest, which he describes as endless reels of the same “visuals and systems” to portray a power fantasy of fighting monsters, aliens, and unnamed soldiers in a perpetual war. To make things worse, Kojima is somewhat unimpressed with the experience (or lack thereof) some studios have with military weaponry. Conducting research for his own games about war and violence, Kojima “learned so many ways to kill people,” he told Nguyen. So for Kojima, it’s not just that most games these days are just power fantasies; they’re also seemingly not interested in learning from what real war and violence tends to look like.</p>

 <p>It’s not surprising that Kojima doesn’t seem too excited about playing <em>MGS3</em>’s upcoming remake. In fact, the interview speculates that the legendary game developer is still affected by the rough split between himself and Konami. The piece describes <em>Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain</em>, which was developed in his final years with the publisher, as “pushed out” and “unfinished,” something fans have long debated based on the odd narrative structure of <em>The Phantom Pain</em> and the presence of <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/metal-gear-solid-5-new-leak-reignites-chapter-3-mission-51-theories/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an unfinished third chapter</a> which might’ve tied up some ill-fitting loose ends presented to the player at the game’s conclusion. Then again, maybe it was simply something Kojima chose to leave on the cutting room floor. We may never know.</p> <p>Kojima’s a serial internet poster, quick to share many opinions on films, games, and other creative works. But it looks like he probably won’t be talking up the upcoming <em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em> on his Bluesky timeline.</p>

        <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/dead-take-ben-starr-neil-newbon-live-action-horror-game-1851785456"><em>Dead Take</em></a>, a horror FMV game from <a href="https://kotaku.com/tales-of-kenzera-zau-review-release-date-abubakar-salim-1851426666"><em>Tales of Kenzera</em></a><em> </em>developer Surgent Studios, starts with a disclaimer that its story of unbridled Hollywood ego taken to its most terrifying extreme is a “work of fiction not intended to reference or depict any actual people, places, events, or other entities in the real world.” This is the same legal ass-covering that many artistic works employ to avoid lawsuits in the event that someone out there thinks the story reflects their own actions or experiences a little too closely, but it stuck with me when I played through the six-hour escape room psychological drama. Its tale of the cutthroat, vindictive side of the entertainment industry may be oozing true crime flair, but outside of the jump scares and darker turns, is the story it tells really <em>that </em>different from any real-life horror story you might have heard about the challenges struggling artistss sometimes face when they’re trying to make it?</p> <p>If you want a game to talk about the trials and tribulations of actors, it’s worth having some incredible talent to get the message across. <em>Dead Take </em>stars <em>Final Fantasy XVI </em>and <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> lead Ben Starr and Astarion from <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> himself, Neil Newbon, as two struggling(?) actor friends(?), Vinny Monroe and Chase Lowry. Both actors auditioned for a role in the latest movie by visionary director Duke Cain, but Vinny was the one who landed the job. While Chase is clearly not thrilled by this turn of events, he and Vinny seem to still be on good terms, up until Vinny stops answering his phone after a party at Cain’s luxurious mansion. Chase, in an effort to find his friend, goes to Cain’s home and finds only the aftermath of a party long over.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000614055" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614055"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614055">Screenshot: Surgent Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Most of <em>Dead Take </em>plays out as a kind of large-scale escape room. Cain’s mansion is full of locked rooms with mysteries and unpleasant answers on the other side. The game is a mostly solitary affair, as Chase seems to be the only soul in the building, but Starr, Newbon, and a few other surprising big actors in the video game space get some real face time through found footage. So even if Chase is alone, every supporting character’s presence is still felt in their absence. There are plenty of text logs and environmental cues that give you a sense of what’s going on, but the bulk of the story is told through FMV video files you search for and watch in Cain’s lavish home theater. There are some puzzles even within that, some requiring you to use video editing software to find hidden footage within the files you’ve already discovered. It’s nothing as demanding as what you find in a Sam Barlow game like <em>Her Story </em>or <em>Immortality</em>, but it’s just enough to make you feel like even the videos you find aren’t the full story, and that there are hidden meanings to be found within even the most innocuous footage.</p>

 <p>Starr’s performance is the standout for me. Vinny is a driven but privileged nepo baby who is drinking Cain’s Kool-Aid as if the man’s films were plopped into theaters by Christ himself. But that’s not even a character flaw that’s specific to him. Everyone<em> </em>in <em>Dead Take </em>is lapping up everything this man puts down, and they’re willing to sabotage others to bask in his light.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000614056" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614056"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614056">Screenshot: Surgent Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>We’re seeing this all through Chase’s eyes, and his voyeuristic role in this whole ordeal means we see more of Vinny’s character than probably anyone else, with much of the footage we see of Chase being taken from his initial, unsuccessful audition. <em>Dead Take </em>has the perspective of someone who has been pushed out or denied entry into a sacred, elite space, and by god, it sure speaks to the feeling of trying to break into a competitive artistic field where certain auteurs are put on a pedestal by just about everyone. Yeah, this is the kind of shit Hollywood has to deal with, but it’s also universally applicable to most creative industries. Whether you’re an actor, an artist, a musician, or hell, even a journalist, there’s a perception that there’s an in-crowd and that some people are so legendary that they cannot be so much as be questioned. To say a word against them is to incur their wrath, and that of the people who stand to gain something by being in their proximity. <em>Dead Take</em>’s horrific vision of these ideas is extreme, but it’s rooted in something so real that I had as much of a visceral reaction to the notes I found as I did to any of the more straightforward horrors I encountered in the self-aggrandizing museum Cain calls a home. I won’t spoil some of the mysteries I uncovered, but suffice it to say, <em>Dead Take</em>’s rancid vibes don’t just come from the tense, isolating atmosphere.</p>

 <p>All that being said, the more straightforward scares are my biggest issue with <em>Dead Take</em>. I can handle a jump scare. I can handle two, even. My problem is that <em>Dead Take</em>’s use of them feels incredibly cheap and artificial. I know it’s currently in vogue to point out that “good” or “elevated” horror doesn’t rely on loud bangs and creepy monsters jumping out of walls to scare a viewer or player. While I think those critiques are often overblown and can carry an air of pretentious elitism, almost all of <em>Dead Take</em>’s jump scares are sudden distorted visions of Starr’s screaming face that appear on the screen without warning or any real diegetic context. This happens over and over, with increasing frequency as the game goes on, and I got pretty sick of it by the time I reached the final sequence. Sure, I could charitably read these as manifestations of Chase’s gradually decaying psyche, but they become so frequent and yet impossible to anticipate or connect to anything specific happening in the game that eventually, they no longer feel like real scares rooted in the world you’re moving through. All they did for me was disrupt my nervous system to the point where I had to brace myself every time I walked into a room, and eventually, I had to pause the game before I moved on because I knew I’d probably get a random bit of Starr screaming at me while I’m just trying to find a key or a USB stick.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000614057" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614057"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614057">Screenshot: Surgent Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>It’s a shame those stuttering screams are littered throughout a game I was otherwise drawn into. If you have the tolerance for jump scares, especially ones that have no real basis in the world, have at it. For everyone else, you might need to take some breaks walking through Cain’s mansion like I did, but once you’re past them, there’s a pretty compelling escape room mystery here, elevated by great performances from its two leads. <em>Dead Take </em>is scariest when it’s rooted in something real, and even if there’s a disclaimer assuring everyone it’s not based on anyone specific, know that Duke Cains walk among us.</p>       </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/dead-take-review-ben-starr-neil-newbon-horror-game-1851787439]]></content:encoded>

              <p>Square Enix lived up to its reputation <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-square-enix-octopath-traveler-2-forspoken-1849531112">for terrible game names</a> during <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-july-2025-octopath-elliot-star-wars-1851787392">the July Nintendo Direct</a>, but somehow an action-RPG titled <em>The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</em> wasn’t the most absurd part of the showcase. That came when the publisher revealed the name of the world in which the HD-2D adventure takes place: “Philabieldia.”</p> <p>They even made some <a href="https://youtu.be/gZoLrfLcIVg?t=1411" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poor presenter</a> say the name out loud. “This is Philabieldia, a continent overrun by beast tribes,” she said with gusto. Square Enix has really come out of the gate swinging on Switch 2.<em> Bravely Default: Flying Fairy</em>, an HD remaster of <em>Bravely Second: End Layer</em>, was a launch game for the new console. Now it’s back with <em>The Adventures of Elliot</em>, which already has a demo free to try on the eShop.</p> <p>But “Philabieldia” takes it to another level. As a native of the City of Brotherly Love’s greater metro area, I feel personally attacked. And confused. Are we being trolled or are the Square Enix localizers for real right now? I am not the only one with questions.</p>

I mean, it’s not just that Philabieldia looks like someone said “this edible ain’t shit” moments before trying to explain who won the Super Bowl last year. It’s also, on its own, completely divorced from the real-world context, just an awful thing to try and pronounce.</p> <p><em>The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</em> looks like a cool game even if it doesn’t <em>sound</em> like one. I can’t wait to meet its final boss who’s probably a boxer named Ricky or something.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/octopath-traveler-ii-impressions-rpg-partitio-osvald-1850179725">A third <em>Octopath Traveler </em>game</a> is on the way and the Square Enix JRPG series looks as stunningly retro as ever. This one is called <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> and includes a bunch of new features. It also looks perfectly positioned to once again trick me into thinking I will fall in love with these games.</p> <p>Revealed during today’s Nintendo Direct, <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> will hit Switch 1 and Switch 2 on December 4 and tell the story of a world on the brink of collapse that must be rebuilt (and which is seemingly <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_US/news/octopath-traveler-0">based on the 2022 mobile spin-off <em>Champions of the Continent</em></a>). Players will still go around collecting party members and grinding through turn-based battles, but this time their own personalized character will be the star of the show. New base-building mechanics will also add some light life management sim aspects to the formula, it seems.</p> <p>Most importantly, however, the HD-2D pixel art still looks incredible. Here’s the trailer:</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="OCTOPATH TRAVELER 0 – Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase 7.31.2025" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ENHXHzvMx-g?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><em>Octopath Traveler </em>should be the prefect series for me. I grew up on 8-bit and 16-bit games. I was obsessed with SNES RPGs. I’ve played <em>Final Fantasy VI</em>, the most direct inspiration for the <em>Octopath games</em>, at least a dozen times. But try as I may, my appreciation, admiration, and respect for the <em>Octopath</em> games has never given way to being truly in love with them. I play a bunch, mostly out of a feeling of duty, and then eventually bounce off. They can be nice JRPG comfort food but never felt like anything more to me.</p> <p><em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> is definitely going to be the one to fix that though, I can feel it. This it the one that will convert me into a true believer rather than just a sympathetic skeptic. I will definitely <em>not</em> buy <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em>, play it for 10 hours, and then never put the game back in my Switch 2. This time will be different. <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> will fix me. I can’t wait to order it, gift wrap it, and leave it under the Christmas tree just waiting to not break my heart on Christmas Day.</p>

              <p><em>Persona 3 Reload</em>, the from-the-ground-up remake of the original PS2 RPG, is <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-games-elden-ring-gtav-final-fantasy-1851745512?_gl=1*xmp4lt*_ga*MTMxODc3NjkwMi4xNzI1Njc2NzM3*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTM5NjU5OTAkbzM4MCRnMSR0MTc1Mzk2Njg5NyRqNjAkbDAkaDA.">coming to Switch 2</a>. Atlus announced the port on today’s Nintendo Direct partner showcase, and it’s coming to the system pretty soon. The port will launch on Nintendo’s system on October 23, with both physical and digital versions.</p> <p>Pre-orders for <em>Persona 3 Reload </em>will begin later today, but at the moment it’s not entirely clear if the Switch 2 version will also include <a href="https://kotaku.com/persona-3-reload-answer-episode-aigis-review-dlc-1851643562"><em>The Answer</em></a>, the playable epilogue starring the Persona-summoning android Aigis. The trailer shown during the Direct only contained footage of the base game, but I imagine we’ll know more later when pre-orders go live.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Persona 3 Reload – Announcement Trailer – Nintendo Switch 2" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hVcHF5_UtM0?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>When I first played the original <em>Persona 3</em>, I did so on my PlayStation Vita by playing the <em>Persona 3 Portable </em>edition. While I adored <em>Reload </em>on PS5, I was constantly yearning for a Switch version that would let me play it in bed or on the go. These games are really suited for handheld play, but we haven’t had a mainline <em>Persona </em>game launch on a handheld since <em>Persona 4 Golden</em>, though plenty of spin-offs have come to mobile, Switch, and Vita. <em>Persona 5 Royal </em>was eventually ported to the Switch, and I still recommend people play it there if they have a chance. It’s just easier to chip away at a 100-hour game if you’re not tethered to a TV or your PC. Now, <em>Persona 3 Reload</em>, the <a href="https://kotaku.com/persona-3-reload-demo-akihiko-junpei-social-link-1851160706">“definitive” edition</a> of the best game in the series, is coming to Switch 2. If you’ve been waiting to jump on the remake, this will hopefully be the place to play it.

              <p>This hasn’t been the wet hot summer extravaganza <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>was hoping for. Despite Capcom <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/capcom-smashes-second-larger-pane-of-emergency-glass-pulling-a-big-endgame-monster-hunter-wilds-update-from-september-and-getting-it-ready-for-next-month-instead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">breaking glass</a> on an event-themed bikini for its fan-favorite blacksmith Gemma, community vibes remain off and the publisher is getting grilled on <a href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-title-2-patch-notes-steam-reviews-1851785248">why more players aren’t flocking</a> to the franchise’s first installment built from the ground up for current-gen consoles.</p> <p>The good news is that all of the panic has led Capcom to push forward some of its plans for a big September update. A new level of quest difficulty and new random skill Talisman rewards <a href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1950139099160949156" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will now arrive in mid-August</a>, hopefully reinvigorating some of the grind when they do. Along with rebalanced weapons and other improvements and adjustments, players should have new loot to grind for and more challenging hunts to contend with.</p>   <p>The bad news is that <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> still isn’t where it deserves to be on PC in terms of performance, and the general sluggishness with which new content updates have arrived has arguably led lots of players to bounce off into other multiplayer games. <em>Monster Hunter World&nbsp;</em>had a faster cadence of new updates culminating in the much-celebrated<em> Iceborne</em> expansion 18 months later. In addition to having a spottier post-launch calendar, many fans also feel like <em>Wilds</em> has had deeper problems it needs to address right out of the gate, especially on PC.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000613831" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000613831"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000613831">Screenshot: Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>“Regarding catalog titles, although sales were soft for <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, the latest title in the series released in February this year, <em>Monster Hunter Rise</em>, a previous title in the same series, continued to see sales growth,” Capcom <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/result/2025/1st/result_2025_1st_01.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told investors during</a> its earnings presentation this week. In fact, the four-year-old game almost sold <em>more</em> than <em>Wilds</em> over the last three months as the latter has fallen off a cliff even while rival games like<em> Elden Ring Nightreign</em> continue going strong, likely thanks at least in part to great word of mouth.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">An update on release date and content of update Ver.1.021</p> <p>The expansion of endgame content which was originally planned as part of Title Update 3 in late September will now be released ahead of schedule as part of the Ver.1.021 update. To accommodate this change, this update… <a href="https://t.co/aQF1oFMCFR">pic.twitter.com/aQF1oFMCFR</a></p> <p>— Monster Hunter (@monsterhunter) <a href="https://twitter.com/monsterhunter/status/1950139099160949156?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Multiple shareholders asked Capcom about the situation <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/stock/meeting.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">during a meeting earlier this month</a>. “There have been concerns raised regarding recent titles, including insufficient content volume and optimization issues,” said one. “What are the Company’s plans for addressing these matters going forward?” Another asked, “Are the development staff aware of the feedback being shared on social media and message boards regarding <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>?” The company said it reviews all feedback but didn’t have anything more concrete to offer at the time.</p> <p>While an “overwhelmingly negative” rating on Steam with just 14 percent of the last 14,000 reviews being positive is certainly doing the game no favors, I think some of the issues go deeper than just a lack of optimization on PC. <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>’ main campaign <a href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-review-ps5-open-world-rpg-capcom-1851766113">is fun and breezy but also streamlined to the point of making much of the game feel perfunctory</a>. The battles and combat are top-notch, but the overall progression and exploration leave much to be desired. It’s a good game but not the type you rush to convince your friends to play with you at the moment. We’ll see if August’s updates can begin turning that around.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-patch-notes-1-2-0-three-lap-cpu-nerf-1851787286">A surprise <em>Mario Kart World</em> update</a> has breathed new life into the Switch 2 exclusive, but it’s one of the changes that goes unmentioned by Nintendo which could have the biggest impact on the game’s competitive scene.</p> <p>While version 1.2.0 lists a ton of of notable changes, including dialing back CPU difficulty across every mode except battles, it doesn’t say anything about players getting a bigger speed boost from landing after performing in-air tricks. Yet that’s exactly what players discovered after the update went live today, with many breezing through their previous time trial records thanks to their newfound acceleration.</p> <p><a href="https://x.com/RookieMK/status/1950394963055038924" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A new clip</a> from RookieMK racing against their previous time trial ghost perfectly encapsulates the change:</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">funniest visualization of the patch <a href="https://t.co/TcEcFD0cvR">pic.twitter.com/TcEcFD0cvR</a></p> <p>— Rookie (@RookieMK) <a href="https://twitter.com/RookieMK/status/1950394963055038924?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 30, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>While <em>Mario Kart World</em>’s big open map and Knockout Mode get the most attention for bringing fresh ideas to the long-running series, the Switch 2 racer is just as notable, if not more so, for how it reinvents the moment-to-moment gameplay by infusing it with a bit of <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater</em>. Players can now wall-run, grind off rails, and glance off mid-air objects to pick up extra speed boosts.</p>   <p>The most skilled players are thus effectively racing like they have a secret stash of Mushrooms. The new patch takes things even further, in particular increasing the speed boost after landing from ramp jumps and other mid-air tricks. “You get a ton of extra momentum,” YouTuber svcTyler said in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeT-NV0hkXk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a new video</a>. “So much momentum to the point that it’s completely trivialized every currently existing world record in the game.”</p> <p>The <em>Mario Kart World </em>records page shows exactly that. Only two new world record times were <a href="https://mkwrs.com/mkworld/recent.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted on July 29</a>. Today, there’s been dozens. Nintendo’s stealth change has completely revitalized the speedrunning race, at least until all of the new optimal times get posted and players have to go back to eking out marginal improvements in times.</p>

              <p>The original Switch was a trailblazing device that proved you could take console-quality games on the go, but it was demonstrably less powerful than its PlayStation and Xbox competitors. In the years since the handheld hit the shelves, that gap has only grown with the release of the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. Making up some ground, the Switch 2 is more powerful and runs games like <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>that wouldn’t have been possible on the original system.</p> <p>So now that we have some sense of what the Switch 2 can actually do, we’ve started thinking about some big games that we’d like to see ported to the spiffy new device. Nintendo is holding <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-nintendo-elden-ring-ff7-time-date-1851787326">a new Direct partner showcase tomorrow</a>, July 31, and it’s entirely possible some big games will be making their Switch 2 debut during the broadcast. What better time than now to think about games we’d like to see on the system? Here are a few of our ideas.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/board-game-company-fucks-around-announcing-a-new-harry-potter-game-finds-out-when-fans-revolt-and-media-announce-boycotts.1259094/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last week the board game publisher CGE, in The Year Of Our Lord Twenty Twenty-Five, announced a new Harry Potter game. Called <em>Back to Hogwarts</em>, it's a spinoff of CGE's immensely popular <em>Codenames </em>series, which has been huge for almost a decade now after winning the 2016 Spiel des Jahres. The announcement was, as you can imagine, not received very well!</p><p>The publisher's reveal post was <em>flooded</em> with angry responses from former fans of the series and current fans of <em>Codenames</em>,<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/codenamesgame.bsky.social/post/3lunig55sr22g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> so much so that after 705 replies CGE turned off the ability for anyone to comment</a> across not just Bluesky, but all their social media platforms. Some of those 705 comments said Harry Potter creator JK Rowling is a "<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mancalledhorse.bsky.social/post/3lurimuil6k2k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mouldy castle bigot writer lady</a>", and that sales of this game puts "<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/val-apocalypse.satan.social/post/3luqwomjf522g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">money straight into a racist terf's pockets that she'll use to enable the murder of trans people</a>".</p><p>Now,<a href="https://boardgamewire.com/index.php/2025/07/29/reviewers-including-no-pun-included-shut-up-sit-down-boycott-codenames-publisher-cge-for-releasing-new-harry-potter-game-while-ignoring-jk-rowlings-anti-trans-rhetoric/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> as BoardGameWire report</a>, sectors of the board gaming media are joining the opposition. No Pun Included have announced they'll no longer be covering any of CGE's games, and have been joined by 3 Minute Board Games and, most consequentially, Shut Up &amp; Sit Down, one of the most popular outlets in the scene with almost half a million subscribers.</p><p>SU&amp;SD's EiC Tom Brewster was absolutely <em>scathing </em>in<a href="https://boardgamewire.com/index.php/2025/07/29/reviewers-including-no-pun-included-shut-up-sit-down-boycott-codenames-publisher-cge-for-releasing-new-harry-potter-game-while-ignoring-jk-rowlings-anti-trans-rhetoric/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> his comments to BGW</a>, saying:</p><blockquote><p>I fail to see Harry Potter: Codenames as anything but a soulless cash grab that’s tremendously insulting to the trans folks JK Rowling has been trying her best to oust from public life. It’s a product to sell to people who prioritise their nostalgia for children’s fantasy over the culture their trans friends and family live in.</p><p>Rowling is a miserable bigot who has routinely chosen to create a more dangerous world for trans people. She wields real influence, and has used it to set us back as far as possible, every single time.</p><p>To tie your well respected brand to such a visibly horrible individual is a just a shockingly poor decision on all fronts. There are other published Harry Potter games out there – but I can see many of them being made before – or whilst – Rowling gestated into the frightful transphobe she’s become. CGE’s attempt to have a bite of the apple has likely been created entirely within this era of blatant, all-out transphobia.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Pretty much! CGE have a long-standing relationship with Harry Potter, having already released one spinoff based on the series back in 2018, but that was then (when Harry Potter was a series about a wizard), and this is now, when the intervening years have turned the book's author into a poisonous husk of a person who<a href="https://www.advocate.com/news/jk-rowling-anti-trans-organization" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> spends their days trying to actively harm people, their efforts funded directly by licensing deals like this one</a>.</p><p>In response to the backlash, CGE published a statement, which reads:</p><blockquote><p>When we embarked on creating the newly announced version of Codenames many years ago, it was a dream coming true for many of us at CGE. The vast world of magic featured in the upcoming Codenames has been a source of inspiration. It ignited a passion for learning English and exploring new worlds through reading. It shaped our childhoods, sparked imagination, or gave comfort in difficult times. We know many people around the world share the same sentiment about this universe, even among those who have been hurt by the public views and actions of its creator. Deciding whether those feelings should also transfer to the once-beloved world is up to everyone, and we fully respect and understand those who do not wish to engage with this game. We still believe in the magic of stories and the connection they create between people.</p><p>As this is an ongoing conversation, we encourage everyone to approach discussion with care, empathy, and respect—both online and in person.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>This worthless statement, which doesn’t actually explain anything, wasn't just instantly criticised (again) on social media, but also drew a rebuke from the Tabletop Game Designers Association, who issued their own statement on the drama,<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ttgda.bsky.social/post/3lv2ytlkhfk2o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> saying</a>:</p><blockquote><p>The leadership of the Tabletop Game Designers Association was disappointed to see the publisher CGE touting Codenames: Back to Hogwarts, a new Harry Potter-themed version of Codenames.</p><p>Author J.K. Rowling’s extreme anti-trans rhetoric has caused physical and emotional harm to a particularly vulnerable group, and the licensing fees she receives from the game will be used to support these attacks.</p><p>CGE released a statement about the controversy around their decision, but it fell far short of anything meaningful.</p><p>TTGDA is dedicated to fostering diversity in designers and diversity in viewpoints. However we do not accept intolerance and demonization of a specific group as an acceptable viewpoint.</p><p>This is particularly true as antitrans rhetoric and action has been increasing in many countries around the world, including the United Kingdom and United States.</p><p>We urge CGE to reconsider their plans to release Codenames: Back to Hogwarts, or at least dedicate a portion of the proceeds to organizations such as The Trevor Project to offset licensing fees that flow back to Rowling.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Not sure I agree with that last point from the TGDA, as I don't think there's a place for offsetting the direct funding of Rowling’s efforts. Maybe <em>Codenames </em>fans could instead take the money they would have spent on this and spend it on...literally anything else?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Releasing on October 3.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Borderlands 4 has been <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-where-to-buy">available to preorder since June</a>, but only for PS5, Xbox, and PC gamers. We knew that the new game would be coming to the Switch 2, but it wasn't until recently that we <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-will-launch-on-nintendo-switch-2-on-october-3">finally got a release date</a>. The Switch 2 version of Borderlands 4 is set to arrive on October 3, almost a full month after its console and PC release. And as of today, you can now preorder your copy for $70.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Preorder Borderlands 4 for Nintendo Switch 2</h2><div catalogid="48ada6cd-ff27-4739-b7b0-2cf5e7d895e0" id="226235"><div id="226235" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Borderlands 4 - Nintendo Switch 2</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As of right now, it looks like the standard edition of Borderlands 4 is the only version available to preorder on Amazon and GameStop. Both the console and PC currently have Super Deluxe Editions available for preorder that include additional content and fancy packaging. It's unclear at this time if the Switch 2 will get a physical release of the Super Deluxe Edition as well, but we'll update this page with any new information as soon as we have it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That being said, the Super Deluxe edition <em>is</em> available to preorder <a href="https://zdcs.link/z62v5d?object_uuid=f0c6d5aa-6d28-4481-8280-ab58f5766e03&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">directly from the Nintendo eShop</a>. So if you want the benefits of that version without the actual physical copy of the game, that's one way to do it.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Preorder Bonuses</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Although this is the standard edition of the game, preordering does come with a few bonuses when you buy from Amazon. Alongside the base game, you'll also get the Gilded Glory Pack. This features a Vault Hunter skin, a weapon skin, and an Echo-4 drone skin. You can see more <a href="https://newsroom.2k.com/resources/borderlands-4-gilded-glory-pack" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">details about the pack from the 2K website</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What Is Amazon's Preorder Price Guarantee?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you've never actually preordered anything from Amazon before, it's worth noting that if you purchase this art book ahead of the release date, it includes Amazon's preorder price guarantee. According to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=G4BRP7LCB9DSDNCR" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon's own help page</a>, this means that if the price decreases between now and when the item ships, you'll pay the lowest price. So in this case, if any of these editions of the game get a discount before they actually start shipping then you'll pay whatever it dropped to rather than the full price.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although not every preorder gets discounted, physical editions of games especially seem to rarely drop in price compared to other product categories before they actually release. That is especially true for popular Nintendo Switch games, which rarely receive discounts of any kind even after release.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jul 31, 2025 8:13 pm</p></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-for-the-nintendo-switch-2-is-now-up-for-preorder-on-amazon]]></content:encoded>

<p>Additionally, Battlefield 6 will have "visual performance enhancements" that will be exclusive to the PS5 Pro version, though it's currently unclear what these enhancements will entail.</p><p>This spot of news is hardly surprising. The Battlefield franchise has a long history for pushing visual fidelity, and have often been touted as top-of-the-line games for benchmark testing, especially given the series' penchant for photo-realistic graphics and simulated destruction of environments.</p><p>Elsewhere on the FAQ page, EA states there is "currently no dedicated support for Steam Deck for Battlefield 6." This doesn't necessarily rule out that it would ever switch gears in order to make it happen, but in the meantime, I wouldn't get my hopes up about playing the upcoming game on on Valve's handheld in the near future.</p><p>Battlefield 6 will be released on October 10 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. There will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-release-date-time/1100-6533515/" data-ref-id="1100-6533515">open betas</a> for the game throughout the month of August leading up to its launch this fall.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Considering we’re living through a period where it feels like every other game is a remake, remaster, or throwback of some sort, perhaps I should be less surprised that Battlefield 6 feels a lot like Battlefields 3 and 4. They were, of course, the glory years for EA and DICE’s large-scale multiplayer shooter – excellent maps, engaging objective-based modes, spectacular destruction, and the all-important class system. It seems like Battlefield 6 replicates all of that, at least as far as I can tell after having played two hours and change of the new, contemporary-set FPS across a number of maps and modes. That is a good thing, of course, especially since recent Battlefield history has been a bit of a rocky ride. But is this resurrection of past glories actually <em>exciting</em>? In the moment, absolutely. But on a grander scale? That’s a more difficult question. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those exciting moments are often the result of the well-defined class system, which returns in a comfortingly familiar guise following Battlefield 2042’s missteps with its hero shooter-like Specialists. The Assault class can use their grenade launcher to breach through walls and then turn the startled soldiers who once huddled behind it into swiss cheese. The Engineer is the vital cog in a tank battle, using their acetylene torch to repair friendly armour and keep the cannon fire rolling, even as an entire building collapses around them. The Support is the squad’s literal lifeline, diving onto the objective with bags of spare ammo and soldier-reviving defibrillators at the ready. And finally there’s the Recon, the tactitician who marks enemies for all to see before scoring a hattrick of headshots with a sniper rifle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s nothing revolutionary about these classes, but they are much clearer in their parameters than they have been in the past. You won’t find the team’s dedicated infantry killer fulfilling anti-tank or medic duties, for instance, as the Assault has been forced to do in the likes of Battlefields 4 and 5. But as clean and traditional as these roles are, there is a minor shake-up. Like Battlefield 2042, any class can use any weapon, but now each role has a “signature” specialism designed to encourage you into the specific loadouts of yesteryear. For example, the Recon is able to hold their breath while aiming sniper rifles, making them the clear choice for long-range engagements, while the Engineer benefits from improved hip-fire control when using SMGs. As someone who would score a low-end grade in a sniper exam, this means I can play Recon while swinging around an assault rifle or LMG, which fully opens up the class roster. But I can’t help but wonder why I should brute-force my way into playing Recon when I could find my specialism elsewhere. Isn’t that what class play is all about? </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The odd, freeform elements of 2042’s weapon system saw their fair share of criticism, and I agree that tighter restrictions would have been of benefit both there and here in Battlefield 6, especially since there’s real strength in the design of the prescribed specialist gadgets for each class. The Support’s deployable cover is a solid example – it’s great for hiding behind while resurrecting fallen squaddies, provides a safe space for allies to restock on the ammunition bags you can drop, and acts as a surface to mount the LMG that the class specialises in. In short, the components of each kit can harmonise wonderfully, and I think the interesting choice is finding which class kit provides the best melody for your playstyle, rather than adjusting the individual notes within that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ultimately the weapons system is a small wrinkle in a very familiar package, and that applies to basically all the new ideas present in Battlefield 6’s demo. A new movement system (ridiculously dubbed the “Kinesthetic Combat System”) promises smoother leaning around corners, bracing against cover to reduce recoil, combat rolls as you land from high jumps, and several other improvements, but I can’t say I found these valuable additions – especially the contextual lean, which rarely seemed to activate. Like the omnidirectional movement in last year’s Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, I wonder how much genuine impact this will have on the experience of regular players. The one addition that I do love is the ability to grab a fallen soldier by the scruff of their neck and drag them to safety before reviving them. It’s a useful ability that everyone has access to (which admittedly does infringe on the Support’s duties, but it’s far from the instant revive of the defibrillator.) More importantly, it’s something that creates a “moment” – there’s few things more heroic than dragging a buddy to cover while machine gun fire kicks up dust around you. If all the small additions add up to something that feels as good as that, then maybe Battlefield 6 will develop a more distinct character in time. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This is a series that needed to find secure footing after a couple of wobbly outings, and it certainly feels like this new iteration is standing on reinforced concrete. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But what about the battlefields themselves? The series has always had to find its own formula when it comes to level geography, simply because the classic three-lane design doesn’t work for 64-player chaos. Thankfully that rule still applies, which means Battlefield still feels unlike any other shooter out there. The flagship Conquest maps retain that almost open-world feel – much more expansive than Call of Duty arenas, with an eye for real-world authenticity. City streets feel like genuine (albeit thankfully evacuated) population centres, and buildings are realistically laid-out with coherent stairwells and floorplans. The designer’s hand <em>can </em>be felt when you realise that there are maps nested within maps, but they leave a good impression. The broad edges of Empire State replicates the wide, tank-friendly streets of New York City, but push further into the centre and there’s rabbit warren-like alleys and a large concrete multi-storey building that’s perfect for claustrophobic, close-quarters fighting. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">One or two matches simply isn’t enough time to understand the nuances of a map, and so I can’t say where exactly the few on offer would rank among the all-time greats. But Liberation Peak, set along the slopes of the Pamir Mountains in Tajikistan, provides the ideal amount of wide, rocky terrain for land vs air battles alongside pocketed military bases that give birth to desperate infantry fights, while Siege of Cairo has the dense street networks ideal for luring tanks into RPG ambushes. With no demolition centrepieces there’s nothing that instantly becomes a map’s signature element, but I hope that continued play will reveal carefully-placed details in each street, room, and capture point. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Talking of demolition, Battlefield’s trademark chaos remains very much in-tact. It is somewhat restrained in comparison to the map-shifting “levolution” system that powered Battlefield 6’s most obvious touchstones, but the alternative is much more useful in the minute-to-minute play. Entire building facades crumble away under cannon fire, opening up buildings like sardine cans to reveal the fleshy fiends hiding within. You can breach floors, allowing for Rainbow Six Siege-like downward assaults… or simply blow the support from beneath a pesky sniper. This late into Battlefield’s lifespan it’s hard to be truly excited about all this – this is the series’ schtick and likely always will be now – but it’s nonetheless impressive. As much as it is a technical feat to be boasted about alongside the most photo-realistic graphics in the series’ lifetime, it’s also a foundational tool that makes Battlefield its own distinct beast.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If it seems odd that we’ve reached this far into the preview without mentioning the multiplayer modes – you know, the things you actually <em>play </em>– then it’s only because they almost blend into the background among the explosions and squad roles. The hands-on session provided matches of Conquest, Breakthrough, and Squad Deathmatch, and they’re exactly as Battlefield tradition dictates. Personal preference naturally applies, but at least from my perspective it’s the classic story of the objective-focussed modes reigning supreme and the smaller-scale, kill-everything-in-sight games still feeling like a square peg in Battlefield’s round hole. It’s not that they’re a bad time, it’s just that the “Battlefield Moments” EA likes to shout about seem to only happen when you’re desperately holding down Point C during a close game of Conquest, or pushing tooth-and-nail through the fiercest defence in Breakthrough. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As part of what seems like a project attempting to recapture the glory days of Battlefields 3 and 4, I don’t hold any grudge against these modes feeling like business as usual. This is a series that needed to find secure footing after a couple of wobbly outings, and it certainly feels like this new iteration is standing on reinforced concrete. But I can’t help but feel that those old, faithful objectives could have been freshened up a little, perhaps with unconventional capture point designs or equipment used specifically for objectives. Perhaps new thrills lie in the new Escalation mode, which was unavailable to sample at my hands-on demo, although considering the official description provided to press claims that it “sees two teams fight to capture strategic control points,” I’m not expecting it to add too much extra fizz to the established formula. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">When <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-suffers-significant-leaks-ahead-of-official-multiplayer-reveal">Battlefield 6’s open betas go live across a couple of weekends in August</a>, I expect there will be a lot of fans who will be relieved to find a package that largely seems focussed on returning Battlefield to its peak years. And I can’t deny that the modern combat aesthetic, equipment, and classes speak to me in a way that the series’ near-future and pseudo-historical guns never could. I had a good time. More than a decade after Battlefields 3 and 4, though, it doesn’t fill me with the same sense of adrenaline it once did. But nostalgia’s still a hell of a drug, and maybe that’s just what the medic ordered.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Do you have any questions about Battlefield 6?
