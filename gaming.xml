              <p>Another dang Monday!? Didn’t we do this already? Fine, whatever, let’s go again. Welcome to Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily round-up of news and other stuff you might care about. Today, we have news about the next <em>Wolfenstein</em> game, information on how Nintendo develops new ideas, a trailer for the next <em>Knives Out</em> film, and bad news for people planning to play <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> on Switch.</p> <h2><strong>Your city’s size in <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> depends on what platform you play on</strong></h2> <p>In December, Square Enix’s<em> Octopath Traveler 0</em> will launch and, in addition to questing through dungeons and slaying monsters, players will be building a new town in this upcoming RPG. But how big your in-game town can be will not be dependent on your skill or determination. As recently revealed by Square Enix and <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1963999156030296316">spotted by Wario64</a>, the maximum size of your city will depend on what platform you play <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> on, with weaker consoles being more limited than PC and newer machines.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Octopath Traveler 0 platform specs <a href="https://t.co/2jhpK7osy6">pic.twitter.com/2jhpK7osy6</a></p> <p>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1963999156030296316?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 5, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The OG Switch has a 250 building limit. Meanwhile, the Switch 2 and PS4 max out at 400 buildings. Finally, if you want 500 buildings (and who doesn’t?), you’ll need to play the RPG on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, or PC.&nbsp; As you might expect, where you play decides your max FPS and resolution, too, which are also included in the chart above. Lots to think about for <em>Octopath</em> fans ahead of the game’s December 4 release date.</p>

 <h2><strong>MachineGames hopes to make a third <em>Wolfenstein</em> game</strong></h2> <p>While <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> was a fantastic video game and one of the best Indy adventures yet, it wasn’t what I wanted from developer MachineGames. What I wanted was a new <em>Wolfenstein</em> game. It felt like there was at least one more story to be told with the studio’s version of BJ, and it turns out that’s in fact the case.</p> <p><a href="https://youtu.be/E189QG28rnE?t=2440">In <em>NoClip’s</em> newly released documentary</a> about the history of MachineGames and the making of its <em>Wolfenstein</em> series, co-founder and studio head Jerk Gustafsson confirmed that the plan from day one was always to make a trilogy. And that’s still the plan, assuming the studio gets a chance to make one more <em>Wolfenstein</em> game.</p>

 <p>“I think this is important to say, because we have always seen this as a trilogy. So that journey for BJ – even during those first weeks at id, when we mapped out <em>New Order</em> – we still had a plan for at least that character. What will happen in the second one. What will happen in the third one. I think that’s important to say because, at least I hope, that we’re not done with <em>Wolfenstein</em> yet. We have a story to tell.”</p> <h2><strong>Nintendo doesn’t need new franchises</strong></h2> <p>Former Nintendo developer and programmer Ken Watanabe <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-09-05/nintendo-invents-new-ways-to-have-fun-with-old-characters">told <em>Bloomberg</em></a> that the company doesn’t really have a need to create new franchises, as it can simply incorporate new mechanics and ideas into one of its existing and already established IP.</p> <p data-cy="paragraph">“New franchises haven’t come out simply because there’s no real need to make them,” Watanabe told the outlet. “When Nintendo wants to do something new, it’s basically about the gameplay mechanics first — about creating a new way to play. As for the skin or the wrapper, they don’t really fuss over it. They just pick whatever fits that new gameplay best.”</p> <h2><em>Schedule 1</em> will add shrooms, which apparently weren’t in the game before</h2> <p><em>Schedule 1,</em> the super-popular drug-dealing simulator on Steam, recently asked players what they wanted added to the game next, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3164500/Schedule_I/">the fanbase voted for shrooms</a>. Which is fine, but also weird to me. It’s not weird that people playing a game about drugs want more drug variety, but, weirdly, shrooms weren’t in <em>Schedule 1</em> to begin with. Anyway, shrooms will be added around November as a free update. Meanwhile, fishing fans, you lost out, and that feature won’t be added to the game in the near future. Sorry.</p>  <h2>ICMYI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/new-tron-3-ad-features-mr-beast-tron-ares-disney-2000623530">New <em>Tron: Ares</em> ad features Mr. Beast</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/no-mans-sky-the-office-base-building-settlement-nbc-2000623462">Someone recreated The Office in <em>No Man’s Sky</em></a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-pass-pete-hines-bethesda-starfield-indiana-jones-2000623467">Ex-Bethesda has some thoughts about Game Pass</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2>

However, some players have already quit the game after one too many deaths due to Silksong's difficulty (via <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1nb6u1r/my_wife_has_been_waiting_for_years_for_silksong/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a>), with some claiming that it's even harder than the first game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last week we were <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/official-spider-man-secret-lair-swings-by-providing-six-sensational-drops" rel="nofollow">treated to news</a> that the next Secret Lair would be <em>Spider-Man</em> themed and we got to check out the<em> Daily Bugle Breaking News</em> drop. At the time, we were teased with six total drops coming but just shown the one. Now we can reveal them all. They all release September 22nd.</p>

<p>Heroes and villains are at the core of any superhero story, and that is exactly where these drops take us. First, let's take a look at some heroes.</p>

<h2>Secret Lair x Marvel's Spider-Man: Heroic Deeds</h2>

<p>A big theme with the overall set of <em>Spider-Man</em>, the art in this drop absolutely pops. All of the artists have backgrounds working as artists for Marvel, like Todd Nauck, Elena Casagrtande, Lucas Wernack, and Swayart.</p>

<p>Here's the list of cards in <em>Heroic Deeds</em>:</p>

<ul><li>Command Tower</li>
	<li>Ephemerate</li>
	<li>Lightning Greaves</li>
	<li>Sol Ring</li>
	<li>Three Visits</li>
</ul><p>All of these should be familiar and are classic cards that see a lot of play. Now they just get the <em>Spider-Man</em> hero treatment.</p>

<p>The non-foil version is $29.99 and the rainbow foil is $39.99.</p>

<h2>Secret Lair x Marvel's Spider-Man: Villainous Plots</h2>

<p>You may see some of the same cards here as in <em>Heroic Deeds</em>, as this drop is meant to complement the <em>Heroic Deeds</em> drop. They both share Command Tower, Lightning Greaves, and Sol Ring. There's a couple of new ones though, and all feature classic <em>Spider-Man</em> villains.</p>

<p>As before, they all feature art from Marvel artists like Todd Nauck, Terry Dodson, Roberta Ingranata, and Kael Ngu.</p>

<p>Here is a list of the cards in <em>Villainous Plots</em>:</p>

<ul><li>Command Tower</li>
	<li>Deadly Dispute</li>
	<li>Go for the Throat</li>
	<li>Lightning Greaves</li>
	<li>Sol Ring</li>
</ul><p>As mentioned, three we've seen before with two new classic cards.</p>

<p>The non-foil version is $29.99 and the rainbow foil is $39.99.</p>

<h2>Secret Lair x Marvel's Spider-Man: Venom Unleashed (Colors)</h2>

<p>You were probably thinking, how the heck was Venom not with the villain drop? Well, Venom is such a big and popular villain that he will feature in not just this drop, but the final three.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This drop features art from Mark Bagley, the artist behind one of the most popular runs of <em>Spider-Man</em> of all time, <em>Ultimate Spider-Man</em>. Obviously, he's no stranger to Spider-Man or Venom, and may just be the perfect choice for this drop.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here is a list of the cards in <em>Venom Unleashed (Colors)</em>:</p>

<ul><li>Damnation</li>
	<li>Dark Ritual</li>
	<li>Peer Into the Abyss</li>
	<li>Surgical Extraction</li>
	<li>Tendrils of Agony</li>
</ul><p>This list of cards include some of the most iconic black cards of all-time with some of the coolest art they've ever been in as well.</p>

<p>The non-foil version is $29.99 and the rainbow foil is $39.99.</p>

<h2>Secret Lair x Marvel's Spider-Man: Venom Unleashed (Inks)</h2>

<p>This drop features the exact same cards and art as the previous drop but is just the inks, not colored in. Here you can see the crisp linework of Mark Bagley before the colors are added.</p>

<p>As a reminder, the cards for <em>Venom Unleashed (Inks)</em>:</p>

<ul><li>Damnation</li>
	<li>Dark Ritual</li>
	<li>Peer Into the Abyss</li>
	<li>Surgical Extraction</li>
	<li>Tendrils of Agony</li>
</ul><p>The non-foil version is $29.99 and the rainbow foil is $39.99.</p>

<h2>Secret Lair x Marvel's Spider-Man: Mana Symbiote</h2>

<p>Finally, Venom has taken over some basic lands that feature mana symbol for the various lands.</p>

<p>Now, these cards I have seen and held in-person. The photos above do not do them justice. When we were shown them, the Secret Lair team mentioned the treatments on these cards are some of the most complicated they've done to create a unique effect. Parts of the card are raised black symbiote tendrils are shiny, popping out amazingly. They are extremely visually striking.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here is what you get in<em> Mana Symbiote:</em></p>

<ul><li>2x Forest</li>
	<li>2x Island</li>
	<li>2x Mountain</li>
	<li>2x Plains</li>
	<li>2x Swamp</li>
</ul><p>The set includes two of each basic land. They are only available in the raised foil version and cost $59.99.</p>

<hr><p>With that, those are all of the drops for the Spider-Man Secret Lair. Will you be trying to pick any of them up?</p>

        <p>Bethesda are looking forward "to the adventures yet to come", but I'll need more convincing to tag along</p>

            <p>Steam tells me I've spent 171 hours of my life to this point playing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/starfield">Starfield</a>. It's not an insignificant amount of time, but it pales in comparison to how long I've spent with the myriad other works of developers Bethesda. Said devs now look like they might have fired up the tease rocket for the space <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>'s second major expansion. If they have, the very little they've shown off so far hasn't gotten me right on board to play more.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Almost a year since Starfield's first DLC, Shattered Space, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/starfield-shattered-space-looks-like-a-wise-return-to-bethesda-basics">unleashed its spooky gunk</a>, Bethesda commemorated the second anniversary of the game's release by tweeting the short video below.</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>Yep, the piss filter of teaseage was whipped out, with fans rearranging the frames in such fashion that they read "Terran Armada". Naturally, the conclusion jumped to by plenty of folks is that this could be the name of the second expansion the developers have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/starfield-will-get-at-least-one-more-expansion-after-shattered-space-todd-howard-says">had set in stone for a while</a>, but haven't said anything about beyond that.</p>
<p>The name suggests a fleet of ships from or somehow related to Earth, and if that's the case, my feelings are best summed up by a straight-faced shrug. As much as judging a Bethesda DLC by the name's pretty pointless, in the absence of any other info, the idea of an expansion focused around Earthly matters doesn't get me too excited.</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="740"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/1n99blb/dlc2_is_titled_terran_armada/">DLC2 is titled "Terran Armada".</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Sklain/">u/Sklain</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/">Starfield</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>Let me outline why. With its relative lack of aliens outside of hostile planet-dwelling creatures, a fairly dry and scientific NASA-inspired brand of sci-fi, and the fate of Earth being a key thread in its main plot, Starfield feels to me like it's done plenty of Earthy stuff already. It's even done the idea of a ship full of folks from Earth randomly popping up to beef with the residents of the Settled Systems. Remember visiting Paradiso on Porrima II, then serving as the middleperson between the resort and the Earth Colony Ship Constant, the latter of which had somehow managed to roam through space encountering nobody else for about 200 years?</p><p>I do, and it was perfectly meh. That's not to say a DLC couldn't put a twist on a tale like that or find another, intriguing way to revamp the relatively featureless sand-ball that was Starfield's ruined Earth. However, as I outlined when I <a href="https://www.vg247.com/starfield-shattered-space-review">reviewed the Shattered Space expansion</a> at my former home, my view's long been that the best way Bethesda can utilise Starfield DLC is to paint a bit more colour and vibrance onto the canvas of an impressively vast but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/starfields-abandoned-gore-and-dismemberment-system-sure-would-have-made-it-less-grey">often quite bland</a> universe.</p>
<p>On the one hand, that first DLC was about snake worshippers on a purple planet, so you can argue that for variety's sake trying to go the weird and alien route again wouldn't be ideal. Though, I reckon at this point you might as well embrace the out-there ideas. No one DLC's going to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bethesda-are-individually-rebutting-starfield-steam-reviewers-defending-the-loading-breaks-and-empty-worlds">rehabilitate Starfield's reputation</a> from would-be masterpiece that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/starfield-review">didn't measure up to the endless hype</a>, to universally beloved sibling of the Elder Scrolls and Fallout juggernauts. </p>
<p>A sequel would have that chance, though, assuming it arrived before the actual heat-death of our universe. So, why not go after the strange and unique, as those other Bethesda-helmed series I've just cited have in some of their strongest and most memorable moments, both in the publisher's hands and outside of them? Even if the game ends up being a one-off, have it go out with one or a series of supernova explosions, rather than the cosmic whimper of an aging comet.</p>
<p>We'll just have to see which of those "Terran Armada" ends up being, assuming it's a DLC tease and not just Todd Howard's lunch order.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/one-of-amazons-best-selling-portable-monitors-just-broke-its-record-low-again-now-almost-free-2000623543</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/one-of-amazon%E2%80%99s-best-selling-portable-monitors-just-broke-its-record-low-again-now-almost-free.1291611/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s almost a given that as tech devices advance and evolve, they shrink in size. If you’re of a certain age that you once owned one of those massive cathode ray tube monitors, the idea of an affordable portable monitor with a great picture would have been laughable not that long ago. Now, however, ultra-thin FHD screens that fit easily in a backpack or carry-on bag are commonplace, and one of the top-selling models just keeps tumbling in price at Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3959/">The MNN 15.6-inch FHD portable monitor, which sells over 10,000 units per month at Amazon, is now just $60</a> — a 33% drop from its usual $90, and a spectacular deal for commuters, remote workers, parents, or anyone looking to escape the single-screen setup once and for all.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3959/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Mega-Compatibility</h2>
<p>What makes this $60 portable monitor such a steal isn’t its portability as much as the fact that it’s nearly universally compatible with any device you can think of. The MNN Portable Monitor has USB-C and HDMI ports, and works with PC and Mac laptops and desktops, smartphones and tablets, Xbox and PlayStation gaming consoles, Raspberry Pi, and even the Nintendo Switch and Steam Deck handheld consoles.</p>
<p>Devices with a full-function USB-C port and Thunderbolt 3 or 3.1 compatibility can connect directly to the MNN monitor with a single cable, and ones lacking a full-function USB-XC port can also connect with a USB-A cable and HDMI cable. Best of all, the MNN Portable Monitor is powered by the device you attach it to, provided it’s a full-function USB-C port. Otherwise it can connect via an external DC 5V, 3A/9V, 2A, or PD 5-20V power adapter.</p>



<h2>Quality To Go</h2>
<p>All that compatibility wouldn’t be worth a lot of the picture was lousy, but this is a brilliant 15.6-inch HDR screen with a 1000:1 contrast ratio, low blue light, 16.7 million colors, and it works in both portrait and landscape modes. The 5ms response time makes it a viable screen for gaming consoles, which makes gaming on the go a reality.</p>
<p>The portability factor is obvious — the MNN portable monitor is barely a third of an inch thick, protected by a durable faux-leather cover that also doubles as a stand, and weighs a shockingly light 1.52 pounds. It’s designed for an easy fit in a backpack, briefcase, or any go-bag you take on the road. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3959/">The limited-time price of just $60 at Amazon is the lowest yet for the MNN 15.6-inch Portable FHD Monitor, and it’s safe to say it’s worth every penny.</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/atari-handheld-gamestation-go-preorder-game-list-2000624033</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-atari-handheld-looks-great-but-costs-almost-as-much-as-a-switch-lite.1291608/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Do we need an Atari gaming handheld in 2025? Definitely not. Do I still really want the Atari Gamestation Go? Absolutely. The retro portable strikes a great balance between ostentatious and sleek, retro and modern. But while the latest Atari machine is full of games from the ’80s, it packs a contemporary price tag of $180.</p> <p>Produced by the folks at My Arcade, the Atari Gamestation Go was first revealed at CES 2025 near the start of the year. It packs a 7-inch high resolution full-color display, a rechargeable battery for 4-5 hours of playtime, and over 200 classics from Atari’s past. Pre-orders went live today at Best Buy and GameStop, with the device shipping sometime in October. Here’s a sample of the game list:</p> <ul> <li><i>Asteroids: Recharged</i></li> <li><i>Missile Command: Recharged</i></li> <li><i>Centipede: Recharged</i></li> <li><i>Breakout: Recharged</i></li> <li><i>Berzerk: Recharged</i></li> <li><i>Balls of Steel Pinball</i></li> <li><i>PAC-MAN</i></li> <li><i>Breakout</i></li> <li><i>Tempest</i></li> <li><i>Warlords</i></li> </ul> <p>The coolest features by far are the integrated paddle, trak-ball and number pad. Not only do they look really cool with the yellow, tan, orange, and black colorway, they’re also functional for deep-cuts like <em>Codebreakers</em> and <em data-processed="true">Missile Command</em>. Assuming the emulation is decent, the buttons feel good, and the device isn’t uncomfortable to hold, it could end up being one of the best ways to play one of gaming’s often overlooked but historically significant back catalogs.</p>

 <p>The fact that the Atari Gamestation Go&nbsp;<em>only</em> plays old Atari games is probably for the best. What better way to put down the smartphone and purge the algorithmic slop-scrolling than by locking into twitchy pattern recognition with OG shoot ’em up <em>Space Invaders</em>? But $180 is nothing to sneeze at. The Switch Lite might officially be $230 but it launched at $200 and can now often be found secondhand for just $100.</p> <p>Retro consoles are cashing in on nostalgia more than anything, but the Atari Gamestation Go is still coming in pretty steep. The NES and SNES Classic came in at $60 and $80 respectively when Nintendo launched them years back. The PlayStation Classic was still only $100. North of that and thoughts of childhood <em>Pitfall</em> sessions brush up again the harsh realities of the current family budget. At least the Atari Gamestation Go doubles as a visual showpiece and a portable time machine.</p>

                <p>Like its predecessor, Ghost of Tsushima, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ghost-of-yotei/">Ghost of Yotei</a> is shaping up to make a strong case for digital tourism. A new video released by Sony shows off several scenic locales from the upcoming game, and best of all, you don't have to worry about any bandits or ronin interrupting your tour of Ezo while listening to an extended version of "The North" from composer Toma Otowa's soundtrack for the game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj6i1eCfIgA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kj6i1eCfIgA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Ghost of Yotei officially launches on October 2 for PS5, and as that date draws closer, Sony and developer Sucker Punch Productions have shared more details on it.

"But you see something out of the corner of your eye that catches your curiosity. And you say, 'you know what? I'm going to go check that out.' That moment where the game's not telling you really about where to go or what to do. It's you.

<p>Despite a small dip in players, which we can attribute to it being a Monday, Silksong is still holding strong. As of writing, the metroidvania has over 459,177 players in-game. What's more, the game is currently sitting at number 4 for most-played games on Steam, beating out the likes of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/rust-review-life-is-fleeting/1900-6416858/" data-ref-id="1900-6416858">Rust</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/path-of-exile-2/">Path of Exile 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/helldivers-2-review-starship-bloopers/1900-6418184/" data-ref-id="1900-6418184">Helldivers 2</a>, and following behind<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/playerunknowns-battlegrounds-review/1900-6416830/"> PUBG</a><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/playerunknowns-battlegrounds-review/1900-6416830/" data-ref-id="1900-6416830">: Battlegrounds</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dota-2-review/1900-6411615/" data-ref-id="1900-6411615">Dota 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/counter-strike-2/">Counter-Strike 2</a>.</p><p>It's worth noting that these numbers only apply to Steam, since there's no way for us to know how the game is performing on other platforms such as Game Pass.</p><p>Silksong is by far one of the most successful games of the year in terms of player count. It's so popular that those eager to get their hands on the game after seven long years had to wait just a little longer after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silksong-releases-immediately-crashes-steam-and-nintendo-eshop/1100-6534478/" data-ref-id="1100-6534478">the game's release crashed almost every storefront, including Steam, Nintendo eShop, PSN, Xbox, and Game Pass</a>.</p><p>If you're just getting started, here are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/hollow-knight-silksong-tips-beginners-guide/2900-6987/#8" data-ref-id="2900-6987">10 Hollow Knight: Silksong tips you need to know before you play</a>, which includes a beginner's guide on Hornet's healing ability, where to purchase maps, fast travel points, and acquiring new skills.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>This coming November 7, 2025, will mark the first anniversary of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-unboxing/">PS5 Pro's launch</a>, a console that, in a physical sense, marked the halfway point of the PlayStation 5 generation, and the deeper we get into the PS5's life cycle, the closer we get to PlayStation 6. While pretty much everything we've heard about the next generation of PlayStation is rumors and speculation, a new report from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-playstation-6-is-planned-to-have-a-detachable-disc-drive-on-launch/">Insider-Gaming</a> does make a good deal of sense, that the coming PS6 will launch with a detachable disc drive.</p>



<p>The reality of PlayStation consoles having <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-slim-drive-multiple-consoles/">a detachable disc drive is already here</a>, and has been the case since 2023, so it's not in the least surprising that Sony and PlayStation would look to make the next console generation compatible with its current manufacturing process, which, according to Insider-Gaming's report, is one of the reasons behind the decision. According to its sources, PlayStation will sell the PS6 the same way it currently sells the PS5.</p>



<p>You'll be able to buy a PlayStation 6 with a disc drive pre-attached and bundled in, or buy it without the disc drive, with the option to add it later if you wish, by buying the disc drive on its own.</p>



<p>Besides the manufacturing reasons, it's also been previously pointed out that <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-discless/">PlayStation isn't ready to release a digital-only console</a>. That said, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-handheld-specks-leaked-outperform-xbox-ally-x/">rumored handheld PlayStation</a> won't have a disc drive, and the fact that the drives are already an option shows how PlayStation is inching towards a digital-only future. At least for now, players who still care about buying physical discs still have that option.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/silksong-first-boss-bell-beast-guide-2000624015</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/don%E2%80%99t-let-hollow-knight-silksong%E2%80%98s-first-boss-stop-you-from-playing.1291560/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There are ways in which <a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-steam-review-bomb-chinese-translation-2000623496"><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em></a> can be a bit more difficult than its predecessor. For players new to the Metroidvania Soulslike series, it can feel a bit like taking a plunge in a cold lake: bracing but unpleasant. The game’s first boss fight is against the Bell Beast. If you’re feeling a bit daunted at first, the good news is that the giant arthropod is easy to defeat once you’ve got the pattern down.</p> <h2>Where do I find <em>Silksong</em>‘s first boss?</h2> <p>The Bell Beast is located early in the game in The Marrow. You can’t get to him until you unlock the Silk Spear ability next door in Mosshome. After getting it, there’s a silk obstacle in The Marrow you can cut through to unlock the way to the Bell Beast’s layer.</p>  <p>Glad you asked? While many <em>Silksong</em> players probably won’t have much trouble with this guy, this is a judgement-free zone with the sole goal of trying to help as many <em>Hollow Knight</em> players break through that first barrier and be able to continue their journey to the Citadel.</p>

 <p>The Bell Beast has two phases and four attacks. In the first phase he’ll just appear from underground and run across the screen or jump over your head. If he’s running across, you can jump over him and hit him 2-3 times from the back before he burrows back under. If he’s about to jump over you, just stand in the middle of the screen underneath the peak of the arc and hit him in the back again.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000624024" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624024"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624024">Team Cherry</figcaption></figure> <p>The second phase is where things get slightly trickier. First, he’ll come up from the ground and spawn two bells that roll across opposite sides of the screen. These are easy to enough to jump over and get a few hits in. Later, he’ll start shaking the whole cavern and have bells drop from the ceiling that bounce while he’s rotating through his other three attacks. Sometimes these bells bounce toward you. Sometimes they bounce away.</p>

 <p>If you stand close to where they drop, they’ll miss you completely no matter which direction they’re going. Plus they disappear before the second bounce. But watch out because during this phase he’ll also spawn bells each time he comes out of the ground.</p> <h2>He keeps killing me in three hits!</h2> <p>Brutal, right? Even though he’s <em>Silksong</em>‘s first boss, Bell Beast, like everything else in the game, hits pretty hard. That leaves little time to memorize his attack pattern and not much room for error once you do. The biggest general tip for the boss fight, like lots of encounters in <em>Silksong</em>, is just to stay calm. Don’t move around more than you have to and don’t overreact to flashy attacks.</p> <p>Imagine instead of a giant, harrowing roly-poly bug constantly trying to squash you, he’s just a rectangle-shaped hit box moving around the screen in very predictable ways. Save at a bench nearby, hit enough enemies to have a full roll of silk to bind with/heal yourself at the start of the fight, and then stick to dodging each of the four attacks as they come. You’ll get to the end of the fight thinking, “How is he still alive?” but then after a few more hits he’ll be liberated and become your new best friend.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-steam-review-bomb-chinese-translation-2000623496"><i><span>Hollow Knight: Silksong</span></i></a><span> is a tough game. Its bosses hit hard, your early arsenal of abilities can feel quite limiting in combat encounters, and its volatile level design can send you accidentally tumbling down into a chasm and losing an hour of progress. But while these kinds of challenges were arguably all to be expected from a sequel to the challenging original, there’s one brand of platforming segment whose sheer difficulty is catching players off guard, especially if they miss an optional upgrade early on in the game.</span></p> <p><span>Hornet, the needle-wielding hero of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-how-long-completionist-achievement-2000623157"><i><span>Silksong</span></i></a><span>, starts off the game with a downward diagonal aerial strike that is used as both an anti-air attack as well as a platforming tool in sections where she must basically bounce on pods to get some verticality and reach higher areas of the map, using her needle as a pogo stick. By default, this attack has a diagonal slant that makes it difficult to precisely strike these pods and position yourself in an optimal way to reach the next one. Though there’s an available, optional upgrade that can make traversing this section much easier, many players miss it,, and because getting through these sections without it is hard but not impossible to pull off, a lot of fans think these are simply mandatory skill checks for your timing and positioning, and are uploading clips of themselves trying, failing, and crashing out.</span></p>       <p><span>The thing is, these sections don’t have to be </span><i><span>as </span></i><span>hard as some folks have been making them out to be, but </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/silksong-demo-hands-on-price-hollow-knight-pax-west-2000621695"><i><span>Silksong</span></i><span>’s non-linear nature</span></a><span> means not everyone is finding the upgrade that makes them significantly easier. Crests are equippable items you’ll find throughout </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>that allow you to swap between different builds, and the Crest of the Wanderer swaps out Hornet’s diagonal air attack for a standard downward strike similar to the one the Knight can perform in the original </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span>, allowing you to more easily and precisely pogo your way through these sections. Getting them isn’t an easy task, however, as you’ll have to unlock a few areas, abilities, and items to do so. Here’s </span><i><span>IGN</span></i><span>’s</span> <span>rundown of how to find the Crest of the Wanderer:</span></p>  <p><span>Keep in mind that this will also cut down the range on Hornet’s attacks, so you’ll have to get in closer in combat. Switching out crests is all about give and take, so it’s up to you to decide which perks and drawbacks are worth it to you. But if you, like many others, are tired of falling into lava and spike pits while you’re trying to pogo on these pods, now you know there is a better way.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Digimon Story: Time Stranger – Our Thoughts After Playing 4 Hours]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/digimon-story-time-stranger-our-thoughts-after-playing-4-hours</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/digimon-story-time-stranger-%E2%80%93-our-thoughts-after-playing-4-hours.1291548/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Sometimes you sit down at a game with no idea what to expect. That was how I felt when I got my first hands-on time with Digimon Story: Time Stranger at Summer Game Fest. I’m a lapsed Digimon fan, someone who liked the franchise a lot as a kid and then just fell off as I got older. But when I played Time Stranger, I quickly realized I had to pay attention. This was a JRPG with some good ideas. So when I got the shot at an even longer preview (about four hours) at PAX West, I took it, because I wanted to see if that initial impression held water. And I’m happy to say that I think it does. Digimon Story: Time Stranger seems to get the Digimon series, but there’s also the foundation of a really good JRPG here, too. I mean the kind that you could spend a long time digging into. One that might be able to appeal to Digimon oldheads while creating new fans. If licensed games have a holy grail, it’s that. And Time Stranger might be able to find it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s get this out of the way before I go any farther: Digimon isn’t a &lt;ahem&gt; stranger to good licensed games. The last Digimon Story game, Cyber Sleuth, was pretty good, and Time Stranger is built on that foundation. After picking between a dude with anime hair and goggles and a woman with a very small hat, you step into the role of an ADAMAS agent. Whoever you don’t choose becomes your operator. You can call them Operator. Your job? Investigate anomalous phenomena in the city. Basically, you look into strange stuff that the public doesn’t even know about. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And man, there’s some strange stuff going on in this city. Things are shut down, and nobody can go anywhere. And what’s all this about being prepared for tremors? After taking my lady and her very small hat for a walk and chatting with some folks about what’s going down, I showed up at the Wall of Hope, which was built after there was an explosion in Nishi-Shinjuku eight years prior, which has been the site of many anomalies. After I snuck inside, I ran into my first Digimon, and it was time to choose my partner. I picked Gomamon – my other options were Patamon and DemiDevimon – and got to work clearing out the local Digimon.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Time Stranger is, at its core, a turn-based RPG.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Time Stranger is, at its core, a turn-based RPG, a DVD Menu Game’s DVD Menu Game (complimentary). That means your Digimon come in three types – Data, Virus, and Vaccine. Virus beats Data, Vaccine beats Virus, and Data beats Vaccine. But Digimon also have elemental strengths and weaknesses, too, so you have to pick the right moves and Digimon for the fight, and manage your turn order, which is shown on the right side of the screen. If you hit another Digimon with an attack, you’ll be able to check whether that Digimon was weak against it (or resisted it) in the future. You can also check on everything you’ve learned about a Digimon at any time. And if you land a pre-emptive strike from the field, you start combat with a massive advantage or sometimes win the fight outright before it starts.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The most interesting in-battle choice Time Stranger makes is allowing you to use items or switch your Digimon on the fly without having it take a turn. While this also makes it easier to get the right Digimon in position and use In Case of Emergency, Break Glass items when you need one, it also means enemies can be a little meaner to you, which is cool. And if you lose a Digimon, you can pull in a replacement from your reserve team. Once you run out, though, that’s it. The battles I played in my time with Time Stranger generally weren’t hard unless I was fighting something I clearly shouldn’t have been, but they were engaging.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you battle Digimon, you earn what’s called Scan Rate. Once it reaches 100%, you can convert that Digimon and make them a member of your team. Wait until you get to 200%, though, and you’ll get a stronger Digimon. It’s one of those “If you wait five minutes, you can have <em>two</em> marshmallows” things, but it’s an enticing incentive. In addition, you can also equip Digimon with Attachment Skills, providing access to moves they wouldn’t normally get. And of course, you can Digivolve (and De-Digivolve) your Digimon once you meet certain requirements. The coolest thing here, though, are personalities. Depending on how you interact with your Digimon, their personalities will change, which will change how their stats level. There’s quite a bit to it, but I like how much freedom to play around with it you have, and how easy it is to build the Digimon you want.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, it’s not all battles here. There is a story, and I was intrigued by Time Stranger’s plot. I met up with a girl that seemed to know my character, but who neither I nor my operator recognized; befriended some Digimon; got chased by a really large Digimon, and mostly tried to figure out what was going on. We know Time Stranger is a time-travel story, but I didn’t get to see that during my playtime. I did, however, get to jump ahead a bit, and that’s where I really got to play with Time Stranger’s systems.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It really made the world feel lived in, and like it existed outside of me, which is what you want in a game like this.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">After my jump, I found myself in the Digital World with a much higher level team. I was in a village of Digimon that had recently been attacked by a group called the Titans. I started off by helping Shellmon, the local healer, gather some materials to make medicine. Along the way, I found Digimon hanging out, listening to a concert, and just enjoying some time alone. It really made the world feel lived in, and like it existed outside of me, which is what you want in a game like this. After a jaunt around the village – where I discovered Digimon trading cards, something producer Ryosuke Hara told me was an homage to the original Digimon (if you know, you know) – only to discover Shellmon had been treating Divermon, who worked for the Titans and was wounded during the battle. After the village is attacked again, Divermon decides to try to get the Titans to stop. After all, anyone willing to help an enemy can’t be so bad.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Before I finished up that storyline, though, I took some time to explore what else there was to see. One of the coolest things was the In-Between Theater, a sort of pocket universe situated between the real world and the Digital World. Here, I could visit the Digifarm, where I could place Digimon on the farm to train them up, increase their Bond with me, or change their personality. There was a Digifarm in Cyber Sleuth, but the one in Time Stranger is much more customizable, allowing you to place more Digimon and customize the various tiles in the farm. Hara told me that they wanted a better Digifarm, but they also wanted it to be like an aquarium you could customize and where you could see your Digimon interact and mingle with one another. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That sense of “this thing is yours” also speaks to why your character isn’t voiced and why they aren’t assigned a partner Digimon, like many of the other members of the cast are. This is your story, and you’re meant to put yourself in the shoes of your agent rather than playing a character that comes pre-built for you. Makes sense, right? About this time I also discovered I could change my outfit. And man, much as I loved my girl’s tiny hat, it was nice to be able to have her rock a t-shirt.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After goofing off a bit, I found Shellmon’s friend Whalemon, who took me to the bottom of the sea to face off with the Titans. We tried diplomacy, for the record. It just didn’t work. So we threw down with Sharkmon and his boys. He was tough; I had to swap my team, use my items, and like every fight in my time with Time Stranger, I had a lot of fun going toe to toe (toe to fin?) with him; he just wasn’t a match for Aegiomon. Once he was little more than Sharkmon fin soup, my demo ended. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I was impressed by how fast my four-hour hands-on session went by, how every little thing in Time Stranger fit together, and how thoughtful so many of its quality of life choices were.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">When my time with Digimon Story: Time Stranger wrapped, I was exhausted. When you get up after a four-hour demo, you feel it, especially at an event like PAX. But I was also impressed by how fast the time went by, how every little thing in Time Stranger fit together, and how thoughtful so many of its quality of life choices were. If you get enough Scan Rate to Convert a new Digimon, you’re notified and you can jump to that menu with the press of a button. The same is true of when a Digimon completes its training on the Digifarm. You can even speed up the battles if you want to move things along. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Digimon Story: Time Stranger understands its genre, something Hara made clear to me when I sat down with him. A JRPG can’t just be about a great story and characters or a great battle system. It has to nail the little things, too, and that means investing in both quality of life choices that make life easier for the player while giving them enough depth to keep them interesting for the long haul.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Based on what I played at PAX, Digimon Story: Time Stranger is looking like it could pull that balancing act off. Like I said, I’m a lapsed Digimon fan, but if what I played is any indication, you kind of don’t have to be one to like what Time Stranger has to offer. You just have to want to play a cool JRPG with time travel in it. I’m still working out how that fits in here (we only got glimpses), but at this point, that just seems like a cherry on top of a beautiful cocktail. You’re here for the mixology, and Digimon Story: Time Stranger looks like a delicious concoction. Let’s hope the sips we’ve been provided are an accurate taste of the whole drink.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/digimon-story-time-stranger-our-thoughts-after-playing-4-hours]]></content:encoded>

The narrative adventure launched to a warm response and earned itself a loyal fan audience, prompting Divine to return for the game's 2019 sequel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But no mention was made of Divine or anyone else who worked on the original game in Amazon's announcement last week, which instead noted that the adaptation would be produced by Square Enix, the publisher and rights owner of the Life is Strange franchise, as well as LuckyChap, a film and TV production company co-founded by Margot Robbie, and Story Kitchen, a company that describes itself as one that "specializes in Franchise Farming™ — adapting video games and other 'non-traditional' IPs into film and TV."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, Amazon's Life is Strange TV series <a href="https://press.amazonmgmstudios.com/us/en/press-release/amazon-mgm-studios-orders-ilife-is-strangei-to-ser" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">press release</a> makes no mention of Don't Nod at all, despite discussing the studio's fan-favorite main characters Max and Chloe, and its beloved setting of Arcadia Bay. Instead, the release spends most of its time focused on the involvement of The End of the F***ing World's Charlie Covell as creator and showrunner.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Divine's comment seemingly confirms that Don't Nod is not involved in the adaptation at all, and the writer isn't the only former Life is Strange staff member to take note. "Seeing the game created by @DONTNOD_Michel, @RaoulBarbet, Jean-Luc Cano, and our @DONTNOD_Ent  team becoming a show is an incredible honor!"

(Despite being tagged, neither studio creative director Michel Koch or Life is Strange director Raoul Barbet have commented on the series' announcement so far.)</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Life is Strange Remastered Collection Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On the one hand, Don't Nod and publisher Square Enix parted ways rather publicly after the launch of Life is Strange 2, with the former team re-establishing itself as Don't Nod Montreal to work on the similar <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/lost-records-bloom-and-rage">Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</a>. Square Enix, which has always owned the Life is Strange IP, has meanwhile continued the franchise on with multiple games developed by Deck Nine Games, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-hidden-nazi-symbols-were-the-tip-of-a-toxic-iceberg-at-life-is-strange-developer-deck-nine">to mixed success</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But despite the original Life is Strange now being a decade old, and Don't Nod long having left the series' behind, many fans have commented on the lack of involvement or mention of the franchise's creators as odd, or discouraging.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When it comes to adapting narrative-based games, someone from the game developer should be there," Life is Strange fan mirracz wrote on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeisstrange/comments/1na24us/no_spoilers_the_writer_of_lis1_had_something_to/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a>, in a lengthy thread of opinions sparked by Divine's post. "If not as a writer, then at least as a consultant."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I agree with that principle," added another fan, EdenH333.

"Both are Amazon MGM Studios."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This series will piss off people regardless," concluded a fourth fan, alihou. "If there's one thing I've noticed with this fan base, they're quick to complain.

                <p dir="ltr">One of Digimon's biggest strengths has always been its ability to lean into nostalgia, and that's no different in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/digimon-story-time-stranger/" data-ref-id="5000-663007">Digimon Story: Time Stranger</a>, the seventh entry in the franchise's role-playing-focused gaming series. Like past Digimon Story games, Time Stranger puts a big emphasis on narrative, but this time around, it was the creature collecting and turn-based battles that made me want to keep playing long after my three-hour preview session ended.</p><p dir="ltr">Instead of children and teens, Time Stranger's protagonist is an adult secret agent investigating Digimon-related phenomena. I started my playthrough right from the beginning of the story, where we see the effects of the Digital World on real-world Earth. You can choose whether the protagonist is male or female, and the other one becomes a character in the story: your partner who communicates with you through a pocket-sized hologram. The intro sets the stage for the clash between two worlds with regular citizens talking about news of unexplained disasters and protestors even accusing authorities of withholding secrets.</p><p dir="ltr">But that's all just a backdrop for the meat of what I got to play. The Digimon Story sub-series gets its name from its narrative-driven core which is, typically, complemented by turn-based gameplay. "Battle balance" is one of the main areas that producer Ryosuke Hara focused on, similar to what he did when working on Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot. At 36 years old, he was part of the target audience for the series when Digimon Adventure launched in 1999.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4563382-en_beginningofthemainstory4.png" data-ref-id="1300-4563382" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4563382-en_beginningofthemainstory4.png" data-ref-id="1300-4563382"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4563382-en_beginningofthemainstory4.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">"So there's a few things that we wanted to improve on from the past installments of Digimon's Story, but one thing [in particular] was the battle balance,"he told me via a translator during my session. "I think in the past versions, people were relying on certain characters way more than their being balanced. So for this title, we wanted to really improve on the RPG battle aspect of the battles."</p><p dir="ltr">Time Stranger starts with introducing us to its main "type triangle," similar to the fire, water, grass triangle in Pokemon and axe, sword, and lance triangle in Fire Emblem. This works similarly to Digimon Story games before like Cybersleuth. While Digimon attacks could have secondary weaknesses behind elements, the main type behind a Digimon's classification heavily affects its strengths and weaknesses. To demonstrate this, Time Stranger gives you one of each type to choose from for your first Digimon: Patamon (Data), Gomamon (Vaccine), or Deviveemon (Virus).</p><p dir="ltr">I went with Patamon, since his partner in Digimon Adventure was one of my favorite characters growing up. Patamon was able to take on most of the enemies I saw within the first 30 minutes or so, but from there, I needed to rely on other Digimon like Koromon to take advantage of type weaknesses. With around 450 Digimon in the game, many of the ones older fans will remember from the shows and games are represented.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4563383-en_beginningofthemainstory3.png" data-ref-id="1300-4563383" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4563383-en_beginningofthemainstory3.png" data-ref-id="1300-4563383"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4563383-en_beginningofthemainstory3.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">In just the first two hours, I recognized almost every Digimon from the random digital monsters seen only a few times in Digimon Adventure to the popular mascot characters like Agumon. One of the biggest targets for Time Stranger are older fans who watched Digimon Adventure, but it’s a completely new story, so you don’t need to know anything about past shows and games to play it.</p><p dir="ltr">When asked about what made Digimon different from other monster-taming series, Hara pointed to its evolution system. "Digimon's evolution system is not the same as other people's," he said. "If you were to take Agumon as an example, Agumon digivolves into multiple different forms. And then from there, again, multiple different forms. If we were to compare one player to another player, how they evolve their Digimon is going to be very different from another player."</p><p dir="ltr">That ties into the best part of Time Stranger: collecting Digimon. Digivolutions don't work like their Pokemon equivalent, where each Pokemon has set evolutions that don't change and rarely branch. Bulbasaur will only become Ivysaur, and even though Pokemon like Gloom can evolve into Vileplume or Bellossom, most Pokemon follow a singular line of evolution. In Digimon, a "baby" Digimon like Koromon can digivolve into Agumon, Guilmon, Dracomon, and others. You don't get to see which evolutions a Digimon has until they digivolve and you see how your treatment of the digital monster affected them.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4563384-en_beginningofthemainstory1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4563384" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4563384-en_beginningofthemainstory1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4563384"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4563384-en_beginningofthemainstory1.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">You can capture multiple copies of a Digimon or de-digivolve the ones you have if you want to try and transform them into something else (I de-digivolved my Pagumon because I thought it was ugly). De-digivolving a Digimon poses its own challenges though. When my Pagumon turned back into its Kuramon baby form, I had to deal with it being level 1 again, so beware of that if you choose to de-digivolve on impulse.</p><p dir="ltr">Digimon also have one of 16 personalities now with their own "matrices," where you can influence their stats and what skills they learn based on how you raise them. For example, increasing your Digimon’s Valor can boost HP and attack growth. Personality Skills can strengthen attacks, reduce the number of skill points that attacks use, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">Your Digimon also <em>talk </em>to you. Your core team has up to three Digimon at once, each of which follows you around and asks you questions as they level up like how to be a good friend, what they should call their next special move, and so on. It adds a layer of endearingness to the gameplay and also some functionality, since your answers can affect which way their stats grow. This can also affect how they digivolve, since some evolutions have requirements like a high enough HP or INT stat.</p><p dir="ltr">The story took a backseat to the enjoyable battles and creature collecting in my preview, but that makes sense since we didn't get that far into the story or have a chance to bond with the characters. I could only hope that the characters hold up as well as the Digimon do, but even without that, I'd be compelled to play if only to explore the different ways I could raise my Digimon.</p><p dir="ltr">Time Stranger comes at a time where the Digimon series has been largely stagnant, mostly riding on the memories of Digimon Adventure rather than exploring new territory. However, the fact that it’s the first Digimon Story in a decade and introducing possibly the most comprehensive battle system the series has seen yet, I'm more excited to revisit the Digital World than I have been in years.</p><p dir="ltr">Digimon Story: Time Stranger launches on October 3, 2025. Pro tip: If you're impatient, I'd recommend going back to Digimon Story: Cybersleuth (and its side story follow-up, Hacker's Memory!) to see where the new game is coming from.</p>

		<p>The Digital World and the real world are colliding once again in Digimon Story: Time Stranger, but with the world seemingly coming to an end, you’re thrown back in time to try and prevent the worst from coming to pass.</p>
<p><iframe title="Digimon Story Time Stranger | Story Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bFEu9XOLmg0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This latest entry in the Digimon Story series picks up with a snazzy intro anime for the ADAMAS agency, a group of somewhat ostentatiously dressed agents who’ve been galavanting around and trying to stop anomalous threats. It’s clear that this world has already been transformed by disasters, with a giant wall having been erected to hide a completely destroyed portion of the city, and now a military lockdown of the area that has the populace scared, confused and angry.</p>


<p>For you, there’s a path to sneak into, taking you underground to pass beneath the wall and discover what’s on the other side. As you do so, you encounter Digimon for the first time… or so it seems. ADAMAS has actually known of these creatures for a while, and can now grant you the ability to summon one, choosing between Demidevimon, Gomamon or Patamon as your partner Digimon through this opening.</p>
<p>What’s immediately apparent, as you battle through the opening areas, is the rather modern and freeing take on a turn-based JRPG. Enemies are visible in the open world, which gives you the chance to strike first or to try and avoid encounters entirely, but once you do end up in battle, you have a streamlined and effective combat system. Creatures go in turns, and you can have up to three active Digimon all slotting into the battle timeline based on speed stats. One nice element here is that using an item does not count as an action, and you can also swap Digimon in and out without foregoing a turn, which I feel will encourage using this feature during the run of the story. Elsewhere, you’ve got animation speed and auto-battling right in the main UI, which are great quality-of-life features.</p>


<p>You also have two categories to determine strengths and weaknesses in combat, with both the creature type and their elemental attacks giving you a deterministic readout of damage bonuses and buffs – whether it’s multiplied or reduced by 1.5x, 2x or both. At least, it will do so eventually, once you’ve learnt what works and what doesn’t against a new enemy.</p>
<p>You can boost these multipliers further with the Cross Arts, a techno-ability for your human character to use that builds up as you land attacks that can deal critical damage, and can then be set to buff your team or debuff and damage the opposition. it’s a fun cutscene animation, with your phone turning into a random gun-like contraption.</p>

<p>Oh, and then there’s adding creatures to your team, not by catching them, but rather by learning enough about them through combat to replicate them –&nbsp;able to do so from 100% learning, but then able to generate more powerful versions by waiting to 200%. As they gain experience, Digivolution comes into play, morphing them into more powerful forms, giving you clear paths to follow and letting you revert and choose alternate creature forms down the line. We only experienced this through the regular run of combat, but interacting with your Digimon to shape their personalities or nurturing them through a Digifarm are also options.</p>
<p>Many of these features were gradually revealed to us through the opening chapter, where the game throws mystery after mystery at you. A woman calls up ADAMAS and seems to know you, though you don’t know them in return, but whisks you along through devastated government buildings and with countless Digimon wandering around, some of immense power that you have to avoid, before building up to a final rooftop battle.</p>
<p>Let’s just say it doesn’t end too well and throws the narrative off in a temporal tangent!</p>

<p>Jumping ahead to a later portion of the game, we’re in the Abyss, and what could actually be a rather idyllic seaside part of the Digital World, were it not for the attacks being wrought upon this village by a group of Digimon known as Titans. You have to figure out a way to stop this from escalating and find that there’s already a personal connection that you can use to do so, as one of the Titans has switched sides.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, my knowledge of Digimon is much less deeply ingrained than Pokémon. I remember watching some of the early Digimon Adventure anime, and Agumon was obviously the posterchild back then – he still is, to be fair! – but I maybe underestimated just how out-there some of the Digimon designs could be. Deltamon has a signature ability to shoot like a Death Star, combining energy beams from both arm weapons and his mouth, or there’s Leomon, the humanoid lion with a knife which is a fellow with a giant gun for a body, and Aegiomon is literally just a human with goat legs, which feels less like a digital monster and more like something out of Greek mythology.</p>
<p>Through this section, the combat really starts to come into its own. The prologue had a lot of single hit battles (or even just some creatures getting KO’d by a preemptive attack), but heading down below the water to the Titan’s lair, thankfully with an invisible macguffin that means you can still breath alright, and the encounters here need more effort to learn and exploit weaknesses. Just as handy is how your party has ballooned in size, so you still have your team of three active Digimon to call upon, but there’s a bunch of story characters alongside.</p>

<p>The fight against the big Sharkmon boss of the Titans was a really satisfying one to work through, plugging away at his weaknesses and switching team members to put the best foot forward, using Cross Arts to debuff and damage them, and also then trying to target his head when he dips down to build up for a charge attack. It’s a good battle.</p>
<p>I feel that there’s a real opportunity for Digimon Story: Time Stranger to take advantage of. After some difficult times for Pokémon games, which are now shifting to a new real-time battle system, Digimon Story is sticking to the tried and true turn-based battles that could bring traditional monster battling fans to its yard.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A couple months ago, my colleague and our Senior Content Manager Andrew Stretch <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/digimon-story-time-stranger-shows-off-vibrant-digital-world-and-quality-of-life" rel="nofollow">played <em>Digimon Story Time Stranger</em> at Summer Game Fest</a> and enjoyed it. He's a longtime cheerleader of the <em>Digimon Story</em> franchise, but I never believed him enough to try it for myself.</p>

<p>After three hours with <em>Digimon Story Time Stranger</em> at PAX West, I'm a believer now. It pretty quickly shot up to near the top of my October wishlist.</p>

<p>This demo session started off with what was essentially the beginning of the game, and I got a bit of setup for the overall plot and an easy onramp for the gameplay. Then, we transitioned to a later point in the story with level 20 Digimon.</p>



<h2>Digivolving to a Better Quality of Life</h2>

<p>The first major aspects I noticed with <em>Digimon Story Time Stranger</em> is just how many quality-of-life features there are. While I haven't played previous ones in the series, I know my way around a classic JRPG, and this one had a lot of lovely shortcuts.</p>

<p>We previously reported on some of them, like how you can auto-defeat wild encounters if your average level is stronger and still earn XP—even for 'mons in your storage. Combat animations can also be sped up by up to five-times speed.</p>

<p>I noticed a few new ones in my hands-on time at PAX, too. You can stand still in the overworld to automatically regenerate health and stamina. Your storage for all your Digimon can also be accessed anywhere in the overworld, making it easy to swap your 'mons out as needed.</p>

<p>"We don't need to do all the wasteful movements that people in past Digimon story titles had to go through," Producer Ryosuke Hara told me through a translator. "And trust me, we know there are people that have spent hundreds, if not thousands of hours in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/digimon-story-cyber-sleuth-review-digimon-are-champions" rel="nofollow"><em>Cyber Sleuth</em></a> and whatnot."</p>



<p>Battles are often determined by your understanding of type effectiveness, as you'd expect from a monster-taming game. I'm largely new to the franchise though, so learning the different attributes and elements felt like a lot to wrap my head around initially.</p>

<p>However, the combat UI makes it super easy to understand what's super effective and how strong (or weak) the multiplier will be. After all, this is a big monster-hunting turn-based RPG with hundreds of thousands of matchups to consider.</p>



<p>Overall, these quality-of-life improvements go a long way to making the game more convenient and streamlined, according Hara-san. He and the team iterated to find that perfect balance of ease without making it too easy. There's one big anchor that they used to balance this convenience against.</p>

<p>"In the end, we tried to balance it with the boss battles. We tried to make the boss battles more fun. We tried not to shake it up too much," Hara-san said through a translator. "Every boss battle is going to be appropriately hard for where you are in the story. That acts as the balancing in the game."</p>

<p>He assured us that while the boss battles ultimately serve as the skill checks, you likely will never be stuck in an impossible scenario. If your team isn't matching up well, you can always De-Digivolve and re-Digivolve your team to find new ways in.</p>



<h2>Digimon Gets Personal</h2>

<p>With the newly introduced Personality system, these conveniences feel like they'll go a long way to making <em>Digimon Story Time Stranger</em> a good time. Depending on which Personality a Digimon has, their stats will grow a certain way.</p>

<p>This system works on two levels, I've noticed. On the surface, you can really shape a Digimon's character and feel more of an attachment to them. If you feel like your Agumon is the brave, heroic type, you can foster that by interacting with him and answering questions with brave responses. It helps you develop more of a personal bond.</p>

<p>On a deeper level, understanding their Personality type will help you optimize their stats, allowing you to amplify their strengths and cover up their weaknesses. This creates a deeper endgame for players who really want to go that extra mile and make a team of absolutely perfect Digimon--or hell, even make a perfect version of all 450+ Digimon in the game.</p>



<h2>So What's the Digimon Story?</h2>

<p>In this universe, there's a Digital World that coexists with reality, and there's an ongoing war between Digimon that could lead to a cataclysmic apocalypse in both. You're part of ADAMAS, an investigation team that's trying to stop the calamity.</p>

<p>The protagonist is a Tamer that collects and controls Digimon to fight rogue Digimon and other threats. In the second part of my play session, a character mentioned something called the "Shinjuku Inferno," which sounds related to (or could be) whatever bad thing we're trying to prevent.</p>

<p>The game doesn't really waste time getting conflicts into motion; the opening hour or so throws you into the thick of a protest that goes wrong, and it ultimately leads what feels like a major inciting incident.</p>



<p>With a 40–50 hour campaign, there will be a lot to sink our teeth into when <em>Digimon Story Time Stranger</em> releases on Oct. 3. Personally, between the strong turn-based combat, quality-of-life upgrades, and intriguing apocalyptic story, I'm convinced I should've been a <em>Digimon Story</em> fan a long time ago.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Another former Xbox staffer has added their voice to criticisms surrounding Xbox Game Pass and other gaming subscription services, and this time, it's ex-Xbox VP Shannon Loftis' turn to cast a critical eye over the service.</p>

<p>Speaking on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7369880832481660928?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7369880832481660928%2C7369898365943218176%29&amp;dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287369898365943218176%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7369880832481660928%29" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>, Loftis first admits that Game Pass "can claim a few victories with games that otherwise would have sunk beneath the waves", citing <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/human-fall-flat-review-drunk-puzzling" rel="nofollow">breakout platformer&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/human-fall-flat-review-drunk-puzzling" rel="nofollow">Human: Fall Flat</a>&nbsp;</em>as an example of this process in action.</p>

<p>However, Loftis goes on to say that "the majority of game adoption" on Xbox Game Pass "comes at the expense of retail revenue", with the exception of games that are "engineered from the ground up for post-release monetization".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/human-fall-flat-xbox-game-pass.jpg?itok=vkFBFQPw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/human-fall-flat-xbox-game-pass.jpg?itok=ADOraKxo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Not every Game Pass game can be&nbsp;<em>Human: Fall Flat</em>, says ex-Xbox VP Shannon Loftis.</figcaption></figure><p>Loftis concludes by saying that she "could (and may someday) write pages on the weird inner tensions this creates" among developers whose games will be appearing on Game Pass.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that Loftis isn't the first former Xbox staffer to offer a colorful opinion on the Game Pass subscription service this month.</p>

<p>Her comments follow those of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-bethesda-exec-says-gaming-subscription-services-worth-jack-s-without-proper-support-for-game-developers" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ex-Bethesda exec Pete Hines</a>, who said last week that subscription services are "worth jack shit" without companies "figur[ing] out how to balance the needs of the service...with the people who are providing the content".</p>

<p>Indeed, Loftis' comment was posted in response to former PlayStation boss Shawn Layden <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/shawn-layden_former-bethesda-exec-says-gaming-subscription-activity-7369880832481660928-HhnQ/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reposting Hines' comments</a> himself, adding that the question should not be whether subscription services are profitable for their owners, but whether they are "healthy and helpful" for devs.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hollow-knight-silksong-xbox-game-pass.jpg?itok=MDF4q3v2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hollow-knight-silksong-xbox-game-pass.jpg?itok=R8iBpTLK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some games, like&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>, almost certainly won't be hurt by launching on Game Pass on day one.</figcaption></figure><p>Launching on Game Pass on day one doesn't necessarily preclude a game from achieving financial success. Games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-3-3m-33-days" rel="nofollow">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>&nbsp;</em>and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/oblivion-remastered-sales-circana-april-2025" rel="nofollow">recent&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remaster</a> debuted on Game Pass, but still seemingly managed to rack up very respectable sales for themselves.</p>

<p>Still, these execs' comments on Game Pass and other subscription services should give us pause for thought, especially when it comes to smaller indie devs (and even major first-party studios). Stay tuned for more on this.</p>

              <p>There really are few phrases in the English language more annoying than “This could be a <em>Black Mirror&nbsp;</em>episode!” But a popular television series which scathingly explores and satirizes the effects of technology on the human race releasing its own themed memecoin and accompanying Web3 platform? That bloody could. At the end, everyone responsible would be thrown in a volcano.</p> <p>Meme-based crypto currencies were once the domain of tech bros looking to make a buck at the top of a pyramid who’d leave the worthless coins in the hands of suckers and move on to the next. Now, their reputation has somehow sunk even lower, with the likes of Donald Trump exploiting his acolytes with Trump Coin (currently worth a fifth of day-one peak, and almost a quarter of its launch price). So it’s just the perfect moment, years after anyone took them even half-seriously, for <em>Black Mirror</em>‘s production company to launch $MIRROR, a coin based on the show. Why? According to <a href="https://gamesbeat.com/black-mirror-token-coming-from-banijay-and-pixelynx/">a <em>GamesBeat </em>article,</a> “To reward <em>Black Mirror</em> fans for their loyalty.”</p>  <p>Banijay Rights is an arm of Banijay Entertainment, a mammoth television production company responsible for shows like&nbsp;<em>Lego Masters</em>,&nbsp;<em>Big Brother</em>, <em>Survivor</em>, and indeed&nbsp;<em>Black Mirror</em>. It <a href="https://www.decential.io/articles/black-mirror-is-coming-to-web3-thanks-to-pixelynx-animoca-brands-and-banijay#:~:text=PIXELYNX%20signed%20a%20partnership%20with,to%20build%20experiences%20on%2Dchain.">partnered with Web3 company Pixelynx</a> a while back, with the intention to create a coin and run a bunch of Web3 bullshit like NFTs. The latter sold out instantly, with all 7,000 being picked up at $40 a pop in under three hours. It was suggested then that this deal could even influence future episodes of the show, but given <em>Black Mirror&nbsp;</em>creator Charlie Brooker doesn’t seem the sort to countenance any of this crap, that sounded like a reach at the time.</p>

 <p>Today <a href="https://dex.coinmarketcap.com/token/base/0xa37e68babc44bb74fc2d1874e2b14794e8430677/">the memecoin launched</a>, albeit so recently that it’s hard to discern any sort of reaction. It also doesn’t help that there’s <a href="https://mirrorchain.io/">apparently another $MIRROR coin</a>, and oh god who cares? (Well, the <a href="https://x.com/blackmirror_xp">237,000 people following the X account</a>, apparently.)</p> <p>But it’s not just a coin! There’s a motherfucking UNIVERSE, too. “The $MIRROR token goes beyond gamified engagement,” we’re told. Phew! “It’s a cultural token at the core of an expanding digital world that merges interactive entertainment, communities, identity, and social standing.”</p>

 <p>Coin owners will be able to vote on covers for <a href="https://www.twistedcomics.co.uk/black-mirror-comics/">a&nbsp;<em>Black Mirror</em> comic from Twisted Comics</a>—and get this!—have the chance to put <em>more</em> money into&nbsp;<em>more</em> nonsense non-products by investing in “royalty streams from selected product launches.”</p> <p>This is all apparently “inspired” by the <em>Black Mirror</em> episode “Nosedive.” The 2016 episode was about people’s ability to rate each other from one to five stars, in a society where your social status is constantly dependent upon how others have rated you. I rate everyone involved in this crypto bullshit 1 out of 5! I’m sure the episode’s writers Ras,hida Jones and Michael Schur, will be just delighted about all this.</p> <p>God, there’s so much more rubbish around this, but you get the gist. That gist being: everything is awful and we should shut down society forever. <em>It could be a Black Mirror episode!</em></p>
