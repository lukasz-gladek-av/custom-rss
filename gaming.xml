So it’s no surprise that <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>—the very first open-world Star Wars title (no, MMOs don’t count)—is an extremely long game filled with tons to see and do. That goes doubly for anyone looking to finish absolutely everything in the game and earn all of the trophies and achievements. Let’s take a look at how long it takes to beat <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> based on how much you’d like to complete.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196842" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Star Wars Outlaws Lost Me With Its Story Trailer" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="138" data-playlist="196842,195326,196181" data-current="196842"><div><p>Star Wars Outlaws Lost Me With Its Story Trailer</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196842/196842_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196842/196842_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196842/196842_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196842/196842_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22392.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h7299"><a id=""></a><strong>How long is <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>?</strong></h2><p>If you’re looking to breeze through the main campaign of <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> without engaging with much of its extra content, you can reach the credits in only <strong>15-20 hours</strong>. This would be ignoring an awful lot of interesting content, however. You’re not on a deadline! Take your time.</p><h3 id="h7300"><a id=""></a><strong>What does it take to 100% <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>?</strong></h3><p>Indeed, this open-world adventure is massive and densely populated with NPCs to meet, treasures to find, lore to uncover, and secrets to unveil. Even more, its large trophy and achievement list is all but certain to keep you super-busy if you’re a completionist. You’ll have to reach maximum reputation with every faction at least once, finish every Expert quest, discover every planet area, find all Nix Treasures, and complete 40 contracts. You’ll also need to complete a wide variety of miscellaneous activities, like getting a high score in an arcade game, doing specific actions in combat a certain number of times, and spending a fair amount of time gambling.</p><p>Engaging with just <em>some</em> of this can add a dozen hours on top of the already lengthy campaign, but you can expect full completion of <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> to take you up to <strong>40 hours</strong>. That’s a whole work week of time spent in a galaxy far, far away.</p><figure id="" data-id="3afd565088efb2df0c63e51a9bca6b0c" data-recommend-id="image://3afd565088efb2df0c63e51a9bca6b0c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Our hero smiles next to a droid." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Our hero smiles next to a droid." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3afd565088efb2df0c63e51a9bca6b0c" data-recommend-id="image://3afd565088efb2df0c63e51a9bca6b0c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Our hero smiles next to a droid." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Here’s the breakdown:</p><h2 id="h7301"><a id=""></a><strong>How many chapters are in Star Wars Outlaws?</strong></h2><p><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> features 21 chapters—some of which will play out in different orders based on which characters you choose to seek out first.</p><p>Here are all of the chapters in the game:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Beginnings</li><li>Outlaws</li><li>Crashed</li><li>Underworld</li><li>New Tricks</li><li>False Flag</li><li>The Wreck</li><li>Hyperspace</li><li>The Heavy</li><li>The Safecracker</li><li>The Droidsmith</li><li>Gunsmith (The Safecracker)</li><li>Breakout (The Safecracker)</li><li>The Hive (The Safecracker)</li><li>Partners (The Heavy)</li><li>Jabba’s Favor (The Heavy)</li><li>Viper (The Droidsmith)</li><li>Legacy (The Droidsmith)</li><li>The Truth</li><li>The Heist</li><li>Revelator</li></ul><h2 id="h7302"><a id=""></a><strong>How many planets are in Star Wars Outlaws?</strong></h2><p><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> features five planets to visit, but rest assured there is no shortage of unique experiences to be had on each of them.

This new update, which is going to be tested by players in September, is changing quite a lot of things, including the level cap, how monsters scale, the paragon system, and much more.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195326" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Diablo IV's Strongholds Are A Great Way To Level Up This Season" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="326" data-playlist="195326,196742,195150" data-current="195326"><div><p>Diablo IV's Strongholds Are A Great Way To Level Up This Season</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195326/195326_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195326/195326_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195326/195326_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195326/195326_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20784.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Blizzard’s big demonic action RPG, <em>Diablo 4</em>, is getting its first expansion on October 8. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-mercenaries-dark-citadel-1851630602&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-mercenaries-dark-citadel-1851630602">The upcoming paid DLC, <em>Vessel of Hatred</em></a></span>, is set to add a new class and a new area for players to explore. Alongside this new expansion, Blizzard is planning to release the 2.0 update for<em> Diablo 4</em>. To help test this update before it goes live, Blizzard announced a test period for PC players that will happen between September 4-11. And based on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo4/24130178/the-2-0-ptr-what-you-need-to-know&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo4/24130178/the-2-0-ptr-what-you-need-to-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a new in-depth blog post</a></span> from Blizzard, this new 2.0 update is a big ‘un.</p><h2 id="h7690"><a id=""></a>New, lower level cap and difficulty changes</h2><p>Perhaps the biggest news is that <em>Diablo 4</em>'s level cap is being lowered from 100 to 60. If you are worried that this means leveling up will be slowed down, Blizzard says that’s not the case. Instead, the studio explained that as it expanded <em>Diablo 4</em>'s endgame, it wants more players to get there quicker. It also helps squish stats and damage numbers, too, which were apparently getting out of hand. </p><p>Once players hit level 60, they’ll start earning Paragon levels, which can be used to unlock nodes and improve all your characters, as the Paragon system will now be realm-based, not character-based. If you have any characters above level 50, all their existing XP-based Paragon Points will be converted into Paragon Levels. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-free-trial-sale-steam-deck-pc-vessel-hatred-1851630535&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-free-trial-sale-steam-deck-pc-vessel-hatred-1851630535"><em>Diablo 4</em></a></span><em> </em>is also ditching its world tier difficulty system and replacing it with Torment levels, making it more similar to how <em>Diablo 3 </em>worked. (A lot of these changes feel heavily inspired by <em>Diablo 3,</em> actually...) </p><p>Now difficulty will be split between two options: Standard and Torment. Standard is how you’ll start the game and how you’ll level up to 60. You can choose between Normal, Hard, Expert, and Penitent. </p><p>Once you hit max level and enter the endgame, you’ll begin to work through Torment levels, which start at one and max out at four. These Torment levels will be very challenging, warns Blizzard, and you’ll have your stats nerfed as you move through the levels. Here’s what that looks like: </p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Torment 1: -250 Armor and -25% All Resist</li><li>Torment 2: -500 Armor and -50% All Resist</li><li>Torment 3: -750 Armor and -75% All Resist</li><li>Torment 4: -1000 Armor and -100% All Resist</li></ul><p>To unlock Torment 1 you have to reach level 60. That also unlocks the Pit, an endgame activity. Reach level 20 of that Pit and you’ll unlock Torment 1. From there, you have to dig into the Pit and keep beating higher tiers to unlock the later Torment levels. This won’t be easy. </p><p>A smaller change that I’m excited about is that in the 2.0 update, monsters and demons will no longer have their level displayed in-game. Instead, they’ll scale to your difficulty, not your level. Blizzard says this change is being implemented based on feedback from players that they felt weak.</p><p>Blizzard also confirmed that all classes are getting one new ability each and five new passives. And passives in each class’s skill tree now have more connections, so you’ll have more flexibility when leveling up and creating your perfect warrior.</p><p>Keep in mind that these changes could, well, change between now and October as players test out the update via the Private Test Realm. But the overall takeaway seems to be that in<em> Vessel of Hatred </em>and <em>Diablo 4</em> 2.0, Blizzard wants more people playing the endgame and wants people to have more options and flexibility in creating characters and builds. </p><hr><p>Here are the full patch notes:<br></p><h2 id="h7691"><a id=""></a>All Classes</h2><p><strong><em>Mythic Unique Items</em></strong></p><p>Heir of Perdition - Mythic Unique Helm</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>AffixesInherent: +200% Damage to Angels and Demons+20% Critical Strike Chance+20% Lucky Hit Chance+20% Movement Speed+2 to Core Skills</li><li>PowerSuccumb to hatred and earn Mother’s Favor, increasing your damage dealt by 60%[x].

<p>It was explained that this is due to a ‘repackaging effort’ that’ll ultimately make the game’s install size much smaller, but it’s not good news for those with a weak internet connection.</p>

<h2 id="h-major-update">Major Update</h2>



<p>Milepost Zero is the next super-sized Fallout 76 update, bringing new repeatable events, changes to the C.A.M.P. mechanics, and various tweaks and alterations to existing events, quests, and weapons. </p>



<p>However, to install the update, you’ll be forced to redownload your entire game – regardless of the platform that you play Fallout 76 on.</p>



<p>When asked on Twitter if users will need to ‘uninstall and reinstall the game’, Bethesda’s support function simply replied, ‘Yes.’</p>

</div></figure>







<p>One of the chief concerns amongst the community is whether this will wipe in-game photo galleries, some of which have been built up over a series of years by users dedicated to the game. Presently, we’re not sure if that’s the case, but I’ve reached out to Bethesda to get the full scope of that potential issue.</p>



<p>This is a welcome change in some respects, as Fallout 76 has long been a dramatically bloated title. Presently, it sits at more than 110 GB on some platforms, almost four times the size of the base installation of Fallout 4 on PC.</p>



<p>Will you be playing Milepost Zero when it’s released?</p>

<p>Remember <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2007/03/game-review-peggle-pc/"><em>Peggle</em></a>? If you were lucky enough to play this deceptively deep <a href="https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2065.html">pachinko</a>-meets-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagatelle">bagatelle</a> game in the late '00s, you know how addictive and entrancing it could be to just watch a bouncing ball ricochet off brightly colored pegs.
</p><p>While developer Popcap <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2009/03/peggle-has-been-quite-the/">released</a> a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/11/xbox-one-game-extravaganza-hands-on-with-10-launch-exclusives/2/">few sequels</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2008/09/peggle-nights-is-here-look-upon-your-productivity-and-despair/">spinoffs</a> in the years after <em>Peggle</em>'s 2007 release, the series has largely languished since <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/07/13/us-electronicarts-idUSTRE76B7FK20110713/">Popcap's acquisition by EA in 2011</a>. Today, the only actively supported version of the game is <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/peggle-blast/id853834250"><em>Peggle Blast</em></a>, a smartphone port that dumbs down the gameplay with frequent pushes to spend real money on needed items, à la <em>Candy Crush</em> and its ilk.
</p><p>A few other games have tried to capture the old <em>Peggle</em> ball-bouncing magic in the last decade, most notably <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/848030/Roundguard/">the excellent but sometimes overwhelming <em>Roundguard</em></a>. But <em>Peglin</em>—which launched out of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1296610/Peglin/">an extended Steam early access period</a> and also <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/peglin-switch/?srsltid=AfmBOoqrm_uNO4pRmufl3mEKOvoXiOJWgk4QF-Niuyh-QkGbwmwTKKB3">saw a Nintendo Switch release</a> this week—is my new favorite take on the concept, combining <em>Peggle's </em>addictive ball-bouncing with just the right mix of roguelike randomization and RPG-style progression.</p>
<h2>Take your shot</h2>
<p>Every shot in <em>Peglin</em> is akin to a turn in an old-school RPG. Each peg your bouncing ball hits before falling out the bottom of the board contributes a bit to your attack power against a horde of enemies that slowly march toward you in a cute animated strip above.</p>

<p>Not all pegs are created equal, though. Each board has two bright yellow "critical" pegs that crank up the attack value of each hit, moving randomly around the board between shots. Green "refresh" pegs are also needed to replace pegs that have disappeared after earlier hits and can lead to some extreme chains when hit at just the right point in a shot. Then there are the bombs, which send your ball flying after being lit and hit while also representing a powerful attack that hits all enemies.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>The balls you fire aren't all created equal, either. There are balls with extreme critical damage, balls that can impart harmful status effect on enemies, and balls that can coat pegs with helpful slime. There are balls that can heal your and balls that activate nearby pegs with each hit. Some balls are extra bouncy, others get attracted to each peg with a weak magnetic force, and still others get split into multiball patterns after being shot.&nbsp;You get the idea.</p>
<p>Building and upgrading a tailored bag of these varied and helpful balls—using coins collected from special pegs on each stage—is one of the most satisfying parts of a <em>Peglin</em> run. But those same coins are the best way of healing in between fights, so you have to manage your resources carefully. Runs can also be enhanced by a wide variety of powerful relics that give permanent stat bonuses or shot effects, though often with a downside that might outweigh the benefits if you're not careful.</p>
<p>Each <em>Peglin</em> run progresses through a randomized <em>Slay the Spire</em>-style map, which lets you avoid a lot of battles if you're careful. Amid the usual shops and treasures, you'll also stumble on quite a few random encounters that let you make simple decisions like trading health for upgrades or risking existing balls for new, more powerful ones.</p>

			<p>Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 will only support NVIDIA DLSS 2 and AMD FSR 2 at launch, as support for the more recent versions of both upscalers will only come after release.</p>
<p>In a new <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/68-august-community-update">August Community Update post</a>, Focus Entertainment and developer Saber Interactive provided some new information on their game launching next month on PC and consoles, confirming that NVIDIA DLSS 3 and AMD FSR 3 support will only come after launch. Ray tracing and HDR will also not be supported, while ultrawide support is planned, but will only come after launch, possibly by the end of September. Steam Deck support is also planned to arrive before the end of the year.</p>
<p>Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 will also feature multiple display modes on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. Quality mode will provide 4K resolution, 30 FPS gameplay on PS5 and Xbox Series X but only 1440p resolution on Xbox Series S, while Performance mode will offer up to 60 FPS gameplay at 1080p resolution. Speaking about crossplay, it has been confirmed that it will be available from day one on PC and consoles, but the PvP Eternal War mode will have separate lobbies, so crossplay will only be available with friends.</p>
<p>The game's launch on September 9th will only be the beginning, as Saber Interactive plans to support the game with new content and features. As part of Season 1, the game will get the aforementioned ultrawide support, as well as Private PvE lobbies and a Sparring Arena. More content will be coming during Season 2 this October, as well as in Seasons 3 and 4, which will conclude the<a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-reveals-first-year-of-post-launch-support/"> first year of post-launch support.</a></p>
<p>Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 releases on September 9th on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide.</p>

                <p>It was recently reported that a new video game set within the universe of Matt Reeves' The Batman was potentially in the works, but that is apparently not true. James Gunn, one of the co-heads of DC Studios--AKA someone who would definitely know--debunked the rumor on social media.</p><p>He said on <a href="https://www.threads.net/@jamesgunn/post/C_TDHo7gbRr" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Threads</a>, "Sadly there is no truth to this whatsoever."</p><p>A <a href="https://puck.news/how-the-wbd-fire-sale-could-play-out/?_cio_id=f6c60601ab8301dced02" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">report from Puck News</a> said there could be a video game based on HBO's Penguin TV series--which itself is set in The Batman universe--in the works. But the report had basically no information to go on. And now it turns out that it's not true.</p><p>While no such game is in the works, DC is indeed making more video games, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/batman-arkham-shadow/" data-ref-id="5000-628040">Batman: Arkham Shadow</a> for Meta Quest 3 and a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/wonder-woman/" data-ref-id="5000-547390">Wonder Woman game</a> from the developers of Shadow of Mordor.</p><p>As for The Batman franchise, Robert Pattinson is suiting up once again for The Batman II, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-batman-2-delayed-to-2026/1100-6521796/" data-ref-id="1100-6521796">it's not coming anytime soon.</a> Looking to The Penguin, the HBO series starring Colin Farrell is much closer on the horizon.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ybarra-consoles-never-die-losing-pushing-narrative/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In the past few years, we have repeatedly heard how consoles are about to die, but the former Blizzard Entertainment president Mike Ybarra not only thinks that this won't be the case but also that those losing are pushing a narrative that fits them, taking a not-so-well hidden dig at Microsoft.</p>
<p>Speaking on<a href="https://x.com/Qwik/status/1829502846498402459"> X</a> earlier today, the former Blizzard Entertainment president discussed Sony's approach to exclusive games, saying that it is the correct strategy to follow if you plan to win in the living room. In this regard, Sony not only knows how to make hits but also how to pick them from others, and it is definitely paying off. If he were Sony, Ybarra continued, he would double down on this strategy because the blood in the water is all over the place.</p>
<p>As another X user highlighted, the narrative nowadays is that the living room is not the future and that consoles are dying. Mike Ybarra replied that, in his opinion, <a href="https://x.com/Qwik/status/1829507360689426571">consoles will never die</a>, and it's those who are losing who are pushing a narrative that fits them. This is a not-so-subtle dig at Microsoft, whose strategy regarding its consoles and exclusives has been all over the place lately, creating much uncertainty.</p>
<p>Just as Mike Ybarra said, Sony has always been capable of producing exclusive hits themselves while also securing titles from other developers. Just this year, games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/rise-of-the-ronin-neo-edo-open-world/">Rise of the Ronin</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/">Stellar Blade</a> have been released on PlayStation 5, making the console the one to own to play some of the best titles launched in the past few years. Microsoft's strategy, on the other hand, seems to have almost completely disregarded console exclusivity, releasing multiple former exclusives on PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch. One of the most anticipated games launching on Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S this year, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, will only be a Microsoft exclusive for a few months, as the game will launch on Sony's console sometime in <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-to-release-as-timed-exclusive/">Spring 2025.</a> With a new console generation not too far off in the future, it will be very interesting to see Microsoft's approach and if the company will continue to push the narrative that the time of consoles is coming to an end.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[DCU Head James Gunn Quashes The Batman Video Game Rumors]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/james-gunn-the-batman-rumors</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dcu-head-james-gunn-quashes-the-batman-video-game-rumors.968454/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/james-gunn-the-batman-rumors<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>DCU movie head James Gunn has taken to social media to shut down a rumor that's been circulating in the last few days regarding a potential video game set in the world of Matt Reeves' 2022 movie&nbsp;<em>The Batman</em>.</p>
<p>The rumors regarding&nbsp;<em>The Batman&nbsp;</em>have been handily collected in <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-game-set-in-the-batman-universe-reportedly-in-development.968079/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this ResetEra thread</a>, and it seems they stem from a site called Puck, which alleged that Warner Bros is currently working on a game "rooted in the<em>&nbsp;Batman&nbsp;</em>movie" (presumably referring to the Reeves project).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it looks like there's no truth to those rumors, at least as far as James Gunn is concerned (and he would know, given that he's overseeing everything to do with DC's excursions into its cinematic universe right now).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/james-gunn-the-batman-game-rumors-suicide-squad.jpg?itok=hH1NnNy2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/james-gunn-the-batman-game-rumors-suicide-squad.jpg?itok=CH2XNMGh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Batman most recently appeared in February's&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Over on Threads, a user <a href="https://www.threads.net/@erikoliveira.eo411/post/C_S096FRykR" rel="noopener" target="_blank">asked Gunn</a> whether or not recent rumors regarding a game set in the universe of&nbsp;<em>The Batman&nbsp;</em>were true.</p>
<p>In response, Gunn <a href="https://www.threads.net/@jamesgunn/post/C_TDHo7gbRr/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">said that there was "no truth to this whatsoever"</a>, which is pretty much as unequivocal a denial as you can get. That's not an exec being evasive or making vague denials; that's a flat-out "no". Sorry,&nbsp;<em>The Batman&nbsp;</em>fans. Looks like you're out of luck.</p>
<p>While he was at it, Gunn also <a href="https://www.threads.net/@jamesgunn/post/C_TFYMlg2--" rel="noopener" target="_blank">quashed the rumor</a> that the song "Tubthumping" by Chumbawamba was being played on the set of the new&nbsp;<em>Superman&nbsp;</em>movie. Way to ruin my dreams, James.</p>
<h2>It might not be over for&nbsp;<em>Batman&nbsp;</em>fans</h2>
<p>While Gunn might have put paid to&nbsp;<em>The Batman&nbsp;</em>rumors, that's not to say there's nothing in the works on this front, at least if a recent LinkedIn job posting is to be believed.</p>
<p>Recently, senior Rocksteady systems programmer Tae Ho Kang added a new section to the "experience" part of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/taeho-kang-london/?originalSubdomain=uk" rel="noopener" target="_blank">his LinkedIn profile</a>. Said section states he's currently working on the tech team for an "unannounced project" at Rocksteady, which began development in June.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/batman-arkham-knight-rocksteady.jpg?itok=dMkJPC-K 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/batman-arkham-knight-rocksteady.jpg?itok=osLiebeS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Could a new single-player Rocksteady-developed DC adventure be in the works?</figcaption></figure><p>Admittedly, that's not too much to go on; the listing doesn't state what the project is (naturally), and it's likely that it's in the very early stages of development if work on it began in June. Still, this could well be the single-player game Rocksteady was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-directors-cut-report">apparently attempting to pitch</a> a few months ago.</p>
<p>If you weren't a big fan of&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League&nbsp;</em>(and, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-kill-justice-leagues-sales-disappointed-hogwarts-legacy-is-big-win">judging by Warner Bros' finances</a>, not many were), then you'll probably want to keep an eye on Rocksteady's socials in the next few months.

The combat doesn’t require complex strings of button mashing, the clearly marked story objectives help orient you even on a small screen, and the many side quests are perfect fodder for pick-up-and-play sessions. The remakes of the first three <em>Mana</em> games are all on mobile devices (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/secret-of-mana-square-snes-rpg-remake-best-1851611091&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/secret-of-mana-square-snes-rpg-remake-best-1851611091">even if some ports aren’t preferable to play</a></span>), so the series has a history of portable-friendly play too. Everything’s in place! So how does <em>Visions of Mana</em> fare on the Steam Deck?<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196055" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="227" data-playlist="196055,196358,195624" data-current="196055"><div><p>6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21584.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>In short, <em>Visions of Mana</em> runs…adequately on Steam Deck. It looks good enough after you fiddle with the settings, and it can hover above 30 frames per second. But you can tell this game wasn’t made for the Deck’s low resolution screen, since the text doesn’t scale well and looks kind of ugly (albeit readable). Still, it’s a passable experience, and I personally enjoyed killing time while I laid in my bed doing side questing on the Deck. I wouldn’t recommend making it your primary platform for playing the game, though, especially if you have access to any other system that can run it.</p><p>To really enjoy <em>Visions of Mana</em> on Steam Deck, check out these tips below to optimize your experience.</p><h2 id="h6450"><a id=""></a><strong>How to fix Visions of Mana not opening on Steam Deck</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="b57d72f2d4a1286d14dda4f5ca61f7d7" data-recommend-id="image://b57d72f2d4a1286d14dda4f5ca61f7d7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Steam Deck menu for Visions of Mana." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Steam Deck menu for Visions of Mana." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Valve / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b57d72f2d4a1286d14dda4f5ca61f7d7" data-recommend-id="image://b57d72f2d4a1286d14dda4f5ca61f7d7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Steam Deck menu for Visions of Mana." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This might sound obvious, but one of the most important prerequisites for enjoying <em>Visions of Mana</em> on Steam Deck is being able to open it at all. If the game refuses to load when you start it, give these troubleshooting steps a try.</p><p>1: Before you hit the “Play” button, press the cog icon on the right side of the screen. Select <strong>Properties</strong>, and then select <strong>Compatibility</strong>. Check the box that says “Force the use of a specific Steam Play compatibility tool,” and then select GE-Proton7-5.3. This is the option that worked for me, but you can give the other iterations of Proton a shot if that doesn’t work (or if a newer option becomes available after we publish this guide).</p><p>2: If the compatibility modes don’t work, or you see an error message saying “DX12 is not supported on your system,” you may need to reinstall the game. To do this, select that cog icon again, choose <strong>Manage</strong>, and select <strong>Uninstall</strong>. You should see the green Play button replaced by the big blue Install button. Try running the game using the compatibility tools again and it should hopefully work.</p><h2 id="h6451"><a id=""></a><strong>The best Steam Deck settings for playing Visions of Mana in handheld mode</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="31aef96385ad8ffcf112bb633462ad8c" data-recommend-id="image://31aef96385ad8ffcf112bb633462ad8c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The game with horrid black bars top and bottom." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The game with horrid black bars top and bottom." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="31aef96385ad8ffcf112bb633462ad8c" data-recommend-id="image://31aef96385ad8ffcf112bb633462ad8c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The game with horrid black bars top and bottom." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Now that you’ve got Visions of Mana running on your system, you’ll notice that it offers limited graphical settings in the options menu. Your resolution is unfortunately locked to 1280x720, which doesn’t quite fit the 1280X800 resolution of your screen. This means you’ll have to deal with black bars as you play (pictured above), and there’s nothing we can do about that.</p><p>Only two options here really impact the game’s performance. Since the game’s already running at a low resolution, I found setting AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 2 to <strong>Quality</strong> and Graphics settings to <strong>High</strong> produced the best results. Some areas in <em>Visions of Mana</em> can cause dips to the frame rate, so you may prefer to adjust that first option from Quality down to <strong>Balanced</strong> to gain some extra frames. These settings should still preserve the game’s visual splendor on the Steam Deck’s small screen, even if it doesn’t compete with its console counterparts.</p><p>You could consider limiting the Frame Rate to 30 in the interest of saving battery life, but I’d personally recommend a shorter and smoother play session, unless you don’t intend to actually fight anything.</p><h2 id="h6452"><a id=""></a><strong>The best Steam Deck settings for playing Visions of Mana in docked mode</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="3e0bda270a36ef4fbe740c34d34547db" data-recommend-id="image://3e0bda270a36ef4fbe740c34d34547db" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The blurry mess of playing docked." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The blurry mess of playing docked." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3e0bda270a36ef4fbe740c34d34547db" data-recommend-id="image://3e0bda270a36ef4fbe740c34d34547db" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The blurry mess of playing docked." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I’ll be real with you: I don’t recommend playing <em>Visions of Mana</em> with the Steam Deck docked and connected to a TV.</p><p>At 1080p, Visions of Mana seriously chugs on the Steam Deck. Frames drop so dramatically that the 20 FPS of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</em> on the N64 will seem smooth by comparison. This can be fixed by setting the AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 2 to <strong>Performance</strong> and the Graphics settings to <strong>Low</strong> (pictured above), but this leaves the game looking horrid. Sure, you get normal looking text, but is that worth completely eliminating the game’s aesthetic?</p><p>You’re better off sticking to the 1280x720 resolution option and reusing the handheld mode graphical settings. However, when this image is blown up on a big TV, <em>Visions of Mana</em> winds up looking predictably blurry. It works, but you’re probably better off just trying to stream the game from a dedicated PC if you have one.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The console versions are newly announced. <span id="more-911389"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Crunching Koalas:</p><blockquote><p>You’re the bouncer of the Green Door club, where every decision matters. Reject the unworthy of partying with clever retorts, explore a neon-lit city, and immerse yourself in the Berlin-like city’s underground techno scene. The beat is pumping—are you in?</p><p>Welcome to the gritty neon-lit streets of Rainbow Drive, where the night never ends, and the music never stops. In <em>Techno Banter</em>, you step into the shoes of Nil, a once-rising star turned bouncer at the infamous Green Door club. Your job? Keep the party alive by assessing the guests at the door. Are they ready to rave, or are they just not cutting it? If they’re not up to par, it’s time to turn them away with a razor-sharp insult, clever comeback, or a devastating quip.</p><p>Every night brings a new challenge. You’ll face a parade of quirky, eccentric characters, each with their own backstory, style, and attitude. As the gatekeeper of the Green Door, you’ll need to quickly size up each guest. Does their outfit scream ‘party material,’ or are they a walking fashion disaster? Are they here to dance the night away, or are they just trouble waiting to happen? When it’s time to say no, you’ll have to do it with flair—because in <em>Techno Banter</em>, words can hit harder than a bass drop.</p><p>Explore the pulsating, vibrant world of Rainbow Drive, a district that thrives under the glow of neon and the thump of heavy basslines. The city is alive with strange and fascinating inhabitants, and it’s up to you to navigate its twists and turns. From dark alleys to dazzling dance floors, every corner of the city tells a story, and every night brings a new experience. As you work the queue at the Green Door and improve the quality of the party, you’ll also have the chance to upgrade the club, turning it into the ultimate techno haven.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>No techno experience would be complete without a killer soundtrack. <em>Techno Banter</em> features tracks from real-life Berlin-based DJs, capturing the raw energy of the underground scene. Each party is underscored by deep house and techno beats that transport you straight to the heart of Berlin’s rave culture. Whether you’re bouncing guests or exploring the city, the music will keep your adrenaline pumping and your head nodding.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Gameplay / Consoles Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Techno Banter - Gameplay / Console Announcement Trailer | PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1mImrCa3jew?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In fact, it could be common for parents to mix up Zelda and Link, and that confusion will likely get worse when The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom launches next month.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo has revealed that the Hylian princess can enter a swordfighter form in a new trailer--seen below--for The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom. Not only does Zelda wield a sword and shield like Link in this transformation, she also sports a similar tunic and hat to the Hylian hero. This ability is unlocked once she discovers a mysterious sword. But, there's a catch: There's a gauge for how long she can stay in this form, which can be refilled by finding energy in the Still World.</p>

		<p>Nintendo has released a new trailer for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>, sharing gameplay of the Still World sections that are found by stepping into the ominous purple rifts, Zelda’s swordfighting form, and more. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/18/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-lets-you-actually-play-as-zelda-this-september/">Echoes of Wisdom launches for Nintendo Switch on 26th September</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom — Into the Still World, a Journey Continued — Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wUdJF8gyO4A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>As the purple rifts have consumed large parts of Hyrule, many of its denizens, the king and link included, have been swallowed into the inky expanses.&nbsp;Thankfully, Zelda has joined forces with a little creature called Tri, who is lending her the ability to make echoes of items and creatures, and let her step into the rifts to explore what the game is calling the Still World.</p>
<p>Chunks of land are suspended here, alongside people that have been drawn into the void, and Zelda will have to get up to some 3D platforming actions to get around – potentially using echoes to solve platforming problems. The Still World is also home to dungeons, again using those echoes and a bit of ingenuity to overcome puzzles, and reaching bosses that need defeating – a boss that looks like a Knack knock off, or maybe “God” from Star Trek V was shown here. You can use echoed creatures or other abilities to hit the weak spots and find your own way to beat them.</p>
<p>Also revealed was a swordfighting form that effectively turns Zelda into a glowing blue Link – Blink, if you will – with sword and shield. However, she’s only got a little time before her energy gauge drains and she reverts to normal – this can be refilled by collecting blue nuggets of energy from the Still World. The final snippet gives a massive hint how you have to acquire this ability…</p>

<p>The trailer also introduces use to Dampé, an engineer of automatons which can be activated by winding them up. These could be a wind up bomb, a music machine, cannon and more – they’ll break if damaged, and act differently to the echo summons.</p>
<p>It all looks positively delightful, as Echoes of Wiszom borrows the visual style of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/09/19/links-awakening-switch-review-the-legend-of-zelda-remake/">Link’s Awakening remake</a>, which was a real highlight from a few years ago. We can’t wait to see more, and we thankfully won’t have to wait all that long for the full release!</p>

		<p>The shuffling hordes of the undead have appeared in almost as many games as the hordes they tend to depict, but any hint of zombie-weariness was gone the moment I saw <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dying-light-the-beast">Dying Light: The Beast</a> in action. This all-new, standalone entry in the Dying Light franchise boasts an open-world full of zombie action, building on the series’ weighty combat and heart-stopping traversal options, while moving things forward with the power and technology they now have on tap.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dying Light: The Beast — Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c50gFkG91jc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Of course,&nbsp;Dying Light: The Beast sees the return of Kyle Crane – the hero of the first game – and we’re rejoining him after he’s undergone more than a decade of captivity and experimentation. Original voice actor Roger Craig Smith returns too (thankfully without having to go method for the role) tying it wholly to that first entry, but while that’s going to delight fans, Techland say this is going to be a great entry point for new players as well.</p>


<p>The name might be a bit of a giveaway, but in our preview session it becomes apparent that The Beast is actually you. Thanks to his incarceration and subsequent experimentation, Kyle Crane has developed a series of beast-like powers, coming to the fore when he’s pushed to the limit. These manifest when he’s angry – you wouldn’t like him when he’s angry – though in gameplay terms that seems to be when he’s been taken and/or dished out a certain amount of damage.</p>
<p>This is a new open-world region that’s not appeared in the franchise before, with a central campaign that’s set to give you over 18 hours of standalone zombie action. Techland feel this is the sweet spot in terms of narrative and gameplay content, though as an open-world game, there’s undoubtedly going to be plenty to distract you from what you’re doing.</p>


<p>Our preview mission sees Kyle tasked with getting inside the E&amp;F chemical factory. Straight away, I’d forgotten about the amazing blend of speed, fluidity and &nbsp;of Dying Light’s traversal and parkour, and it looks even more seamless this time around. The environments are incredibly detailed, and every element has been hand-crafted by the visual team. Environments shimmer with foliage, and the new and improved water and weather effects add newfound depth to every scene.</p>
<p>The narrative this time out draws on inspirations from TV shows like Twin Peaks and Stranger Things, with central villain Baron working on a new strain of virus to create chimaeras, or Freaks as the game has it. For a world that is already most of the way to hell, this seems like an unnecessary narrative kick in the balls, but it gives us a clear threat to deal with, and a reason for smashing our way through piles of zombies.</p>
<p>We see Volatiles, the returning apex predators of the undead and “king of the night”. Through our preview, there’s an emphasis on avoiding combat at first, with leaping across rooftops then replaced by hiding in long grass, and avoiding the Volatiles especially. Fans shouldn’t worry though, as Kyle soon takes out a baseball bat, smashing up a pack of zombies, culminating in a particularly graphic replacement of a skull by a crimson hole.</p>
<p>As an open world experience, you’ll come across different encounters that will distract you from what you’re supposed to be doing. We find a small group of raiders trying to lockpick a crate, though that’s an easy distraction to ensure they don’t see Kyle and his bow coming. Or indeed the arrows as they lodge in their chest.</p>

<p>If you’re coming from the first game, there’s a greater emphasis on firearms – just as there was in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dying-light-2">Dying Light 2</a> – though Techland are keen to say that melee combat remains the focus. The team just want to give players as many tools as possible to work their way through the hordes, and the assault rifles and shotguns we see during our preview seem weighty and lethal. Ammunition is going to be limited though, so they’re never going to be the answer to every problem you encounter.</p>
<p>There’s also vehicles here, as first appeared in Dying Light: The Following, and we see Kyle hopping into a pickup truck which allows him to ferry a mission-specific canister across the map. This does, of course, involve running down a few zombies, but just as with the outlook elsewhere, this is a game about surviving against the odds. Vehicles will take damage, and you’ll need to refuel them too, so you won’t just be able to trundle across the entire map bopping zombies out of the way with the windows rolled down.</p>
<p>As an aside, Techland originally worked on several racing games including the Xpand Rally series, and they’re drawing on some of their original in-house talent who worked on these to make sure that the vehicles in Dying Light: The Beast feel and handle as accurately and enjoyably as possible. They definitely look fun as another zombie bounces over the hood and just misses out on being lodged in the pickup truck’s cargo bed. Maybe there’ll be an achievement for that.</p>

<p>The close of our preview saw Kyle complete his mission to attract the unidentified giant monster, with this Behemoth arriving in dramatic fashion, smashing cargo crates out of the way to enter the wrecking yard arena we’ve found ourselves in. At first Kyle struggles to do much damage – his guns run out of ammunition, and the equipped machete is basically just giving this guy paper cuts.</p>
<p>However, as the rage in Kyle grows he’s suddenly able to utilise his own powers, gaining some of the same attacks the Behemoth has been using to try and turn him into Kyle soup. You can now leap high into the air, crashing down to cause a painful shockwave, while Kyle’s strength goes off the charts. After wearing the creature down, Kyle finishes the encounter by literally pulling its head off. As blood spurts from the fallen monster, our time here runs out, but tellingly, nobody wants it to end.</p>
<p>As we approach the tenth anniversary of the franchise, it seems fitting to be returning to the world of Dying Light. Perhaps most surprising is that The Beast is going to be available at no extra cost for owners of Dying Light 2: Ultimate Edition, fulfilling the promise of a second DLC expansion for that game. Going so far beyond the minimum bar feels indicative of Techland’s approach to their premiere series, and to its fans. Thus far, The Beast looks stunning, with visceral and spectacular action tied to the franchise’s most impressive visuals yet. We can’t wait to see more.</p>
