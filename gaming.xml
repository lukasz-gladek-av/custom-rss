<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/deltarune">Deltarune</a> made its debut on the Switch 2 earlier this month and now that chapters one to four are available, you might be wondering when the next one drops.</p>
<p>Well, it seems the end credits of the fourth episode have confirmed chapter 5 will be arriving in <strong>2026</strong>. There's no specific date attached to this release window, but it's scheduled for some point next year. So, there you go!</p>

<p>Deltarune originally debuted on the Switch eShop as a free download in 2019 and in a development update last December, creator Toby Fox mentioned how the fifth chapter was making "steady" progress.</p>
<p>Hopefully, this '2026' release sticks and we see the next chapter arrive within its scheduled window. We should also have a Deltarune Switch 2 review going live here on Nintendo Life at some point in the future, so be on the lookout for that.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
It's already been a lengthy journey for developer Toby Fox's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/undertale">Undertale</a> follow-up <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deltarune">Deltarune</a>. The first of its seven planned chapters originally launched in 2018, and there are still three more to go - but we now know fans won't have too long to wait until the saga continues. According to the most recently released chapter's closing credits, part five will arrive next year.
</p>
<p>
Deltarune, which charts the adventures of human teenager Kris and their lizard friend Suzie in the mystery Dark World, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/undertale-creator-says-the-rest-of-deltarune-has-not-been-made-yet">debuted as a free download in 2018</a>, and a second instalment <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deltarune-chapter-2-arrives-this-week-on-pc">showed up in September 2021</a>. It's taken nearly four years for Fox and his team to get Chapters 3 + 4 wrapped up since then (both finally made their long-awaited debut <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deltarune-available-on-switch-1-and-2-through-cross-buy-when-it-launches-with-new-nintendo-console">alongside Switch 2's launch</a> earlier this month), but part five, thankfully, won't require so much patience from fans.
</p>
<p>
As reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deltarune-chapter-5-will-release-in-2026">IGN</a>, the closing credits of Deltarune's recently released fourth chapter conclude with the words, "To be continued in Chapter 5, 2026." That's still a fair way out, then, but at least we now know it won't be another four-year wait for more.

<p>
This isn't quite what Fox originally had in mind, of course; back in 2021 he said the goal was for Deltarune's third, fourth, and fifth chapters to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/undertale-creator-working-on-deltarune-chapters-3-to-5">all launch at the same time</a>, but he eventually conceded five was still some way off, and that he wouldn't deprive fans of their Deltarune fix purely to adhere to a simultaneous launch. "I don't think anybody really wants to wait that long to release anything," Fox explained at the time. "Especially me."
</p>
<p>
But while Chapter five is, comparatively speaking, right around the corner (assuming it's a corner at the end of a hallway that takes at least six months to walk down), we've had no indication of how long Deltarune's final two chapters might take to release. For all we know, the world will be orbiting a dying sun by the time Fox is ready to wrap things up in part seven, but at least Deltarune's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deltarune-is-a-game-about-playing-and-its-bloody-brilliant">already a good time</a>, even if it <em>is</em> some way from tying up all its loose ends.

Fortunately you don't have to reach a certain level or join a specific group. Here are the quick simple steps to redeeming them:</p><ol data-cy="list"><li>Launch Anime Rising</li><li>Press the <strong>green "Store" button</strong> on the left side of your screen</li><li>Then <strong>press the "Codes" button</strong> of a blue bird near the bottom right.</li><li>Enter your code here and press the blue Redeem button to get your rewards.</li></ol><h2 data-cy="title2">Why Isn't My Anime Rising Code Working?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're having trouble redeeming a code, there are two main reasons why one usually doesn't work. Here's what you need to know:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>The code is expired</li><li>The code has been entered incorrectly</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">If a code is entered incorrectly or doesn't exist, you'll see a message that says, "Invalid code". To avoid running into this problem, we recommend <strong>copying and pasting directly from this article</strong>. Just make sure you don't accidentally end up with an extra space in your code when copying one. This is why it never hurts to double-check before redeeming a code.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Find More Anime Rising Codes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">You can always check back here for whenever new codes are added since we try to update as often as we can. However, if you want to search for Anime Rising codes yourself, there is a <a href="https://discord.gg/animerising" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dedicated Discord server</a> where they're announced. The in-game window for codes mentions each developer's Twitter account but they don't seem to post any on there.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What is Anime Rising in Roblox?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Anime Rising is a collector game that seems to be inspired by Solo Leveling. You can defeat all sorts of enemies and then resurrect them to fight for you. Over time, you'll amass a large squad of teammates to help you complete quests. Using free summons from the codes in this article, you can also get characters heavily inspired by other popular anime shows too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Jeffrey Lerman is a freelance game journalist for IGN who has been covering games for over a decade.

While many of them are known brands with solid track records, there’s always the small possibility they won’t work as intended or will damage to your controllers. Unofficial controller chargers for other platforms, including the original Switch, generally work perfectly fine, and it's very rare for an accessory like this to damage your controller. But since they don't have the official Nintendo seal of approval, this is a "buy at your own risk" situation. If you want to play it as safe as possible, the Joy-Con 2 Charging Grip is the way to go. The official grip has built-in back buttons and lets you play while charging via the detachable USB-C cable.</p><hr><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4515966-switch2joy-conchargingdocks.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4515966" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4515966-switch2joy-conchargingdocks.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4515966"></a><figcaption>Switch 2 Joy-Con Charging Docks - third-party, not licensed by Nintendo</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4515966-switch2joy-conchargingdocks.jpg"></figure><p>Of the unofficial products, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mumba-Charging-Nintendo-Switch-Controllers/dp/B0DWMQ2N7F?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mumba Charging Dock</a> has been the most popular on Amazon since the Switch 2's launch earlier this month.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Fallout: Wasteland Warfare</em> Second Edition is coming. Publisher Modiphius has announced a streamlined version of the officially licensed, narrative-focused miniature skirmish game, incorporating changes to the rules based on player feedback.</p>

<h2>The <em>Fallout: Wasteland Warfare </em>Second Edition Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, <em>Fallout: Wasteland Warfare</em> Second Edition is scheduled to arrive in the first half of 2026. This new edition will launch with box sets containing new plastic miniatures for the game. If you already own some Wasteland Warfare miniatures from <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/modiphius-announces-fallout-wasteland-warfare-expansions" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the Commonwealth</a> or from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/fallout-tv-show-miniatures-announced-by-modiphius-entertainment" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Fallout</em> TV</a> series, they will be compatible with this new edition.</p>

You play as a customizable hero from one of <em>Fallout's</em> many factions. From there, you can recruit a warband and explore a procedurally generated apocalyptic wasteland, surviving attacks from creatures, mutants, and humans.</p>

<p>Thankfully, this new edition will retain some multiplayer. These include a co-op mode where multiple players can join a single warband and explore a campaign map together. Alternatively, there is a battle mode where players can duke it out with their custom warbands.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“We’re doubling down on all the best bits of the Wasteland Warfare experience, inspired by elements of the Into the Wasteland, Homestead, and solo rules from the first edition, to give players a more refined and streamlined version of the solo campaign that’s so popular. The game really nails the feeling of Fallout: exploring the wasteland around you, being jumped by irradiated creatures, coming across other camps of survivors, raiders, or super mutants, and scavenging what you need for your warband to survive. War never changes!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Upon release, <em>Fallout: Wasteland Warfare</em> Second Edition will support fifteen different factions taken from the history of the franchise. These include staples like the Brotherhood of Steel, NCR, Super Mutants, Raiders, and Survivors, as well as more recent groups like the Minutemen, the Institute, and the Cult of the Mothman. These factions will receive further support in supplements down the line.</p>

The movie was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/10/19/konami-announces-silent-hill-2-remake-silent-hill-f-a-new-movie-and-more">first announced</a> to be in production in October 2022 during the first Silent Hill Transmission.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Return to Silent Hill</em> is being directed and co-written by Christophe Gans, who directed the 2006 <em>Silent Hill</em> film. The project also boasts a soundtrack composed by long-time series composer Akira Yamaoka. The movie is an adaptation of Silent Hill 2, which was <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/silent-hill-2/engrossing-and-unsettling">remade in 2024</a>, and centers on protagonist James Sunderland receiving a letter from his deceased wife, Mary, urging him to find her in the foggy, monster-infested town of Silent Hill. Despite being the third film adaptation of the franchise and the first since 2012’s <em>Silent Hill: Revelation</em>, <em>Return to Silent Hill </em>is not connected to the previous movies.</p><p dir="ltr">The cast includes Jeremy Irvine as James, Hannah Emily Anderson as both Mary Sunderland and Maria, and Evie Templeton as Laura. You can check out the film's original 2022 teaser (complete with commentary from Gans) below. <em>Return to Silent Hill</em> is set to premiere in theaters on January 23.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NZLrjCzVGz8"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NZLrjCzVGz8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p dir="ltr">It's been an eventful time for the Silent Hill franchise.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/sega-reveals-persona-4-revival-and-stranger-than-heaven-might-not-be-out-until-2027/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sega-reveals-persona-4-revival-and-stranger-than-heaven-might-not-be-out-until-2027.1224426/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to SEGA's <a href="https://www.segasammy.co.jp/cms/wp-content/uploads/pdf/en/ir/20250618_Management_large_MTG_all_e.pdf">latest fiscal report</a>, the recently revealed<a href="https://wccftech.com/persona-4-revival-announced-for-pc-and-consoles-with-new-trailer/"> Persona 4 Revival</a> and RGG Studio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/stranger-than-heaven-is-the-official-name-of-rgg-studios-project-century/">Stranger Than Heaven</a> might not be out on store shelves until 2027.</p>
<p>Included on a slide in the presentation about what's defined as the "<em>medium-term pipeline</em>" for SEGA and its release schedule, five announced games are listed, including Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds, which is due out on September 25, 2025.</p>
<p>Raidou Remastered: The Mystery of the Soulless Army, which is already out at this time of writing, Football Manager, set for a 2025 launch, and Persona 4 Revival and Stranger Than Heaven.</p>
<p>Both Persona 4 Revival and Stranger Than Heaven are listed as "<em>announced titles to be released in or after FY2027/3.</em>"</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>This release window doesn't lock in either game to releasing in 2027. SEGA's 2027 fiscal year will begin in the 2026 calendar year, which means either, or even both games, could still likely make it out in the back half of 2026.</p>
<p>But it does give us a sense that we could be waiting until 2027 for at least one of these games, if not both, to make it out the door.</p>
<p>We heard <a href="https://wccftech.com/persona-4-remake-seemingly-confirmed-by-spider-man/">rumors and teases</a> about Persona 4 Revival for months leading up to its official reveal, and Stranger Than Heaven was first known as <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-virtua-fighter-project-century-announced-by-like-a-dragon-series-developer-ryu-ga-gotoku-studio/">Project Century</a>&nbsp;before its official title was announced this month as part of <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/summer-game-fest/">Summer Game Fest 2025</a>. A two-year wait time for either game sounds about right, considering the pace at which modern video games are made.</p>
<p>Hopefully, we'll be hearing more about both games soon, though if they really aren't going to be out in 2026, we might not hear any more from SEGA about either game for the rest of 2025 while the teams working on them are heads-down in development.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Nobody is quite sure what the reason for the bug is. Some players report it happening while in a full party, while others said it happened to them playing solo. A few players theorize that the bug could be coming as a result of player's dealing too much damage.</p><p dir="ltr">Even before her Season 8 rework, Lilith has always been a hard fight (despite her <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-hardest-boss-in-diablo-4-has-already-been-defeated/1100-6515043/" data-ref-id="1100-6515043">being defeated for the first time</a> less than a week after Diablo 4 came out). Her various phases made her a significant challenge unless players could deal enough damage to largely ignore the fight's oppressive mechanics.</p><p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, in Season 8, players are now forced to deal with those mechanics even more than before. Even if a player can deal an incredible amount of damage, it's impossible to "brute force" through the phases, as attacks that would previously transition her into the next phase will instead only drop her health to a specific percentage. This makes for extended periods of time during where Lilith is entirely immune to damage, forcing players to dodge her various projectiles and spike waves which inflict a stacking debuff that will eventually one-shot players for a mistake.</p><p dir="ltr">A bug making Lilith unkillable wouldn't be the biggest deal if Blizzard hadn't tied an important reward, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-how-to-get-resplendent-sparks-for-uber-unique-crafting/1100-6523718/" data-ref-id="1100-6523718">Resplendent Spark</a> used to create Mythic Uniques, to the first time players kill her each season. Despite the annoying nature of the boss fight, players almost always want to defeat her at least once to claim the Spark before ignoring the boss for the rest of the season. That, however, isn't exactly possible when she can't be killed.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard hasn't issued a response to the thread on Reddit or offered an ETA on when players can expect a fix. Broken boss fights aren't the only issue Diablo 4 players are contending with, as the game's new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-new-reliquary-battle-pass-system-is-even-worse-than-players-originally-thought/1100-6532514/" data-ref-id="1100-6532514">Reliquary battle pass has also drawn criticism for its poor design</a>. Blizzard has stated its looking to make changes to Diablo 4's Reliquary system in the future, partially out of response to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-berserk-crossover-is-a-huge-wasted-opportunity/1100-6531373/" data-ref-id="1100-6531373">Diablo 4's disappointing Berserk crossover</a>, but that those changes won't be arriving as part of its upcoming Season 9. Diablo 4 Season 9, Sins of the Horadrim, is set to arrive on July 1 and will let <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-9-will-let-players-build-their-own-spells/1100-6531782/" data-ref-id="1100-6531782">players craft their own spells</a>.</p>

			<p>Mafia: The Old Country has gone gold ahead of its August 8, 2025, release date, developer Hangar 13 has announced.</p>
<p>The studio posted a short video clip on the <a href="https://x.com/mafiagame/status/1936076608135172440">official Mafia X account</a> announcing the news, as the team now shifts to focusing on polish and making sure Mafia: The Old Country is ready for prime-time when it releases in August.</p>
<p>The Old Country is a prequel and a return for the series after the last brand-new Mafia game came out in 2016. Since then, we've had a remake of the first game and remasters for the second and third games, but nothing brand new until now.</p>
<p>Hangar 13 has claimed that this will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/hangar-13-says-mafia-the-old-country-will-be-the-best-looking-mafia-game-thanks-to-unreal-engine-5/">"<em>the best looking Mafia game</em>"</a> in the series, and, through the studio's work with Italian developer Stormind Games, has put in the effort to make everything about players' journey in Italy <a href="https://wccftech.com/everything-in-mafia-the-old-country-feels-authentic-says-co-developer/">an "<em>authentic</em>" experience</a>.</p>
<p>"<em>Our priority has always been to ensure that everything in the game feels authentic</em>," said senior project manager at Stormind Games, Salvo Fallica. "<em>The details are absolutely key in keeping the immersion of the player</em>," added Hangar 13's lead writer Matthew Aitken.</p>
<p>We've seen plenty of <a href="https://wccftech.com/hangar-13-digs-into-mafia-the-old-country-gameplay-narrative-and-more-at-pax-east/">gameplay footage</a> and heard a lot from Hangar 13 about how much work they've put in to this release. We'll see in August if this is a strong return for the series or not.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/red-dead-redemption">Red Dead Redemption</a> fans believe they've now worked out the truth behind recent teases that suggested something was going on with Rockstar's beloved cowboy franchise — but it's not what many fans had been hoping for. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, John Marston actor Rob Wiethoff teased that he had "exciting news" to share that was "absolutely killing" him to keep quiet, while chatting with fans during a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption/comments/1lbextu/i_wonder_what_this_could_mean" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">livestream</a>. Wiethoff suggested that, whatever the news was, fans would hear about it by the end of this week — and that he wouldn't be the only one sharing it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The mystery deepened when Red Dead Redemption 2's Arthur Morgan actor Roger Clark subsequently confirmed that he was also aware of the news, but couldn't yet say more. Immediately, fans began to speculate that the pair were involved in some kind of announcement regarding the future of the franchise, such as the reveal of an upgraded <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> — something that has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-2-reportedly-set-for-nintendo-switch-2-by-end-of-2025-and-theres-a-rumored-next-gen-upgrade-patch-too">previously been reported as in development for Nintendo Switch 2, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With fan hopes at fever pitch, Wiethoff released a statement earlier this week clearly designed to manage expectations. In it, John Marston's voice actor said he "possibly misled some people" in regards to how exciting the announcement was, and said he did "not make announcements for Rockstar games."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I do have something I'm really excited about, I truly am, and I think you will be too," Wiethoff said. "I really do think so, but I possibly misled some people when I announced that I have something to announce that I can't talk about right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Just please recognize – and I know that you know this, but let me remind you, I guess – I do not make announcements for Rockstar Games. We all know that, I'm just reminding you I do not make announcements for Rockstar Games. Rockstar Games makes announcements for Rockstar Games, and they don't use me to do that."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/cyberboiuk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@cyberboiuk</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/Mctannen?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Mctannen</a> <br>Rob Wiethoff has clarified that his announcement has nothing to do with rockstar. <a href="https://t.co/WmlWJD1GSQ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/WmlWJD1GSQ</a></p>— jon🚬 (@jonbranham_) <a href="https://twitter.com/jonbranham_/status/1935043619754250697?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 17, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">So what is the big mystery announcement? Well, fans have now <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption/comments/1lg4jz3/was_this_the_announcement_rob_was_so_excited_for/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spotted</a> confirmation of a Red Dead Redemption and Red Dead Redemption 2 cast reunion, which is set to take place at the National Gaming Expo in Tampa, Florida from August 8 to August 10.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Was this the announcement [Wiethoff] was so excited for?" wrote one fan on reddit. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think so," added replied.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It would be great if they waited for this convention to reveal there's going to be SOME kind of update, remastering, DLC, a next chapter etc," said a third. "It's definitely wishful thinking on my part."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Red Dead Redemption 2 originally launched for PS4 and Xbox One back in October 2018, and arrived on PC a year later. Fans have long hoped for a revamped version designed to take advantage of the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, but, more than five years after those consoles launched, a re-release or remaster is yet to arrive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, Rockstar has been busy during this time building Grand Theft Auto 6, which after its recent delay will now launch on May 26, 2026. Surely there's time to pop out a Red Dead Redemption 2 patch before then?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

Depending on the parasite type, you'll either respawn or can fight researchers while infected.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eliminating creatures and infected players will give you credits and level you up. This will help you unlock new weapons for taking on tougher creatures. But you can also use traps to wipe out hordes of parasites via decontamination or electricity.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jeffrey Lerman is a freelance game journalist for IGN who has been covering games for over a decade.

                <p>In the 12 years since the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/grand-theft-auto-v-review/1900-6414475/" data-ref-id="1900-6414475">Grand Theft Auto 5</a>, two of the three main characters, Franklin Clinton and Trevor Philips, have reappeared in Grand Theft Auto Online, while Michael De Santa has only been mentioned. But if the actors behind these iconic characters get their way, they'd reunite GTA 5's trio for one last heist. </p><p>Earlier this month, Steven Ogg (Trevor), Ned Luke (Michael), and Shawn Fonteno (Franklin) made a joint appearance together at Comic Con Brussels (via <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/gta-5s-michael-trevor-franklin-want-gta-6-return-in-final-score-story-dlc-3216565/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dexerto</a>). At the 12:40 mark in the video below, the actors spoke about their desire to reunite in a DLC for GTA Online called The Final Score, which was named by Luke. The trio stressed that Rockstar doesn't currently have any plans to bring them back together, and urged fans to campaign for it.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkGCcdAhJUM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KkGCcdAhJUM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Rockstar has yet to shed light on whether GTA Online will continue following the release of Grand Theft Auto 6 next year. Take-Two executives have suggested <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-suggests-that-current-gta-online-could-continue-after-gta-6-releases/1100-6529517/" data-ref-id="1100-6529517">that GTA Online may be unaffected</a>, but they've stopped short of confirming that. If the actors manage to convince Rockstar to bring them back one more time, it seems more likely to be for GTA 6 than GTA 5. </p><p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5s-latest-major-update-is-live-with-a-money-laundering-theme/1100-6532494/" data-ref-id="1100-6532494">GTA Online rolled out another large update</a> that lets players assume control of their own money laundering operation. One of the developers of GTA 3 recently disclosed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-dev-wanted-online-mode-as-far-back-as-2001/1100-6532533/" data-ref-id="1100-6532533">the team wanted an online GTA game</a> as far back as 2001. There have also been hints that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-could-carry-forward-this-feature-from-gta-5/1100-6532421/" data-ref-id="1100-6532421">more major music personalities may get their own radio stations</a> in GTA 6.</p><p>Grand Theft Auto 6 will launch on May 26, 2026 for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

                <p>Since its release on Thursday, Rematch <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rematch-a-soccer-game-from-the-developers-of-sifu-is-off-to-a-hot-start/1100-6532582/" data-ref-id="1100-6532582">has pulled in some solid numbers</a> and is picking up steam. With its relatively simple gameplay, Rematch is an enjoyable game to watch and play. play. Of course, with a growing player-base comes questions about what's next for the game, and the developers found time to address them. </p><p>Over on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2138720/view/534353549843235107" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam page</a>, the team behind Rematch went through a laundry list of updates, how they're working to prevent lag that affects gameplay, and addressed the potential of crossplay down the line. However, they also assured players they're taking one thing at a time.</p><p>"We want to extend a huge thank you to everyone who joined us during the Early Access launch and shared valuable feedback," the statement read. "Seeing players from all over the world enjoying Rematch and expressing their excitement online has been incredibly rewarding."</p><p>The team had initially wanted to implement a crossplay feature, but "unforeseen technical complexities" prevented it from being ready on time. They added that they understand players' frustration and are going to get it working soon.</p><p>"It's very important for us that our players are able to enjoy Rematch with their friends, so along with bugfixes, crossplay is our absolute highest priority. We're committed to delivering this feature swiftly, and we'll share a more precise deadline as soon as possible."</p><p>Here are also issues they're looking into for the game:</p><ul><li><strong>Core gameplay:</strong> Simple fixes like improving the sliding tackle, tweaks to goalkeeper mechanics, to the dribbling system and wall contact. All the while taking into account community feedback. The idea would be that as they move forward, test servers will be at work so they can try out new features and improvements in a live environment.</li><li><strong>Competitive features:</strong> They are currently designing a tournament system with a leaderboard system for players above Elite ranking. There's also a club creation system in the works that will be aiming to provide more variety for competitive players.</li><li><strong>Social components:</strong> While crossplay is their top priority, other features are also being worked on such as being able to spectate your squad’s game when you join a squad. This will allow players to team up and rematch with teammates they enjoyed playing with, and more.</li><li><strong>Casual play features:</strong> Aside from a new quick play game mode and a rotating game mode queue, AI-controlled bots will be used so that players are able to train with and against the computer in both workshops or in dedicated game modes.</li></ul><p>"Please remember that we are not a huge team, and that these features take time, so don't expect all this by the end of the year! We will communicate on a more precise roadmap for upcoming seasons as soon as we have better visibility on when we can deliver on these intentions."</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/rematch/" data-ref-id="5000-654961">Rematch</a> is available now for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. It is part of the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate game catalog, but can also be purchased for $30.</p>
