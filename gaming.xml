We're using machine translation for the article announcing the <em>Evangelion </em>revival.</p><p>Yoko Taro will be scripting the series, with production being handled by CloverWorks and <em>Rebuild of Evangelion </em>outfit Studio Khara. Keiichi Okabe, who's written music not only for <em>NieR </em>but also for its predecessor series <em>Drakengard </em>(as well as <em>Hyrule Warriors </em>and more), will be on composition duties.</p><figure role="group">

<p>Direction will be handled by <em>Rebuild of Evangelion</em>'s Kazuya Tsurumaki and <em>Chainsaw Man</em>'s Toko Yatabe, but beyond the staffers mentioned, we don't know much else about the new <em>Evangelion </em>series, including whether it'll be a reworked version of the original or an entirely new story.</p><p>What we do know, however, is that Yoko Taro has <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stellar-blade-x-nier-automata-taro-yoko-hyung-tae-kim" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">spoken in the past</a> about how <em>Evangelion </em>influenced his work, and it's not hard to see how; like <em>Evangelion</em>, Taro's work combines high-octane action with deep philosophical themes (and, some might say, similarly nonsensical endings).</p><p>Whether or not production of the new <em>Evangelion </em>affects Taro and Okabe's work on <em>NieR </em>remains to be seen. It's worth noting that a new <em>NieR </em>game hasn't been released for around nine years; the last was 2017's <em>NieR: Automata</em>.</p><p>However, there may be cause to hope on that front. In a recent trailer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nier-automata-sales-10m-followup-tease-possibly" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c8a6dece-ec13-453e-8894-717f0a1a0350" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">announcing 10 million sales</a> for the game, a closing message simply read "<em>NieR: Automata </em>to be continued...", suggesting that more <em>NieR </em>(and perhaps even more <em>Automata</em>) could be on the way.</p>
<p>We'll likely have to wait a little while before we get more information about Yoko Taro's plans for <em>Evangelion</em>, and, indeed, his plans for <em>NieR</em> as well. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

              <p>Logan Paul’s sale of the Illustrator Pikachu card last weekend made a lot of headlines, but they were almost entirely based on the extraordinary $16.5 million price paid for the plastic-cased piece of cardboard. However, what surrounds the sale, and the use of prediction market gambling, might perhaps be the real story.</p> <p>Before we get started, let’s be completely clear: we’re not accusing anyone mentioned of wrongdoing. Lots of questions are being asked, and we are interested in finding out their answers.</p> <p>On February 15, <a href="https://kotaku.com/logan-paul-illustrator-pikachu-psa10-auction-pokemon-card-2000669385">a weeks-long auction of Logan Paul’s&nbsp;<em>Pokémon&nbsp;</em>card collection came to an end</a>, with winning bids exceeding the market prices for the listed cards by sometimes as much as 70 times. The standout among them was the PSA 10 Illustrator Pikachu, one of only 41 of the card ever printed, and the only one to have been graded a perfect 10; it sold for a record-smashing $16,492,000. That, of course, caused headlines around the world, as it was the most expensive collectible card sale of all time, fetching over three times more than any Pokémon card has ever sold for before.</p>

 <p>Unusually, the winning bidder for the card has been identified. It’s AJ Scaramucci, the venture capitalist son of financier and former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci, who bought the card for $13.3 million, and then paid the extra $3.2 million in auction house Goldin’s fees. Even more unusually, Scaramucci is said to have <a href="https://eu.usatoday.com/story/money/2026/02/16/logan-paul-sells-rare-pokemon-card-auction/88701757007/#:~:text=Logan%20Paul%20bought%20the%20Pikachu,Feb.%2015%20at%20$13.3%20million.">“surprised” Goldin</a> by being in the company’s headquarters in person at the moment the sale completed. As Goldin put it in a press release, “Originally, Paul agreed to personally visit the winning bidder to hand-deliver the card; however, the winner shocked the crowd with his presence as he was already at Goldin HQ.” Thus there was the opportunity for a photoshoot with Paul and Scaramucci as the card was handed over, still attached to its garish chain <a href="https://kotaku.com/logan-pauls-latest-stunt-paying-6-million-for-rare-pi-1848743633">as worn during Wrestlemania</a>.</p> <h2>Cutting It Close</h2> <p>The obvious question is: why? Why did someone pay quite so much money for something that has no intrinsic value beyond being collectible. The answer, in so many directions, is money. Paul paid $5.275 million for the card in 2022 in an attention-seeking move, and obviously wanted to profit from that stunt. Scaramucci said he thought the card would one day be worth $100 million, so he presumably sees it as an investment. Goldin got to charge a seven-figure fee for hosting a page on their website for a bit. But even after all this, there was more money to be made.</p>

 <p>The card started its final night of the auction at $6.3 million, where it had sat throughout the final week of the 42-day auction, a modest increase from the massively over-inflated price Paul paid for the card four years ago. During this last day of bidding it rose to $6.882 million, where it stayed until the last moment. Auctioneers Goldin <a href="https://www.oddschecker.com/us/insight/specials/entertainment/20260101-logan-pauls-pikachu-illustrator-sale-price-odds-76pp-chance-pauls-pikachu-sells-for-over-$7-million">had predicted</a> the card would sell for between $7 million and $12 million, and had already advanced Paul $2.5 million ahead of the sale (this was featured as part of the Netflix vanity documentary <a href="https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81505384"><em>King of Collectibles</em></a>), so hopes were that it would still climb a little higher. Then, at the last moment, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2026/02/16/americas/pokemon-card-logan-paul-record-auction-intl-hnk#:~:text=As%20Monday's%20bidding%20drew%20to,million%20from%2097%20total%20bids.">a flurry of bids</a> came in during “an extended bidding period” when it suddenly shot up ten million to the unimaginable price of $16.5 million.</p>

 <p>Obviously, anyone who’s tried to buy something desirable on eBay is used to seeing prices skyrocket in the closing few minutes, but this was quite extraordinary. Fortunately, Guinness World Records were in the room <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2026/2/logan-pauls-rare-pokemon-card-becomes-most-expensive-ever-sold-in-record-setting-auction">to capture the record-breaking moment</a>.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000672014" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000672014"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000672014">© Goldin / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>Speculative Betting</h2> <p>Attention then turns to Polymarket, the cryptocurrency-based prediction market where people can bet on absolutely anything they wish, so long as it’s in the future. Ahead of the final day, Polymarket was predicting a 72 percent chance the card would sell for over $7 million, meaning had it sold for the $6.882 million it was sitting at before the extended bidding, a lot of people would have been disappointed.</p>

 <p>However, Polymarket’s odds flipped much more in the better’s favor the moment that price went over $10 million. At $8m it sat at 61 percent, but at $10m that dropped to 40 percent. And as for $15 million: surely only a fool would have taken the odds of 11 percent. Because as <a href="https://www.oddschecker.com/us/insight/specials/entertainment/20260101-logan-pauls-pikachu-illustrator-sale-price-odds-76pp-chance-pauls-pikachu-sells-for-over-$7-million"><em>Oddschecker</em> put it at the time</a>, “This would require a historic bidding war and a sale far above Goldin’s top estimate of $12 million. Traders view this as a long-shot outcome.”</p> <p>So that worked out rather well for <a href="https://polymarket.com/@0x4815162342">the person who won $265,217</a> betting it would hit super-high prices, especially given it was the account’s first ever and only Polymarket bet. In total, five bets were placed by the account:</p> <p>$98,814 at 58 percent for going over $10 million<br> $154,967 at 42 percent for going over $12m<br> $131,164 at 17 percent for going over $15 million<br> $195 at an unknown percentage for going over $18 million<br> $1,187 at an unknown percentage for going over $20 million</p>

 <p>This could look like the betting of a person who felt extremely confident that the price was going to hit between $12 and $15 million, and pretty certain it wasn’t going to reach $18 million, but figured it’d look suspicious if they didn’t put a bet there anyway.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Someone just won $265K correctly predicting the sale price of <a href="https://twitter.com/LoganPaul?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@LoganPaul</a>’s Pokémon Illustrator card.</p> <p>This was his first and only bet ever on Polymarket.</p> <p>What did he know? <a href="https://t.co/rQA3p5jDNZ">pic.twitter.com/rQA3p5jDNZ</a></p> <p>— Car (@CarOnPolymarket) <a href="https://twitter.com/CarOnPolymarket/status/2023259200730611743?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 16, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>A few people have since raised questions about this, like X user @surgieboi who specializes in eBay actions of sports and TCG collectibles. Replying to Goldin’s CEO Ken Goldin’s boasting during the successful night (along with the most awkward video) as the price went over $13 million “AND RISING,” surgieboi asked, “<span>Was it rising before your $4,000,000 estimate pre-auction (screenshot attached of your own data), or after Logan, I mean the anonymous Polymarket account bet that the auction would cross $15,000,000?”</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Was it rising before your $4,000,000 estimate pre-auction (screenshot attached of your own data), or after Logan, I mean the anonymous Polymarket account bet that the auction would cross $15,000,000? </p> <p>Coincidentally, aligning one-to-one with this latest content push. I’m… <a href="https://t.co/CxR9ai7LDH">pic.twitter.com/CxR9ai7LDH</a></p> <p>— 𝖘𝖚𝖗𝖌𝖎𝖊𝖇𝖔𝖎 (@surgieboi) <a href="https://twitter.com/surgieboi/status/2023254753908490316?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 16, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The reference to the $4 million figure comes from data embedded in Goldin’s website that shows the card was listed with “estimated_value: 4000000.” It’s unclear if this is just a placeholder or something official, and we’ve reached out to Goldin to ask. And indeed whether the auction house has any concerns regarding the Polymarket betting. And just to be clear, we’re in no way endorsing the many claims made by surgieboi in his post.</p> <h2>Liquidated Marketplace</h2> <p>This is not the first controversy surrounding the Illustrator Pikachu card since Logan Paul bought it, and a previous issue came back to bite him after the sale. Keen as the amateur boxing victim is on web3 nonsense, as seen in <a href="https://kotaku.com/youtube-logan-paul-cryptozoo-nft-game-refund-lawsuit-1851143787">his experiments with NFTs</a> and <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cze386d3enpo">forays into crypto</a>, in 2022 he attempted to sell “shares” in the card via Liquid Marketplace. Liquid Marketplace (LM), co-owned by Paul, was an online platform that allowed people to buy an imaginarily-sliced portion of a high-value collectible, and then hope that when it was resold they’d profit along with the owner. And boy, if you’d bet “No” on Polymarket over whether it would still be in good standing in 2026, you’d have made a profit. The <a href="https://www.capitalmarketstribunal.ca/sites/default/files/2024-06/oth_20240619_liquid-marketplace.pdf">Canadian government has accused LM</a> of being a “multi-layered fraud,” saying the company had “misappropriated approximately $3 million, including through hidden payments to shell companies, for the personal enrichment of the LMP Principals.” (It’s important to note that Paul was not listed as one of these Principals, and nor does his name appear anywhere within the filing.)</p> <p>Paul had attempted to sell 51 percent of the Pikachu card on LM, but in the end only sold 5.4 percent for around $270,000. As the company fell apart, and customers began to panic, Paul says he bought the card back for the original price and ensured buyers that their investments could be withdrawn over the next year. <a href="https://x.com/LoganPaul/status/2023428274542563508">In a recent post on Logan Paul’s X account</a> after the sale, he addressed the controversy noting, “For reasons outside of my control, the LM site then went offline,” but claims he then paid to get the site back up and ensured any remaining money could be reclaimed. Oddly, he never mentions his co-ownership of the company at the center of all the problems.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">What an epic night. I’m truly grateful for the Pokémon community, Ken Goldin, and my team for making last night a historic moment for the hobby.</p> <p>To address concerns regarding the ownership history of the card, now for the facts:</p> <p>I had originally offered to sell up to 51% of the…</p> <p>— Logan Paul (@LoganPaul) <a href="https://twitter.com/LoganPaul/status/2023428274542563508?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 16, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <h2>Shiny Cardboard</h2> <p>A couple of other things of note regarding this peculiar sale. First is to address the grading of this particular card. Of the few dozen Illustrator Pikachu cards that PSA has graded, only one has ever received the gold standard of a 10, with 15 managing a 9 and 12 getting a grade 8. But if you look at Paul’s card, that 10 does feel a little odd. And if you’ve recently tried to get a card graded with the company, you’ll know that something as tiny as an almost invisible print line on the rear of the card is enough to ensure it can’t score a 10. This is a point well addressed by former Blizzard developer <a href="https://x.com/PezRadar/status/2023540758649991373">Adam Fletcher in a post on X</a>, where he explains in detail how standards at PSA have risen over the years, and especially so in the last couple. There’s no way this card would be a 10 if graded today. It makes the whole thing even more of a folly.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Seen so much commentary on this thing. Why not chime in? Has some info on grading/comping cards.</p> <p>First, Logan Paul is a sleezebag. Won't get into his fractional share nonsense or all his other past behavior but I feel like this is generally known.</p> <p>As for the card… I've seen… <a href="https://t.co/UuQtcsXwtr">https://t.co/UuQtcsXwtr</a></p> <p>— Adam Fletcher (@PezRadar) <a href="https://twitter.com/PezRadar/status/2023540758649991373?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 16, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>And finally, new owner of the world’s most expensive piece of cardboard AJ Scaramucci has said that it’s his wish for the Illustrator Pikachu to be placed in the recently opened <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-museum-gift-shop-merch-n64-virtual-boy-wii-u-1851657878">Nintendo Museum</a> in Kyoto, Japan, “and cement it as the ‘Mona Lisa’ of the Pokémon Franchise.” It seems incredibly unlikely, though, that Nintendo would want to pay the insurance.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Let's get this into the Nintendo Museum in Kyoto and cement it as the "Mona Lisa" of the Pokémon Franchise. <a href="https://twitter.com/Nintendo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Nintendo</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/Pokemon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Pokemon</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/Museum_Nintendo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Museum_Nintendo</a> <a href="https://t.co/SPe56Jo6PB">pic.twitter.com/SPe56Jo6PB</a></p> <p>— AJ Scaramucci (@jedimooch) <a href="https://twitter.com/jedimooch/status/2023888485401457021?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 17, 2026</a></p></blockquote>

<p>A major expansion is on the horizon for World of Warcraft players with the long-awaited release of Midnight, with the release date for WoW Midnight now right around the corner.</p>



<p>The release date for the expansion was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-release-date-announced/" id="160714" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first revealed back in November</a>, meaning fans have been ticking down the hours waiting for the next big slew of content in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/blizzard/" id="1092" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blizzard</a> masterpiece.</p>



<p>If you’re eagerly awaiting the WoW Midnight release date, Insider Gaming has all the important details.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-wow-midnight-coming-out-release-date-explained">When is WoW Midnight Coming Out? Release Date, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New landscapes. Image via Blizzard</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>World of War Midnight is set for release on Monday, February 2, so the countdown to launch is well and truly on.</strong></p>



<p>Midnight brings the long-awaited arrival of housing to WoW, something players have been clamouring for, and it’s expected to be a busy release period. Naturally, that may come alongside server stress, so prepare yourself for potential problems.</p>



<ul>

</ul>



<p>WoW has the capacity to deal with the majority of server stress issues, however, so there shouldn’t be too many major problems.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-wow-midnight-early-access">When is WoW Midnight Early Access?</h2>



<p><strong>Early access for World of Warcraft Midnight is set for Thursday, February 26, giving players an extra weekend to dive into all the brand-new content.</strong></p>



<p>Like many other games, however, entry to early access comes at a cost, as it requires an additional purchase. Given the cost of maintaining WoW access, players may want to consider holding out for the full release.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-wow-midnight-start-times">What Are The WoW Midnight Start Times?</h2>



<p><strong>WoW Midnight is set to be released at 3 PM on March 2, with the early access launch coming four days earlier at the same time.</strong></p>



<p>That means a late afternoon launch for those in the United States, while those in Europe face a late night. Meanwhile, those in Asia and Oceania have to wait until the next day.</p>



<p>The exact release times have been shared by Blizzard and are available in the table below. We’ve separated the main release time and early access into different columns.</p>

In <a href="https://www.gameswirtschaft.de/marketing-pr/star-trek-voyager-across-the-unknown-daedalic-launch-190226/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">another Games Wirtschaft piece</a> (for which, again, we're using machine translation), Daedalic seems to suggest the game is the most successful launch in its history, period.</p><figure role="group">

<p>A quick look at <a href="https://steamdb.info/publisher/Daedalic+Entertainment/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SteamDB's stats for Daedalic</a> as a publisher suggests that <em>Across the Unknown</em> hasn't achieved its highest peak concurrent player count on PC yet, although there's plenty of time for it to do so.</p><p>It's certainly Daedalic's most successful PC launch within the last few years, at any rate; the only game to rival it within the last three years is <em>Barotrauma</em>, which achieved a peak player count of just under 20,000 upon its exit <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dive-into-europas-depths-in-barotrauma-now-available-in-steam-early-access" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="dc2e1274-bfa3-46d9-823e-918d872ca94f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">from Early Access</a> in March 2023.</p><p>The publisher arguably sorely needs a success like this; while <em>Barotrauma </em>proved a success in 2023, that same year's <em>The Lord of the Rings: Gollum </em>was so disastrous for Daedalic that it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lord-of-rings-gollum-studio-reportedly-abandons-game-development" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b8cc9b20-8e39-4bf6-a4db-fd132661ca91" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">closed down its development division</a> following the game's failure.</p><p>Since then, things haven't exactly been rosy for Daedalic. Let's hope this one continues to sell well and keeps everyone at the studio in a job.</p>
<p><em>Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown </em>is available now for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch 2. Stay tuned for more on this and all other things Daedalic Entertainment as and when we get them.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Slay The Spire 2 is ready to enter Early Access, just like its predecessor did all those years ago. It’s the perfect time to take on community feedback and balance the various cards and characters, but there’s one thing on everyone’s mind—will the sequel have multiplayer?</p>







<p>It was one of the most requested features for the original Slay The Spire, and for good reason; who wouldn’t want to ascend the Spire with their friends? Well, now’s the time to find out whether Mega Crit took on the fan feedback, and to see whether <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/slay-the-spire-2/" id="3528" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Slay The Spire 2</a> will have multiplayer during Early Access.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-slay-the-spire-2-early-access-have-multiplayer">Does Slay The Spire 2 Early Access Have Multiplayer?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Stand together! Image by Mega Crit.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, Slay The Spire 2 will have multiplayer during Early Access, as you and up to three friends can face the Spire together. </strong></p>



<p>This is thanks to the brand new online Co-Op mode, which brings a whole new level of complexity to the game. From multiplayer exclusive cards to powerful team synergies, you and your friends can work together to ascend the Spire and beat the game. </p>



<ul>

</ul>



<p>Of course, this is brand new to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/slay-the-spire-2-early-access-release-date-exact-start-times/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/slay-the-spire-2-early-access-release-date-exact-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Slay The Spire 2</a>, with the original game not having any form of multiplayer or co-op available. Whilst you can still play the game solo, there’s no denying that strategizing with three friends will be a thrill like no other—but can you do it from the same device?</p>







<h2 id="h-does-slay-the-spire-2-early-access-have-split-screen-co-op">Does Slay The Spire 2 Early Access Have Split-Screen Co-Op?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Helpful notes. Image by Mega Crit.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>At the moment, it doesn’t seem like Slay The Spire 2 will have split-screen co-op during Early Access. </strong></p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/mega-crit/" id="3619" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mega Crit</a> have only mentioned that the game will have online co-op, and there remains no mention as to whether there will be anything to do with split-screen. However, the likelihood is that whilst it remains in Early Access, co-op features will remain exclusively online.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming:</strong> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-pokemon-pokopia/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-pokemon-pokopia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">What Is Pokémon Pokopia? </a></li>
</ul>



<p>That’s not to say that it won’t change in the future, though. As the game rolls out on different platforms once Early Access is complete, there’s a chance that local multiplayer features could be added. Until then, though, you’ll have to team up with your friends across different devices. </p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-9-revenant-shadows">Resident Evil Requiem</a> is almost here, but that hasn't stopped evildoers from dropping lots of spoilers all over the Internet, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-issues-resident-evil-requiem-plea-as-leaks-become-a-flood">prompting Capcom to acknowledge the situation</a> ahead of the final weekend before the game's launch. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-2">Resident Evil 2</a> director (and famous games industry bad boy) Hideki Kamiya had stronger words for the leakers.</p>
<p>Through <a href="https://x.com/HidekiKamiya_X">his X/Twitter account</a>, the creative commented on the ongoing drama and launched a personal attack against the folks who are ruining other fans' fun before the game hits both the shelves and digital storefronts. <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival-horror/resident-evil-requiem-leakers-deserve-to-die-ten-thousand-deaths-former-series-director-hideki-kamiya-says-i-pray-they-are-cursed-to-never-play-the-game-again/">GamesRadar+ translated the post</a>, but you can find the original one below:</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="ja">確かバイオ2の時も終盤の展開を写真週刊誌にスッパ抜かれたよなー…<br>テメエ個人の利己的な満足のために、楽しみにしてるユーザーの気持ちも、力を尽くして制作したクリエイターの気持ちも踏み躙る、全ての人の幸せを破壊する唾棄すべき行為で、万死に値するだろ…二度とゲームを遊べない呪いにかかれ… <a href="https://t.co/iKueo8axFC">https://t.co/iKueo8axFC</a></p>— 神谷英樹🍀 Hideki Kamiya🍀 (@HidekiKamiya_X) <a href="https://twitter.com/HidekiKamiya_X/status/2025040184614728119?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 21, 2026</a></blockquote></div>

<p>First, he pointed out RE2 actually went through something similar due to a magazine's poor handling of pre-release leaks: "Towards the end of development on Resident Evil 2, I'm sure there were some leaks that were exposed in a weekly magazine." Mind you, being aware of leaks (and even resharing them) isn't uncommon these days, but things were different back in the day. Still, <em>actual plot spoilers</em>, especially so close to a game's release, are in bad taste in my opinion.</p>
<p>Regardless, the RE Requiem leaks are coming from less official sources and aren't a matter of an outlet slipping up. Thus, cracking down on the leakers is far more difficult. Kamiya said there's almost nothing to gain from leaks that ultimately hurt those who worked hard on the games: "Trampling on the feelings of the people who are looking forward to the game, and the creatives who worked so hard to make it... Destroying everyone's joy, just for these assholes' self-gratification."</p><p>Towards the end of his port, the developer's meaner side reappeared: "Should you commit these contemptible acts, you deserve to die ten thousand deaths," he declared before going with a softer alternative that's just praying "they are cursed to never play the game again."</p>
<p>It must be noted Kamiya is a much friendlier individual in person, but he's well-known for his harsh attitude online, one which, if you ask me, is often justified based on who/what he often has to deal with.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The sequel to the incredibly popular deck-building roguelike Slay The Spire was officially announced back in April, 2024, and now almost two years later, its release date has officially been announced. </p>







<p>However, that comes with a major caveat: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/slay-the-spire-2/" id="3528" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Slay The Spire 2</a> is first releasing in Early Access, with an official full release date still unconfirmed. But if you’re eager to tackle the mysteries of the Spire, then you won’t have to wait long, as Early Access is right around the corner.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-slay-the-spire-2-early-access-release-date">What Is The Slay The Spire 2 Early Access Release Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Who will you play as? Image by Mega Crit.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Mega Crit announced that Slay The Spire 2 will enter Early Access on March 5, 2026, though the full release date remains unknown. </strong></p>



<p>Whilst it might sound confusing to some, the original Slay The Spire was actually released in the same way. It arrived in Early Access, and after almost two years’ worth of community-led finetuning and balancing, the game was officially released as the complete package.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming:</strong> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-pokemon-pokopia/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-pokemon-pokopia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">What Is Pokémon Pokopia?</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Mega Crit mentioned on Slay The Spire 2’s Steam page that they expect to follow a similar schedule with the sequel. So, if all goes according to plan, Slay The Spire 2 should ideally officially launch as a complete package by late 2027 or early 2028. Of course, these dates are speculation, so don’t put too much trust in them, but fingers crossed that it arrives sooner rather than later.</p>



<h2 id="h-slay-the-spire-2-early-access-start-times">Slay The Spire 2 Early Access Start Times</h2>



<p><strong>You’ll want to be up and ready in the morning, as Slay The Spire 2 will be launching in Early Access on Steam at 10 AM PT on March 5.</strong></p>

</ul>



<p>Of course, not everyone diving into Slay The Spire 2’s Early Access will be native to the PT time zone, so for everybody else, Insider Gaming has adjusted the release time for your convenience. If you don’t see your time zone, let a staff member know, and it’ll be added! </p>

            <p>The vibes are rotten out there if you work anywhere near video games. 2026 is yet another year off to a terrible start when it comes to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-is-laying-off-40-devs-at-studio-working-on-splinter-cell-remake-but-confirms-the-game-is-still-in-production">layoffs</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-troubled-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-dead-as-publisher-kills-multiple-projects-closes-studios-and-orders-staff-back-to-the-office">project cancellations</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-closes-acclaimed-demons-souls-and-shadow-of-the-colossus-remake-studio-bluepoint-despite-acknowledging-it-had-delivered-exceptional-experiences-for-the-playstation-community">studio closures that often don't make a lick of sense</a>. Despite all this, though, US consumer spending on video games has gone up year-on-year.</p>
<p>Via <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/us-video-game-spending-rose-3-in-january-driven-by-596m-from-subscription-services-us-monthly-charts">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, we've gotten a quick look at Circana's latest data on console and PC content spending during January 2026. The year-on-year rise was of 3% (getting it to $4.3 billion by last month). "This growth was driven by a 23% increase in non-mobile subscription services, generating $596 million in revenue." We'd been hearing for a while that, even after price increases across the board, premium subscription services were driving a lot of growth these days, and the data continues to back those assessments up.</p>
<p>"Hardware spend reached $248 million, up 16% compared to January 2025" despite PS5 (down 17%), Xbox Series X/S (down 27%), and Nintendo Switch (down 79%) all seeing substantial year-on-year declines. It's all explained by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>'s strong launch period and hold despite a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-source-blames-switch-2-holiday-sales-slowdown-on-the-economic-landscape-and-the-absence-of-a-major-western-game-despite-the-release-of-metroid-prime-4-beyond">slower-than-desirable Christmas season</a>. PS5 continued to be leading in the US market, though.</p>
<p>Perhaps more shocking (at least to disgruntled Call of Duty fans and outsiders) is that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review">Black Ops 7</a> has been topping the charts during the January 2026 period. Its initial launch was well below Microsoft and Xbox's high expectations, but we're talking about CoD here, and the IP continues to be <em>the</em> rival to beat in the FPS space.

            <p>Microsoft's new gaming CEO Asha Sharma has responded to concerns surrounding her background in AI, as well as her lack of previous gaming-related roles.</p>
<p>Sharma was announced to be taking over from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> following Friday's shock news that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/today-marks-an-exciting-new-chapter-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-retiring-amid-major-leadership-shakeup-that-sees-microsofts-coreai-president-taking-over-roll">Xbox head would be retiring from Microsoft after nearly 40 years with the company</a>. Sarah Bond, who many had presumed would eventually succeed Spencer, also announced she would be leaving Xbox at this same time.</p>
<p>When word came out that Sharma would be taking over as Xbox's head of gaming, many raised concerns about her background in AI (Sharma was previously Microsoft's president of CoreAI). However, Sharma has now seeked to calm these concerns, stating to <a href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/new-microsoft-gaming-ceo-asha-sharma-xbox-games-ai-1236668829/">Variety</a> she has "no tolerance" for what she classifies as "bad" AI.</p>
<p>"AI has long been part of gaming and will continue to be," Sharma told the publication, stating that industry needs new "growth engines". That said, the new Xbox head added "great stories are created by humans", and not by machines.</p><p>As for her lack of professional roles within the gaming sector specifically, on the announcement of her new position Sharma made "three commitments" to the Xbox community: "Great games", the "return of Xbox", and the "future of play". She has since affirmed that she wants Xbox to tell stories that make people "feel something" when they play, complete with "deep emotional resonance" and a "distinct point of view". Sharma cited Campo Santo's 2016 first-person mystery <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/firewatch">Firewatch</a> as a game that had this kind of impact on her.</p>
<p>Sharma admitted she had "a lot to learn" in her new role within the gaming industry, however she is committed to "being grounded in what the community is telling" Xbox. "I'm coming into gaming as a platform builder," she said, with her goal to "earn the right to be trusted by players and developers". She will do this by demonstrating "consistency" over time, Sharma added.</p>
<p>We can expect to hear more about what Xbox has in store next month, during the annual GDC conference, Sharma said, before teasing some bigger announcements to come during an Xbox Games Showcase this spring.</p>
<p>For more, over the weekend <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-xbox-president-sarah-bond-bids-farewell-to-xbox-staff">Sarah Bond shared her farewell to Xbox staff</a>, where said she will "remain on as a Special Advisor to Asha to help ensure a smooth transition," but stressed, "this is the right time for me to take my next step, both personally and professionally".</p>

            <p>Make sure the dildos are flying at half mast. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/saints-row">Saints Row</a> 1 design director Chris Stockman has said he believes the series is "dead", following conversations with Embracer Group about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/saints-rows-original-design-director-is-pitching-a-grounded-70s-open-world-prequel-with-absolutely-no-dildobats">his pitch for a prequel</a>. According to the developer, who currently heads VR studio Bit Planet Games, that chatter about a potential Saints Rowssurection post <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embracer-close-volition-developer-of-red-faction-and-saints-row">Embracer's closing of Volition</a> has ended in the publishers ghosting Stockman.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Stockman's pitch for a Saints Row comeback - revolving around a trip back to the 70s to unearth how the series' gangs came to be via an adventure with a similar tone to the series first couple of entries - gained traction online late last year. The developer <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SaintsRow/comments/1ok2dh3/comment/nm7n1xa/">subsequently revealed</a> current series owners Embracer had expressed interest in hearing him out on it.</p>
<p>Sadly, the latest updates Stockman's offered in chats on <a href="https://discord.com/channels/598114267744698370/1450558651399147620/1461431635680559260">Bit Planet's Discord server</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-think-the-franchise-is-dead-says-saints-row-design-director">Europeanvideogamer</a>) don't paint a very rosy picture in terms of how his resuscitation efforts are working out. "I think the franchise is dead, unfortunately," he told one user during a January exchange. "I get the sense that Embracer has zero ability to do anything with it. I wish things were different. I tried my best to offer a path forward but they've ghosted me."</p>
<p>Also, in case you were wondering, Stockman isn't sure whether Saints Row newslady Jane Valderamma was based on Family Guy newslady Tricia Takanawa. I didn't need to tell you that, but it was the subject of that January Discord chat immediately prior to Stockman dropping the bombshell that he thinks Saints Row's gone the way of the dodo. Boy, sometimes things escalate quickly.</p><p>For what it's worth, the developer's subsequently emphasised in a comment on <a href="https://discord.com/channels/598114267744698370/1450558651399147620/1473450909504766115">February 17th</a> that the ball is still very much in Embracer's court if they want to license or contract the Saints Row series out to his studio. However, he says he's "done all I can do to try and make that happen".</p>
<p>So, things are looking bleak if you're holding out for a dildo-batless revival for Saints Row headed up by some series veterans.</p>

            <p>Grok, the generative AI chatbot on X (formerly Twitter), reportedly had an update delay because it wasn't a good enough expert on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>. This came from its owner Elon Musk, who apparently was dissatisfied with his <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce8gz8g2qnlo">non-consentual nude creating</a>, formerly <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4g8r34nxeno">Hitler-praising</a>, tool.</p>
<p>This report comes from <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-xai-leadership-style-big-year-grok-ipo-spacex-2026-2">Business Insider</a>, which published a report into xAI following Musk's shift from head of the US Government's Department of Government Efficiency back to his prior role as CEO at various tech-based companies.</p>
<p>Business Insider wrote: "a model release was delayed for several days because Musk was dissatisfied with how the chatbot answered detailed questions about the video game '<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a>,' according to people familiar with the matter."</p>
<p>Sources also told Business Insider that Musk had requested Grok learning about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> - one of his favourite games - a priority. To achieve this, Musk brought together a group of staff into a "war room", as Business Insider claims he does whenever there's a problem he deems urgent. One of these war room groups was dedicated to getting the impressionable AI chatbot to play perhaps the most toxic game of all time.</p><p>What is the purpose of having an generative AI chatbot play a game for you, who knows? Years ago, before the generative AI boom, <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2172612-ai-trained-on-3500-years-of-games-finally-beats-humans-at-dota-2/">one program was able to beat Dota 2 players after training on 3,500 hours of gameplay</a>. So it's not like this idea is particularly novel either.</p>
<p>If you're in the UK, your parliament recently <a href="https://edm.parliament.uk/early-day-motion/65027/grok-ai-generation-and-dissemination-of-sexually-explicit-and-nonconsensual-images-of-women-and-children-on-x">discussed the dissemination of sexually explicit and non-consensual images due to Grok's recent behavior</a>. This may lead to expansions of the Online Safety Act, so that it covers the output of AI chat bots.</p>

            <p>It's been a while since the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unmade-bioshock-movie-had-two-game-endings-says-director">BioShock movie</a> was revived... only be stuck in limbo again. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-expect-that-netflix-bioshock-movie-any-time-soon-three-years-on-it-still-doesnt-have-a-finished-script">Slow progress is being made on a script</a>, however, and like many suspected, it seems that director Francis Lawrence's busy agenda has been the main thing preventing it from happening.</p>
<p>Since Netflix's take on the cursed project <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/netflix-bioshock-movie-announcement/">was announced</a> in February 2022, Lawrence has been busy working on two different Hunger Games prequels, The Long Walk, and even the tentative sequels to I Am Legend and Constantine. Now, via <a href="https://collider.com/bioshock-movie-production-update-netflix-roy-lee-francis-lawrence/">Collider</a>, producer Roy Lee has teased <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> <em>could</em> be the filmmaker's next big project after he's done with The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping's post-production later this year.</p>
<p>"We would have gotten it made a few years back, but then other movies got in the way, with one being The Long Walk and the other being The Hunger Games prequel, which comes out this December. We're just waiting for him to finish post-production, because he's going to be working on it through at least September, and then jump back into it," Lee openly admitted during a chat with Collider's Steve Weintraub. Many cinephiles and video game fans figured this could be the case, especially with the I Am Legend and Constantine sequels being far from locked, but it's reassuring to get a proper update from BioShock's producer.</p>
<p>Netflix and rights-holder Take-Two might also be pushing hard to get the ball rolling on the long-in-the-works adaptation pronto, as the fourth game in the series might get a nice boost after former Gears of War and Diablo head <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioshock-studio-cloud-chamber-undergoes-layoffs-appoints-rod-fergusson-new-bioshock-head">Rod Fergusson joined Cloud Chamber</a> last year to rework and fast-track its troubled development. Fergusson is no stranger to coming in hot to fix and finally release troublesome games, and it seems the powers that be are betting on the game being ready in the coming years, which is why the movie needs to get going soon: "I know that Netflix and Take-Two are very anxious to see the movie come out because they want to have the release coincide with some of the potential new incarnations of the game," Lee added.</p><p>After last year's creative shakeup at 2K and Cloud Chamber, we also learned <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-4-fails-to-impress-at-internal-2k-review-resulting-in-leadership-shake-up-and-revamped-narrartive">a remake of the original BioShock was in development</a> and ultimately binned according to reports. That would've been the perfect thing to release alongside a live-action movie, but now all eyes are on the all-new fourth BioShock... even if we don't know anything about its nature yet.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Ubisoft’s CEO Yves Guillemot has confirmed that they are making a bunch of new Assassin’s Creed and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry">Far Cry</a> games, together with some unannounced original projects, in a wide-ranging albeit very rehearsed-sounding chinwag with Variety. 
</p>
<p>
In the interview, Guillemot also talked more about Ubisoft’s plan to cut fixed costs by €200 million, as the publishers continue their transformation into a set of “creative houses” grouped around particular games and genres. The transformation has already led to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-and-more-cancelled-by-ubisoft-with-layoffs-potentially-on-the-horizon">the cancellation of several games</a> and the closure of two studios, and it sounds like there could be more layoffs on the way.
</p>
<p>
“As we announced, the €200 million in additional cost reductions will include selective restructuring across the company,” Guilemot <a href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/ubisoft-ceo-interview-yves-guillemot-layoffs-creative-house-1236667500/">told the site</a>. “That said, our primary focus for aligning the organization with our long-term goals remains disciplined workforce management, meaning prioritizing voluntary departures while carefully controlling recruitment for replacements and new roles.
</p>
<p>
“We are also taking a range of measures to optimize the business: reducing certain expenses, adjusting or stopping projects where necessary, improving production processes, and making more effective use of our tools,” he went on.
</p>
<p>
“Following the post-Covid period, the industry grew very quickly, anticipating sustained demand that didn’t fully materialize. On our part, this led to too many projects and increased complexity. Our priority today is to build a more focused, agile company, with stronger teams that strike the right balance between senior expertise and young talent and who are well positioned to deliver the highest quality games.”
</p><p>
The talk of “disciplined workforce management” might seem a bit risible when you consider that Yves has just appointed his son, Charlie, as co-CEO of Vantage Studios, the creative house that will handle potential “billionaire brands” like Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry and Rainbow Six.  
</p>
<p>
Charlie Guillemot has a few years under his belt in executive positions, but doesn’t strike me as anybody’s first choice for the role of Assassin’s Cry Rainbows tsar. As <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/ubisoft-ceo-confirms-new-assassins-creed-and-far-cry-games-are-coming-denies-that-putting-his-son-in-charge-of-them-was-nepotism/">PCGamer</a> note, he’s otherwise known for running free-to-play specialists Owlient, creators of an infamous Tom Clancy mobile spin-off that shut down a year after launch, and co-founding AI, web3 and blockchain studio <a href="https://www.unagi.games/#web3">Unagi</a>. Charlie Guillemot doesn’t have any public credits on any of Ubisoft’s would-be “billionaire brands”.</p>
<p>Vantage’s other co-CEO, Christophe Derennes, looks like a stronger fit: he’s the <a href="https://montreal.ubisoft.com/en/christophe-derennes-30-years-in-a-booming-industry/">former general manager</a> of Ubisoft Montréal, developers of the original Assassin’s Creed, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry-2">Far Cry 2</a> and several Rainbow Six games.
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft – founded by the Guillemot brothers in 1986 - have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/charlie-guillemot-follows-father-as-co-ceo-of-ubisofts-new-tencent-funded-subsidiary-nepotism-claims-addressed">batted away allegations of nepotism</a> in the past. Asked by Variety to comment on the subject yet again, Guillemot replied that “Ubisoft was created as a family company, and our strong heritage helps us take a long-term view, prioritizing sustainable growth, creative ambition, and continuity over short-term cycles. This perspective guides our decisions and helps us build franchises, teams, and strategies that endure for decades.” 
</p>
<p>
I’m not sure the argument that keeping it in the family helps Ubi avoid short-termism really gels with the previous answer about over-expansion during the Covid boom, or with Ubisoft’s repeated investments in NFTs and other flavours of snakeoil.
</p>
<p>
“I strongly believe that Christophe Derennes and Charlie are the right leaders as Co-CEOs of Vantage Studios,” Guillemot went on. “They bring complementary strengths and experience that make them well-suited for the role. Their appointment was based on their skills, track record, and fit for the role.” 
</p><p>
Ubisoft’s creative houses “will operate like dedicated business units with clear accountability for performance and genuine creative autonomy,” the exec explained. Vantage specifically have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-hand-ubisoft-a-big-wad-of-cash-to-spin-out-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-as-a-separate-business">funding from Tencent</a>, but according to Guillemot, the latter “respect our operational autonomy and are not involved in our governance or day-to-day management”. 
</p>
<p>
Whether investors trust the Guillemots to run Ubisoft any longer is somewhat in doubt: the company has weathered <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-ubisoft-investor-wants-to-dethrone-ubisofts-founders-so-ubisoft-can-lay-more-developers-off">shareholder revolts</a> over <a href="https://markets.ft.com/data/equities/tearsheet/summary?s=UBI:PAR">the falling stock price</a>. The Guillemots have also been accused of failing to curb a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/three-former-ubisoft-execs-found-guilty-of-sexual-and-psychological-harassment">"boy's club" workplace culture</a> that has led to several criminal convictions. I get the sense that decentralising the founding fathers and detoxifying the Ubisoft brand is part of the thinking behind positioning the creative houses as autonomous. Or at least, that was my reasoning before the big boss appointed his son to co-run three of Ubisoft’s most successful series. 
</p>
<p>
They’ll have to do more than that to convince the Ubisoft rank-and-file: around 1200 French Ubisoft workers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/1200-ubisoft-staff-go-on-strike-against-assassins-creed-companys-massive-cutbacks">went on strike</a> earlier this month in response to the changes of direction and an associated return-to-office policy.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Quordle takes the complexity of the original daily word game and ups the ante by having you solve four solutions at once. Your 100% attention suddenly needs to be diverted four ways, and completing the daily Quordle is tough without the right starting words or hints. February 23, 2026, Quordle is the #1491 edition of the puzzle, and there are four new words for you to find. This guide has hints and a helping hand to help you solve all four words.</p>



<p>Before the information comes thick and fast at you, make sure you give today’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/quordle/" id="3574" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quordle</a> a go if you haven’t already!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-quordle-daily-word-game">How To Play Quordle Daily Word Game</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Rest assured, they will be tested. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Quordle is different from other daily word games as it requires you to correctly work out four words at once, and you can attempt this through the official Quordle website.</strong></p>



<p>Before anything else, check out this set of instructions on finding and playing Quordle:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://beta.quordle.com/#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Quordle</a> website.</li>



<li>You should be presented with four equal boxes reminiscent of a Wordle setup.</li>



<li>Enter your first guess using the keyboard input at the bottom of the screen.</li>



<li>The game will fill out the first of nine lines for all four boxes.</li>



<li>A green box means the letter is correct AND goes in that exact spot on the grid.</li>



<li>A yellow box means the letter is correct BUT needs to go in a different spot on the grid.</li>



<li>A grey box means the letter DOESN’T feature at all.</li>



<li>Do this up to nine times to try to solve all four words.</li>
</ol>







<h2 id="h-best-quordle-tips-amp-tricks">Best Quordle Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Try to use as many of the five vowels as you can in your first two guesses.</li>



<li>Focus on solving words with more green and yellow boxes first.</li>



<li>Avoid reusing letters that are not applicable across any of the four answers.</li>



<li>Don’t be afraid to try the same letter twice in one word, as answers can be sneaky like that.</li>



<li>Play the Practice game first if you’re not used to Quordle, or need a warm-up before today’s new game!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="h-when-is-the-next-quordle-daily-game">When Is The Next Quordle Daily Game?</h2>



<p id="block-bc42def5-af74-42a4-abf5-f31a34e53dd6"><strong>Quordle is updated daily at 12 AM (Midnight) in your time zone and region, so the next game will start on February 24</strong></p>



<p>The Quordle schedule is very consistent and always comes out at the same time each new day. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-quordle">What Is Quordle?</h2>



<p><strong>Quordle is a variation of the popular Wordle daily word game, but instead of giving you one word to solve, you must figure out four unique words at the same time.</strong></p>



<p>Needless to say, Quordle is MUCH harder than Wordle! There are days when it might be an achievement just to solve one of the four words. Whereas you can guess Wordle with your first answer, that’s impossible with Quordle. You need to be thinking on all cylinders with Quordle, and Insider Gaming strongly recommends you take the hints above on board and apply them to future Quordle puzzles.</p>



<p>Additionally, a new daily guide will be on the website for every new puzzle. Keep coming back each day for hints and solutions to the newest Quordle daily word games!</p>
