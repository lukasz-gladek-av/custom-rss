            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-citizen-discrimination-tribunal<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Cloud Imperium Games, the studio behind&nbsp;<em>Star Citizen</em>, has been ordered to pay $35,000 in compensation to a disabled worker against whom the studio has been found to have discriminated.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/cloud-imperium-games-discriminated-against-disabled-employee-with-return-to-office-policy" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Game Developer</a>, programmer Paul Ah-Thion took Cloud Imperium to tribunal following the instatement of a return-to-work program that didn't include any kind of provision for him and his disability.</p>
<p>Ah-Thion initially worked at Cloud Imperium's Wilmslow office, which was closed during the COVID-19 pandemic, necessitating that Cloud Imperium employees work remotely. When Cloud Imperium sought to relocate to Manchester, Ah-Thion requested to work from home indefinitely, but was denied.</p>

<p>CIG's argument during the tribunal was that Ah-Thion had failed to fulfil his professional obligations as a result of working from home, and that he was "unable to meet certain job criteria" (that's Game Developer's wording) like training junior employees.</p>
<p>However, the tribunal found that these claims were incorrect, and that by refusing to make adjustments to accommodate Ah-Thion, CIG acted in a discriminatory manner.</p>
<p>The tribunal ordered Cloud Imperium to pay Ah-Thion £27,748 in compensation, a figure which works out at around $35,000.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-citizen-discrimination-tribunal-hangar.jpg?itok=S6oXTN1d 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-citizen-discrimination-tribunal-hangar.jpg?itok=jupxDN_Q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Cloud Imperium will have to pay Paul Ah-Thion tens of thousands of dollars in compensation.</figcaption></figure><p>This decision comes as several publishers and gaming companies ratchet up their efforts to create accessible hardware and software for gamers with accessibility concerns.</p>
<p>These efforts include Sony adding <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-adding-accessibility-tags-to-playstation-store-on-ps5">accessibility tags to entries on the PlayStation Store</a>&nbsp;and creating an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-5-access-controller-brings-accessibility-this-december">entire controller based around accessibility</a>, as well as games like <i><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-accessibility">Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2</a>&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/god-of-war-ragnarok-accessibility-options-revealed">God of War Ragnarok</a>&nbsp;</em>featuring extensive accessibility options.</p>
<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Star Citizen</em>, which has been in production for thirteen years at time of writing, a concrete release date doesn't look like it's any closer to being announced, although Cloud Imperium has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-citizen-roadmap-release-2024">said that it will release a roadmap</a> leading up to the game's 1.0 launch this year.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-new-crazy-taxi-is-going-to-be-a-%E2%80%98large-scale-open-world-online-game%E2%80%99-because-of-course-it-is.916137/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24189842/crazy-taxi-reboot-mmo<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="1PM0yu">Sega is going through one of those phases when it decides it wants to be Sega again — the Sega of blue skies, killer arcade cabinets, and the glorious unfulfilled promise of the Dreamcast.</p>
<p id="xsOx1O">Last week, the publisher released the first original <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24185483/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-review-interview">Super Monkey Ball</a> game in a decade. At the Game Awards last December, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game-awards-tga/23993016/sega-jet-set-radio-streets-of-rage-shinobi-crazy-taxi">the company announced</a> an initiative to bring some of its classic game franchises back to life, including new games in the Jet Set Radio, Shinobi, Golden Axe, Streets of Rage, and Crazy Taxi series.</p>
<p id="5Ogq1m">That was a fan-pleasing move, though many questioned how (or, indeed, whether) Sega intended to make these games relevant for a modern audience. We now have a partial answer, as far as Crazy Taxi is concerned.</p>
<p id="m01KgF">Sega is moving to staff up the development team making the new Crazy Taxi, and in a <a href="https://hrmos.co/pages/sega/jobs?category=2010249489979686912">series of job adverts</a>, the game is consistently referred to as a “large-scale online title,” “open world,” and a “massively multiplayer driving game.” The original is a tight, fast-paced arcade driving game about ferrying passengers around a city map as fast as possible.</p>
<div id="Pe1o1o"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0VHYLJR9pNg?rel=0&amp;start=80" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="Jdw4S9">In an ad seeking a <a href="https://hrmos.co/pages/sega/jobs/10">lead game designer</a>, Sega says the project is “aiming to become a global hit, primarily in the North American market.” Sega would prefer its new lead game designer to have experience in both “car game production” and “multiplayer action battle production.” The game is being made in Unreal Engine.</p>
<p id="cZPKOh">Sega also posted a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLQsitFYpg8">recruitment video</a> (in Japanese) featuring producer Kenji Kanno — the director of the original game — and other developers. In the video (according to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/segas-crazy-taxi-reboot-is-a-massively-multiplayer-driving-game/">VGC</a>), the developers talk about adapting the classic Crazy Taxi gameplay for a world with multiple players set on a “theme park-like” city map. Brief work-in-progress clips from the Game Awards announcement video show multiple cabs trailing sparks as they drift around a San Francisco-style city.</p>
<p id="Pth8HD">The news may set off alarm bells about overreach — can a game series that last saw a home console release <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_Taxi_3:_High_Roller">in 2002</a> really support a “global hit” in the 2020s, however much nostalgia there is for it? On the other hand, Crazy Taxi’s frantic gameplay and joyously garish style seems well suited to a bustling, competitive online world, and might even support a battle royale-style mode. The idea of a more over-the-top, arcade-coded rival to the likes of Forza Horizon — or, to put it another way, a <em>Fortnite</em> on wheels — doesn’t seem so crazy after all.</p>
<p id="NJqs0t">The new Crazy Taxi — like the reboots of Jet Set Radio, Shinobi, Golden Axe, and Streets of Rage — does not yet have a release date.</p>

On their release in November 2020, both the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X were incredibly scarce, thanks to an imperfect storm of covid, global chip shortages, and supply chain issues. At the same time, the three-year-old Switch was also having supply issues, and consoles that <em>were</em> available were quickly snatched up by scalpers. But Nintendo reckons it’s in a position to ensure that’s not a problem with next year’s release of the Switch 2.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196230" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Cool New Retro Console Is A Great Gift For Atari Fans" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="217" data-playlist="196230,191491,196143" data-current="196230"><div><p>This Cool New Retro Console Is A Great Gift For Atari Fans</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21779.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>In a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/qa2406.pdf&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/qa2406.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent shareholder call</a></span> (pdf), Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa was reminded that he said a year ago that he would put in place measures to prevent resellers from blocking customer access to the (technically unannounced) new console, and asked what had been done thusfar. Furukawa’s response was pretty simple. He said that the answer is to just make enough units to meet customer demand. In other words, Nintendo plans to make loads of the new Switch console.<br></p><p>Now, of course, Nintendo has been its typical cryptic self when it comes to the Switch 2, or whatever it will eventually be called.

It’s such a peculiar situation that the company is explaining its techniques for ensuring a console isn’t going to sell out before they’ve properly acknowledged the console even exists.</p><p>Furukawa added that in 2021 and 2022's financial years, Nintendo was unable to meet demand for the Switch, mentioning the shortage of semiconductor parts, but says that this situation has been “resolved.” It’s Furukawa’s belief that there shouldn’t be any shortages of any parts this time out, and—according to a Google translation—says the company is also “considering whether we can take any measures within the scope of laws and regulations, taking into account the circumstances of each region.”</p><p>In the same call, Furukawa was also asked how Nintendo would support indie developers with the new system, to which the president said Nintendo has been improving development tools, and improving support for developers, while mentioning the regular Indie World strand of its Direct streams. Rather splendidly he added, “Indie games are essential to increasing the appeal of our platform, so we would like to continue to strengthen these activities in future.”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>According to Steam <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/753/charts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">data platform SteamDB</a>, the Steam user count reached 36,928,521 yesterday, which represents a new all-time peak. Naturally, the user count is a little lower right now, but it's still hovering at around 33.5 million.</p>
<p>This breaks the record set by Steam users back in March, when the total concurrent user count reached 36,354,393, representing a leap of almost three million over the previous month. Perhaps not coincidentally, March is also when the last major Steam sale took place.</p>

Ruiz, playing as General Shao, had just stomped Curtis “Rewind” McCall’s Reiko to send his opponent down into the Losers Bracket. As the chair was flung out of the ring it smashed into a light fixture, sending shards of glass flying. According to CEO 2024 organizer Alex Jebailey, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Jebailey/status/1807145856337854633&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Jebailey/status/1807145856337854633" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the equipment was worth almost $3,000</a></span>. </p><p>“Does anyone know @RezDyloch’s PayPal cause somebody’s paying for that broken light fixture and it’s not me,” he <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Jebailey/status/1807117772087824600&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Jebailey/status/1807117772087824600" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a></span>.

<p>Despite the overwhelming reception to the game, along with its free-to-play nature and launch this summer for everyone, there’s still mystery surrounding The First Descendant. For instance, what’s the game’s multiplayer like? Is The First Descendant multiplayer?</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-the-first-descendant-multiplayer">Can You Play The First Descendant Multiplayer?</h2>



<p>First and foremost, The First Descendant is a cooperative looter-shooter in which up to four players can team up and work together to dominate mobs of enemies and challenge bosses in Void Intercept battles. Alongside the raid-type boss content in The First Descendant, you may also participate in Consecutive Survival and Consecutive Defense, in which you must work together to survive hordes of enemies for as long as possible.</p>



<p>Lastly, and perhaps most importantly for most players, is that you can play the entire campaign cooperatively with the same number of players. You never have to struggle through a particularly challenging section of the game, as you can enlist the help of a friend!</p>







<h2 id="h-is-the-first-descendant-pvp">Is The First Descendant PvP?</h2>



<p>The First Descendant does not offer a PvP mode, as the game primarily focuses on a cooperative experience. This information was confirmed by developers Beomjun Lee and Minseok Joo, the Producer and Director, respectively, at Nexon Games. They set out to create a cooperative PvE game, first and foremost, and intend to stick with that design plan.</p>



<p>Furthermore, their insistence on sticking to the original PvE plan means there’s little to no chance of a PvP mode coming to The First Descendant in the future. Of course, never say never, but it isn’t very likely.</p>

Players will be unable to rest at sites of grace, or fast travel to them until they have killed the spirit.

        <p>Animation production studio previously worked on Dragon's Dogma 2 and Resident Evil Village</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Capcom has made Minimum Studios a subsidiary through a share acquisition.</p>
<p>The Taiwan-based animation production company previously worked on Capcom titles including Resident Evil Village, the Resident Evil 4 remake, and Dragon's Dogma 2.</p>
<p>Minimum Studios was founded in 2018, and specialises in keyframe animation and motion capture.</p>
<p>"Capcom has decided to make the studio its subsidiary company to substantially bolster its development and technological capabilities," the publisher said. "Going forward, Capcom will continue to explore the acquisition of necessary technological capabilities in order to enhance its game development organisation."</p>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/capcom-acquires-support-studio-swordcanes">Capcom acquired support studio Swordcanes</a> which worked on Street Fighter 6. It has also contributed to games including Final Fantasy 16, Hi-Fi Rush, and the Monster Hunter series.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/resident-evil-fan-film-adapts-iconic-itchy-tasty-diary.916077/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-fan-film-the-keepers-diary<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A group of&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>fans have created a short film based on one of the original game's most iconic diary-style text logs, and it stars an actor who made an appearance in the original game.</p>
<p><em>The Keeper's Diary: A Biohazard Story&nbsp;</em>stars Charlie Kraslavsky, who played Chris Redfield in the original 1996&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil</em>, as The Keeper, a man who slowly succumbs to the zombification process brought on by T-virus exposure.</p>
<p>The film dramatizes the events of the diary, which begin with the Keeper playing poker with his coworkers and famously end with the words "Itchy. Tasty.", which the movie shows him writing as the last vestiges of humanity leave him.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/resident-evil-fan-film-typewriter.jpg?itok=-o7AW_Ps 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/resident-evil-fan-film-typewriter.jpg?itok=S0LmQfJK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I guess not everyone uses typewriters to save their progress in&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>It's all told with a wraparound structure that features actress Gracie Madsen as Jill Valentine, who's reading the diary after the fact.</p>
<p>I'd definitely recommend giving this one a watch if you're a&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>fan. The Keeper's Diary is one of the most iconic and well-remembered text logs in the original game, and it's neat to see it brought to life in this way.</p>
<p>You can check out <i>The Keeper's Diary: A Biohazard Story&nbsp;</i>right here. Make sure you keep watching after the credits for a fun sting that seems to offer a tease for one of production company Biohazard Declassified's future projects.</p>

<p>If you haven't caught up with the original&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>and want to know where the Keeper's Diary came from, you've got two options.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, the&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>HD remake, which was originally released for GameCube in 2002 and which was subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/review/resident-evil-hd-remaster-review-remastering-remake">remastered for more modern platforms in 2015</a>, is widely available on PC and consoles right now.</p>
<p>You could also go back to the source and check out the 1996&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil</em>, which scored a <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/resident_evil" rel="sponsored" target="_blank">nifty GOG re-release</a> last week, with&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>3&nbsp;</em>set to follow soon. Will this first entry be next in Capcom's sights for a fully-fledged remake? We'll have to wait and see.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24187573/house-dragon-season-2-episode-3-review-alicent-rhaenyra<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="wl8KKx">So the Brackens hate the Blackwoods, and the Blackwoods hate the Brackens. It’s been this way for as long as anyone can remember. The start of it all, we are told, is lost in time. Does it matter that the Brackens pledged to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24182763/house-dragon-king-aegon-2-joffrey-game-thrones">Aegon</a> and the Blackwoods to Rhaenyra? Probably not. Violence is cyclical, and the young men from each family arguing at the start of this week’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/house-of-the-dragon"><em>House of the Dragon</em></a> were primed for conflict long before they were born. They’re doomed to a grim death, as are the countless countrymen that will join them, as the inertia of this particular cycle runs its course. </p>
<p id="Ggxpse">The opening vignette of this week’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23322393/house-dragon-houses-characters-explained"><em>House of the Dragon</em></a> underlines how its characters are no longer the masters of their own destinies. War is easy to slide into and difficult to avoid, as it needs no justification to perpetuate itself. That doesn’t mean they’re willing to accept this, though. Continuing <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24183267/house-dragon-episode-season-2-review">the stages-of-grief metaphor</a> from last week, this week’s episode is about bargaining — culminating in a final conversation between Rhaenyra (Emma D’Arcy) and Alicent (Olivia Cooke) where the two attempt exactly that. With a new status quo that has placed an ocean between them, the relationship that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23423671/house-dragon-season-1-review"><em>House of the Dragon</em></a> is built on gets precious little screen time, even as it still drives their individual convictions. Once upon a time, these young women’s friendship had the potential to break the cycles set in course by men; now that potential is imperiled. Is there any way out? </p>
<p id="GHCrGD"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/24183307/house-dragon-twin-fight-episode-2">As the twins Arryk and Erryk are buried</a>, Rhaenys reminds Rhaenyra that she is not above getting lost in this cycle. She asks what caused the current conflict Westeros finds itself in. Was it the stolen throne? Or Lucerys’ death? Or <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24182584/house-dragon-aemond-daemon-interview-episode-2">Aemond</a>’s lost eye? When the fight begins, will it even matter? “When the desire to kill and burn takes hold,” Rhaenys says, “all reason is forgotten.”</p>

<p id="WlCmtc">Or, as Ser Simon Strong, the castellan of Harrenhal, tells Daemon when he arrives to claim the very damp, hilariously uncontested stronghold: “Sin begets sin begets sin.”</p>
<p id="9NOBHv">Rhaenyra was supposed to be different. Her crown was taken from her <em>because</em> she would have been different, because she would have broken the chain of patriarchal rule and threatened the very power structure of Westeros. Thus, she makes one final, desperate gambit to break the loop, to pivot away from the war that the men of this world crave, the same kind of war they have waged for generations. She sneaks into King’s Landing to meet with Alicent during her prayers.</p>
<p id="IkCeBZ">It’s a patently absurd mission, one that the viewer — who has just witnessed the dysfunction of Rhaenyra’s council, the bloodthirst of Aegon’s response, and Ser Simon Strong’s frank breakdown of the conflict that has forever spilled across the riverlands — would be right to be skeptical of. But perhaps a dream deserves a funeral, and Rhaenyra needs one last chance to mourn, reckless as it may be. </p>

<p id="4UaNl7">“We knew even [as children] that men trained for battle are eager to fight,” she tells Alicent, believing that they can still be different, that they can find peace. Alicent, however, still believes herself to be in the right, that Viserys changed his mind about his heir on his deathbed, and that it’s Rhaenyra’s actions that are plunging them into war. The conversation devolves into blame and deflection until the core misunderstanding that drove the pair apart is finally clarified: Alicent realizes King Viserys’ last words were about Aegon the Conqueror, and not his grandson Aegon. </p>
<p id="VK2D7g">Olivia Cooke plays the terrible moment of realization impeccably, as shock and comprehension make their way across her face before curdling into grim determination. They’re already pot committed; there’s nothing to be done. They too will slip into the tides of war, but unlike many of the men we saw before, they will know exactly why.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-movie-producer-gives-new-update/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>As reported by Brian Crecente’s <a href="https://game.substack.com/p/borderlands-metal-gear-solid-and">Game newsletter</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-movie-script-still-being-worked-on-producer-says" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">also IGN</a>, producer Ari Arad offered a brand-new update on the Metal Gear Solid movie adaptation.</p>



<p>Arad revealed that “we’re working on the script some more, but I can’t talk about it yet.” This confirms the movie is still under way, and there is likely some traction with the story. </p>



<p>Arad added that “I think everyone’s going to be really excited and surprised.” </p>



<p>The producer also briefly spoke about the potential tone of the film. They stated that “I think getting Metal Gear right will obviously be amazing because I think it’s a lot more meditative than some of the other adaptations.” </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Metal Gear Solid movie adaptation originally had Jordan Vogt-Roberts of Kong: Skull Island attached to direct. Also, Oscar Isaac previously joined the cast. It’s unclear if either creative is still going to be a part of the Metal Gear Solid film in some way.</p>



<p>In the meantime, fans of the game series are looking forward to the Metal Gear Solid 3 remake. Just weeks ago, Gamestop appeared to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-3-release-date-leaked-by-gamestop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leak a release date</a> for the anticipated remake. In a deleted post, Gamestop suggested it will arrive on November 17, 2024. </p>



<p>Other film adaptations on the way include the Street Fighter movie, now set for a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/street-fighter-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2026 release window</a>, and a Super Mario Bros. sequel <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-super-mario-bros-movie-will-release-in-april-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coming in April 2026</a>.</p>

            <p>Despite what the headlines suggest, no – layoffs are not an inevitability.</p>
<p>Jesse Schell – a veteran designer and author who hasn't laid off a single employee since establishing Schell Games in 2002 – believes the games industry's cyclical hiring and firing practices not only breed distrust and fear, but also weakens team dynamics over time.</p>
<p>As part of our new <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/events/gi-sprint-summer-2024">GI Sprint</a> series of videos, podcasts, and articles about making games cheaper, faster, and better, Schell shares his strategies for building and maintaining a sustainable business in desperately uncertain times.</p>

<h2 id="section-1">Change how you do business, not your headcount</h2>
<p>"The reason I think a lot of folks end up having layoffs is they put jobs at risk as part of the nature of doing business," Schell says when asked how he's managed to avoid layoffs at his studio when almost 11,000 devs from 120+ studios have lost their jobs in 2024 alone.</p>
<p>"[Studio executives] go into it saying, 'Look, we're gonna get this money, we're gonna make this game. If the game is a success, then great – if the game's not, then we're gonna have to lay people off'. That's just how it is," Schell says.</p>
<p>"I've always found it to be really toxic. I've been at companies where I've seen it happen. And you see how everybody lives in fear of what will happen next."</p>
<p>Not only is this bad for morale, but it's bad business, too. That's why Schell thinks studios should prioritise people over profits.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Prioritise your people by creating a desirable workplace culture</h2>
<p>Firmly believing that the longer people work with each other, the better they get, Schell's keen to stress that retention isn't just about holding onto skills or experience – it's about strengthening relationships across your workforce, too, no matter its size.</p>
<p>"When somebody from the team leaves, not only have you lost that talent, but all of the experience that people have built up working <em>with</em> that person," Schell explains. "But when people stay together, they get stronger over time. For us, a big part of it has been prioritising stability, and the way that we have chosen to prioritise stability is to have a mixture of work-for-hire projects combined with our own IP.  This way, if one [project] isn't going so well, we can lean more into the other.</p>
<p>"At the heart of it all is choosing not to put jobs at risk. We'll put <em>cash</em> at risk when we make a game, but we don't put jobs at risk. Even if our own IP brings in zero dollars, we still haven't put any jobs at risk – we still have a path forward where we'll be able to keep people on. So, in a lot of ways, it's a choice."</p>
<p>That doesn't mean Schell isn't prepared to make difficult decisions when someone isn't working out, or adversely affecting team dynamics, he adds; it just means Schell Games carefully fosters a working environment that "people want to stay at long term".</p>
<h2 id="section-3">Be efficient and agile in your decision-making</h2>
<p>Schell Games typically works on six to eight games at a time. Sure, it could double that if it doubled its workforce – Schell's quick to acknowledge that "there can be meaningful economies of scale" when you boost your headcount – but those improved efficiencies may come at the cost of "more chaos and miscommunication."</p>
<p>"Experienced devs can look at a project and estimate what they'll probably need. Estimating is hard to get right, and it's hard work. So the key is to respect the fact that it's difficult and respect that it's hard work. And then you do your best.</p>
<p>"Then, as the project goes on, you realise this isn't what we thought," he adds. "We thought this game needed 12 levels, but it only needs eight. We thought it needed 10 enemies, but actually, it needs 25. The project changes. This is why agile development is so important. Because agile development is a system where you're reevaluating the schedule and saying: what's changed? What have we learned in the last sprint that's going to affect the long-term plan for this?</p>
<p>"There's a real art form to estimating and planning and getting things done on time on budget at quality, and you have to respect that and have people focused on that."</p>
<h2 id="section-4">Outsourcing can save money in the short-term but at a risk</h2>
<p>While Schell appreciates why studios prefer to contract or outsource staff on a freelance basis to keep their core costs lean, he works differently.</p>
<blockquote>"We'll put <em>cash</em> at risk when we make a game, but we don't put jobs at risk"
</blockquote>
<p>"You don't know these people. You haven't built a relationship with them," Schell says. "That works best when the work is very straightforward. But if you're living in an innovative space where you're inventing a new kind of gameplay, it's tough working with contracted folks because communication is just so important. It takes time to build up that trust between folks.</p>
<p>"Every few years, you'll get some Hollywood big-wig, they'll say: 'You games people, you don't know what you're doing. I'll show you how we do it the <em>Hollywood</em> way. It's really efficient'. And they'll jump in, and they'll start trying to do that, and then a year or two later, they're out. They just kind of just disappear into the shadows. It's just way harder in games."</p>
<h2 id="section-5">There are alternatives to layoffs</h2>
<p>Schell Games has experienced hard times, with the studio being "in danger" at various points in time.</p>
<p>"We've never taken investment," Schell says. "We've been a bootstrap studio. We started out doing work-for-hire projects where people would pay us to make a game, we would deliver, and we'd get paid. Obviously, we had to manage those in a way they were breakeven or profitable. And we did that for quite some time."</p>
<p>Using the profits generated by these work-for-hire contracts, Schell Games then reinvested in its own people to develop its own IPs. By Schell's own metrics, "they were not always profitable games," but that's okay – "we kept going."</p>
<blockquote>"Layoffs are like an avalanche. If a company needs to do a layoff, it's a smart idea to do it when everybody else is doing it. Then it's like, 'Well, it's not <em>us</em>. That's just the <em>economy</em> right now..."

</blockquote>
<p>"Right now, we're in a spot where we can do about 50% our own IP and 50% work-for-hire, and it works really well," he adds. "Everything is feeling pretty good. But the recession back in 2012 was a really scary time. Projects were getting cancelled. We were having trouble getting new projects. And it was just constant hustling, just trying to get work.</p>
<p>"So there have been periods where we didn't do raises for a while. We needed to be careful. I remember somebody back during the recession quit over that. So he left and went and worked at a large game studio… and a year later, he got laid off.</p>
<p>"Belt tightening is part of it," Schell explains. "A part of that is, sometimes, you have to pull back on bonuses, or pull back on raises, or pull back on other kinds of spending. There's a lot of ways that you deal with it in a pinch, but you want to get ahead of it. We did some belt-tightening this past year, too, because we saw where it was going. And we had a tough situation. A big project was all lined up. We were saying no to other projects because of it. We'd been working for about six months, getting this deal, and <em>poof</em> – it vanished overnight. Just… it was gone.</p>
<p>"You just have to manage it and be thoughtful and be careful. I mean, it's business. There are no guarantees. But it comes down to what you prioritise. If you prioritise stability, you can stay pretty stable, but you've <em>got</em> to give it a lot of time and thought and attention."</p>
<h2 id="section-6">Be honest and pragmatic about risk mitigation</h2>
<p>Reflecting on industry trends, Schell says that the reason we've seen so many layoffs – not just in the game industry, but in the tech industry generally over the last two years – is about recovering from the pandemic.</p>
<p>"We moved into the pandemic, and suddenly everybody's working at home," he says. "We have a situation where everybody can work from anywhere. And so suddenly, we experienced the Great Resignation; people started quitting all over the place. As a result, everybody started trying to combat it. So salaries went way up, and companies started hiring in a kind of a desperate, fearful way.</p>
<p>"Layoffs are like an avalanche," he adds. "If a company needs to do a layoff, it's a smart idea to do it when everybody else is doing it. Then it's like, 'Well, it's not <em>us</em>. That's just the <em>economy</em> right now. So if we're going to do it, we should do it now because then it's not going to make us look like something's wrong with us. It's going to make us look normal. So that's what we're going through right now. Hopefully, everything's going to normalise pretty soon."</p>
<p>Schell thinks this "boom and bust" mentality isn't unusual, not just in the entertainment sphere but also in tech spaces. Ultimately, though, he believes layoffs are often the result of managers failing to properly mitigate risk and candidly consider all outcomes.</p>
<blockquote>"If you care about prioritising [minimising layoffs], you can make it work"</blockquote>
<p>"You can and you <em>must</em> think about the worst case. You must think about risk mitigation. What if the deal goes south? It's like a game of chess – there are entities out there that will <em>intentionally</em> put you in a bad spot, get you to go out on a limb, and then they're going to start sawing that limb off in order to get a better deal out of you. I've seen it happen to so many studios when they're setting up a deal with the publisher."</p>
<p>This is why, Schell says, studio heads should always have a backup plan and prioritise their people.</p>
<p>"I got a great piece of advice from [Insomniac Games CEO] Ted Price once when our studio was growing. We were pushing up past 40. And I was like, 'Ted, I know the way we've been managing is not right. We're gonna have to do things differently. We're gonna have to add a layer of management. But I don't know if it's the right thing to do'.</p>
<p>"He says, 'Here's what's going to make things okay for you. You <em>care</em> about these problems. You're <em>thinking</em> about these problems, you're giving them time and attention. If you do that – if you think about them, care about them, value them, prioritise them – you're gonna solve them. It's the people who just say, well, now let's just make our game. We don't need to think about that stuff. Let's just hope it works out. Those are the folks who get themselves in trouble'.</p>
<p>"So that's my main advice. If you care about prioritising [minimising layoffs], you can make it work."</p>

            <p>Dataminers have recovered a deleted cutscene from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> DLC Shadow of the Erdtree.</p>
<p>As you may well expect given we're about to talk about cutscenes, <strong>this way be spoilers</strong>, so if you'd rather not know more until you've completed the DLC yourself, head back to the safety of Eurogamer's <a href="http://eurogamer.net/">homepage</a> now.</p>

<p>For those who <em>have</em> already completed the DLC (or simply don't mind spoilers, of course), the additional scene was uncovered by dataminers ChainFailure, MagicalShion, and Hnery, and brought into the public consciousness by Elden Ring content creator <a href="https://x.com/sekirodubi/status/1806409907362734317">Sekiro Dubi</a>.</p>
<p>Just like the others, there's no cinematics per se, just a black screen and a couple of brief lines of dialogue that reveal a hidden fourth cutscene for St. Trina.</p>
<p>"Thank you," a disembodied voice whispers from the darkness. "Finally, he will be free."</p>
<p>"Hearing that 'Thank you... Finally, he will be free' really reinforces something clear about Miquella's nature that we initially learned from the Golden Epitaph's description, 'A sword made to commemorate the death of Godwyn the Golden, first of the demigods to die. Infused with the humble prayer of a young boy; O brother, lord brother, please die a true death'," explained very knowledgeable commenter, PierceArner.</p>
<p>"In divesting himself of everything he had, it's clear that he wanted to give it ALL up and also die a normal death - something impossible for his eternally youthful form just as much as it was for Malenia. Turning into a god in essentially the exact way Mohg wanted to do with his coccooned body shows how either one of which would have been a prison he could never escape where he was once again the literal embodiment of everything he had just cast aside.</p>
<p>"With Florissax offering her dreams and sleep to Placidusax and St. Trina's sleep itself being death, I think there are some interesting themes and overlaps in those roles, so it'll be interesting to poke around and see what ideas like this they cut back on slightly."</p>
<p>The discovery has fans wondering what else may have been chopped before Shadow of the Erdtree finally released earlier this month, and what else may be lurking in the game's backend just waiting to be discovered by dataminers…</p>
<p>Over the weekend, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-writer-george-rr-martin-tells-us-nothing-and-everything-about-a-live-action-spin-off">Elden Ring worldbuilding writer George R. R. Martin has given his strongest hint yet that the critically acclaimed game may be getting its own "feature film or TV" spin-off</a>.</p>
<p>"Oh, and about those rumours you may have heard about a feature film or television series based on Elden Ring… I have nothing to say. Not a word, nope, not a thing, I know nothing, you never heard a peep from me, mum mum mum. What rumour?"</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-has-recovered-to-a-mostly-positive-steam-rating">Elden Ring's Shadow of the Erdtree DLC fans have elevated its once "Mixed" Steam user score</a>, moving into the the "Mostly Positive" category once more.</p>
<p>The DLC initially fell to a "mixed" user rating on Steam after thousands of players logged their disappointment with difficulty and the PC version's performance issues.</p>

<p>At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Switch consoles became sought-after items. The global semiconductor shortage in 2021 saw supply shrink, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-shouldnt-be-impacted-by-any-chip-shortages-nintendo-says/1100-6523347/" data-ref-id="1100-6523347">echoing previous statements regarding availability</a>, Furukawa added that Nintendo is anticipating that it'll have enough stock to combat scalping.</p><p>"Although we were unable to produce sufficient quantities of Nintendo Switch hardware last year and the year before due to a shortage of semiconductor components, this situation has now been resolved," Furukawa said. "At this time, we do not believe that the shortage of components will have a significant impact on the production of the successor model."</p><p>Several months ago, Nintendo confirmed that a Switch successor was in development and that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-successor-will-be-revealed-by-april-2025/1100-6523222/" data-ref-id="1100-6523222">Switch 2 will be announced during the company's current fiscal year</a> ending in March 2025. The Switch successor comes at a time when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-sales-slide-as-console-enters-its-eighth-year/1100-6523232/" data-ref-id="1100-6523232">Switch hardware sales have begun to decline</a>, but with 141.32 million consoles and over 1.2 billion games sold as of March 31, 2024, the Switch has had a terrific run so far. Here's hoping the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-needs-backwards-compatibility-and-luigis-mansion-2-shows-why/1100-6524558/" data-ref-id="1100-6524558">successor is backwards compatible</a> so fans can keep playing their full library.</p>

			<p>Today, CAPCOM <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e240701.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the acquisition of two-thirds of the shares of Minimum Studios, an animation production company based in Taiwan. The paid-in capital is less than $30K. Here's the rationale for the acquisition shared publicly by the Japanese developer and publisher.</p>
<p><em>Based in Taiwan, Minimum Studios’ strength lies in animation production for consumer home video game development, and the studio has carried out work on major Capcom titles in the past. Capcom decided to make the studio its subsidiary company to sustainably bolster its developmental and technological capabilities, aiming to achieve its long-term management goal of 100 million units in annual sales.</em></p>
<p><em>Going forward, Capcom will continue to explore the acquisition of necessary technological capabilities in order to enhance its game development organization.</em></p>
<p>Founded in August 2018, Minimum Studios previously contributed to Capcom games like Resident Evil Village, Resident Evil 4, and Dragon's Dogma 2 with in-game and cutscene animations. Here's an overview of the services offered by Minimum:</p>
<p><em>We specialize in keyframe animation and motion capture to create exquisitely detailed animation works. Whether it's for animation or gaming, we possess professional expertise and extensive experience to bring your creativity and imagination to life in the virtual world.</em></p>
<p>In other CAPCOM news, the Japanese studio will host <a href="https://wccftech.com/capcom-next-event-announced-for-july-1-will-show-dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the NEXT event</a> later today. Fans will be able to learn new information and watch new footage of three games: Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess, and Resident Evil 7: Biohazard for iPhone/iPad/Mac. Monster Hunter Wilds won't be there, in case you were wondering. The whole show is expected to last around 25 minutes, starting at 3 PM Pacific Time.</p>

			<p>Nintendo is determined to avoid Nintendo Switch 2 scalping by producing enough units to meet consumer demand.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-says-it-wants-to-avoid-switch-2-scalping-by-making-enough-to-meet-demand/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VGC</a>, Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa replied to a question during a recent Q&amp;A session with shareholders regarding the measures the company will put in place to prevent scalping, saying that the main plan is to make sure users don't have to turn to resellers to purchase the console, thus it will make sure that enough consoles will be produced to meet customer demand. Additionally, the company may take other measures depending on the circumstances in each region. Thankfully, Nintendo shouldn't have too many issues producing enough consoles, as the semiconductor shortage that affected the production of the original Switch in the past is no longer an issue.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time we have heard how the Nintendo Switch 2 should be easy to find in stores at launch. Earlier this <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-easy-find-stores/">year</a>, it was estimated from display shipment data that Nintendo should produce over 10 million units in the console's first fiscal year of availability, preventing a Playstation 5, Xbox Series X|S situation where all systems were incredibly difficult to find in stores for months and months.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has yet to be officially unveiled, but a full reveal should come before the end of the year. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as more come in on it, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

<p id="ibXHat"><strong>Director:</strong> Sam Raimi<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, Alfred Molina</p>
<p id="yJ5I1O">Sam Raimi’s follow-up to 2002’s <em>Spider-Man</em> isn’t just one of the greatest sequels of its era, but one of the greatest superhero movies ever made. The apex of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23043438/best-spider-man-movies-sam-raimi-explained-theaters">Sam Raimi’s Spider-Man trilogy</a>, <em>Spider-Man 2</em> takes place two years after the first film, with Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) attempting (and failing) to balance his everyday life and his great responsibilities as a web-slinging hero. </p>
<p id="QjJszw">With his relationship with Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) strained under new threat in the form of his mentor-turned-adversary Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina), Peter is pushed to his limits like never before as he strives to protect the people of New York. With impeccable writing, terrific performances, and easily one of the most breathtaking fight sequences of the 2000s, <em>Spider-Man 2</em> is a superhero movie for the ages. <em>—Toussaint Egan</em></p>

			<p>Sega's upcoming Crazy Taxi reboot is an Unreal Engine-powered massively multiplayer open-world title, according to the publisher.</p>
<p>New details about the reboot were shared in a <a href="https://youtu.be/uLQsitFYpg8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Japanese recruitment video</a>, in which Crazy Taxi producer Kenji Kanno and his team talk about the game (<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/segas-crazy-taxi-reboot-is-a-massively-multiplayer-driving-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via</a> VGC). Developed by Sega’s Sapporo Studio, the Crazy Taxi reboot aims to retain the iconic Crazy Taxi style while also adding new mechanics to the reboot.&nbsp; In the video, the the team mentions a realistic city based on the United States’ west coast, while also mentioning a theme park-like map. You'll find the recruitment video below.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the <a href="https://hrmos.co/pages/sega/jobs?category=2010249489979686912" target="_blank" rel="noopener">job recruitment page</a> for new Crazy Taxi entry makes mention of Unreal Engine 5, while also mentioning that the reboot will feature an open world and "massively multiplayer driving game" elements. The title is being presented as a "new major online title".</p>
<p>Back in 2022, Bloomberg <a href="https://wccftech.com/sega-craxy-taxi-jet-set-radio-reboot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that Sega was rebooting old franchises, including Jet Set Radio, and Crazy Taxi.<em> “The new Crazy Taxi has already been in development for over a year and the Tokyo-based entertainment group aims to release it within two to three years, the people said, asking not to be named as the information is not yet public”</em>, Bloomberg's Mochizuki wrote in 2022.</p>
<p>Late last year, Sega officially <a href="https://wccftech.com/sega-revives-5-of-its-classic-ips-golden-axe-crazy-taxi-jet-set-radio-shinobi-and-streets-of-rage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the revival of five classic IPs, including Golden Axe, Jet Set Radio, Shinobi, Streets of Rage, and Crazy Taxi. "<em>Today's announcement is just the start of our initiative", </em>Sega's Shuji Utsumi said upon the announcement last year.<em> "First and foremost, our ambition will be to create great games with memorable characters and worlds. We hope fans of all ages will look towards our future with anticipation as we release these projects in the coming years.</em></p>

<p>As covered some months back, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/sega-games-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new Sega games are all said to be coming to the Nintendo Switch successor</a>, for now dubbed the NIntendo Switch 2. We'll update you as soon as we learn more about Sega's upcoming projects, including the Crazy Taxi reboot.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-the-witcher-3-mod-restores-cut-boat-races.915972/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-the-witcher-3-mod-restores-cut-boat-races/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>This morning, modder MerseyRockoff published a new, interesting The Witcher 3 mod <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/9157" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Nexus</a>. The mod restores a series of boat races cut from the final game, leveraging the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-redkit-q-further-improvements-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent release of the REDKit tool</a> made by CD Projekt RED.</p>
<p>The modder explained:</p>
<p><em>With the release of REDkit, 100% of the boat race script was found in the game files, which allowed for the restoration process to begin. Only the text and audio files were found; the rest were created from scratch based on CDPR's writing and careful examination of the files. This means that all the conversations, characters, notices, and journal entries featured in the mod were originally written by CDPR but re-created and brought to life by me using REDkit. This The Witcher 3 mod only supports English localization at the time of the release. Support for other languages is planned in a future update.</em></p>
<p><em>There are 4 races (Regattas) in the game now:</em><br>
<em>Novigrad Regatta - Start from the Novigrad Harbor notice board.</em><br>
<em>Oxenfurt Regatta - Start from the Oxenfurt notice board.</em><br>
<em>Helmsman's Dash - Start from the Kaer Trolde village notice board.</em><br>
<em>Rally of the Wrecks - Start from Holmstein's notice board, but the races take place on Faroe.</em></p>
<p><em>You can also go directly to the start location, skipping the notice boards if you know where they are, and speak with the race master/mistress.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="The Witcher 3 - Boat Races (Restored with REDkit)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/81eJ791XvzM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The mod works with the classic version of The Witcher 3 as well as the enhanced 'next-gen' version. The installation process is fairly simple; you will need to copy the downloaded modBoatRaces folder to your The Witcher 3\mods folder. Then, copy the dlcBoatRaces folder to your The Witcher 3\dlc folder. Lastly, check for conflicts with the Script Merger tool, merging if necessary.</p>
<p>To uninstall the mod, simply delete the related folders. However, the modder warns against doing so while one of the boat race quests is active.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/cloud-imperium-games-discriminated-against-disabled-employee-with-return-to-office-policy<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="captioned-content"><p><span>Image via Cloud Imperium Games</span></p></div><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A UK employment tribunal has ordered </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Star Citizen</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> developer Cloud Imperium Games (CIG) to pay almost £30,000 ($38,000) in compensation for discriminating against a disabled worker.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The studio was taken to tribunal by senior programmer Paul Ah-Thion (the claimant) after rolling out a return-to-office policy that failed to accommodate his needs as a disabled person diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The claimant was hired by CIG in 2018 and made the company aware of his disability at the beginning of his tenure. Although he initially worked from the company's office in Wilmslow, the COVID-19 pandemic required staff to work remotely.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As noted in the Tribunal Judgement sent to Game Developer, upon emerging from the pandemic, the studio opened a new office in Manchester and sought to relocate its workforce. However, during the pandemic, Ah-Thion found working from home to be more accommodating of his disabilities.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rather than move to the Manchester office, the claimant asked CIG for a permanent remote working arrangement. The request was swiftly denied. CIG refused to change its stance despite repeat requests and eventually dismissed Ah-Thion in July 2022.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During the tribunal, CIG branded itself as a "start-up" enterprise—despite boasting over 400 employees—and attempted to argue the claimant had suffered from performance issues related to his remote working setup. It also claimed he was unable to meet certain job criteria, such as mentoring junior staffers, when working remotely.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The tribunal, however, found "there was no specific issue with the claimant's performance in relation to working from home as opposed to his performance generally." A witness for CIG stated the company was taking a "tougher" stance on working from home, but despite the alleged issues with the claimant's performance, never formally asked him to return to the office.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The Tribunal finds that the respondent's concern about the claimant's performance seemed rather retrospective in the sense that whilst the claimant was employed the respondent never formally investigated those concerns," reads the judgment.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The Tribunal finds that if the respondent had a serious concern about the claimant's performance they failed to give any evidence to suggest why they could not monitor it successfully remotely whilst he was working from home. Normal performance measures, such as performance targets and regular review meetings, could have been dealt with online."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Taking those points into consideration, along with the claimant's admission that working in-office often left him "exhausted and distressed," the tribunal found that CIG could have made the "reasonable adjustment" of allowing Ah-Thion to work from home permanently. In refusing to do so, the studio was found to have acted in a discriminatory and disproportionate manner.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The Tribunal finds the respondent cannot satisfy us that terminating the claimant's employment was proportionate. We rely on the fact we have found that working from home was a reasonable adjustment which would have alleviated the substantial disadvantage to the claimant. There is no evidence that working from home would have failed to achieve the respondent’s legitimate aim of ensuring the acceptable performance of a senior gameplay programmer," reads the judgment.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We find there was a failure of the respondent to understand the nature of the claimant’s autism. It was a condition of his autism that he struggled with his duties to act as a coach, reviewer and mentor to the junior members of the team. The evidence shows that the claimant was struggling to do this when he worked in the office. [...] We find that the respondent has treated the claimant unfavorably because of something arising in consequence of his disability. They have been unable to show that dismissal was a proportionate means of achieving the legitimate aim and accordingly the claimant's claim succeeds."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">CIG has been ordered to pay the claimant £27,748 in compensation. That includes loss of earnings totaling £14,045.31 and £12,000 for injury to feelings.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;Employers should be careful of mistaking a disability for weakness&quot;">"Employers should be careful of mistaking a disability for weakness"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking to Game Developer, Ah-Thion said he remains proud of his work at CIG and described many of his colleagues as "great people." He also, however, told us the experience was soured during his last nine months at the studio, where he was "shocked to see how ready CIG management were to ignore my disability and gaslight me about my work."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ah-Thion said he feels "vindicated" following the outcome of the tribunal. "I've been fighting this by myself for two years, and being autistic made the whole process especially challenging. But we're lucky to have the employment tribunal system, where an ordinary person can actually find justice without having to bankrupt themselves on legal fees," he continued.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It was clear to me from the start that CIG didn't want people to work from home after the expense of their new Manchester office, and worked backwards from that to retroactively conjure up reasons why my request should be denied, something they continued to do right up until the final tribunal hearing—all while ignoring disability legislation. It was gratifying that the tribunal saw through them as easily as they did."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He also suggested that some employers might have a "tick-box mentality" when it comes to accommodating disabled workers, "where sending a manager on a two-hour course about a disability is all they need to do."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"In reality, each disabled worker is different, and the simplest and best course is to talk to them, ideally on a semi-regular basis and outside the normal performance review process—and employers should be careful of mistaking a disability for weakness," he added.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer reached out to Kuits employment solicitor Jake McManus to learn how employers in England and Wales can support disabled workers, and how those with disabilities can hold employers to account.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He explained employers have a "legal obligation to make reasonable adjustments in the workplace for disabled workers," and said they must refrain from using a "blanket one-size-fits all" approach when identifying which adjustments should be made.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"They should tailor the adjustments to that individual and their specific needs. Employers should monitor these adjustments to make sure that they are working and the employee continues to be supported, and be flexible with making further adjustments if required," said McManus.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"This can be difficult with invisible disabilities such as autism, as it may not be immediately apparent how a condition affects the employee at work, or whether they have a disability in the first place. However, employers cannot rely on ignorance: if there are indications that an employee may be disabled then they should take steps to investigate it further. An Employment Tribunal will not be afraid to hold an employer liable if they reasonably ought to have known of the disability and did not carry out the necessary investigations, which would have ultimately revealed the disability."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">McManus' advice for workers is to inform employers of their disability when they commence employment. This ensures an employer will have no doubt as to their legal obligations. "If an employee believes that they are being treated less fairly than other colleagues because of their disability, or because of something that is a consequence of their disability, then they should bring this to their employer's attention so that it can be addressed," he continued.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Employees should be aware that any workplace policy or procedure that leaves them at a disadvantage compared to other, non-disabled employees, could be discriminatory. In this case, the company’s policy of requiring senior gameplay programmers to work from the office left Mr Ah-Thion, a person with autism, at a disadvantage due to his social interaction difficulties."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer has reached out to CIG for comment.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/segas-new-crazy-taxi-game-will-be-open-world-and-massively-multiplayer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
The big budget upcoming return of Crazy Taxi will be an open-world, massively-multiplayer game, Sega has said. 
</p>
<p>
A new developer interview video published today includes quotes from Sega's team behind the upcoming reboot, as well as brief flashes of in-game footage. There are clips of multiple yellow taxis racing each other - and police cars in pursuit.
</p>
<p>
Job adverts on Sega's <a href="https://hrmos.co/pages/sega/jobs?category=2010249489979686912">recruitment page</a> note that the game is being developed in Unreal Engine, and that Sega has high expectations for the game's success globally. The publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/segas-new-crazy-taxi-game-aaa-in-scope">previously described the project's scope as "AAA"</a>, indicating it is placing plenty of resources behind it.

<p>
According to translations of the development team's quotes (the new video, above, is in Japanese),  Sega is currently testing how Crazy Taxi's traditional gameplay works in multiplayer, with unspecified new mechanics. (That's gameplay mechanics, not people with wrenches.) The game's map is once again inspired by the sunny US West Coast, with a play space designed to feel like a theme park (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/new-crazy-taxi-title-will-be-an-open-world-massively-multiplayer-aaa-game-according-to-sega/">Automaton</a>).
</p>
<p>
Sega's new Crazy Taxi project was one of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-announces-flurry-of-projects-including-jet-set-radio-crazy-taxi">five fresh titles in classic franchises announced last December</a>, alongside new entries in the Jet Set Radio, Shinobi, Golden Axe and Streets of Rage set to arrive over the next few years. (I'm sure Skies of Arcadia is next... right, Sega?)
</p>
<p>
The publisher has said it is aiming to find the next breakout series from its vast back catalogue, after successfully turning its mascot Sonic into a powerhouse brand.

<p>The cut scenes, dug up and reimplemented for the video, would have taken place between Geralt’s showdown with Eredin and the game’s finale at the tower. It's all set in a Niflgaardian camp, and would have included conversations with Yennefer and Emperor Charles Dance, as well as some optional chats and exploration. There’s also a scene - albeit one missing some animations - in which Yennefer betrays the Lodge of Sorceress to the Nilfgaardians in a bid to help Ciri. She lets Triss escape though, font of goodwill that she is.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the discarded scenes, there’s even some extra bits with good old Crach an Craite, who I mainly remember as the bestower of a very-hyped up magic sword with very useless stats.</p>
<p>It’s been too long since I finished The Witcher 3 to say much on whether this was a cut well made, although it does remind me of the granular politicking in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/the-witcher-2-assassins-of-kings-enhanced-edition">The Witcher 2</a>’s closing hours. As great as the third game was, I do mourn for all the plot threads from 2 it left hanging, notably Iorveth and Saskia, and lots of other little details from the final act. Ah, well, can’t have everything, I suppose. Unless there was some sort of extensively powerful tool that let modders just flippin’ <em>add stuff</em> to the game. Imagine it! Why, you could give me back my dragon wife right now! Now!</p>

R. Martin has teased an <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a> movie or TV show.</p><p>In a post on his <a href="https://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2024/06/29/lose-one-win-one/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog</a>, the Game of Thrones author wrote about winning awards, and in doing so strongly suggested an adaptation of FromSoftware’s masterpiece is indeed in the works.</p><p>“Oh, and about those rumors you may have heard about a feature film or television series based on Elden Ring… I have nothing to say,” he said. “Not a word, nope, not a thing, I know nothing, you never heard a peep from me, mum mum mum. What rumor?”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I know nothing, you never heard a peep from me, mum mum mum.</p></div><p>As George R. R. Martin stated in the blog post, the famed fantasy author “did the worldbuilding” for Elden Ring, whereas <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-george-r-r-martin-miyazaki-writing">FromSoftware chief Hidetaka Miyazaka and his team “did all the rest.”</a> Now it does indeed seem like an Elden Ring movie or TV series is actually happening, George R. R. Martin will likely be involved in some capacity.</p><p>An Elden Ring movie has often come up as a possibility, with fans pondering how it might be adapted. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hidetaka-miyazaki-open-to-elden-ring-movie-if-a-very-strong-partner-were-to-step-in">Miyazaki himself revealed recently</a> that he would be open to an adaptation of the studio’s 25 million-selling 2022 action role-playing game, but only if a “very strong partner” were to come into play.</p><p>“I don’t see any reason to deny another interpretation or adaptation of Elden Ring, a movie for example,” explained Miyazaki in an interview with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/article/2024/jun/26/pushing-buttons-meeting-hidetaka-miyazaki" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Guardian</a>. “But I don’t think myself, or FromSoftware, have the knowledge or ability to produce something in a different medium.”</p><p>“So that’s where a very strong partner would come into play,” continued Miyazaki. “We’d have to build a lot of trust and agreement on whatever it is we’re trying to achieve, but there’s interest, for sure.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree DLC Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Meanwhile, Shadow of the Erdtree has sold wonderfully well, shifting five million copies in just three days.

We said: “Like the base game did before it, Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree raises the bar for single-player DLC expansions. It takes everything that made the base game such a landmark RPG, condenses it into a relatively compact 20-25 hour campaign, and provides fantastic new challenges for heavily invested fans to chew on.”</p><p>Check out IGN’s comprehensive <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Shadow_of_the_Erdtree_DLC">Shadow of the Erdtree guide hub</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/maps/elden-ring/the-shadow-realm">Elden Ring interactive map</a> if you need any help, </p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
