			<p>Borderlands 3 free Epic Game Store</p>		</div><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The July 2024 <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PlayStation Plus</a> monthly games have been revealed, and PS Plus subscribers – across all of Essentials, Extra and Premium – are being taken to the Borderlands with this trio of games.</p>
<h2>What are the PS Plus June 2024 games?</h2>
<p>The following three games will be available from the first Tuesday of the month, 2nd July.</p>


<ul>
<li><strong>Borderlands 3</strong></li>
<li><strong>Among Us</strong></li>
<li><strong>NHL 24</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/borderlands-3">Borderlands 3</a> saw the long awaited return of the co-op looter shooter, with another blast of, well…. blasting stuff to smithereens! Jason said in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/09/18/borderlands-3-review/">our review</a> that “I like it and it’s fun to play, but it could have been so much more and the writing feels like time traveling back to your high school days and being surprised and a little disappointed at how immature everyone is.”</p>

<p>If you enjoy your time with Borderlands 3 from the monthly collection, and are subscribed to PS Plus Extra or Premium, then make sure to also check out <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/03/30/tiny-tinas-wonderlands-review/">Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands</a> which is in the PS Plus Catalogue. It struck a much better writing and humour balance for Jason.</p>

<p>Following on from that is a game that’s really rather sus. The social gaming sensation <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/among-us">Among Us</a> is being chucked onto PS Plus to get more people chasing each other round, doing tasks on space ships and pointing fingers at one another when someone ends up being found dead.</p>

<p>And finally we have another of EA’s sports games, which might help you feel a little bit cooler as we get waves of hot summery weather. NHL 24 will let you take to the ice rink with the latest take on pro ice hockey.</p>
<p>So, what do you think of this month’s games?</p>
<h2>Can you still get the June 2024 PS Plus games?</h2>
<p>You can still grab June’s titles up until the new set of game’s arrives on 2nd July, so make sure to grab one of the best beat ’em ups of recent times!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SpongeBob Squarepants: The Cosmic Shake</strong></li>
<li><strong>AEW Fight Forever</strong></li>
<li><strong>Streets of Rage 4</strong></li>

            <p>
Dragon Age creator and BioWare veteran Mark Darrah has discussed some of the reasons why big-budget games seemingly take so long to make - and why some projects are announced so long before they're ready to release.
</p>
<p>
Darrah, a veteran of BioWare back to the original Baldur's Gate, previously headed the Dragon Age franchise and returned to work on the upcoming entry Dragon Age: The Veilguard as a consultant. 
</p>
<p>
Speaking via his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NK0vKRf0_c">YouTube</a> channel, Darrah provides some interesting insight on the topic of big-budget game development. And, while he avoids namechecking any of BioWare's games directly, it's not difficult to read between the lines at certain points as to how this wisdom relates to the company he's spent most of his career at.
</p>

</p>
<figcaption>Dragon Age: The Veilguard reveal trailer.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXKsoC12JCY" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
To begin with, Darrah counters the question of why AAA game development takes so long by simply saying that it doesn't - or at least, it doesn't take as long as you might initially believe. In practice, various games get announced well in advance of full development taking place, with only small teams working on pre-production or ideation for several years.
</p>
<p>
"There might be a small nascent seed of a team, but really there isn't any work being done for quite a long time," Darrah notes. "Studios can kind of be misleading on this front, because they'll say things like 'we've started work on Elder Scrolls 6', or they might even a trailer for the game even though the current team size is under 10 people. 
</p>
<p>
"So they're giving the impression that this is parallel development, that the team is working on this game, when in fact it's a few people having a few meetings, and not much is being done."
</p>
<p>
As a reminder, BioWare released its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-mass-effect-teaser-shows-series-will-return-to-milky-way">first teaser trailer for Mass Effect 5</a> in 2020, even though the bulk of BioWare has been busy working on Dragon Age: The Veilguard in the meantime. BioWare has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-5-teaser-image-revealed-and-analysed">updated fans with fresh concept art</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-teases-mass-effect-5-title-plus-answers-to-trilogy-ending-questions">other visuals</a> each year - but it's clear the game is still nowhere near launch.
</p>
<p>
"There might be reasons why it's important for the studio or the publisher to have that game in the public consciousness," Darrah continues. "It might be because the publisher's slate is a little weak, and they want the public to remember it still has important games in its back pocket. It might be because the studio wants the game announced because they're worried the publisher might kill it otherwise."
</p>
<p>
Announcing projects early isn't the best strategy, Darrah continues, but sometimes "needs must". 
</p>

<p>
The full video, above, is worth watching to hear more of Darrah's thoughts on what holds up big budget games from being made, including the growth in size of open-world or live-service projects in scope (and therefore the need for bigger, more cumbersome teams of people making them), a push from publishers for greater iteration and a "fidelity death cult" where projects have to continue pushing the bar in terms of visuals.

            <p>
The thing everybody forgets about Sisyphus is that he was an absolutely awful bastard who deserved everything he got. Prior to being the guy who has to push a boulder up a hill for all eternity, Sisyphus was a crafty Ephyran tyrant who used to murder his guests for kicks, and who once fathered children with his own niece in a bid to depose his own brother. Charming! The Ancient Greek gods were outraged both by the king's violation of the norms of hospitality, and by his general insistence on being too clever by half - and I feel a similar way reading the Xitter feed of Bashir "ManliestDev" Kashalo, who is making a game in which you play as Sisyphus after his eventual demotion to Hell's chief rock-pusher. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Kashalo has come to <a href="https://x.com/manliestdev/status/1805269658448146898">"hate"</a> playtesting the game, jovially titled Pushing It! With Sisyphus, whose <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2899090/Pushing_It_With_Sisyphus/">Steam page</a> promises "levels of frustration not previously thought possible". He's just really sick of that boulder. Waiter! Please fetch me the world's smallest violin, grind it to a paste and gently spoonfeed it to the developer who is weary of the game he consciously and deliberately decided to make about the experience of infinite failure. I'm sure no other video game developers can relate.
</p>
<p>
Kashalo is, of course, not being serious and neither am I. I think Pushing It! With Sisyphus looks hilarious. I also think it's hilarious that it's not even the only Sisyphus sim on the store. The others include 2D precision platformer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1634190/SISYPHUS/">SISYPHUS</a>, in which Sisyphus is a low-key ninja with the power of time manipulation, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2904890/The_Game_of_Sisyphus/">The Game Of Sisyphus</a>, perhaps the most polished of the currently available Sisyph 'em ups, which which, when I discovered it, had a "mostly positive" rating on Steam. 
</p>
<p>
You might think that "overwhelmingly positive" would be funnier, but the thing I love about "mostly positive", without reading the individual reviews, is that it implies a level of good-humoured debate and some carefully considered reservations at the level of both premise and execution, because after all, one player's eternal punishment is another player's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/diablo-4-best-class">Diablo 4</a>. Perhaps if the boulder had ray-tracing it would have squeaked into "overwhelmingly positive" territory. 
</p>
<p>
And then there's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2732980/Capybara_The_story_of_Sisyphus/">Capybara: The Story of Sisyphus</a>, in which Sisyphus is a capybara roped to a barrel, and the goal is to have a bath on top of the mountain. This particular incarnation of Sisyphus has Wild West levels and what's more, "if you suddenly fall off the mountain, there's a small chance you'll end up on the roof of a steampunk building!" I feel the spirit of the original myth has been lost, somewhat, but then again the capybara doesn't appear to have been a mass-murderer and would-be fratricide in her previous life - she's just "lazy". Perhaps becoming a capybara roped to a barrel and in sore need of a wash was the Olympian punishment for sloth? In fairness, this isn't worlds away from the average Aristophanes play.
</p>
<p>
What can we learn from this strange outbreak of Sisyphus games, which extend beyond explicit adaptations to widely influential Sisyphean works like Bennet Foddy's Getting Over It, the recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-tried-to-escape-hell-in-chained-together-and-one-of-us-kept-running-ahead-with-no-warning">Chained Together</a> and whole genres, like the endless runner? I dunno, but there's probably a wonky op-ed in how these games symbolise an entertainment form that has given itself over to cycles of indirectly monetised futility that wear the label of "progression system". In the eyes of investors and CEOs, every game needs to be a mountain without a summit. I'll say this for Sisyphus games, though: they make for brilliant streaming fodder. If you've got an hour to burn or more, you could do worse than to spend it watching Northernlion's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNNwBl7YmAc">fully narrated, surprisingly chill videos about his experience of Stygian torment</a>. Perhaps Bashir Kashalo would find the footage restful too, once he's done digesting that violin.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-gets-surprise-announcement-2024-release-and-controversial-frank-west-redesign.912015/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-gets-surprise-announcement-2024-release-and-controversial-frank-west-redesign/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Right out of nowhere, with no leaks or rumors or even official teases, CAPCOM has published a trailer for Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster. It's an updated version of the first game in the franchise, originally released for Xbox 360 in 2006. It will be released for 'new generation platforms', which clearly includes PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X (and hopefully PC, too), at some point in 2024.</p>
<p>It does seem to be more than your average remaster (hence the Deluxe moniker) since the visual uplift is pretty significant. However, the main character, Frank West, has clearly suffered a bit of a facial redesign, and I have a feeling it may be a bit controversial.</p>


<p><iframe title="Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster Teaser Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xyZ7gagpgsU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Anyway, as a long-standing franchise fan, I really appreciate the return of Dead Rising. The original game was very fun, and its time-sensitive mechanics also made it unique compared to many modern games. The last game in the series, Dead Rising 4, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dead-rising-4-review-jolly-hacknslash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> in December 2016 without any of those time-based systems and was the worst for it.</p>
<p>As you might remember, CAPCOM Vancouver was making Dead Rising 5 between 2016 and 2018, but the home office in Japan decided to ax it and <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-rising-capcom-vancouver-shut-down/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shut down the studio</a> after spending around $40 million on the project.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://wccftech.com/capcom-vancouver-wanted-to-make-new-dino-crisis-dead-rising-5-before-shutting-down/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a report by Liam Robertson</a>, the game would have taken place in Santa Catarina, Mexico, between the events of Dead Rising 2 and 3, and would have featured Dead Rising 2 protagonist Chuck Greene.</p>
<p>Dead Rising 5 would have been powered by Epic's Unreal Engine 4, which wasn't nearly as refined then as it is now, and reportedly posed some serious development challenges for CAPCOM Vancouver as they tried to make an open-world title with massive zombie hordes roaming around, as is customary for the Dead Rising franchise. At one point, the developers even considered switching from the usual bombastic and cheesy Dead Rising atmosphere to something much more serious.</p>
<p>Perhaps CAPCOM, which is in a much rosier financial situation nowadays, is testing the waters with this Deluxe Remaster to possibly greenlight a brand new installment in the franchise. One can hope, anyway.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-trailer-revealed/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>One of the best zombie apocalypse titles of all time is being remastered – Dead Rising. It was first released way back in 2006, with an HD remaster dropping in 2015. Now, in 2024, the ‘Deluxe Remaster’ is set to land on the Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC later this year. In a short teaser trailer posted today, Capcom showcased a brief snippet of the refreshed game that turned so many heads almost twenty years ago.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-dead-re-rising">Dead Re-Rising</h2>



<p>Dead Rising kicked off a series of open-world zombie apocalypse titles that would come to dominate the genre for almost two decades. With unparalleled levels of visceral, zombie-slaying action, bigger hordes than any other game, and more bizarre weapons than you could ever dream possible, the Dead Rising franchise has well and truly left its mark in the gaming history books.</p>



<p>The last Dead Rising game was released in 2016, and while it wasn’t as big a hit as previous games, it enjoyed its fifteen minutes of fame quite nicely. Since then, the series has gone quiet – aside from a few leaks concerning <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dead-rising-5-cancelled/">a cancelled Dead Rising 5 project</a> over the last year or so.</p>



<p>Now, Capcom is prepping a little fan service by teasing Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster - Official Teaser Trailer" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WgdRaicE0nw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Fans were quick to note that it’s not the original voice actor playing Frank, which is a sticking point, but it should be easy enough to overlook when they’re charging around Willamette’s mall, cracking skulls with all kinds of inane weaponry and trying to beat the clock.</p>



<p>It wasn’t confirmed when Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster is being released, only that it’s dropping this year.</p>

There, I said it. To date, I’ve logged over 300 hours (while listening to countless podcasts and audiobooks, sorry audio team), having only started the game several months ago on Xbox Game Pass.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As a Writer and Narrative Designer at Sticky Brain Studios, I was testing out some games as research for our next unannounced title. I only delved into </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Coral Island</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> after rage quitting </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Stardew Valley</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (I know, my team’s Animation Director/next game’s Concept Creator </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ejoanlee-illustration/">E. Joan Lee</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> finds this </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>hilarious</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">). Sometimes, it really boils down to aesthetics and explaining how to get started.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">From what my colleagues tell me, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Coral Island</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is remarkably similar to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Stardew Valley</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Coral Island</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’s main story quest is clearing the ocean of garbage and uncovering beacons that pierce through and dissolve an oil spill-like root that is poisoning the island and surrounding ocean waters. It gets a bit monotonous (hence me with the audiobooks), so it makes sense to also have the farming sim part, plus peppering the gameplay with NPC interaction and collection.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I love a game with crafting quests and resource management. I also spent ages playing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mineko’s Night Market</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> … twice. I love that</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> Coral Island</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> also has a racially diverse range of NPCs, and with its Indonesian studio/development team, it skews East Asian, so things like the Harvest Moon festival, mooncakes, the Cherry Blossom Festival, and Indonesian foods are featured. It’s a visually stunning experience, with such attention to detail that I never thought running through a field of digital cauliflower on a windy day could be so freaking satisfying.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I haven’t yet had the opportunity to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>work</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> on a game with such an extensive play time, but as game developers, I feel like we’re always searching for the things that make for compelling gameplay. And while I don’t share the same love of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Minecraft</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> with my children, in which they’ve logged far longer than my measly 300+ hours of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Coral Island</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, I feel like an articulated list of key considerations might be helpful, and could have been alternately titled as, “Maximizing the Feeling for Getting Fantastically Lost in a Game World: A Narrative Designer’s Wish List”.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Customizing your character’s aesthetic look and player name </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">goes a long way in making the player feel like they’re part of the story world. Every time an NPC says, “Thank you, Deb!”, I’m like, “You’re welcome, NPC, whose name I wouldn’t remember if it wasn’t in the character name label.” Player agency over how </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>they</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> appear can often deepen their connection to the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ensure that there’s a purpose for all dialogue</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. For all the effort that goes into planning, writing, crafting choices, asset creation, animation, coding, and localization – don’t give players a reason to skip any of it! Use dialogue interactions and cut scenes to:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">- Provide hints;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">- Add depth to the story; and</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">- Direct players to find or build up to crafting items for a longer quest -- which should then be an actionable item that adds to a quest list, and not just a suggestion.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Highlighting key words in the text would be helpful in identifying their importance. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mineko’s Night Market</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> does a really great job of this. I found myself taking paper notes, but my Certified Accessible® Player Experiences Practitioner self would recommend working this into a quest journal of sorts.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Meaningful interactions with NPCs</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> deepen the game’s feeling of immersion. I haven’t played the Steam version of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Coral Island</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> where you can form romantic relationships with NPCs, so I can’t speak to that. But having heard thirdhand that dialogue can run out with your spouse, I would venture setting the default dialogue to something like, “I love you! My days are so much happier with you in my life.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Give options to delve into deeper subjects</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for run-of-the-mill platonic conversations that can then be attached to something like a collector quest.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Example:</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">NPC: Hello [player name input]! How are you?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>You</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Great! How are you, [nonplayable character’s name]?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">NPC: I could be better.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>You</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Option 1</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: I don’t have time to talk right now, but let’s talk later.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">NPC: Sure thing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>OR</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>You:</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Option 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Why? What’s going on?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">NPC: My mom and I fought this morning. It’s my fault. I know a simple apology won’t work. I was thinking about trying to make her this special cake from her childhood she loves so much. But I don’t know where to find any pumpernickelodeonspongebobpantsie flowers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s an opportunity to unfold more of the story and develop characters, especially when players feel more invested while contributing to the story.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Item/craft quests should offer more significance than a mere errand.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Example:</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Accept pumpernickelodeonspongebobpantsie quest: Yes / No</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Coral Island</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>beautiful</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> set dec, such that players can enter almost every NPC’s delightfully furnished home. Other than for the currency reward, which at this point in the game, I don’t need, it feels like a lot of effort to find or harvest the requested item, track down the NPC, give them the item, have them acknowledge it, and then there’s no other interaction or mention of it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Previous interactions are reflected in future interactions.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Example:</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After completing the pumpernickelodeonspongebobpantsie flower quest, dialogue alludes to the NPC’s healed relationship with their mother, thanks to your efforts.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Anything new really hypes that reward instinct.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I don’t think I really need to elaborate on this, but getting a magical greenhouse or discovering merpeople was worth the lack of sleep and staying up a little, nay … a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>lot</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> longer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Understanding that the revenue model varies for such games, I do realize that my playing a premium download sim game carries a finite amount of gameplay and there is no obligation on the developers’ part to extend that past a main storyline. The thing is that many games are scoped with collector quests that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>offer</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> the kind of extensive gameplay whether the Player feels like it’s grinding or just a fun place to chill and go fishing.

		<p>Now I know what you are thinking, didn’t we have a remaster of Dead Rising back in 2016?&nbsp; Yes we did, but Capcom have announced a Deluxe Remaster which goes above making the game run on modern platforms and at a higher resolution.</p>
<p>It looks like all the graphics have had a major overhaul with Frank West now looking rather more haggard and rather older, gone are the luscious brown locks and in comes a rather scruffy, greying haircut.&nbsp; It also appears he has a new voice, fans have quickly noticed that it is not TJ Rotolo.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster Teaser Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9aL8m3OaJ2g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There is no other information about the game, the YouTube description just says “Hello? Is this thing on? This is Frank! Frank West! Is anyone out there? Grab your camera and prepare for the big scoop on Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster. Stay tuned for more info soon.” However, with Gamescom round the corner this does seem to be just the sort of thing that would get a premiere at the event.</p>


<p>It’s unclear who is behind the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster as Capcom Vancouver,&nbsp; the team who made the Dead Rising games, was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/09/19/dead-rising-developer-capcom-vancouver-to-close/">shut down in 2018</a>. “As a result of reviewing titles in development at Capcom Vancouver, Capcom has decided to cancel the development projects at this studio and will concentrate development of major titles in Japan,” the company said in a statement at the time.&nbsp; It did appear that Dead Rising 5 was in development at the time but it was cancelled, and that was the last we have heard of the franchise until today.</p>

<p>The last Dead Rising title was the fourth in the series and that was also released back in 2016.&nbsp; Sadly the PC version which we&nbsp; reviewed was littered with bugs and issues and we scored it just <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/12/15/dead-rising-4-review/">6/10 in our review.&nbsp;</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-brings-a-classic-back-from-the-dead.911973/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-announced<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has announced another remaster of&nbsp;<em>Dead Rising</em>, and this one looks like it's bringing a full visual overhaul to the classic zombie-slaying sandbox game.</p>
<p><em>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster&nbsp;</em>was revealed earlier today via teaser trailer, and while we don't get to see much of the new project, we can see that the visuals seem to have been significantly improved, with protagonist Frank West sporting a much more realistic (and still very recognizable) face.</p>
<p>The new trailer covers the intro to the original&nbsp;<em>Dead Rising</em>, wherein Frank West is helicoptered into Willamette, Colorado in order to investigate a zombie outbreak.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-frank-west.jpg?itok=ia5Mq6ub 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-frank-west.jpg?itok=1OQzV5HO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Everyone's favorite insane photojournalist Frank West is coming back yet again.</figcaption></figure><p>Capcom describes the new version of&nbsp;<em>Dead Rising&nbsp;</em>as "an updated release with a brand new look" that's making its way to the current generation sometime in 2024.</p>
<p>I'm assuming that means PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, along with a PC release, although it's unclear right now whether this new remaster will replace <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/427190/DEAD_RISING/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the existing one</a> on PC or be available as an additional version.</p>
<p>In any case, you can check out the brief announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster</em>, which is sporting a fun "DRDR" logo inspired by the original's graphic, right here.</p>

<p>The full extent of the changes Capcom will be making in this remaster aren't clear at the moment; it could just be a simple visual rework, or the studio could be taking this opportunity to sand down some of&nbsp;<em>Dead Rising</em>'s sharper 2006-era edges.</p>
<p>We'll just have to wait and see what's in store for this new version of Frank West's inaugural adventure, but at any rate, it'll be much more worth revisiting than <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/dead-rising-4-review-coal-miners-glove">2016's awful&nbsp;<em>Dead Rising 4</em></a>, which is probably why Capcom is going back to the start with this remaster.</p>
<p><em>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster&nbsp;</em>will be available sometime in 2024, presumably for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>Boil the kettle, we're having cheap ramen. If you liked <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/townscaper">Townscaper</a> for simple seaside town tinkering, or enjoyed the forest-dwelling demo of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tiny-glade">Tiny Glade</a>'s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-made-the-witchy-cottage-of-my-dreams-in-tiny-glade">homely castle creation</a>, you might get a satisfied sigh out of this. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dystopika">Dystopika</a> is a cyberpunk build 'n' chill where you place down skyscrapers, apartment blocks, factories, and imposing ziggurats straight out of Blade Runner. There's no goal, no big number to hit or yammering town mayor to appease. Just some low tempo music, straightforward building controls, and the ability to insert your own cat pictures on the sci-fi billboards.</p>

<p>It's a "meditative city-sculpting experience"  according to designer, Matt Marshall, who made the game partly while travelling for a year across cities in Japan, Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia. "No goals, no management, just rich, atmospheric moods for contemplation, creativity and wonder," he says. What this means in real terms is that you're being given a toy for gardening a city skyline of the future. </p>
<p>The tools for building are sweet 'n' simple. You plop down buildings, choosing from among some themes. Perhaps you want those neo-pyramids of Omega Corp, or maybe the small blocks of lowtown. You click them into being, rotate them, resize them, and watch as a smattering of other tiny buildings appears magically around them. The automatic growth of a city happening in seconds. Very soon a handful of extra props are unlocked. For me, it all moves towards constructing a pleasing shot for the camera in the game's photo mode. Ah, there we are. Snap.</p>
<p>These no-frills builders evoke the feeling of dressing a set with pre-made props. You're preparing a scene, building up to that perfect frame, that pleasant feeling of satisfaction as you look over everything and think: yes, that's it. You don't have to think too hard about the fine detail of the props you're adding, it's all about composition, broad strokes. In Dystopika, you can get more into the nitty gritty as you go along, adding glowing advertisement billboards, neon lettering, holographic whales and (my personal favourite) little hovercar highways that criss-cross the city high above the smog-coated ground. But largely, it's like those other relax-o-builders, in that it invites you to stay loose and not worry too much. There's no wrong place to build a skyscraper. </p>

<p>When you feel ready, you can import images from your computer onto the huge billboards of the city, filling your neo-capital with the feline mascots such a metropolis deserves. So far I've only toyed with it for an hour, raising three distinct clusters of buildings at some distance from one another (in the cyberfiction of my own head, they are separate districts). New props, megastructures, camera modes, and mod features are planned for the future, says the creator in a road map on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379910/Dystopika/?curator_clanid=44991926">the game's Steam page</a>. But I can safely say it has already given me my six quids worth of focused cyber-flow. Please excuse me, my glasses are steaming up. Must be all the noodling. </p>

  <p id="BaGg6N">Prime Video’s <em>Batman: Caped Crusader</em> may not <em>exactly</em> be set in the same continuity as <em>Batman: The Animated Series</em>, but if the first trailer is anything to judge by, it’s definitely set in the same nebulous time period. </p>

So it’s an intriguing, if winking bit of casting that finds him in <em>The Exorcism</em>, about an actor whose addictions tanked his once high-flying career and who now finds himself starring in the apotheosis of schlock horror genres: an exorcism flick.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="193897" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="10 Creatures We Wanna Ride In Star Wars Jedi: Survivor" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="418" data-playlist="193897,194012,194316" data-current="193897"><div><p>10 Creatures We Wanna Ride In Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193897/193897_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193897/193897_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193897/193897_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193897/193897_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/19360.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>It could have been delicious to watch Crowe chew up a role like this—cheeky, scary, profane. It could have been a lot of things.</p><p>But the intensity just isn’t there in director Joshua John Miller’s debut film. The script, written by Miller and his partner M.A. Fortin, does an excellent job of paying homage to the great demonic possession films of yesteryear, even name-dropping a few of them as exposition. But the joke only goes so far.</p><p>Crowe plays struggling actor Anthony Miller, cast in a new horror film <em>The Georgetown Projects, </em>a pastiche of both <em>The Exorcist</em> and <em>The Amityville Horror, </em>after its lead dies on set under mysterious circumstances. Running at a paltry 93 minutes, it’s a horror film about the making of a horror film that never really gets cooking.</p><p>Miller’s past haunts him. His daughter Lee, portrayed by an excellent Ryan Simpkins, arrives just as he’s cast in the film and is witness to his spiritual and physical relapse. Simpkins brings a nascent groundedness to Lee, who is fresh off a suspension from her all-girls school for an act of protest that may have been an act of arson. They and Chloe Bailey, who portrays Miller’s young co-star Blake Halloway, both bring a glow and warmth to the screen whenever they appear together. It makes for a nice contrast with Crowe’s erratic and increasingly cold Miller.</p><p>Rounding out the cast are Sam Worthington, Adam Goldberg, and David Hyde Pierce. All three carry their roles dutifully. Goldberg makes the most of his few minutes on screen as an acid-tongued schlock-jock. Sam Worthington’s character could have used more time and development. At points, you forget about him entirely. Pierce eats up every line he delivers, taking a moment to savor the ridiculousness around him, though he still gives an earnestness and clarity of faith to his performance as Father Conor. He mugs his way through the third act—worth the price of admission alone if you decide halfway through that you should have seen a comedy.</p><p>The short run-time doesn’t allow for much more than exposition, with jump cuts and placards speeding you along. Russel Crowe does what he can to bring a gravitas to Miller, but the writing doesn’t support his effort. And it all feels a tad self-serious and cloying, like something you might buy from the Vatican gift shop. If you were a fan of his take on Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde in 2017’s <em>The Mummy</em>, then you’ll enjoy his performance here.</p><p>The possessed move at alarming speeds, spines bend the way they shouldn’t, and the demon king Moloch might be an executive producer on the film. All in all, <em>The Exorcism</em> is a fun but hollow take on a staple of the horror genre. Crowe deserves a hell of a lot better, but don’t we all?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The first time I ever touched a Nintendo 64 controller and held it like an idiot <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/growing-up-sixty-four-1644419166&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/growing-up-sixty-four-1644419166">was in a Toys ‘R’ Us</a></span>. Some of its employees would go on to leak upcoming games to the world, and one even <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/i-got-internet-famous-leaking-games-from-toys-r-us-1788187772&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/i-got-internet-famous-leaking-games-from-toys-r-us-1788187772">got internet famous for doing so</a></span>. One thing everyone can agree on: it was a place created, run, and shopped at by humans. </p><p>So naturally, why not try to boil all of that down into a bungled series of god knows how many machine learning prompts? Billed as the “First Ever Brand Film Created with SORA,” the 66-second spot features an AI-animated depiction of Toys ‘R’ Us founder Charles Lazarus as a young boy in his dad’s bicycle shop. It shows him dreaming of a future filled with toys as a soulless woman’s voice creepily recites a two-sentence Wikipedia-style history of the company’s creation. The iconic Toys ‘R’ Us giraffe bobs along like a knock-off Pixar character wiped out by tranquilizers. </p><p>“We are thrilled to partner with Native Foreign to push the boundaries of Sora, a groundbreaking new technology from OpenAI that’s gaining global attention,” reads a description <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.toysrus.com/pages/studios&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.toysrus.com/pages/studios" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on the company’s website</a></span>. “Sora can create up to one-minute-long videos featuring realistic scenes and multiple characters, all generated from text instruction. Imagine the excitement of creating a young Charles Lazarus, the founder of Toys ‘R’ Us, and envisioning his dreams for our iconic brand and beloved mascot Geoffrey the Giraffe in the early 1930s.”</p><p>The whole thing is cringe, bizarre, and soul-crushing in a bunch of ways. First, there’s the fact that generative AI is theft. Then there’s the idea of trying to evoke “Rosebud” level child-like wonder and nostalgia using an artifact no humans were involved in making. Finally, the ad leans on the founder’s legacy to paper over the fact that Toys ‘R’ Us was put through a financial wood chipper by Bain Capital and others in the 2000s. It now exists primarily as the rent-seeking play thing of the “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.anbmedia.com/news/retail-news/2021/03/whp-acquires-controlling-stake-in-toysrus/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.anbmedia.com/news/retail-news/2021/03/whp-acquires-controlling-stake-in-toysrus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">leading brand acquisition and management firm</a></span>” WHP Global. The company’s tagline is “activating the power of brand.” Apparently it couldn’t afford any <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nvidia-convai-ai-demo-npc-dialogue-bad-1851345311&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nvidia-convai-ai-demo-npc-dialogue-bad-1851345311">real artists, designers, or writers</a></span> to help do that in this instance. </p><p>I grew up to the dumb beat of inexorable technological progress. Change might be hard, but it was for the best.  Toys ‘R’ Us came in and supplanted mom and pop shops. Big box stores came in and supplanted  Toys ‘R’ Us. Now the algorithms for Google, Amazon, and TikTok shape what we imagine will fill the hole in our hearts when we click the buy button. It’s easy to to feel like it’s all just another version of the same old bullshit. Part of getting older is realizing that it’s definitely not. </p><p>I’m not going to pretend that the world would be a better place if there were a Toys ‘R’ Us in every zip code. But the idea of having a big store stocked entirely with frivolous, colorful chaos sounds naively whimsical in the year 2024. I have small children. I have been to the three disheveled toy aisles at the local Target, one of which is <em>still</em> pink somehow, and they absolutely suck. I have tried to find cool toys on Google and Amazon and it all funnels you to the same SEO-gamed, sponsored-ad junk. </p><p>It might seem like this has nothing to do with the AI-generated Toys ‘R’ Us ad, but its the same logic at work: remove the humans, maximize the profits, completely <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/#hey-guys&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/#hey-guys" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">enshittify</a></span> everything in the process. What you’re supposed to take away from from the ad is an affection for whimsy and a renewed appreciation for humanity’s enduring will to dream. But the real message is that dreams are cheap, and easily replaced by AI. It’s a proof-of-concept exercise leveraging a dead brand’s last drops of nostalgia for a pre-internet age aimed at convincing other companies that they too can cut costs by replacing human input with random slop. I’m sure there is a 21st century Lazarus dreaming of exactly that. </p><p> .</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>PlayStation has revealed this month's batch of free games for PlayStation Plus subscribers, starting July 2: Borderlands 3, NHL 24, and Among Us.

While the main storyline isn't the best, the four DLC expansions tell a much better story and one of them <em>sort of </em>sees Handsome Jack return to menace players. The timing on this addition to PS Plus is also pretty good, as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-movie-clip-shows-shows-liliths-team-in-action/1100-6524061/" data-ref-id="1100-6524061">live-action Borderlands movie</a> will hit theaters in August.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4325162-ps-plus-july-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4325162" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4325162-ps-plus-july-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4325162"></a><figcaption>Ps Plus games for July 2024.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4325162-ps-plus-july-1.jpg"></figure><p>Next on the list is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/nhl-24/" data-ref-id="5000-598603">EA Sports NHL 24</a>. This version of the game included several new game features and upgraded modes, and the Exhaust Engine was used to create more authentic experiences on the ice.</p><p>Lastly, you can gather some friends and wonder which one of them is a horrendous alien that defies mortal comprehension in Among Us. The game became a huge hit during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, and since then, it has remained a firm favorite as a social game with its frequent updates and<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-gaming-april-fools-day-jokes/2900-5219/" data-ref-id="2900-5219"> nightmarish April Fools' jokes</a>.</p><p>If you've never played it, Among Us is all about holding a spaceship together as your crew works to return to civilization. The catch here is that one of your crewmates is a shape-shifting alien, and they'll be aiming to sabotage the ship and kill everyone aboard. The remaining humans have to finish their tasks and identify the Impostors before it's too late.</p><p>As a bonus in July, PlayStation Plus members can also claim in-game rewards for Genshin Impact with an exclusive bundle.

The scene depicts Karlach realizing she's stuck in a video game, looking directly into the camera, and addressing the player on the other side of the screen.</p><p>Chubblot only managed to access the scene by using mods, suggesting the scene could simply be cut content not meant to be seen in-game. But things changed when Karlach's voice actress, Samantha Bert, commented on the mysterious discovery.</p><p dir="ltr">"Congrats on finding this, perhaps I'll comment on it when someone triggers it organically (rather than yanking the file and then getting confused about context)," <a href="https://x.com/SamanthaBeart/status/1703158961753502110" rel="nofollow">Bert said</a> of the odd cutscene, suggesting it may be possible to access without modding the game's files the way Chubblot did--and that players may have misinterpreted the meaning of the scene itself. Some players say they've encountered the cutscene, but none have managed to produce evidence of triggering it organically during their playthroughs, leaving fans of the franchise confused--and eager to get to the bottom of the mystery.</p><p dir="ltr">In response to Bert's comments regarding the scene, Proxy Gate Tactician <a href="https://youtu.be/BkvOeluJOCs?si=TiejTB6KADRlF1nz&amp;t=474" rel="nofollow">posted a video</a> detailing the hunt for the hidden cutscene and announcing the $500 reward.</p><p dir="ltr">"If someone can find a legitimate way--without modifying the game's files or cheating--to trigger this cutscene, post a video showing a method of how they did it, and others can do it themselves using that method, I will send you $500," Proxy Gate Tactician said in the video.</p><p dir="ltr">Currently, no one has managed to pull it off, but knowing the Baldur's Gate 3 fandom, someone will hopefully rise to the occasion eventually--but it will certainly be a challenge, especially given the fact that dataminers say the scene is marked as "currently cannot be triggered" in the game's files.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/how-king-is-using-ai-to-speed-up-development-of-new-candy-crush-levels<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <p>The firm has made level iteration 50% faster as a result of its playtesting bot</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>For King, the new opportunities offered by AI in improving and speeding up game development aren't new at all.</p>
<p>The Candy Crush maker has been utilising and researching machine learning and AI tech for over half a decade, which is <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/king-purchase-ai-firm-peltarion">even before it acquired Peltarion</a>, the Swedish-based AI software company it picked up in 2022.</p>
<p>King's AI Labs is a sizeable department led by Sahar Asadi, and the firm has already introduced AI tools that its teams are using in games such as Candy Crush. In fact, one of those tools has already had a profound impact on the development of the hit mobile game.</p>
<p>"The playtesting bot we've developed gives designers, prior to releasing a level, an understanding of the game experience for the players," Asadi explains. "They can see whether the level they've created is providing the desired experience or not, and if not they can go back and refine it.</p>
<p>"We've also built on top of this bot a tweaking solution. If a designer says there are a few levels that don't have the intended experience, and these are the criteria for that experience, the bot can make refinements automatically. The best refined solutions are sent to the designers, and they can pick the best ones and go from there.</p>
<p>"The fun part for designers is to create levels. The mundane part is iterating, playing the level, looking at how it is, and if you're not happy going back and tweaking it. That manual work is mundane. The playtesting bot has been helping to reduce the time on tweaking, and that allows for more time on the creative part, which is making and innovating with levels."</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/candy-crush.jpeg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>Candy Crush level tweaking has been sped up significantly due to AI</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>AI being used to play games isn't new. We've had computers play chess against world champions for decades. But the AI that King has built isn't trying to beat humans but replicate them. And that required a different approach.</p>
<p>"For us, the key element about playtesting is to make sure it's human-like. A few years ago, there was this AlphaGo from DeepMind, which was playing Go against the master of Go, and the goal was to beat the best player. Here, we want to emulate our players. How do we make sure it is human-like? Let's say you're on move number two or three: [the bot] looks at the board, it looks at the possible actions you can take, and then decides what the best option is. And 'best' in this case is the one that is most probably taken by a human."</p>
<p>This behaviour is learnt from the data King gathers about its players, Asadi continues.</p>
<p>"We know millions and millions of states and the corresponding actions that [players] took. And the bot is learning this pattern. So for a new state that it sees, it can predict the most human-like response. It might not be the best option, but it's the most human one.</p>
<p>"We run the playtesting bot over a large amount of data. We have the level difficulty, and we have the bot estimate on the level difficulty and the overall challenge. And we will find a linear pattern, which is an indication that it is playing the game like a human. Also, we have been continuously working recently on how would you incorporate player skills and preferences into the bot so that you can make it even more human-like."</p>
<p>The impact of the bot has been significant. Asadi tells us that there are now 95% fewer manual tweaks being made to levels as a result of the playtesting bot, and that's led to 50% faster tweaks to the levels overall. But the bot isn't all about speed of development.</p>
<p>"It also really helps us to ensure the quality of the released level," Asadi says. "Is the level playable? How much shuffle does this level have? Does it give the right amount of challenge to our players? That is a factor in why we're doing this."</p>
<blockquote><p>"The way of working is going to change There will be some shift in what skills you need in the day-to-day work"</p></blockquote>
<p>The natural concern for employees is whether this is the beginning of the end for designers. If bots are successfully recommending tweaks to levels that designers are accepting, how long before these tools are building the levels to begin with?</p>
<p>"Absolutely we need designers," Asadi says firmly. "We see this as a co-pilot for designers. It's an assistive tool. What the playtesting tool provides is insights about the gameplay before releasing it. If the bot gets it right, we are sure that the insights are right. At the end of the day, the designers know what is fun and what they want from the gameplay experience. And then they can decide with these insights whether they should go ahead and release the level, or whether they should iterate more."</p>
<p>She adds: "What is fun? What is a good gameplay experience? Mathematically you can never explain it. The designer role is there to build that."</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/candyscreen.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>The playtesting bot will play a Candy Crush level as if it's a human</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>What's more, these tools wouldn't be possible in the first place without the input from designers, Asadi argues.</p>
<p>"This whole tweaking system has been because of the close collaboration with designers. Their openness and excitement to try and get away from the mundane tasks to focus on the innovation, has been the main driver and incentivising everyone to spend time building this.</p>
<p>"If you go back in time, designers were using paper and pencils to design levels, then they moved to photoshop and now to new UI tools. I see this as another advanced tool that enables them to work on the things that are really skilful on. And hopefully it means we're building more exciting and interesting things."</p>
<p>Asadi may not believe AI will replace designers, but those mundane tasks she talks about are often the jobs that are given to entry-level employees to help them understand the processes. There are numerous people in the games industry who found their way into the business through testing, for example.</p>
<p>"The way of working is going to change," She admits. "There will be some shift in what skills you need in the day-to-day work. What are the new technologies and new products that we are building? So everyone's role, especially mine, is changing.</p>
<p>"Because of machine learning, a lot of things that engineers need to code, they don't need to anymore. When I am interviewing people today, I'm not basing it on the criteria that I used to hire people two years ago. But still, the gist of the things I need, and the understanding of machine learning, is still there."</p>
<blockquote><p>"For other companies, AI is moving fast, but how would you integrate it technically, culturally and in terms of getting the value out of it?"</p></blockquote>
<p>Moving forward, King's AI Labs is looking at ways that the company can get a better sense of its players and what they want at different times.</p>
<p>"For instance, if I sit on a bus and I have five minutes, I want to get to the level I was playing as fast as possible," she explains. "When I am sitting in the sofa, and I have half-an-hour, I might want to do different quests in the game. Getting this context and what is needed to get this joy out of the gameplay… that is something that could be rewarding for players. Part of our research is how, using foundational models and with the new developments in machine learning, we can capture a better representation and understanding of players, and feed that into the game in order to build a better experience."</p>
<p>AI is developing rapidly and it may only be a year or two before King's current research is implemented into its games. Yet the speed in which King can move is because of this early investment in AI tech. For other studios, the immediate opportunity AI represents will depend on whether they're ready to make the most of it.</p>
<p>"The landscape of AI development is changing very fast," Asadi concludes. "It makes it very exciting because it creates new opportunities to innovate, which keeps me and my team on our toes. It creates huge opportunities to bring that research into the game. But a huge factor is how ready the games are to take in these technologies. At King, we have this opportunity because we have already started, we started much earlier with some internal research, then the acquisition of Peltarion, which means we have the expertise. We have a very good connection with the game, and we're making the game ready to integrate with the AI solutions. That helps us to go fast.</p>
<p>"For other companies, that is something to consider. AI is moving fast, but how would you integrate it technically, culturally and in terms of getting the value out of it? That's critical. Very often my team works on something that gets to the game in one or two years. And I hope that the new solutions we're talking about can go even faster."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/26/forza-horizon-4-is-being-delisted-15-december-2024/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Playground Games has confirmed that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/forza-horizon-4">Forza Horizon 4</a> will be delisted from sale late this year on 15th December 2024, thanks to those pesky “licensing and agreements with our partners”. Between now and then, the game will be going on a steep discount, with the possibility to grab a game token for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a> players who bought any kind of DLC for the game.</p>
<p>This discounted pricing hasn’t been announced or put into place on Xbox yet, but Forza Horizon 4 is 80% off on Steam at £10.99, while the Ultimate Edition with DLC is now £16.99. <a href="https://support.forzamotorsport.net/hc/en-us/articles/30662484986387-Forza-Horizon-4-Delisting-FAQ">All standalone DLC has already been delisted</a>, so the only way to get the Fortune Island and LEGO Speed Champions DLC packs are to buy the Ultimate Edition.</p>


<p>Xbox Game Pass players who purchased DLC content and who had an active subscription yesterday, 25th June 2024, will receive&nbsp;a game token through the Xbox Message Center that will be delivered in the coming days to turn it into a full digital license for the game.</p>
<p>With the game being delisted, the next Festival Playlist will be its last. Series 77 will run from 25th July through to 22nd August, with the usual smorgasbord of weekly challenges and activities to take part in. After that point the festival playlist history will stay in the game, but players will be skipped through to the Festival Site screen instead of to the Playlist. There will also still be daily and weekly challenges in the game.</p>
<p>This final Series will be the last chance to earn the following Achievements:</p>

<ul>
<li>A Creature of Habit – Complete all Seasonal Championships in a Festival Playlist Series.</li>
<li>Stunt Puller – Complete all Seasonal PR Stunts in a Festival Playlist Series.</li>
<li>Cashing In – Earn 1 Season Completion Bonus.</li>
<li>Perfectionist – Earn all 8 Season Completion Bonuses in the same Series.</li>
<li>Encore? – Complete all activities in a single Festival Playlist Series.</li>
</ul>
<p>Forza games being delisted used to be a yearly occurrence in the late 2010s, as licensing for music and/or cars expired on a game-by-game basis. However, there’s been a lull since <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/07/30/forza-motorsport-7-delisting-september-big-sale-discount-offer-xbox-game-pass/">Forza Motorsport 7’s delisting in 2021</a>, and Forza Horizon 4 stayed relevant at the start of the Xbox Series X|S generation thanks to a native port to the new generation, before Forza Horizon 5 arrived two years later. As game releases have spread out, it’s possible that Microsoft has signed longer licensing deals, so that the 2018 game will have had a healthy six years on sale, as opposed to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/08/12/forza-horizon-3-delisted-september-games-with-gold-possible/">Horizon 3’s four</a>. Additionally, the latest Forza Motorsport is set to be a longer-lasting racing platform, so licensing deals will have been made to take that intention into account.</p>
<p>Of course, Forza Horizon 4 will still be totally playable after it’s been delisted, and it remains a real highlight of the series to date. Launching in 2018 for Xbox One and Xbox One X, it was a fantastic visual showcase that toured a rendition of Northern England and Scotland. In our review, Dom said, “The opening alone, which takes you through Forza’s beautiful changing of the seasons, forced me to quite unknowingly smile like a buffoon a number of times despite my default malaise of British apathy, and the game continued to force this cheery outpouring from me for hours upon hours. So, it’s good. Unless you don’t like smiling. Horizon 4 is fuelled by the same anarchic arcade racing streak as previous entries in the series, but its new additions ensure it remains firmly at the head of the pack.”</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/prince-of-persia-lost-crown-price-drop</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-price-sliced-permanently.911910/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/prince-of-persia-lost-crown-price-drop<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has announced a permanent&nbsp;<em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</em>&nbsp;price drop, so if you missed out on one of 2024's best games, now's your chance to pick it up.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown/price-drop" rel="noopener" target="_blank">spotted by PCGamesN</a>,&nbsp;<em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown&nbsp;</em>is now $10 cheaper across all platforms, and you'll probably be able to find it at a lower price if you're picking it up physically now as well.</p>
<p>PCGamesN asked Ubisoft about the price drop, and the studio confirmed that the change "is permanent" rather than being due to a sale, so you don't need to worry about missing out on this deal.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-price-drop-boss.jpg?itok=RuK9DPuE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-price-drop-boss.jpg?itok=7K8XiFDN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>One of 2024's best games is now permanently cheaper.</figcaption></figure><p>No reason was given for the price drop, but we can make some educated guesses.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown&nbsp;</em>is coming to Steam in August, so it's possible Ubisoft wants to lower the price to make the game more enticing for Steam players. It's likely a launch discount will also be applied to further attract Steam users at launch.</p>
<p>It's also possible that Ubisoft believes it got the price for the game wrong the first time around and wants to make an adjustment to put the game more in line with some of its fellows, although it's still not as cheap as the likes of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/367520/Hollow_Knight/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">Hollow Knight</a>&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1809540/Nine_Sols/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Nine Sols</em></a>.</p>
<p>Either way, this is a real win-win for anyone who's yet to check this game out, because&nbsp;<em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown&nbsp;</em>is one of the most underrated games of the year already, and we're only in June.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar,&nbsp;<em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown&nbsp;</em>is a 2.5D Metroidvania with a heavy emphasis on acrobatic platforming and combat.</p>
<p>You play as Sargon, a warrior of the Persian Immortals who must travel to the mystical Mount Qaf in order to save the captured Prince Ghassan. Along the way, you'll engage in classic&nbsp;<em>Prince of Persia</em>-style platforming challenges, take on massive bosses, and upgrade your abilities in true Metroidvania fashion.</p>
<p><i>The Lost Crown&nbsp;</i>might be a single-player experience, but there's still plenty of new stuff on the horizon for it, including a new chunk of single-player DLC that was announced during the recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everything-announced-at-ubisoft-forward-2024">Ubisoft Forward showcase</a>.</p>
<p>You can grab&nbsp;<em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2751000/Prince_of_Persia_The_Lost_Crown/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown/9NBV5QFW83WC" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>, and after the price drop, I'd heartily recommend you do.

<p>To kick things off, game director Rich Aldridge spoke of plans to “continue in the mold” of Thrones Of Decay’s pricing scheme, which split the factions into three separate, cheaper purchases. As for the shape the expansions might take, Aldridge said that “the big news is that you’ve shown us where the importance of the game is, and that’s Immortal Empires". The "next DLCs will be focused on Immortal Empires specifically,” although this doesn’t mean they’ll stop supporting the smaller Realms of Chaos campaign in terms of balancing and bug fixes. I do hope this means bringing some of the more focused narrative campaigns into the wider sandbox with things like worldwide story events. A hopelessly addicted man can dream.</p>
<p>On the upcoming DLC: It’s an ogre-haul, baby! Aldridge confirmed that the new Legendary Lord - or subfaction leader, if you’re new around these parts - will be the long-suspected Golfag Maneater. He’s a travelin’ man(eater), fond of exploring the world and finding strange and new cultures to eat. There will be more characters revealed later, but the video does spoil a few of the new units: the <a href="https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Thundertusk">Thundertusk</a>, which is actually an ice-type unit, confusingly, and <a href="https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Blood_Vultures">Blood Vultures</a>. These look to fill the ‘annoying flying unit’ archetype common among many factions. Not especially sexy, but with a huge amount of battlefield utility.</p>
<p>Next up, it’s Khorne. The legendary lord is <a href="https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/U%27Zhul_the_Skulltaker">U'Zhul the Skulltaker</a>, who I’d describe as an angry red man if that narrowed it down at all. Let me try again: he collects skulls. Nope, still too vague. He likes <em>interesting</em> skulls, like a mad stamp collector. Ok, that’s fun. Maybe he’ll get a lord skull trophy rack? Maybe Queek can get the same one! I’ve somehow turned this into a conversation about rats and I don’t care. For Khorne’s new units, they showed off the <a href="https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Slaughterbrute">Slaughterbrute</a> (Big, Red, Angry, like a daemonic Kool-Aid man).</p>

<p>Next up, it’s your boys and mine, the Greenskins. For the LL, it’s <a href="https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Gorbad_Ironclaw">Gorbad Ironclaw</a>. We haven’t had a boar-mounted orc lord yet (or indeed, any DLC orc lords, they’ve all been gobbos), so this is interesting to me, an enjoyer of furry pigs. They also suggest a diverse new roster, including not-so-subtly confirming a <a href="https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Colossal_Squig">Colossal Squig</a> on the horizon.</p>
<p>In terms of free bits, Aldrige reaffirms a return to the free LL format, last seen with Nurgle’s Epidemius. This time, it’s another Khorne lord, though they’re staying schtum on which one.</p>
<p>As for details on future content, Alridge says that getting the rest of the Chaos gods fleshed out is the main priority, which more than likely means Slaanesh is next. He also suggests sooner-rather-than-later updates for Vampire Counts, Norsca, and - happy days! - the glorious Lizardmen’s not-so-glorious Geomantic Web.</p>
<p>My high level take on the video is: it's great to see Rich Aldridge in the flesh and chatting about the game! Rich and his team have always felt like the beating heart of all that's great about the series, and even if it's still marketing, it's a fine choice to highlight his team talking about a game they're evidently brimming with passion for.</p>
<p>If you don’t fancy waiting, a quick reminder that Khorne got <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/todays-total-war-warhammer-3-patch-has-that-large-red-khorne-dog-your-ordered-plus-a-new-competitive-multiplayer-mode">a free dog</a> this week (angry, red). A quick reminder, also, that a former Creative Assembly developer<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-total-war-dev-accuses-creative-assembly-of-mismanagement-and-says-strategy-series-ai-is-limited-by-design"> recently took to Medium</a> to allege a culture of mismanagement and “limited by design” AI, dating back to the launch of Rome 2.</p>

Alexander told <em>Kotaku </em>through a DM that he, as well as Twitter users @Swirlymark, @rnaidens, @sexdisrespecter, @FlingLatraniz16, @Dorkp0rk, @beelolbop, and one anonymous fan, all came together to place these images in one of the busiest areas of New York City because they thought it “would be really funny.” But Alexander also says he believes Venture deserves “more love and recognition” within the <em>Overwatch </em>community.</p><p>“I really like Venture’s personality,” Alexander said. “They’re so energetic and fun!

Prince Jacaerys (Harry Collett) meets with Cregan Stark (Tom Taylor) on top of the Wall and accepts the best fighters that Lord Stark can dispense for Team Black. It’s comforting to be back on the Wall and hear a Northern drawl warning that “winter is coming.”</p><p>Princess Rhaenys (Eve Best), after dragon-watching the blockade of trade routes to King’s Landing, gets into it with a raving Daemon (Matt Smith), who questions her loyalty to Team Black. Daemon continually tries to assert his dominance but is reminded of his low rank. “It is a command,” he yells at Rhaenys. “Would that you were the King,” she tosses back.</p><p>In Drismarck, Lord Coryls (Steve Toussaint) assesses the state of the shipping fleet and meets Alyn, the sailor who saved his life. Then the “enduring mystery,” Queen Helaena (Phia Saban) ominously tells King Aegon (Tom Glynn-Carney) about fearing “the rats.”</p><p>Of course, rats surround King’s Landing. Lord Larys (Matthew Needham) exterminates Otto Highwater’s spies in another ploy to have Queen Consort Alicent Hightower (Olivia Cooke) owe him. When Alicent isn’t worrying about the impending war or her alliance with her father, she’s finally getting hers with Kings Guard commander Criston Cole (Fabian Frankel). Alicent is no angel, but after years of bedding a pus-filled King Corpse, she deserves a ride or two.</p><p>The Team Green council meeting goes awry with too many cooks in the kitchen (one being the 4-year-old heir that Aegon decided to bring to work). Aegon flounders as king. He can’t even resolve a small-time farming dispute, let alone enact his Dragon v Dragon war plan. Naturally, Aegon’s woeful leadership and need to be liked by the masses makes him the perfect puppet for Alicent and Otto to control. But the sneaky Larys starts campaigning to be Aegon’s new Hand.</p><figure id="" data-id="2c8efdfa7f031233090182d05c0769cf" data-recommend-id="image://2c8efdfa7f031233090182d05c0769cf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1778" data-height="1180" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Queen Rhaenrya stands overlooking the water.

Her palpable grief turns into a stern call to action as she delivers her only line in the entire episode, “I want Aemond Targaryen.”<br></p><p>Daemon heeds the call and cuts a deal with Miseryia (Sonoya Mizuno) to identify ratcatchers. He hires the disgruntled Blood and Cheese to kill Aemond. But Blood and Cheese throw out their original plan when they stumble upon the King’s heirs and the Oracle Helaena in the nursery. “A son for a son” is just as good in their eyes as they force Helaena to point out the male heir and slaughter him (thankfully off camera). The episode ends with Helaena clutching her daughter and fleeing for help.</p><p>Any hesitation from either Alicent or Rhaenerya about going headlong into war is squashed by their need to dole out Hammurabi’s Code: Eye for an Eye. Son for a Son. Heir for an Heir. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
