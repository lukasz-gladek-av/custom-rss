			<p>Although life continues to be grim for fans of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">The Elder Scrolls</em></strong> series, as the wait for the sixth entry in the series gets more difficult to bear with each passing day, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">2025</strong> brought a smile to more than a few of them with the release of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Oblivion Remastered</em></strong>, a remake of the fourth entry in the series by <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Bethesda</strong> powered by <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Unreal Engine 5</strong> which leaves the original gameplay almost intact.</p>



<p>Right from the outset, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-looks-gorgeous-and-its-out-now/"><strong>the game's shadowdrop appeared successful</strong></a>, which wasn't surprising given how popular the game remained following its 2006 release. However, nostalgia is not as powerful as some may think for engagement, as many players got their fix in about 10 hours before dropping the game.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/how-2025s-xbox-published-games-sold"><strong>a new report</strong></a> shared a couple of days <span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">ago,&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Alinea Analytics' Rhys Elliot</strong>&nbsp;looked at how well&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Xbox-published</strong>&nbsp;games performed</span> on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PlayStation 5</strong>, starting with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Oblivion Remastered</em></strong>. The remake sold <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">1.1 million copies</strong> on the system, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"proving the pull of Bethesda’s legacy catalogue on PlayStation hardware,"</em> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Elliot</strong> wrote in the Substack post. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"Over 80% of Oblivion’s PS5 copies were sold during its first month on the market, but some discounts to $33 over the past couple of months have led to small sales spikes,"</em> the analyst added.</p>



<p>While sales were solid, player engagement wasn't impressive at all for a massive RPG, as <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"around half of Oblivion Remastered players on PS5 played for less than 15 hours, showing that most people got their nostalgia fix before meaningfully progressing."</em> Considering how easy it is to lose oneself in Cyrondiil before making any real progress in the main story, this highlights that a remake needs more than improved visuals to keep players engaged past the point where they get their nostalgia fix.</p>



<p>However, there could be a few more reasons why those who purchased <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Oblivion Remastered</em></strong> on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PlayStation 5</strong> did not play for long, besides the lack of new content. For starters, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-is-an-impressive-remaster-with-dire-performance-problems-says-digital-foundry/">the game still runs poorly across all formats</a></strong>, and the performance hiccups make it challenging to enjoy the new visuals. In addition, the game does not support <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-8k-texture-packs/">mods</a></strong> on consoles, preventing it from achieving the same enduring popularity as its sequel, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Skyrim</em></strong>.</p>



<p>With <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Oblivion Remastered</em></strong> selling reasonably well, regardless of how long players have lost themselves in <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Cyrodiil</strong>, it will be interesting to see how <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Starfield</em></strong> will fare on the system.

Hopefully, <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-might-get-cyberpunk-2077-2-0-style-update-ps5-switch-2-launch-2026/"><strong>the rumored 2.0 update</strong></a> will also provide reasons for jaded players like me to return to the game, whose opinion on it<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-shattered-space-may-the-great-serpent-save-us/"><strong> soured a lot in the months after its release.</strong></a></p>

<p>That's March 5th, 2026, as <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/marathon-release-date-leaked-via-xbox-community-page-march-5th-deluxe-edition-available.1409665/">leaked</a> a bit ahead of time via some Xboxer slightly shakily filming their telly. Thankfully, you can now watch the fresh trailer above in the quality intended.</p>
<p>It bwaaaas and shoots its way through some action, while a narrator called Gantry waxes lyrical about Tau Ceti being buried. The only way it can maybe be saved, it turns out, is via you running around and getting shot a lot, which is a happy coincidence. I'll be honest, I'm not quite sure how to feel about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> at this juncture, at least until I've given it a go.</p><p>I have long admired the game's commitment to the colour lime green, as if it's a twelve year old who thinks being sponsored by Monster Energy is akin to being knighted by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/king-arthur">King Arthur</a>. Then again, Bungie betray this a bit by momentarily turning everything red towards the end of the trailer, as a tall robotic silhouette. However, this mysterious threat - who I assume to be the baddie - does have a glowing emerald circle in their chest, suggesting the heart of Marathon still flows with that love of lime green.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you fancy, you can queue up to pre-order the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPwr3JClpuQ">collector's edition</a>, which comes with a vacuum-packed caterpillar thing among other tat. The base version, meanwhile, will set you back £34.99 / $39.99 / €39.99, while the deluxe edition that boasts extra in-game stuff but no physical goodies costs £44.99 / $59.99 / €59.99. All the details on what each version includes can be found <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3065800/view/114412015531853135">here</a>, where Bungie have also mentioned that details for an open preview weekend will be coming soon.</p>
<p>That post also runs down the cast of English voice actors, which includes Deus Exman Elias Toufexis, Arthur Morgman Roger Clark, and at least four <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a> threeple - Samantha Béart, Jennifer English, Neil Newbon, and Tracy Wiles. Final Fantasy 16's Ben Starr is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/TSfKBTKmTKI">also in it</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-vr-mod-baldurs-gate-3-takedown-2000660987</link>
            <guid>1410133</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
                  Paywalled mods turn <i>Baldur's Gate 3</i> and every other major game into unofficial VR ports
                </p><div>
              
              <p><span>The modder behind a paywalled </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-the-kotaku-review-1845946628"><i><span>Cyberpunk 2077</span></i></a><span> VR mod has accused CD Projekt RED of following “in Take-Two Interactive Software’s steps,” after its legal team issued their project with a DMCA takedown notice. Clearly undeterred, the same modder has even gone ahead and released a VR mod for </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-bg3-review-dungeons-dragons-rpg-larian-1850726491"><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3</span></i></a><span>. It uses the same paywalled method of distribution that got them into trouble with <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>.</span></p>

 <p><span>Luke Ross (not his real name, according to </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23190201/luke-ross-vr-real-mod-gta-v-elden-ring-horizon-red-dead"><i><span>The Verge</span></i></a><span>) is a somewhat infamous figure within the VR modding community. His “R.E.A.L. VR” project is a singular mod that supports dozens of high-profile video games, including </span><i><span>Elden Ring</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Hogwarts Legacy</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Marvel’s Spider-Man</span></i><span>.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>The catch is that the R.E.A.L. VR mod requires a $10 monthly subscription to download directly through Luke Ross’ Patreon. While you could easily download everything you need with a one-off payment, you’d need to renew your subscription if one of the games is updated. If you’re curious as to how much Luke Ross is making off of said subscription, </span><i><span>The Verge</span></i><span> estimated that he was earning roughly $20,000 per month back in 2022.</span></p>

  <p><span>Requiring payment for a mod is obviously against most publishers’ terms of service, which is why Ross’ R.E.A.L. VR project has previously been subject to a <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-v-take-two-mafia-modder-mods-luke-ross-vr-dmca-1849149715">DMCA takedown by Take-Two Interactive</a> for its </span><i><span>Red Dead Redemption II </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto V</span></i><span> support.</span></p>

 <p><span>Based on a lengthy rant in the “About” section of his Patreon page in which he admonishes Take-Two for their “hostile behavior toward modders and gamers alike,” the VR modder doesn’t make much of a distinction between himself and those who release their mods for free.</span></p>

 <p><a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/another-one-dust-148437771"><span>A new post</span></a><span> on his Patreon now projects that same ire at CD Projekt Red.&nbsp; It blasts the Polish RPG-maker for its “iron-clad corpo logic” over the fact that “</span><span>every little action that a company takes is in the name of money, but everything that modders do must be absolutely for free.” </span><span>“As usual they stretch the concept of ‘derivative work’ until it’s paper-thin, as though a system that allows visualizing 40+ games in fully immersive 3D VR was somehow built making use of their intellectual property,” Ross writes.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>This post went up on January 17. Since then, R.E.A.L. VR has been updated to include support for </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3</span></i><span>. Hasbro, Wizards of the Coast’s parent company, has been quite liberal with its use of DMCA takedowns in the past, so I wouldn’t expect R.E.A.L. VR’s </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3</span></i><span> support to stick around for long.</span></p>

 <h2>Turning <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> VR into a modding live service</h2> <p><span>If I were to play devil’s advocate for a second, I do think there’s something to Luke Ross’ rants. R.E.A.L. VR is obviously not on the same level as your average mod, and likely requires a lot of upkeep. It’s hard to see a way in which he could continue to support it without some sort of monetary incentive.</span></p>

 <p><span>On the other hand, there’s a very straightforward loophole here that Ross is doubtlessly aware of and that hundreds of other modders take advantage of: donations. Instead of charging a one-off payment or a subscription for a mod, others release all of their mods for free and allow appreciative users to donate to them instead. There’s less danger with this method since donating is completely optional. </span></p> <p><span>Plenty of mod users don’t like mod paywalls either. A popular mod adding DLSS upscaling support to Starfield back at launch sparked its </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-dlss3-fsr2-pc-mod-nvidia-amd-intel-piracy-1850804328"><span>own controversy</span></a><span> when it was put behind a similar monthly subscription paywall. It seems the community is wise to Ross’ strategy, however, with many commenters over on the virtual reality subreddit taking CDPR’s side.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>“This is not the first mod the Modder had taken down because he tried to make a Live Service out of it,” wrote user </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1qfd6z2/comment/o03xc9q/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>Frraksurred</span></a><span>. “He knew he was outside the ToS and just chose to get away with it as long as he could. Now he’s trying to play the victim.” Others agreed. </span><span>“Good,” wrote user </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1qfd6z2/comment/o04zlti/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>PelluxNetwork</span></a><span>. “Paywalled mods are disgusting. Take donations, no worries there, but pay-walling your copyright infringement should be an obvious no.” </span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Riot MMO Secures World of Warcraft Lead Producer]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/riot-mmo-secures-world-of-warcraft-lead-producer/</link>
            <guid>1410130</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>World of Warcraft’s former lead producer has confirmed that they are jumping ship to work on Riot’s upcoming MMO. </p>



<p>Not much is known about the upcoming Riot League of Legends MMO, other than the fact that it is set in the Runeterra universe. League of Legends itself is reportedly scheduled to receive a major overhaul by 2027, which will seemingly be dubbed as ‘League Next’. However, today we aren’t talking about that title. </p>







<h2 id="h-riot-mmo-brings-in-world-of-warcraft-s-raymond-bartos">Riot MMO Brings in World of Warcraft’s Raymond Bartos </h2>



<p>The World of Warcraft’s lead producer, Raymond Bartos, announced his departure from Blizzard last month, after working for 3 years at the company. During that time, Bartos helped push content like Plunderstorm, multiple Remixes, Gear update, Dungeon Followers, Dastardly Duos and more. However, now he is ready to kick-start a new chapter in his game development journey. </p>



<p>Bartos took to <a href="https://x.com/RaymondBartos/status/2011629347803734299" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) to reveal that he will be moving to Riot Games to work on their upcoming MMO and taking on the role of Senior Game Producer. After working on one of the biggest MMORPGs on the planet, his expertise will be crucial to developing this project. The values of Riot Games were influential in securing Bartos, with the former WoW lead producer revealing that “kindness, respect, and care aren’t just words” at Riot, and it is something the “team truly lives by”. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I’m incredibly excited to be joining <a href="https://twitter.com/riotgames?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@riotgames</a> on the MMO team!!!</p><p>From my very first conversation with Riot, I immediately gravitated toward their values—and I was genuinely impressed by how clearly those values showed up throughout the interview process. It made it obvious… <a href="https://t.co/Sap1O7CQeo">pic.twitter.com/Sap1O7CQeo</a></p></div>— GoodGuyRay 💙 (@RaymondBartos) <a href="https://twitter.com/RaymondBartos/status/2011629347803734299?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 15, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Regarding Riot’s MMO, the last major update was <a href="https://x.com/MarcMerrill/status/1770479141600874553" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">back in 2024</a>, when the company’s co-founder spoke about future plans. At the time, they had decided to reset the direction of the project. Resetting also meant that they would be “going dark” for “several years,” and that seems to be the case. The company doesn’t want to create an MMO that players have played before with a Runeterra coat of paint. Instead, they want to do something “that truly feels like a significant evolution of the genre.” </p>

                <p>After years out of the Hollywood spotlight, The Mummy and The Whale actor Brendan Fraser has made a huge comeback. The actor has new film roles lined up, but right now, his most pressing concern is avoiding getting steamrolled by the notorious Lynel mini-bosses in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.</p><p>In an interview, Fraser was asked whether he was playing any video games, and he explained that he was "still stuck" on the critically acclaimed 2017 Zelda game. "I want to know how to get better weapons without getting my ass kicked by all the Lynels," <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ign/video/7596135484670184717" rel="nofollow ">Fraser said to IGN</a>, while also lamenting that there simply aren't enough bomb-flowers in the game. While his interviewer suggested he consult online guides, Fraser responded that he was looking to beat the game the old-fashioned way, without relying on walkthroughs.</p>

It will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC and cost $40.</p><p>The trailer introduces players again to Tau Ceti IV, a colony that you, playing as runners, will infiltrate to dispatch armed forces and extract with valuable gear. You'll make use of a variety of Runner Shells that give you different abilities and perks, defining your role in a party or giving you a choice over how to build if you're planning to play solo.

If you're so inclined, pre-orders for the game are open now as well, and you'll get extra stuff if you buy the game before its release date hits, including some rewards for <em>Destiny 2</em>.</p><p>This announcement marks the second time that <em>Marathon</em>'s release date has been revealed; back in April last year, Bungie <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marathon-release-date-gameplay-revealed" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="aa33e300-ad1e-49d4-aa79-c1a1ab82252d" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">set a September date for the game</a>, but <em>Marathon </em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shocking-no-one-bungies-marathon-delayed" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b9bec301-96aa-432b-879e-d90acf44097c" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">was delayed</a> in June following lukewarm feedback from the game's alpha testing period.</p><figure role="group">

<p>As well as the disappointing alpha feedback, Bungie also found itself at the center of controversy in May, when it was revealed that the game contained <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-marathon-art-stolen" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5bd258c2-70a9-4816-a5f2-9f981d275fcc" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">artwork that had been stolen</a> from an online artist without proper credit.</p><p>All of that followed on from news in August 2024 that <em>Marathon</em>'s former director Chris Barrett had been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marathon-director-fired-report-bungie" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7ef2a90f-6d8c-4535-a8a5-2e5217b15752" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">fired over misconduct allegations</a>, which led him to sue Sony over his dismissal. Sony promptly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-christopher-barrett-lawsuit-evidence" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d697b644-87cf-46b1-9530-25c17167ff69" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">responded to the lawsuit</a>, providing evidence of what it called a "pattern of misconduct" on Barrett's part.</p><p>This is all to say that <em>Marathon </em>has had a lengthy and difficult development cycle, and with <em>Destiny 2 </em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-q2-2025-26-destiny-2-bungie" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b988b438-f974-4d01-854a-83f6fa549891" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">proving a disappointment to Bungie and Sony</a> in recent years, the two will likely be hoping this one is more of an unqualified success.</p><p>You can check out the new pre-order trailer for <em>Marathon</em>, which also introduces a brand new character you'll be meeting a lot in the game, right here.</p>
<p>Assuming that there are no further delays, you'll be able to check out <em>Marathon </em>on March 5th on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3065800/Marathon/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/marathon/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/marathon/9pb32dkqkzdq" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

"Instead, later this year a RE Remake that starts with "(C)" &amp; ends "(ode Veronica)" is going to be announced, I promise you."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil: Code Veronica originally launched in 2000 for the Sega Dreamcast, and while not a mainline numbered entry like Resident Evil 2, 3 or 4, it remains beloved by fans and considered a core part of the franchise's story. Its narrative takes place around the same time as Resident Evil 3, but instead features Claire and Chris Redfield on a remote prison island and then in Antarctica. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Resident Evil 5, speculation around a remake has bubbled up following a teasing comment by Eva La Dare, the voice actress behind that game's character Sheva Alomar. However, as of yet, Capcom is not believed to have greenlit any new version of the game — which garnered strong sales and a mostly positive reaction from fans back at its original launch in 2009. Whatever Alomar is referring to, it's likely not worth getting your hopes up.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">Instead, Capcom will reportedly finish remaking its early Resident Evil entries with a fresh version of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-zero-hd">Resident Evil Zero</a>, due in 2028 after this year's Requiem and next year's new version of Code Veronica. (And after all that? Well, it would seem time for an all-new Resident Evil entry once again.) </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last year, Capcom's under-wraps Resident Evil Zero remake appeared to pop up on the resume of Far Cry 5 and Guardians of the Galaxy video game actor Jon McLaren, with the suggestion that he will now be playing escaped convict Billy Coen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Before all of that, of course, Resident Evil Requiem will arrive on February 27. Set to feature new character Grace Ashcroft and returning hero Leon S. Kennedy, the game's mix of survival horror and action looks hugely promising — even if <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/could-capcom-really-kill-leon-in-resident-evil-requiem-new-images-showing-a-mysterious-mark-on-his-neck-have-fans-worried">we're all a bit concerned by that nasty-looking bite on Leon's neck</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvel-rivals/">Marvel Rivals</a> introduced an upgrade to its hero proficiency system last week, allowing players to earn new rewards. Many of these rewards--including the brag-worthy Lord icons--require a considerable amount of grinding to achieve, which has led to the rise of "Lord farming" amongst the playerbase.</p><p>Essentially, players aren't moving after they spawn into a match, as they spam their abilities to earn proficiency points safely. This has led to some <em>very </em>one-sided matches, and developer NetEase says it'll address this problem in a future update. There's no date yet for when this update will go live, but players can expect some severe penalties if they're caught farming stats this way.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Marvel Rivals - Deadpool Character Gameplay Reveal Trailer | The Merc with a Mouth</p>
      </div>
<p>"Recently, we've noticed that some players are exploiting matches by remaining stationary and repeatedly farming stats to gain hero proficiency points," <a href="https://x.com/marvelrivals/status/2013176993383133552" rel="nofollow ">NetEase wrote online</a>. "This behavior disrupts normal gameplay and seriously affects the match experience of other players. To address this, we are planning to introduce a combat behavior detection system. Players found engaging in such behavior may face penalties including, but not limited to: warnings, short-term suspensions, long-term suspensions, or permanent account bans. We ask all players to help us maintain a fair and healthy game environment."</p><p>Outside of players suddenly developing concrete feet, Marvel Rivals has expanded with several new modes and heroes over the last couple of months. Rogue and Gambit made their grand debut the previous year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-deadpool-can-literally-do-it-all/1100-6537365/">and Deadpool was added to the game</a> when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/marvel-rivals-battle-pass-season-6-all-skins-emotes-and-other-rewards/2900-7412/">Season 6</a> began on January 16. Designed to be a Jack-of-all-trades character, Deadpool can serve as a Duelist, Vanguard, or Strategist hero, and he can upgrade his abilities throughout a match.</p><p>Season 6 also added team-up balance changes, the Collector's museum, a dueling arena, and a photo mode. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-shortening-seasons-releasing-a-new-hero-every-month/1100-6530612/">The next Marvel Rivals hero</a> will be the monster-hunter Elsa Bloodstone, who'll arrive halfway through the current season.</p>

                <p>Valve has made changes to its AI-disclosure guidelines, removing the need for studios to disclose whether or not games have been developed with AI-powered tools and putting more emphasis on AI-generated assets.</p><p>The change, which was pointed out by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/simoncarless_interestingly-pc-video-game-platform-steam-activity-7417944215675908096-OGNg/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Simon Carless on LinkedIn</a>, suggests that Valve is no longer concerned by the use of AI tools that assist development, stating, "Efficiency gains through the use of [AI-powered dev tools] is not the focus of this section." These tools could included a variety of things, such as AI-generated transcripts of meetings to code helpers that have become prevalent in most programming environments.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Divinity Will Be Better Than Baldur’s Gate 3 “On All Fronts” Says Larian CEO</p>
      </div>
<p>Valve states the the aim of its disclosure policy is to inform players when AI is used to generate content, from marketing and conceptual assets to in-game ones that players will interact with. Developers are able to specify what assets have been generated and indicate, via a single checkbox, whether or not players will interact with AI-generated content during gameplay, be it images, audio, or other content.</p><p>This is the first time Valve has made a significant change to the AI disclosure rules since its introduction in 2024, when generative AI use in game development began rising. While there are thousands of games on Steam that disclose the use of AI, the policy is still voluntary and not enforce by moderation on Valve's end, meaning many developers might omit the disclosure on their store pages. The policy itself contradicts other rival storefronts such as the Epic Games Store, with Epic CEO Tim Sweeny recently stating that such disclosures "make no sense" for storefronts.</p><p>The use of AI continues to be a talking point off the back of 2025. The use of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-sparks-debate-over-ai-voice-acting-in-games/1100-6536146/" data-ref-id="1100-6536146">AI-generated audio </a>in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> was widely discussed in the wake of its critical and commercial success, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/" data-ref-id="5000-497541">Baldur's Gate 3</a> developer Larian Studios came under fire after its CEO suggested that the studio will make use of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-divinity-dev-reveals-how-it-uses-generative-ai/1100-6537001/" data-ref-id="1100-6537001">generative AI in several conceptual phases</a> for its next game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/divinity/" data-ref-id="5000-706358">Divinity</a>. Larian <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/larian-studios-draws-harder-line-on-ai-clarifies-stance-in-reddit-ama/1100-6537296/" data-ref-id="1100-6537296">later clarified this statement </a>to assure players this would no longer be the case, but that the studio will continue exploring these options in the future.</p>

            <guid>1410085</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Last year, Ubisoft released a <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/29/far-cry-4-gets-60-frames-per-second-update-on-current-gen-consoles">60 FPS update for Far Cry 4</a> on current consoles, and now it’s applying the same magic to three earlier entries. Far Cry 3: Classic Edition, Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon Classic Edition, and Far Cry Primal will receive the same update this week.</p><p>The news was first announced via a <a href="https://x.com/FarCrygame/status/2012162929614029088">cryptic X post</a> featuring three math equations using emojis to spell out the games and the 60 FPS update. These updates will be available this Wednesday, January 21, and apply when playing the games on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. Individual trailers showcase the improved framerates (at least for Far Cry 3 and Blood Dragon), which, keep in mind, is the primary upgrade; don’t expect any graphical enhancements. Still, it’s nice to have smoother-running versions of these games on current platforms.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MLmdp8xEHTU"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MLmdp8xEHTU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>To reiterate, the update applies to the Classic Editions of Far Cry 3 and Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon, which are remastered ports released for PS4 and Xbox One in 2018 and 2021, respectively. Far Cry Primal, meanwhile, is a native last-gen title released in 2016.</p><p>As you wait for the update to hit this Wednesday, you can read our original reviews for <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/far_cry_3/b/pc/archive/2012/11/21/you-know-where-you-are-you-re-in-the-jungle-baby.aspx">Far Cry 3</a>, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/far_cry_3_blood_dragon/b/xbox360/archive/2013/04/30/ubisoft-loves-the-39-80s.aspx">Blood Dragon</a>, and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/far_cry_primal/b/xboxone/archive/2016/02/22/far-cry-primal-review-moving-forward-by-looking-back.aspx">Primal</a>.

            <p>Another voice actor has confirmed their participation in upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider game</a>, Catalyst.</p>
<p>Eva La Dare has revealed she is part of the Tomb Raider: Catalyst cast, after fans thought they recognised her voice <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-tomb-raider-game-known-as-catalyst-finally-revealed-at-the-game-awards">during last month's reveal trailer</a>. "Your ears are GOOD!" La Dare responded on social media.</p>

<p>La Dare did not go into details about her Tomb Raider: Catalyst character, <a href="https://x.com/KarenShevaEva/status/2011578365627810233?s=20">simply stating</a>: "Can't say more yet, but I'm so excited to be part of this legendary franchise" (thanks, <a href="https://www.tombraiderchronicles.com/headlines5409.html">TombRaiderChronicles</a>).</p>

			<p>MIO: Memories In Orbit can be described in four words: beautiful, engaging, challenging, and frustrating. It is a game that will be those who really like a tough as nails platforming and boss fights, but it will frustrate those who do not like getting stuck on sections because your reaction times come up short. I fall somewhere in the middle of the two camps, with the game’s story taking me nearly 50 hours to complete, and there are still some sections of The Vessel I have yet to see.</p>
<p><iframe title="MIO: Memories in Orbit - Release Date Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1OlFwMM1RdI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>MIO: Memories of Orbit is set on a ship called The Vessel, a generational ship that was taking humans, called The Travellers by the robots of the ship, on a journey to find a new home. Some kind of disaster sees all of the Travellers disappear, leaving The Vessel to sail onward while it deteriorates. MIO finds that The Vessel is on its last legs because the Pearls – the different AIs that kept the ship going – have seemingly abandoned their duties which in turn has allowed some kind of corruption spread amongst some of the robots on the ship. MIO goes on a journey to discover what has happened to the Pearls, having to navigate a ship falling apart and rogue robots attacking anything in sight.</p>



<p>The Vessel is huge. MIO: Memories In Orbit’s map has such a variety of locations with each having their own distinct looks. You start in Nexus at its centre and from there you can explore the garden and promenade of the Haven, or head in the other direction to the Metropolis. Eventually, you will also be able to delve deeper into The Vessel towards the Vaults or head upward to the Celestial Bay. The only issue is that none of these locations are easily accessible through the deteriorating ship structure, and the platforming is far from forgiving.</p>

<p>MIO slowly gains new ways to traverse the ship, so you will need to go back and forth a fair few times between districts to see all of the platforming puzzles and bosses they have hidden within them. The platforming in MIO: Memories of Orbit does require precision and quick reflexes, with these sections getting more difficult as you unlock more traversal options. That’s because you will need to quickly switch between using each one to get to new locations, while also managing MIO’s energy bar. While most of the platforming is tough but fair, &nbsp;there were a few that felt way too tricky. There is a fine line between making something challenging and making something tedious or overly contrived, forcing you to repeat the same section over and over again. These moments always took away from the experience.</p>

<p>Combat in MIO: Memories of Orbit seems like a simple affair at first, with just a single attack button and a dodge, but there is a lot of depth around that. You have to understand and learn the patterns of your opponents, and while fights against regular enemies become easier as you get stronger, but each boss has its own unique attacks and arenas with their own hazards to deal with too. The battles are incredibly tough but, unlike some the platforming, they do not get to a point where they become too frustrating. It all comes down to knowing when to hit and knowing when to back off and move out the way for all of them. I liked each design of the bosses with each one having memorable hooks to them, with some appearing out of nowhere as you move through The Vessel.</p>
<p>Helping you get stronger are the Modifiers you can install, some of which allow for combos where the final hit deals additional damage, and others can increase the number of slots so you can equip more. However, there is a cost with increasing modifier slots, which could see Nacre Basins remaining empty. These are stopping points that allow you to replenish your health, which is useful especially before tough platforming sections and bosses, while nacre also acts as the game currency to buy upgrades for MIO.</p>

<p>MIO: Memories In Orbit is certainly going to compete to be one of the best-looking games of the year, with hand drawn environments and movements. Every district in The Vessel has such a unique look, with my personal favourite being the Aviaries and the Bell Tower. The designs of the characters look great and even though some characters don’t have faces the way they are drawn and posed communicate their emotions very well. The visual design is one of the main factors that kept me pushing through the game, because I wanted to see what the designers had come up with. This is paired well with the music and soundtrack, with haunting melodies in some areas really selling that this is a ship on its final voyage.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		MIO: Memories In Orbit is an early contender for one of the most memorable games of 2026.

MIO: Memories In Orbit draws you in, and does not let go easily. It is hard game but the journey is worth experiencing.	</p></div>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/mio-memories-in-orbit</link>
            <guid>1410070</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="MIO: Memories in Orbit Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161509/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>Team Cherry set a new genre standard with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a>. That legacy has recently been reaffirmed by the long-awaited <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Silksong</a>, a release that developers and publishers alike are now clamouring to match. These are beautifully animated combat platformers, built around tight controls and striking art direction. Players explore compelling, labyrinthine spaces in search of answers, upgrades, and increasingly brutal challenges.</p>
<p>Douze Dixiemes looks to emulate that success with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mio-memories-in-orbit">MIO: Memories in Orbit</a>. The French indie studio's game is sumptuously designed, dripping with atmosphere and built around a compelling central mystery. There is a lot in this complex science fiction fable that feels a little too familiar. Even so, the little robot hero, MIO, is a strong candidate to carry the gauntlet thrown down by The Knight and Hornet.</p>
<figure><a title="MIO: Memories in Orbit Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161513/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Awakening on what looks like an operating table as a giant creature skitters away, MIO wanders out into the Vessel. This gigantic collection of biomes is filled with deadly flora and automatons, both hostile and friendly. Picking away at the mystery behind the Vessel’s collapse, she is tasked with finding and reactivating the Pearls, guardian AIs of this strange place.</p>
<p>MIO plays out like a very typical Metroidvania, with MIO (the game’s name matching the protagonist’s may get confusing) exploring areas of the Vessel and gaining abilities that allow her to push further.</p>
<p>The Vessel itself is a gorgeous place to inhabit. Grand architecture is fused with technology and pastel-coloured vegetation. Bio-organic masses weave in and out of stone constructs and metal pipes, while creatures stir in the shadows. Those shadows, and the lights that spread across surfaces, look like charcoal sketches. Each biome is distinct, and discovering a new area frequently inspires awe.</p>
<figure><a title="MIO: Memories in Orbit Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161511/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Gorgeous sound design complements the painterly visuals. The enchanting synth score ebbs and flows, transitioning into frantic techno beats during moments of action. The dreamlike background themes emphasise the intimidating size of the Vessel, reinforcing just how small you feel within its vast interior.</p>
<p>Despite the grandeur, the overall tone is one of melancholy. Scattered around the Vessel are robots that pine for their loved ones and lament the downfall of this once thriving home. Helping them will slowly uncover the story behind this world and MIO’s purpose.</p>
<p>Not all the bots wandering around the Vessel are nice, however, and there is some nicely twitchy combat to enjoy alongside the exploration. Enemy types are varied, although the roster leans a bit too heavily toward aerial threats.</p>
<p>MIO has some basic slashing combos that combine with her floaty jump, letting her attack bots from all angles. A dodge is unlocked early on that adds to combat variety. Bosses escalate nicely. Some are punishing, but runbacks are merciful.</p>
<figure><a title="MIO: Memories in Orbit Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161504/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Those runbacks, as well as general traversal, require skill and timing to navigate the many hazard-strewn routes of the Vessel. MIO can double jump from the beginning, which gets her through the opening areas with relative ease. Later, she obtains a grapple (here called the hairpin) that allows her to latch onto anchor points and enemies to gain height and reach more of the environment.</p>
<p>When she unlocks the ability to refresh her jump and hairpin, things get a bit more fiddly. Team Cherry veterans can attest that there is nothing more frustrating than whiffing a hit and breaking a long jump chain.</p>
<p>Love it or hate it, this kind of platforming is a staple of the genre now. It can be deeply satisfying to master, but rage-inducing when you just can't get the hang of it. That said, there is an undeniable satisfaction in clearing hazard-filled vertical climbs and being gifted a merciful shortcut back to a hub area or boss encounter.</p>
<figure><a title="MIO: Memories in Orbit Review - Screenshot 5 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161508/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Alongside a forgiving map structure, MIO’s combat and survival abilities are bolstered by mods. This gameplay-altering upgrade system is not unlike the chip abilities found in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nierautomata_the_end_of_yorha_edition">Nier Automata</a>. Every aspect of her offence and defence can be buffed by installing mods scattered throughout the Vessel.</p>
<p>These modifications can tweak core elements of the experience. One even strips away the UI entirely, offering a cleaner view of the game’s lovely environmental design. Others focus on more direct boosts to offence and defence. The most powerful upgrades often come with a debuff attached, helping balance out the boon without undercutting its usefulness. Much like with Nier, mods are limited by capacity, so there is a nice juggling act at play. You will be building different versions of MIO to get past specific challenges.</p>
<p>There’s been an emphasis on other titles here, which may have distracted from judging the game on its own merits, but the comparisons are very hard to avoid. Ultimately, MIO wears its influences proudly, and it delivers enough atmosphere and polish to stand on its own. Its ideas and execution do lack originality, but that is not a dealbreaker.</p>
<figure><a title="MIO: Memories in Orbit Review - Screenshot 6 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161507/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>As a Switch 2 title, it ran smooth as butter both docked and undocked, never dipping below 60fps on the larger display. Consistent performance is crucial given how much precision the boss fights and platforming demand. The experience is rounded out nicely by assist options and difficulty tweaks that restore some of MIO’s health when she’s stationary and weaken bosses after each attempt. These options don’t dilute the overall experience, instead offering a more accessible entry point for players who found the game’s contemporaries a bit too unforgiving.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>MIO is a compelling adventure with solid platforming and combat. The Vessel is a great place to explore and the mod system adds versatility. A great Metroidvania, then, though its similarities to genre heavyweights stop it from being essential. If you are in the mood for another tightly designed Metroidvania on Switch, however, this is an easy recommendation.</p></section>

			<p>Over the past few years, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">CAPCOM</strong> has done an excellent job keeping the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Resident Evil</em></strong> series in the spotlight by releasing remakes of the first four entries in the series alongside new entries in the series, such as <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-7-survival-horror-king/">Resident Evil VII Biohazard</a></em></strong> and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-village-horror-greatest-hits/">Resident Evil Village</a></em></strong>. This approach not only provided fans of the series with multiple entries to enjoy, but also revitalized it, which had looked like it was losing what made it so special with the widely criticized sixth entry.</p>



<p>2026 looks set to be an excellent year for fans of the series. In a little over a month, <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-gamescom-hands-on-preview-turn-on-the-lights/">Resident Evil Requiem</a></em></strong> will launch on <strong>PC</strong> and consoles, marking the return of <strong>Leon S. Kennedy</strong> to a mainline entry in the series and a dual gameplay style that looks incredibly compelling.</p>



<p>The launch of the ninth main entry in the series, however, isn't everything fans reportedly have to look forward to despite the disappointing lack of news of this month's <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-gameplay-resident-evil-showcase-capcom/">Resident Evil Showcase</a></em></strong>, as another <strong><em>Resident Evil</em></strong> remake will be announced in the coming months, according to a known insider.</p>



<p>Addressing community speculation fueled by a social media post made by <strong>Eva La Dare</strong>, the voice actress of <strong>Sheva</strong>, protagonist of the fifth entry in the series together with <strong>Chris Redfield</strong>, who teased something for the series' <strong>30th anniversary</strong> this <strong>March</strong>, known series <strong><a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/2012597154825515449" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">insider Dusk Golem reported</a></strong> that <em>"there is NOT a Resident Evil 5 Remake that's going to be announced this year."</em></p>



<p><em>"Instead, later this year a RE Remake that starts with "(C)" &amp; ends "(ode Veronica)" is going to be announced, I promise you,"</em> the insider continued. While a remake of the survival horror game, which made its debut on the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">SEGA Dreamcast</strong> in early <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">2000</strong> has been<strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-zero-code-veronica-remakes/"> rumored to be in the works for a while</a></strong>, this is the first time we heard that it could be revealed ahead of the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Resident Evil Zero</em></strong> remake, which has also been rumored to be in the works for a while.</p>



<p>While we have to take what Dusk Golem revealed with a grain of salt, the insider has proven quite reliable with both older and more recent Resident Evil series rumors. Last year, the insider revealed that Leon would be the second Resident Evil Requiem protagonist, ahead of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-look-at-leon-s-kennedy-in-resident-evil-requiem-has-arrived-with-new-trailer/"><strong>confirmation during this year's <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">The Game Awards</em> show.</strong></a></p>



<p>Following the release of the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Resident Evil 4</em></strong> remake, which improved the original without revolutionizing the original formula which aged quite well, it will be exciting to see how <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">CAPCOM</strong> will modernize <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Resident Evil Code Veronica</em></strong> in its remake.</p>



<p>The original's formula is based into the series' roots, and has quite a few divisive narrative and gameplay choices, including the infamous <strong>Fire Extinguisher trap</strong> which may prevent players from obtaining a powerful weapon, sudden character swaps between <strong>Chris</strong> and <strong>Claire</strong>, excessive backtracing and some harsh difficulty spikes which would definitely need to be addressed to keep the series momentum going strong as it has in the past few years.</p>

<p>The delay won't affect <em>Tides of Tomorrow</em>'s playable demo, however, so it's unlikely that anything will be significantly changing in terms of direction between now and the new release date of April 22nd.</p><p>If you're not familiar with <em>Tides of Tomorrow</em>, it's the next game from Digixart, the studio responsible for road trip adventure <em>Road 96</em>, which our very own Will <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/road-96-review" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="24ceeade-3c31-41f5-9bd2-d997ce525392" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">wasn't too impressed with</a> when it launched back in 2021.</p><p>This time around, Digixart has opted for an adventure that takes place in a world devastated by an event known as the Great Flood.

While Sony plays whack-a-mole to get the new footage taken down, screenshots from it showing a March 5, 2026 release date have already spread across the internet.</p> <p><a href="https://streamable.com/ahh4d3">The new story trailer</a> includes a fresh sizzle reel of previously unseen gameplay showing off the sci-fi multiplayer shooter’s various maps, runners, and guns. There’s a healthy dose of the Bungie project’s exceptional art peppered throughout. But of most interest to casual players will be the nod to an early March launch date.</p>

  <p>Following its 2025 delay, the game only resurfaced with a vague March release window. This appears to confirm it’s coming at the early end of that range, giving Sony’s latest live-service game a few weeks to prove itself before the end of the fiscal year. According to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2026/01/19/yes-the-leaked-marathon-preorder-and-release-date-is-real/">Paul Tassi at <em>Forbes</em></a>, the new trailer and final release date are accurate, with Bungie planning the official announcement to go live this week.</p>

 <p>There’s been some speculation among fans that Bungie will hold at least one round of open beta player tests before the game launches. If that’s the case, it now seems like a good bet we can expect those before the end of February. If so, it’ll be the last chance for people to go hands-on with the overhauled shooter for free before it arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-release-date-price-battle-pass-proximity-chat-2000653472">behind a $40 price point</a>.</p>

 <p><strong>Update: 1/29/2025, 11:04 a.m. ET:</strong> Bungie has gone ahead and released <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/marathonthegame.bungie.net/post/3mcrz6dqutv25">the official trailer</a> and confirmed the game’s expansive voice cast:</p> <blockquote><p>Krizia Bajos, Samantha Béart, Beau Bridgland, Ry Chase, Roger Clark, Darin De Paul, Jennifer English, Dave Fennoy, Nika Futterman, Morla Gorrondona, Reina Guthrie, Donnla Hughes, Keston John, Sohm Kapila, Rich Keeble, Elliot Knight, Erica Lindbeck, Piotr Michael, Brent Mukai, Neil Newbon, Ariana Nicole George, Emily O’Brien, Lee Shorten, Jason Spisak, Ben Starr, JB Tadena, Fred Tatasciore, Craig Lee Thomas, Elias Toufexis, Oliver Vaquer, Scott Whyte, Tracy Wiles, Erin Yvette</p></blockquote> <p>Pre-order pages are also up early for the standard, Deluxe, and Collector’s Edition pages.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/best-open-world-rpg-games-releasing-2026/</link>
            <guid>1410049</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Playing a new RPG or open-world game in 2026 could prove to be a big time commitment, but it’s probably worth it, so who cares? 2026 is serving up even more long-form gaming through new role-playing titles and open-world sandboxes, but no one wants a time sink, which is why Insider Gaming has singled out the best in the genres announced so far.</p>



<p>There’s plenty of crossover with open-world games and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/insider-gaming-best-rpg-game-of-the-year-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RPG</a> games. Similarities include open (or at least semi) environments, quests, leveling up, exploration, and fighting. It’s a style of gameplay that doesn’t get old, especially for those special few who make everything feel new.</p>



<p>2026 is shaping up to be an epic year of gaming, and these prospective releases will help.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-open-world-amp-rpg-titles-coming-in-2026">Best Open-World &amp; RPG Titles Coming In 2026</h2>



<p>Everything on this list has been outed for 2026. It doesn’t mean all games will release in 2026, as that’s just how the media industry works. Delays are common, and one VERY anticipated game sticks out on this list like a sore thumb. Read the list as though every game is releasing, there are no issues, and you can carry on about your day like everything is perfect.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming will be the first to cover any video game delays if they happen.</p>



<h3 id="h-nioh-3">Nioh 3</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Team Ninja</figcaption></figure>



<p>While <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nioh-3-demo-progress-carry-over/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nioh 3</a> isn’t completely open-world, it retains its usual RPG elements from its level-up system to picking certain stats to upgrade, along with quests, bosses, and the usual slew of RPG requirements. Team Ninja has also made Nioh 3 the most open in the franchise’s history, meaning the game’s devilish difficulty will be accompanied by a new sense of freedom not yet seen. It’s great to see Nioh back, and let’s hope you don’t want to see the back of it for being so tough it hurts.</p>



<p><strong>Current release date: February 6.</strong></p>







<h3 id="h-monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>Monster Hunter Wilds was aptly one of the wildest stories of 2025. Capcom’s long-running series broke an outrageous amount of new ground and catapulted the MH name into the upper echelons of mainstream gaming. 2026 cranks things down slightly with the release of Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection. It brings back the less-heralded series, but with MH being as popular as ever, there might not be a better time to jump into a new Monster Hunter RPG.</p>



<p><strong>Current release date: March 13.</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-crimson-desert">Crimson Desert</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Pearl Abyss</figcaption></figure>



<p>Pearl Abyss is back with Crimson Desert. The open-world title is a spiritual successor to Black Desert Online and will have you running and riding across the pristine lands of Pywel. Unlike its predecessor, Crimson Desert is a single-player-driven experience, focusing on your adventure with Kliff&nbsp;and his allies. It wouldn’t be a shock to see Crimson Desert in RPG GOTY conversations come the end of 2026, hence IG’s recommendation.</p>



<p><strong>Current release date: March 19.</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image via TT Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>KA-POW. Stop the count, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</a> is winning it all! It’s probably not the case, but DC fans can dream as The Dark Knight readies himself for another dark night in the dank, dangerous streets of Gotham. LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight isn’t your conventional LEGO title, and it might be all the better for it. Resembling a Rocksteady Arkham game more than a LEGO clone, there’s promise for Legacy of the Dark Knight, and it doesn’t look like a Joker.</p>



<p><strong>Current release date: May 29.</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-fable">Fable</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Playground Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>A new Fable has grown beyond being just a fable; it should finally be a 2026 reality. Playground Games is a connoisseur of high-speed racing that looks to send you speeding across the horizon (pun fully intended), but the talented team has broadened its horizons (ok, might be overkill) by being tasked with a new Fable. It’s been 16 years since Fable 3, and the time for waiting needs to be over. It’s a central figure in the Xbox Developer Direct 2026, and a release this year should happen.</p>



<p><strong>Current release window: 2026</strong>.</p>



<h3 id="h-chrono-odyssey">Chrono Odyssey</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Chrono Studio</figcaption></figure>



<p>A “late-2026” release window is on the cards for Chrono Odyssey, so this one could be borderline. However, what is certain is that Chrono Odyssey looks otherworldly, and the MMORPG’s open world could be addicting, it’s <em>that </em>type of game. It’s been in beta, so it’s not like it’s a new entity suddenly dropping out of thin air, and Chrono Odyssey could explode overnight—unless you’re onto it now thanks to this list, eh?</p>



<p><strong>Current release window: 2026</strong>.</p>



<h3 id="h-diablo-iv-lord-of-hatred">Diablo IV: Lord of Hatred</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Blizzard</figcaption></figure>



<p>There’s a lot of hatred in Diablo 4, isn’t there? After 2024’s Vessel of Hatred comes <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/diablo-4-lord-of-hatred-coming-april-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lord of Hatred</a> in 2026. It was announced at The Game Awards 2025, and the fan-favorite Paladin class is making a heroic return. Diablo 4 players will have Mephisto locked into their sights when the ARPG’s new content drops in April. D4’s endgame is getting overhauled, and there will be plenty of new features to look forward to.</p>



<p><strong>Current release date: April 28, 2026</strong>.</p>



<h3 id="h-subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Unknown Worlds Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s safe to say that Subnautica 2 hasn’t been able to swim away from its controversy. The unbelievable hype has been washed away somewhat by the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/subnautica-2-delay-confirmed-krafton-says-it-wasnt-because-of-money/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Subnautica 2 delay</a>, followed by the ongoing lawsuit between <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/subnautica-2-developer-unknown-worlds-sues-former-leadership/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Subnautica 2 developer Unknown Worlds and former leadership</a>. On the other hand, Subnautica 2 looks to be an extension of everything that made the original so great, and remains the number one game on ‘the ‘Most Wishlisted Upcoming Steam Games.’ The lawsuit could affect its date, but 2026 is on the cards for now.</p>



<p><strong>Current release window: 2026</strong>.</p>



<h3 id="h-grand-theft-auto-6">Grand Theft Auto 6</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Remember the sentence earlier on saying: “One VERY anticipated game sticks out on this list like a sore thumb,” where delays were possible? Grand Theft Auto 6 will dominate all media in 2026. Movies, TV, Games; it doesn’t matter. The big caveat being IF it comes out in 2026. ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-gta-6-coming-out-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">When is GTA 6 coming out</a>?’ might be the most asked question on Earth. The November 5, 2025, Grand Theft Auto 6 delay announcement broke everyone’s hearts, and there have been suggestions that it could be pushed back to 2027. </p>



<p>You never know with Rockstar Games and GTA.</p>



<p><strong>Current release window: 2026 (Hopefully!)</strong>.</p>



<p>Whether you’ve got a missing game that should be on this list or you vehemently disagree with IG’s selections, the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a> is the perfect place for your guidance or grievances.</p>

<p>Heartopia has plenty to get stuck into as you explore an idyllic life in a new location, but the wording inside the game can be quite confusing, especially when it comes to the Resident’s Request Office.</p>



<p>Starting off in Heartopia results in an avalanche of information being thrown your way, which you will naturally want to get rid of as soon as possible so you can focus on playing, but that can result in you inadvertently skipping past some important details.</p>



<p>If you’re on the hunt for the Resident’s Request Office in Heartopia and have no idea where to look, Insider Gaming has got you covered with this guide.</p>







<h2 id="h-where-is-the-resident-s-request-office-in-heartopia">Where is The Resident’s Request Office in Heartopia?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Push the button. Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Resident’s Request Office in Heartopia is not a location you can actually visit in the game, which has caused a lot of confusion.</strong></p>



<p>Instead, the Resident’s Request Office is a menu you access in the game to track your progress, as it acts as a hub for both Daily and Weekly Requests. </p>



<p>To access the Resident’s Request office, <strong>click on the calendar-like icon on the top-left of the screen, </strong>which is located next to the map.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-use-the-resident-s-request-office-in-heartopia">How to Use The Resident’s Request Office in Heartopia</h2>



<p><strong>The Resident’s Request Office in Heartopia is extremely handy for keeping track of mini objectives in the game, which can earn you neat rewards.</strong></p>



<p>Each day, a fresh batch of requests will be made available, and more requests are available every week. Completing them provides a range of rewards, including Gold, Wishing Stars, and Contribution Medals.</p>



<p>Contribution Medals are the most important of these rewards, as they tally together to increase your D.G. Member Level, unlocking additional features like additional Hobbies, extra plots by your house, and more.</p>

            <p>2025's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dynasty-warriors-origins-review-top-notch-hack-and-slash-stumbles-off-the-battlefield">Dynasty Warriors: Origins</a>, which has just celebrated its first anniversary, was <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/dynasty-warriors-origins/">generally considered a big success</a> and a much-needed evolution of the long-running hack-and-slash series. Later this week, the <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/dynasty-warriors-origins-visions-of-four-heroes-official-reveal-trailer-state-of-play">Visions of Four Heroes DLC</a> and its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yL69vFOt_lM">Nintendo Switch 2 port</a> are launching, and a recent interview with producer Tomohiko Sho has teased what might be coming next.</p>
<p>We've known for some time <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dynasty-warriors-origins">Dynasty Warriors: Origins</a> sold quite well, with Koei Tecmo itself <a href="https://www.koeitecmoeurope.com/news/koei-tecmos-dynasty-warriors-origins-sells-over-1-million-units-worldwide/">confirming on February 2025</a> the game had crossed 1m sales during its first month on sale. On top of the aforementioned DLC and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> port, the general assumption (though <a href="https://twistedvoxel.com/dynasty-warriors-origins-developers-eye-more-crossovers-hint-at-possible-sequel/">it hasn't been confirmed</a>) is that developer Omega Force is already looking at developing a sequel. Now, Sho has revealed during <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202601/63110">an interview with Famitsu</a> (with the relevant excerpt <a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/news/19385-dynasty-warriors-origins-continuation-may-be-expanded-from-duology-to-trilogy">translated by RPG Site</a>) that a single follow-up might not be big enough to tell the whole story the devs want to tell.</p>
<p>The producer has been sitting on those thoughts for a while, it seems: "I thought of making a duology where we would depict up until the Battle of Wuzhang Plains. But as we ended the development, the game depicted up until the Battle of Chi Bi with much more density than we guessed… In that case, if we maintain this density in the sequel, it would be impossible to depict up until the Battle of Wuzhang Plains (strained laugh). That’s why in the middle of the development, I ended up thinking that we would have to make it into a trilogy."</p>
<p>Traditionally, Dynasty Warriors games have covered (repeatedly) a very large portion of the Chinese Three Kingdoms period, starting with the Yellow Turban Rebellion in the 180s and taking players to the Battle of Wuzhang Plains in 234 AD. More recent games took us a bit further in order to also tell the Fall of Shu Kingdom in 264 AD. It all involves heroes (as well as villains) sending hordes of soldiers flying with all sorts of weapons, but at its core, it's a massive historical drama.</p><p>With Origins, the main pitch from a narrative perspective was to spend more time with each part of the larger story. The game goes up to the Battle of Chi Bi / Red Cliffs in 208 AD. The expectation was to have the rest of the period covered in just one sequel, but looking at the density of the content and intertwined story arcs, we're inclined to support Sho's tentative decision to go bigger and longer. Two more entries instead of one would also allow Omega Force to better iterate on the many changes to Dynasty Warriors' traditional combat system and the RPG layer that added much-welcome depth.</p>
<p>"I kindly want you to buy this DLC, and I want even more people to play the base game," the producer added, suggesting a final decision hasn't been made and encouraging fans to vote with their wallets.</p>

<p>You might recall that Nintendo revealed the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/here-are-japans-best-selling-switch-and-switch-2-eshop-games-for-2025">most-downloaded eShop titles</a> in the region at the end of last year, but Famitsu's list accounts for the industry at large, giving PlayStation and Xbox titles a chance to get in on the fun.</p>
<p>That said, only one non-Switch release was able to make the 2025 top 10, with <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/monster_hunter_wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> breaking in at fourth with some PS5 representation.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067nglyto&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>As you might expect, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> led the proceedings, with over 2.5 million sales in the region since the Switch 2 launched in June. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> was a big enough hitter on Switch 1 and 2 that it occupied the remaining spots on the podium, and other Switch 2 exclusives like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> snagged a spot too.</p>
<p>Oh yes, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> is still outselling <em>most</em> new games in Japan, too. Because of course it is.</p>
<p>Here's Famitsu's full list of the best-selling games in Japan in 2025:</p>

<p>As you might expect from those numbers, the Switch and Switch 2 also nabbed the top two spots in Famitsu's total hardware sales for 2025. The new system came out on top, naturally, with almost 3.8 million units to its name since launch (over half of <em>all</em> home consoles sold in the region last year), but the Switch 1 clung onto second while the PS5 sat in third.</p>
<p>Here's Famitsu's list of the best-selling consoles of 2025 in Japan — note, the 'Switch' entry includes sales for the Lite and OLED models, 'PS5' comprises base, Digital and Pro editions, 'Xbox Series X|S' also accounts for the Series X Digital Edition, and 'PS4' adds in any Pro sales:</p>

<p>All of this means that Japan's game market is in a pretty healthy position thanks to the last 12 months. Famitsu estimates that the market has grown by 38.8% in the last year, with hardware spending at 282.69 billion yen (up 49.3%) and software spending at 135.44 billion yen (up 21%).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Back in October 2025, shortly after <strong>Ubisoft</strong> unveiled its subsidiary, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tencent-new-subsidiary-far-cry-rainbow-six-assassins-creed-vantage-studios/">Vantage Studios</a></strong>, a new branch formed in partnership with <strong>Tencent</strong> to house the <strong>Assassin's Creed, Rainbow Six</strong>, and <strong>Far Cry </strong>franchises, head of the Assassin's Creed series, <strong>Marc-Alexis Côté, </strong>was <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-franchise-lead-leaves-ubisoft-following-tencent-subsidiary-reveal-vantage-studios/">confirmed to be leaving the company by Ubisoft</a>. While Ubisoft initially framed Côté's departure as his choice, saying that he declined a role within Vantage Studios and that he had "<em></em><em>chosen to pursue a new path elsewhere outside of Ubisoft</em>," three days later, <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-assassins-creed-series-boss-didnt-choose-to-leave-ubisoft-asked-me-to-step-aside/">Côté published his own statement</a>, saying he didn't choose to leave, but that instead "<em></em><em><strong>Ubisoft asked me to step aside</strong></em>."</p>



<p>While Côté claimed that he held "<em>no resentment</em>" at the time, that statement appears to be in question after <a href="https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/2221328/marc-alexis-cote-ubisoft-assassins-creed">Radio-Canada</a> reported that Côté is now <strong>suing Ubisoft for $1.3 million,</strong> accusing Ubisoft of "<em>constructive dismissal</em>" to avoid paying him severance.</p>



<p>Côté had been with Ubisoft for two decades, with the majority of that time spent working on the Assassin's Creed franchise, and the final three years of his tenure as the head of the entire series. The suit alleges that in the summer of 2025, a meeting was held to discuss a new "<em>head of franchise</em>" role within Vantage Studios, which Côté noticed would swallow up most of the responsibilities he had in his current position.</p>



<p>Côté was instead offered a "<em>head of production</em>" role within Vantage Studios, which would fall under the newly created "<em>head of franchise</em>" role, and see Côté lose most of his influence over the Assassin's Creed series and the responsibility to lead partnerships with external studios like <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-assassins-creed-netflix-adaptation-finds-director-johan-renck/"><strong>Netflix</strong>, which is currently working on a new Assassin's Creed TV show.</a> According to the report, in Côté's current position, he directly reported to no one save for Ubisoft's long-time boss and chief executive officer, <strong>Yves Guillemot</strong>.</p>



<p>After declining the head of production role, Côté was then reportedly offered a "<em>creative house</em>" lead, which would allow him to oversee "<em>second-tier</em>" Ubisoft series. With Côté seeing himself as the "<em>guardian of the Assassin's Creed</em>" series after having been with it for so long and having spent three years at its helm, he considered the positions offered a demotion, the kind he could not accept. As he was "<em>disoriented, confused and affected by the anxiety-provoking situation</em>," according to the suit, Côté took two weeks off to reflect on how to move forward.</p>



<p>He was reportedly told that he would have to make a decision at the end of his two weeks as to whether he would accept the role offered. At the end of the two weeks, Côté determined the role was an "<em>unacceptable demotion</em>," and asked to be paid severance. Ubisoft reportedly responded by telling Côté not to come to work on October 13, and the next day, on October 14, an internal email was sent to staff outlining that Côté had "<em>chosen to pursue a new path elsewhere outside of Ubisoft</em>," the same email that broke to the press that day. </p>



<p>The lawsuit alleges that Ubisoft has listed Côté's departure as a "<em>voluntary</em> <em>departure</em>" in order to avoid paying him severance. Côté is suing for two years' salary and <strong>$75,000</strong> in moral damages, which the suit is calling "<em>an abuse of power and harm to his reputation</em>." The salary, along with the additional $75K is what brings the total to <strong>$1.3 million<em>.</em></strong> Additionally, Côté is asking that the court lift his non-compete clause, so he can find a new role elsewhere in the video game industry.</p>



<p>Wccftech has reached out to Ubisoft for a comment on the situation, and we'll update this report if/when we hear back. Côté and his lawyer, Catherine Asselin Jobin, from Poudrier Bradet Avocats, have reportedly declined to make a statement on the matter, save for his lawyer saying, "<em>Mr. Côté</em> <em>hopes for a negotiated, swift, and satisfactory resolution to the situation</em>."</p>



<p>Though we currently only have Côté's side of the story in this matter, and we've yet to see how Ubisoft will claim the situation shook out, this is the second instance of the year already where dismissals at Ubisoft are under suspicion. At the beginning of the year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-shuts-down-ubisoft-halifax-claims-decision-had-nothing-to-do-with-studio-unionizing/"><strong>Ubisoft shuttered its Halifax studio, laying off</strong> <strong>71 people</strong></a> a little less than three weeks after the majority of the branch <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-halifax-vote-in-favour-of-wall-to-wall-union-under-cwa-canada/">voted to unionize under the CWA Canada</a></strong>.</p>



<p>While Ubisoft claims the studio shutdown had nothing to do with the team unionizing, and claims the decision was made well before organizational efforts at the studio began, CWA Canada has pushed back on that narrative and has filed a complaint with Nova Scotia's labour board, seeking clear evidence from Ubisoft to prove its claims. When the two sides last met, CWA Canada claimed Ubisoft had brought none of the requested evidence.</p>



<p>Public and legal pressure from the CWA Canada has already caused Ubisoft to consider raising the severance it plans to give the 71 fired workers, and CWA Canada continues to apply pressure to the company after it discovered that Ubisoft had been <a href="https://wccftech.com/cwa-canada-files-complaint-ubisoft-halifax-closure-ubisoft-1-billion-tax-subsidies/">given <strong>nearly $1 billion</strong> in tax subsidies over the last five years for operating in Halifax</a>.</p>



<p>It's also worth noting that Marc-Alexis Côté is the second lead of a franchise at Ubisoft to leave the company since the reveal and establishment of Vantage Studios, with The Division lead<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tells-the-division-players-dont-worry-series-producer-julian-gerighty-leaves-for-battlefield/">, <strong>Julian Gerighty</strong>, announcing his departure just last week</a>. Rumours circulated in October 2025 of his departure, which <strong>Massive Entertainment</strong> denied at the time, though with Gerighty set to join <strong>Battlefield Studios</strong>, his departure doesn't appear to have the same issues that Côté alleges he had.</p>

Suffice it to say that <em>RuneScape </em>at the end of 2026 should look a lot different to how it looks today.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>RuneScape</em>'s 25th anniversary is shaping up to be special.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In April, player character avatars will be completely updated, with features like models, animations, and hairstyles getting an overhaul. More updates will be introduced "based on community feedback" as well.</p><p>You'll gain more control over your house this year, too, allowing you to build a space that "feels personal, welcoming, and worth visiting", according to Jagex. The Construction skill will increase to 120, and you'll get a new recipe system that lets you unlock and build new furniture.</p><p>It's not all tweaks to existing systems and features, though. <em>RuneScape </em>is also getting "the largest area expansion" in its history in the form of Havenhythe, which will be arriving "in multiple parts throughout the year".</p><p>Havenhythe is a "progressively vampiric" area that brings new quests, new early-game bosses, and a new level cap for your Hunter skill, with new story and boss content also arriving later in the year.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Gamers love AI in game dev — they just don’t know it yet, says Razer’s CEO]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/podcast/863361/razer-ceo-min-liang-tan-ces-2026-ai-gaming-project-ava-interview</link>
            <guid>1410022</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>We’re back to start the year off with a very special live interview with Razer CEO Min-Liang Tan, which we taped in front of a terrific audience at Brooklyn Bowl in Las Vegas during CES.</p><p>Razer is obviously best known for making mice, keyboards, and gaming PCs in its signature black and bright green, with a smattering of RGB LEDs to set everything off. But the company always makes splashy announcements at CES, and this year was no different — and along with the hype, there was plenty of controversy.</p><p>This year, Razer earned those splashy headlines and more than a little controversy for something it calls Project Ava, an AI companion that has a physical presence in the real world as an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/854705/razer-ai-anime-waifu-hologram-desk">anime hologram that sits in a jar on your desk</a>. Ava is powered by, you guessed it, Elon Musk’s Grok.</p><div><p><em>Verge</em> subscribers, don’t forget you get exclusive access to ad-free <em>Decoder</em> wherever you get your podcasts. Head <a href="https://www.theverge.com/account/podcasts">here</a>. Not a subscriber? You can <a href="https://www.theverge.com/subscribe">sign up here</a>.</p></div><p>There are a lot of choices bundled up in all of that, and Razer can’t really fall back on the “it’s just a prototype” defense. It’s taking $20 “reservations” and entirely expects to ship this thing, potentially even this year. So I spent a good chunk of time in this interview asking Min some very obvious questions, to which I’m not sure I got very satisfying answers.</p><p>I really wanted to know if Min and Razer had really thought through the implications of building AI companions, after a string of stories detailing the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/06/technology/chatgpt-lawsuit-suicides-delusions.html">mental health issues</a> chatbots have caused for so many people. And of course, I wanted to know why Min and Razer had chosen Grok, which is facing outrage around the world for allowing users to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/855832/grok-undressing-children-csam-law-x-elon-musk">create deepfaked pornographic images of real women and children</a>.</p><p>Min says they chose Grok for its conversational capabilities. But he was also not very convinced by the notion that products like this always end up being turned into creepy sexual objects, despite an entire year of headlines about AI psychosis and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/11/05/magazine/ai-chatbot-marriage-love-romance-sex.html">people turning chatbots into romantic partners</a>.</p><p>That exchange really set the tone for the rest of my conversation with Min, which focused on why exactly he’s pushing Razer so hard into AI when it does not seem at all clear that the core gamer demographic wants any of this. The gaming community at large has been absolutely rocked by the AI art debate that’s ripped through the broader industry in the past 12 months, with concerns over labor, copyright, and even just experimental AI use in game development putting some of the industry’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/859551/baldurs-gate-3-larian-studios-gen-ai-concept-art-reddit-ama">most beloved studios into full-blown crisis mode</a>.</p><p>Gamers themselves are fairly hostile toward AI, which you can see in the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DTJmdYkieb6/">comments on Razer’s own CES AI posts</a>. So I asked Min about that, and how he would know if he had made the right bet here in the face of all this pushback.</p><p>As you can tell, there was a lot of back and forth here, and this was a really good conversation. Min and I really dug into some of the biggest issues in tech and gaming, themes that are going to be central throughout 2026. It’s also great to do these kinds of episodes live in front of an audience. I think it’s going to give you a lot to think about.</p><p>Okay: Razer CEO Min-Liang Tan. Here we go.</p><p><em>This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.</em></p><p><strong>Hello, welcome to </strong><strong><em>Decoder</em></strong><strong>. I’m Nilay Patel, editor-in-chief of The Verge, and Decoder is my show about big ideas and other problems. Today, I’m talking with Razer CEO Min-Liang Tan. Welcome, Min.</strong></p><p>Thank you for having me.</p><p><strong>Nailed it. Thank you to our audience. We are live at Brooklyn Bowl at CES. I’m very excited to be doing this in front of a live audience. You’re going to hear them throughout the show because Min has no shortage of extremely controversial things to say.</strong></p><p>We’ll see, we’ll see.</p><p><strong>I was promised “extremely controversial.”</strong></p><p>Oh, is that right?</p><p><strong>I mean, that’s what they told me. Let’s get into it. You’ve made a bunch of announcements here at CES. You’ve obviously been with Razer for a long time. You founded Razer, and you’re over 20 years into the job. The gaming industry is undergoing a lot of turmoil lately because of AI. You’re making huge investments in AI. There’s a hologram waifu we should talk about that you’ve introduced throughout the show.</strong></p><p><strong>I actually wanna start with something very basic. I’ve been covering CES for about 20 years as well. Razer loves CES. You love CES.</strong><strong><br></strong></p><p>We love it.</p><p><strong>Every year, there is a huge suite of Razer products announced. There are weird projects and concepts. Why are you so invested in CES? Of all the companies, I think Razer has the most consistent enthusiasm for this show in particular.</strong></p><p>It’s odd, and we were just talking about it yesterday. It’s over 20 years at this point in time, and I think we’ve been at CES maybe 15 years or so. And from the very early days at Razer, I remember <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337944/we-are-experiencing-digital-experiences">Pepcom</a>, a massive hall with a little table there, talking about gaming products. Back then, I think we were probably one of the few, if not the only, gaming equipment providers.</p><p>It’s really grown for us. I think what has happened is we have a huge online community, people are very passionate about things that we come up with, what’s the latest and greatest, and we’ve really grown this community, and we have all been kind of invested in what we’re gonna be launching at CES. So it kind of started a couple of years ago when we said, “Okay, why don’t we not just bring the stuff that we’re gonna launch, but some of the things that we’ve got cooking in the Razer labs and stuff.”</p><p>We brought it to CES, it has been a hit, and we said every year, “Why don’t we bring more of our concept products? Some of which will come to market, some of which do not, and let’s see what the community thinks.” So we’re a company that is for gamers, by gamers. We really like to hear what the community would like to say about our product, and it gives us an opportunity to present the stuff that we’ve got, get the feedback, and then we go back and polish it a little bit.</p><p><strong>Well, I’m curious. I mean, this is kind of a meta question about how this show in particular has changed so much over the years. The idea of even having a big tech trade show has gone in and out of favor. If you look at where a lot of the action is this week in Vegas, it’s actually in the Aria and Vdara, where the ad tech people are doing whatever weird stuff they’re doing. I don’t even know what’s going on over there, man. It’s goofy. </strong></p><p><strong>This is about getting attention, right? I mean, you launch things at trade shows because the press and creators are here, and you can get a lot of attention. Razer doesn’t need help getting attention. Why still do it here?</strong></p><p>Well, it’s an opportunity, I think, for us also to catch up with our partners, friends, and show a little bit of what we have been working on under the hood. But it’s been a tradition of sorts. I think the community expects us to be here. I’d love to see more of these in-person events right now, especially post-pandemic, and what has happened.</p><p>From a gaming perspective, we’ve also lost a couple of big events in the year. So it’s a great way to kind of kick it off. It’s a little early in the year for us, though. We wish it would be maybe mid-January or something like that. But it’s a bit of a tradition for us. I hope it continues, I hope it gets bigger along the way, and it’s massive right now. But it’s good fun.</p><p><strong>Do you think you’re still getting the same amount of attention from this kind of thing as you would if you just had your own events?</strong></p><p>Well, we have our own events, pretty much, but it’s a good opportunity just to catch up with partners. I think that’s been a real opportunity for us. And it’s also a good opportunity for us to kind of bring the rest of our audience along, from the gaming community, who may not necessarily be keen so much on all tech, but they really wanna see what’s the latest and greatest in gaming tech. And that’s what we do.</p><div><p><strong>So let me ask you about the announcements here. There’s an </strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/854756/razer-concept-ai-wearable-headphones-project-motoko"><strong>AI headset called Project Motoko</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p></div><p>Yes.</p><div><p><strong>You’ve got </strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/855038/razer-forge-workstation-ai-dev-hardware"><strong>AI PCs for software developers</strong></a><strong>, which is really interesting. I wanna talk to you about that. And then there’s </strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/854705/razer-ai-anime-waifu-hologram-desk"><strong>Project Ava, which is a spinning hologram</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p></div><p>Yes. We’ve got Madison also, which is a project that we’ve brought across, which showcases the latest and greatest in immersion technology. We’ve <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/854601/razer-concept-gaming-chair-speakers-rgb-lights-rumble">put it into a gaming chair</a>, so that’s a setup for games.</p><p><strong>I can’t believe I forgot the chair. The most important.</strong></p><p>Yeah, the chair, it’s getting a lot of traction. And a whole lot more, and not just hardware, but software.</p><p><strong>So how do you decide what is going to be a real product you’re gonna ship? The AI PCs, I think, are real products you’re definitely gonna ship. That’s just happening. And then here’s the concept, just to get attention and feedback. How do you make that kind of choice?</strong></p><p>Actually, we’ve got a labs team internally, which charts and pretty much looks at things far out, in terms of the industry, where we think the industry’s going, and how we can build toward that. In essence, the decision to green-light a project to an actual product is really like, “Is this cool? Do we think it’s gonna do well?” We kind of started with that, with the gaming mouse, right?</p><p>We very rarely sit down with the finance people and say, “Oh, do we do projections and things like that?” It’s really more of a “by the seat of our pants” kind of thing. It’s cool, we like it, it’s gonna be fun, we want it for ourselves. I think the real kind of trigger there is, do we want it for ourselves? And if we really want it for ourselves, and we think it’s cool, we’ll bring it to market.</p><p><strong>Every year, there’s always some project; some of them come out, some of them don’t come out. One year, you </strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/13/24343016/more-than-1-million-in-refunds-are-going-out-to-people-who-bought-razers-zephyr-face-masks"><strong>announced a respirator that got you into a lot of trouble, and you had to recall the product</strong></a><strong>. How do you make the call of, “Okay, this project, it’s out, it’s successful, it’s doing what we want it to do, we’re gonna keep investing,” versus “this was a one-off.” What’s the metric of success there?</strong></p><p>Well, scaling it. I think scaling it is definitely something that we would like to do. And sometimes we’re really early. For example, I think over a decade ago we built a complete gaming PC in a handheld. For that matter, we brought it to market at the same time. Today, we’ve seen handhelds out there, and we haven’t launched our handheld, for example, at this point.</p><p><strong>Do you have one?</strong></p><p>We might. We will see. But not today.</p><p><strong>So you got claps for that already.</strong></p><p>I think for us, when we launch a product, we look at the attraction for it. You know, is this something that we want? Do we wanna invest in the next generation? Do we wanna kind of provide a roadmap across to it? So we essentially work very closely with the community.</p><p>We keep talking about “for gamers, by gamers,” but we really believe in that. We’ve got a really big fan base that’s very passionate. Everyone’s got an opinion. We love hearing opinions. We’ve got social media, we chat with them often, so on and so forth. That’s what really guides us, and we really let the community guide what we build for the future.</p><p><strong>All right, so now I have to ask you about Project Ava.</strong></p><p>Sure.</p><p><strong>Did you say to your team, “I want a holographic anime waifu on my desk”? You say that the metric is “what we want.” Who was like, “I want this”?</strong></p><p>Sure. So actually, yeah, somewhat. Well, not so much in the specific words, “I want an anime waifu,” and things like that. But we did hack together a holographic projector to have a character there. We had ideas like that in the past, where we’ve created holographic projectors for game companies. But back in the day, to say, “Hey, look, is there a way that we can do a holographic representation of some of your latest characters?” and stuff like that.</p><p>With AI, we were now able to get that personality there and have conversational AI coming through. I think the tipping point for us was really not just making great hardware, and not just having great software, but also, now with great intelligence, I think, coming out together with it. And it’s that premise of being able to have a semi-physical representation of an avatar, to me being able to chat, as opposed to clicking a button or typing on something, and having a little thing over there.</p><p>It’s really exciting in our imaginations for ourselves, you know? It’s cool. We’ve always had that, whether it’s a game like a super AI in <em>Halo</em>, like Cortana, for example. So it’s a little bit of sci-fi, us growing up always wanting something cool like that, and so we said, “Hey, it’s a great concept,” and I think the community loves it.</p><p><strong>Are you aware of the very common trope about actually building superintelligence from sci-fi movies? The one that’s “you should not build the </strong><a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/torment-nexus"><strong>Torment Nexus</strong></a><strong>?”</strong></p><p>Well, for us, I think in this case it’s more… Well, I’m familiar with that, of course.</p><p><strong>[Laughs] Just checking.</strong></p><p>Yeah, yeah. But, I mean, with the guardrails… That is also, I think, on a broader level, from an AI discussion and things like that, trust and safety is one of the things that we do look at internally at the company. But specifically for Ava, it was just cool. It was just awesome to be able to have a product like that, and hopefully we will.</p><p><strong>So is Ava going to come out? Because I think that my understanding, or my reaction to this product, changes based on whether it’s actually coming out or if this is just a concept that people can react to. But you’re taking pre-orders for it. It’s like 20 bucks to pre-order it.</strong></p><p>Yes, we’re taking reservations for it at this point in time.</p><p><strong>It seems like it’s going to come out.</strong></p><p>We plan to put it out, but we do want to get as much feedback, to hear what the concerns are, right? Are there things that we can do better? What’s cool? What are the characters that we would like to get on? We’d also like to get the feedback from many of the game partners, at the same time, to do really specific character models, so on and so forth. And then finally, I think on the trust and safety part, we also wanna make sure that we take that into consideration. Are there things that we need to know? We’re working with our model partners at the same time.</p><p><strong>So the model partner with Ava is Grok.</strong></p><p>Yes.</p><p><strong>I would say that there’s a pretty significant disconnect between saying you care about trust and safety and partnering with Grok, which is in the </strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/859715/x-grok-ai-deepfakes"><strong>middle of a deepfake porn scandal</strong></a><strong>. As we speak, as we’re sitting here, Grok is undressing people left and right. I’m confident that we will be undressed by the end of this podcast.</strong></p><p>But Grok has the best–</p><p><strong>Can you care about trust and safety, and also partner with Grok?</strong></p><p>Well, I think for Grok, you know… We picked Grok also because it’s got the best conversational AI at this point, for us. At least from a conversation, personality side of things, and that’s one of the things that we looked at from a tech perspective. Now, ultimately, however, we do see Ava as an open platform, right? If somebody wants to be able to use a different model, it’s one of the things that we’re taking into consideration. And we are multi-model, right? But I think from a perspective of an avatar, from a conversational AI for CES, we feel that Grok has a really great conversational AI model at this point. So that’s one of the reasons why we picked Grok.</p><p><strong>Grok, also made by Elon Musk, who has his own anime waifu ideas, I would say. There’s something there that is, you know, not necessarily just trust and safety. The idea that you would have a pet on your desk that looks like a person, that can talk to you, that’s a big door to open for a lot of people. Are you worried about that at all?</strong></p><p>Well, the doors have been open since Tamagotchi.</p><p><strong>I think there’s a pretty big step difference between… Like my daughter has a Tamagotchi. I’m never worried that this thing is alive.</strong></p><p>Right.</p><p>Sure. But from a virtual perspective, and as a gamer, we’ve interacted with NPCs and stuff like that. And of course, NPCs are getting smarter with AI, and I do hope they get smarter. It gets more engaging. And I think we’re still in the early days. Now, the question, I think, where it’s going to lead to is something that we need to discover, right? And, of course, we need to discover it in a responsible manner to figure out how we do that, and put the right guardrails in. What do we do in terms of AI, in terms of this? That’s something that we’re learning.</p><p>So building great hardware, I think, is part of it. Grok is powering this for us at this point in time, and this is something that we feel, from a conversational perspective, they do an incredible job at. Now, over and above what else can we do to ensure that, ultimately, when we do launch the product, how do we make sure that it’s going to do the right things and be able to converse and be the great companion that we want it to be?</p><p><strong>This is very much what I mean by saying I react to it differently when it’s just a concept, and it opens the door to these conversations, versus you are going to sell this thing to people. And I think when you sell it to people, the responsibility skyrockets. We’ve all looked at what’s happened with OpenAI models over the last year or so. People have fallen in love with them. Famously, Bing proposed to journalist Kevin Roose </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/16/technology/bing-chatbot-microsoft-chatgpt.html"><strong>on the front page of </strong><strong><em>The New York Times</em></strong></a><strong>. People are having relationships with these products. They are being driven to </strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/858102/characterai-google-teen-suicide-settlement"><strong>very negative outcomes</strong></a><strong>. </strong></p><p><strong>Do you think that you have to do something else to make sure that doesn’t happen with Ava, who will be represented in human-like form on your desk? Like the opportunity to have a relationship is gonna change, right? And from what I have been told, from our reporters, Razer people are saying, “We don’t want this to be a companion in that way.” OpenAI said that about ChatGPT, and yet, here we are. So what have you learned from that already?</strong></p><p>So we work closely with the model providers. I think this is something that we work closely on with them, with respect to that. We do talk to them often about what the plans are for the future, with respect to this. But I think what is clear is that these are still early days, right? It is still new for us to discover. I’m sure that there will be concerns or issues that will come about, and evolving what’s happening for technology is something that we do.</p><p>Now, maybe it’s even a hardware lock that we need to put in. We don’t know, right? Or it’s more software guardrails that we have to put into place at this point in time. That’s one of the reasons why we decided to put it as a concept first out there, to get the feedback. And we’re not gonna be able to think of everything, but we would like to be able to get as much thought, concern, and care into the product before we actually launch it, which is why we’ve also intentionally, in a very intentional and deliberate manner, said, “We don’t know when we’re gonna launch this.” We really do not.</p><p>I would suspect, for us, it will be a phased approach to a certain extent, with dev kits out there first to be able to discover more. Someone’s gonna be able to do more with it, perhaps, to load up different models and to have it say things that we may not necessarily want it to say, and we’ll find out. And then, accordingly, we’ll just grow the product.</p><p><strong>I understand all this, but you’re taking the money, right? You’re taking the pre-orders. Why take pre-orders if you don’t think you’re ready?</strong></p><p>So what we have actually said is that these are reservations. They’re not pre-orders, per se. So, ultimately, when we do launch the product, and it could be a long way out, by then, because of the specs… We have not disclosed the actual specs of the product, and even, for example, which character models, or even which model it’s gonna be running at this point in time. We’re leaving that absolutely open.</p><p>And of course, at the end of the day, if somebody says, “Look, this isn’t the product that I thought it was going to be,” that’s fine. Cancel the reservation, and we’ll remain open and see how the product evolves at that point in time.</p><p><strong>Are you ready for a customer, a few years from now, falling in love with their hologram on your desk that you have provided?</strong></p><p>I don’t think that’s how we would want to design the product.</p><p><strong>It’s going to happen.</strong></p><p>We don’t know.</p><p><strong>That’s what happens with all these tools.</strong></p><p>I suppose we literally do not know, right? I use the example when I play a game, and I’m really invested in the game, I really enjoy it, and I feel a sense of loss... Well, I wouldn’t call it unhappiness, but loss when I finish a game. But it’s a great game. I’m fully invested in a movie, I’m fully invested in a game. Is that how we see it? Perhaps, right?</p><p>We want to create products that people care about, whether that’s a gaming mouse, a laptop, or whatever software platforms. We want people to care about it. I don’t necessarily think that we want somebody to fall in love with one of our products and marry them. It might happen. Who knows? It could.</p><div><p><strong>There are other CEOs who come on this show, they’re like, “You should marry my AI,” and </strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24216748/replika-ceo-eugenia-kuyda-ai-companion-chatbots-dating-friendship-decoder-podcast-interview"><strong>straightforwardly say these things to me</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p></div><p>Really?</p><p><strong>All the time.</strong></p><p>Okay.</p><p><strong>The reality is, some people are having their romantic lives rocked because a cloud service got deprecated, and then you’re gonna have to deal with that. I’m just saying, these are the questions that are coming for you once you put a character that people can have an emotional relationship with.</strong></p><p>Well, I would say that potentially that could happen, but that’s definitely not something we plan to build the product toward. I mean, we have, for example, people really passionate about Razer products, right? Some of them have come to me, and they have said, “Look, I’m so passionate about this product, it’s part of my life. I’m gonna tattoo the product on myself,” and things like that. We didn’t plan to do that.</p><p>But we did, however, plan to make the best possible product. We put incredible amounts of care and concern, I think, in terms of design. And that’s what we plan to do with Ava at the same time, or Motoko, or Madison, or any of the products that we bring to the market.</p><p><strong>One more question on this, and then I’m gonna ask you the </strong><strong><em>Decoder</em></strong><strong> questions and talk about the rest of your AI investment, which is pretty substantial. You said you’re working with the model partners, and that is how you’re thinking about trust and safety. Is xAI a good partner when it comes to trust and safety, as it relates to Grok? Because I’m looking at the product you’re shipping today, and I would say, “No.”</strong></p><p>Sure. So I think, and I speak broadly, I think, for all of the partners that we’ve got. I think for the vast majority of all the models out there, I think there’s, of course, a lot of focus in terms of intelligence, really trying to get to that point, but trust and safety really is one of the things that pretty much all our partners really do care about. And that’s one of the reasons why… Each model, I think, excels in different ways at the same time. And I think for us, we really wanna find the best possible model. And ultimately, in what shape or form we ship at the end of the day, that’s one of the things that we will take into consideration.</p><p><strong>Is xAI a good partner when it comes to trust and safety?</strong></p><p>Specifically, I don’t really like to comment on that at this point in time because I don’t have enough information, I think, right now. I really don’t. My focus to date has been more in terms of what’s the best conversational model that we’ve got, and they’re great, they’re fantastic.</p><p><strong>Again, I suspect we’ll be undressed within the next 45 minutes. They’ve got one idea, and they’re good at it.</strong></p><p><strong>Let me ask you the Decoder questions. If you’ve got a trick, you gotta play the hits, you know? Let me ask the Decoder questions ‘cause I think that’s gonna lead into some of the big investments you’re making, and the change that’s coming to Razer as a company over the next few years. You’re really invested in design. You’re a product designer, that’s some of your background. How is Razer structured in a way that lets you stay focused on design?</strong></p><p>So I focus on product at the company. We’ve got a really pretty flat structure at Razer. I’ve got about 40, 50 direct reports. We really work as a team. And the entire company is really focused, I think, in terms of product first. You know, that has always been the mantra for the organization, but we’ve got a really great team, very talented team members. And everyone has worked together for a while. We’ve got team members who have been there for the last 20 years together with us, growing alongside us.</p><p>I would say that the guiding north star for us is just about the gamers. We’ve been consistent in that respect, despite the fact that in the very early days, gaming or gamers were not considered a big industry or demographic. But we’ve been laser-focused in terms of that as we’ve grown. Even with the industry growing at this point in time, the opportunities for us to go like, “Hey, why don’t you do productivity at the same time? Why don’t we go into this other area?” And stuff like that. We’ve just said, “Look, we know what we’re good at.” We remain focused on it. We align the team members all the time, and that’s how we are structured.</p><p><strong>How many people are at Razer?</strong></p><p>About 2000.</p><p><strong>When I say structure, I mean literally organized. Does everybody report to you? Where do all those 2000 people go?</strong></p><p>No. In the traditional structure, we’ve got our operations and supply chain. We’ve got legal, so on and so forth. But we’ve got a pretty flat, I think, management team structure, and we don’t have multiple layers from that perspective. And we consistently keep a very single-minded focus to say that, “Look, the product’s always the most important. The customer, in our case, the gamer, is always the most important for us.” And pretty much we ask ourselves the question, right? If there’s no direction or management mandate when it comes down to this, just figure it out. Like, what would the customer want, what would the gamer want? That’s what we do.</p><p><strong>You’re primarily based in Singapore. I know you come back and forth a lot. Where is most of the company based?</strong></p><p>Well, we’re everywhere. A third of our business is in the US, a third in Europe, and a third in Asia at this point in time. So we’ve got team members spread out. We’ve got close to 20 offices worldwide. We’re dual headquartered in Irvine and Singapore.</p><p><strong>When I think about the market of gamers, we’re here, obviously, in the United States. It’s very obviously focused on what this market wants. Gaming is growing in China at a high rate, right? We’re adding more gamers in other places. When you say, “We’re focused on the gamers,” the gamers in different regions want different things. How do you make those decisions? How do you decide which needs are gonna drive your roadmaps or your design ideas?</strong></p><p>Exactly that. You know, the gamers from, or the needs from, every country or region that we’ve got… We’ve got team members from design in each of the various regions, and we do focus on pretty much two constituents, the way that we see it. The first of which would be the game developers. That’s who we work with, very closely with. And then on the other end of the spectrum, we’ve got the gamers. And what we do is focus on what the gamers want, what the game developers want, and we see ourselves as the link in between. And we keep both as happy as we can.</p><p><strong>This brings me to the other </strong><strong><em>Decoder</em></strong><strong> question I ask everybody on the show. How do you make decisions? Do you have a framework? Do you have an organized way of making decisions?</strong></p><p>I think we are dictated by what we feel the customer wants. That’s what dictates our decisions at any point in time. We talk to the gamers, and when we say “talk to the gamers,” it could be directly through social media, it could be through our customer base, it could be through our sales and marketing team, and things like that. And anecdotally, we figure out, is this what we want? And if this is something that they are keen or passionate about, we then make the decision to say, “Okay, cool.” And we have a very quick, flexible, and… We’re very nimble, I would say, at Razer, wherein we try to do as little as possible, but to scale as fast as possible just for our customer base.</p><p><strong>This is gonna lead me to the big decision. You have </strong><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-06/razer-ceo-min-liang-tan-interview-at-ces-2026-strategy-investment-and-ai-focus"><strong>announced you’re investing $600 million into AI</strong></a><strong> over the next few years. You’re gonna hire 150 AI engineers, I think. The gamers hate it. The gamers, I think, are in open revolt against AI coming into their games, into their platforms. Certainly, developers are very worried about what’s gonna happen to software development. We’ve seen game studios rocked by AI. </strong></p><p><strong>That’s a pretty big disconnect. Even, I think, in the announcement of the CES tag line for Razer at CES, which is, “AI is the future of gaming.” I </strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DTJmdYkieb6/"><strong>looked at the Instagram comments</strong></a><strong>. If you’re listening to the gamers, you’d be like, “Well, we’re done with this.” How are you reconciling that gap?</strong></p><p>So, I would say that the question is, “What are we unhappy with?” When I say we, I mean us as gamers. I think we’re unhappy with generative AI slop, right? Just to put it out there. And that’s something that I’m unhappy with. Like any gamer, when I play a game, I want to be engaged, I wanna be immersed, I wanna be able to be competitive. I don’t want to be served character models with extra fingers and stuff like that, or shoddily written storylines, so on and so forth. I think for us, we’re all aligned against gen AI slop that is just churned out from a couple of prompts and stuff like that.</p><p>What we aren’t against, at least, from my perspective, are tools that help augment or support, and help game developers make great games. And I think that’s fundamentally what we are talking about at Razer, right? So if we’ve got AI tools that can help game developers QA their games faster, better, and weed out the bugs, I think, along the way, we’re all aligned, and we would love that. If we could get game developers to have the opportunity to create better, to check through typos and things like that, to create better games, I think we all want that. So I think that’s the way that we see it.</p><p>One of the things that we’re building, for example, at Razer is what we call a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/676444/razer-is-making-its-ai-tools-available-to-all-developers">QA companion</a>. So QA tends to be an expensive endeavor. Like the gamer doesn’t see it at the end of the day, but it can take up like 30 to 40 percent of the cost, or delay games for the longest time. Now, what we’ve done is create a companion, a tool that works with the human QA tester to be able to automatically fill in forms, to say, “Okay, if this is…” Say the form is a Jira ticket, to say “this is a bug that is identified, there’s a graphical bug, there’s a performance bug.” All that’s logged very quickly, so it’s sent to the developer at the same time. The developer then can go in and say, “Okay, this is how I’ll fix the bug,” or, “These are suggestions on how I fix the bug.”</p><p>The way that we see it is that AI is a tool to help game developers make better games. In this case, rather than replacing human creativity — and that’s something I personally feel very passionately about — we want to figure out how we use AI in the gaming industry to get AI to do things better. In the broader scheme of things, I think that’s what we have been focused on. But there are other reasons why I think gamers are unhappy with AI, and I agree with them. I don’t like slop either, right? That’s one. Two, is it raising the cost of RAM? It is also raising the cost of RAM. I don’t like that at the same time.</p><p>Back in the day, there was the GPUs versus crypto situation and things like that, and this is the same thing. So I do think, however, that all gamers would love better games, more fun games, more engaging games, and if AI can help create that by doing better QA, I mean, I’m all for it.</p><p><strong>I want to poke at that a little bit harder, but let me just ask you: is Razer feeling the RAM crunch and the GPU crunch like everybody else?</strong></p><p>Oh, yes, absolutely. Because we make laptops and things like that.</p><p><strong>How badly has that affected you?</strong></p><p>I mean, we haven’t announced the prices for the next round of laptops, for example, and this is something that concerns me because the RAM prices are going up, and we want to be able to make sure our laptops remain affordable and within the reach of gamers out there. But it has been moving. It is such a volatile situation at this point in time that it’s hard for us to even figure out what the pricing is at this junction.</p><p><strong>Do you think you’ll be able to pick a number and be confident in that number by the time the laptops have to come out?</strong></p><p>I don’t know if I can pick a number right now as I speak with you, and by the end of the podcast.</p><p><strong>Yeah, that’s bad.</strong></p><p>It is bad. It is bad right now.</p><p><strong>You have competitors in the PC industry like Apple, Microsoft, and others. They can move their margins around. They have services, businesses, and stuff that attach to these laptops. Maybe they’ll take a hit on the RAM because you’re gonna have to pay for iCloud for the rest of your life, or whatever it is you’re gonna do. You don’t have that kind of secondary business. Is that more of a danger to you?</strong></p><p>Well, we do have a secondary business of sorts. So hardware is a big part of our business. We actually have a services payments business where we do payments for a lot of the game companies out there, and that’s one of the strategies that we use to try to make our products more available to everyone. That’s the way that we kind of see it.</p><p>We are an ecosystem of sorts. We do great hardware, I think, for game developers and the gamers out there. But we’ve got a software platform that we are able to bring across to all the gamers out there. And of course, it’s a services business at the same time. But the RAM situation, at the end of the day, is still an evolving situation right now.</p><p><strong>Do you think it will cap out, and do you think we’ll have enough data center capacity, and things will go back to normal?</strong></p><p>I wish I knew. I really don’t.</p><p><strong>Is there a point at which the price of RAM, or the price of a marginal Nvidia GPU, becomes too high for you to sustainably do laptops at your scale?</strong></p><p>I would say I’m hoping that it doesn’t come to that, right? I think, in short, we’ve seen this happen with the industry multiple times in the past, spiked in terms of pricing. What’s great is that as long as manufacturing kicks in, and we are able to kind of keep up, it’s just economics at the end of the day. There is a spike in terms of pricing. We believe that at some point it will come down. What goes up must come down, and what goes down at some point goes up, too.</p><p><strong>Let me come back to what you’re saying about AI and development. AI is the future of gaming. You’ve announced products here, and we’ve talked about Ava, the headset with the cameras and the AI stuff in it. That’s consumer AI products, right? Those are consumer products. And you’re saying your bet is on AI helping developers make better games faster. There’s a gap there, right? </strong></p><p><strong>AI is the future of gaming is an all-encompassing tag line. It means a lot of things to a lot of people, but it sounds like your bet is very specifically in sort of the more enterprise side of the house, helping developers do games better. Is it correct that it’s much narrower than what people are perceiving?</strong></p><p>Well, I think the tag line’s very broad, but it’s easier to do a catchier tag line when it’s a broad tag line, as opposed to when it’s hardware we look at or software and stuff like that. But in short, for us, we run an ecosystem. We’ve got hardware, we’ve got software with services. Starting with the hardware, I think we do see that AI is going to be part of the whole kind of conversation. The way that we look at it would be things like whether it’s AI companions, or whether it’s making smart headphones, like with Motoko. We see all of this as augmenting what’s happening today, not replacing it.</p><p>So it’s not a gen AI conversation that we’ve got. It’s about how we bring the smarts, where we design products, and how we bring additional value to our users. For example, using our gaming headphones, all of a sudden, we can provide additional AI capabilities. Is that great? Absolutely. So, that’s one of the things that we’re looking at from a hardware perspective.</p><p>Now, from a software and services perspective, as we work with the game developers and publishers, and so on and so forth, we look at additional tools that can make their games better. We can work closely with them on a QA companion basis, for example. And then some of these core technologies, as we provide for them, can then make better games, over and above. So I believe that at some point, it’s not just games, but AI is just gonna be so prevalent or ubiquitous that every single vertical, healthcare, gaming, and entertainment, is gonna have some elements of AI there. And we are just going along with it.</p><p><strong>I’ve heard this pitch a lot, and I have a lot of reactions to it. But I guess the simplest way of asking this question is, what have you seen that makes the bet worth it? Because I’ve evaluated a lot of these AI products, the merch team has reviewed a ton of them. We have literally just tried to do the things that Microsoft says you can do in the ads, and the products don’t work. Right? There’s this massive gap between what everyone says is gonna happen, or should be happening, and what is actually happening in the products.</strong></p><p><strong>You know, to be a cynic about it for the sake of getting a laugh out of this audience, I will tell you the products are best at convincing you that you should love them, and doing crimes, and they’re not so good at identifying what’s on your screen and helping you get a task done. They are really good at that in the domain of software development, right?</strong></p><p><strong>I can see why you’re pushing there with game developers. It’s obvious that Claude Code has ushered in some kind of revolution, and Cursor has ushered in some kind of revolution. In your vertical, you have something to offer that is different. But in the broad sense, this belief that it’s all just gonna happen, I think, has come up against the reality of what the products can do today. So what have you seen that suggests we will overcome that gap that makes you so confident?</strong></p><p>Well, occasionally I go on podcasts where the guy is more concerned that someone’s gonna fall in love with my product in the long run. And I think maybe there’s something there. No, but you see, it’s early days. It could completely be the worst possible idea. It could completely go off the rails and become off the spectrum, where it’s just the most phenomenal product that somebody completely falls in love with, so on and so forth, right? And I think the reality is gonna be something in between. The way that we see it, it’s probably closer to bringing more value to people, and that’s what we want to be able to do.</p><p>We want to be able to get to the point where AI is going to be helpful to all customers, all users. And that’s also one good example where, at CES… I was just looking at some of the stats, and they said, “What’s the biggest buzz at CES?” And there were a lot, like Ava, Motoko, and things like that. And for what it’s worth, we’ve literally just put vision capabilities, audio capabilities on a headphone, and combined it with AI. It’s not a quantum leap from a hardware design perspective, but it has captured so much imagination at this point in time. People are going, “Oh, wow. Now I can bring AI on the go with me at any point in time.” It’s truly something revolutionary at this juncture. So the way that we see it, and maybe that’s something that–</p><p><strong>Wait.</strong></p><p>Yeah.</p><p><strong>Can we just hit pause on that? What specifically do you think is revolutionary about having the AI and the cameras in the headphones with you all the time?</strong></p><p>Well, I would say that, first off, we are really looking at being able to have an unobtrusive universal form factor to enable AI smarts.</p><p><strong>I think the whole industry is looking for this one factor, right? This is like when I hear about the platform shift, you suddenly had this massive input device paradigm shift, right? We’re going from touchscreens or mice to voice and vision. I get that. No one has sorted out that form factor, so your bet is headphones.</strong></p><p>Our bet is on headphones in the sense that we don’t necessarily have to retrain human beings as a whole with an entirely new form factor. And so I don’t have to change any behavior of sorts. Boom, tomorrow we can get you AI smarts immediately. And that, I think, is the promise. There’s a disconnect today with the possibility of AI and what it could be, and that’s where we see ourselves as designers, having that responsibility, or the opportunity, so to speak, to be able to design in such a way that we don’t necessarily have to change the entire behavior.</p><p>For what it’s worth, in the very early days, it could be, for that matter, a mouse. It’s just a mouse. Why is a mouse so important that today we’ve brought it from a mouse all the way to a gaming mouse, and now the gaming mouse is a broader category than productivity, right? Gaming mice right now dominate the mouse category at this point in time. And right now, we can call it a smart headphone, and that’s the way we see it. We don’t necessarily have to retrain everybody to say, “Oh, you’ve gotta put on glasses. You’ve gotta be able to bear with the weight,” and things like that.</p><p>So that is one of the things that we’re doing with Motoko, and a lot of the work that we do is actually on the software side of things, right? How do we ensure that we get context faster? How do we ensure that we are able to do all of that? So it’s both hardware/software fusion and a sense of fusion at the same time, that we are really focused on in terms of bringing the experience over. That’s something that we believe is the reason why people go, “Oh, I absolutely get it, right now, why I would want something like that.”</p><p><strong>So the model in the Motoko that I saw is ChatGPT. </strong></p><p>It is ChatGPT.</p><p><strong>Why’d you pick ChatGPT for the headphones and Grok for Ava?</strong></p><p>So, ChatGPT for the headphones was primarily more from the premise that we think it’s a good assistant, in terms of CV capabilities, identifying things, and being able to give very quick feedback at the same time. But it could very well run Grok also at the same time. And the way that we are kind of presenting this is that whether it’s for Ava, or whether it’s for Motoko, or any of our other products, we are multi-model.</p><p>That was one of the things that we wanted to be able to do. We believe that at some point in time, you see Gemini doing really well. We see Grok doing really, really well. We see ChatGPT having advances in various aspects. This race to intelligence is just great for all of us as consumers, right? When I mention that Grok has great conversational AI, I think it is the best for conversational AI at this point in time. ChatGPT’s doing great, I think, in terms of it as an assistant, for reasoning and things like that. And that’s what we see ourselves. We see ourselves as owning the vertical from a gaming perspective, being able to work with all the best intelligence or the AI out there, and then bringing and designing a product or service tailored for our users, and within the gaming vertical.</p><p><strong>So the vision is that I’m wearing headphones that have cameras, microphones, and speakers. I’m walking through the airport, and I’m just asking it, “Where is my gate?” and it’s telling me the answer from ChatGPT. Or is it more that I’m sitting at my desk playing a game and it’s helping me through the game?</strong></p><p>All of the above. You can literally do that with Motoko at this point in time.</p><p><strong>But this is what I mean about the capability gap. I think if I walk through the airport and I ask ChatGPT where my gate is, it would not get that right at this point in time. Like, there’s a model capability gap there.</strong></p><p>I believe that if you use ChatGPT today and you’re providing snapshots with some context, like, let’s say, location, to a certain extent, you could. I would be messaging on my phone with ChatGPT, for example, and it could give me the reasoning to be able to bring me there, to a great extent. I’ll give an example, right? I would literally use ChatGPT for a whole bunch of day-to-day tasks and stuff like that. It’s got great reasoning; it’s able to do that. And now we are layering on vision capabilities, and that’s just another level of input.</p><p>Over and above, we’ve got far-field microphones. So audio capabilities also come to bear. With all of this, we’re able to give a lot more information across to ChatGPT, which does all the reasoning, I think, for us. And that’s where we see it coming through. So constantly, the smart or intelligence is part of how we see us designing AI hardware, at this point in time.</p><p><strong>It seems like you have a pretty big reliance on the models themselves, right? You’re obviously not training your own models. You wanna be multi-model, you wanna let people choose. Are you thinking of yourself more as being the best at the hardware, the form factor, and having the best microphones and cameras, and that will let people use the models more conveniently?</strong></p><p>Well, we are an ecosystem, but I think for gamers. It’s not just, I think, in terms of the hardware, but most of our work is actually done at the software side. If I use CES as an example, if I’ve got Ava, when I wake up, it’s giving me information like what’s happening in the day and what my day is gonna be today, so on and so forth. When I get out of my apartment, and I go out into the street, to the subway, et cetera, then I’ve got Motoko at the same time. But with persistent memory, it will know exactly what has been happening in the home. Ava is somewhat following me everywhere in my day. I’m not gonna fall in love with it yet.</p><p>But in short, it’s following my day, I’m going around, I’m looking at it, I’m asking for directions. When I get to the office, I could literally still be with Motoko, which is another form factor. So the way that we see it is that the intelligence is persistent, and it follows you. The form factors that are presented are hardware form factors. It’s a little bit like how we’ve designed our product at this point in time. We have a singular software platform where we are able to give you a great gaming experience, over and above. You could be using one of our mice, our keyboards, and so on and so forth, a laptop. These are just representations, at the end of the day. And that’s how we designed it, and there are particular problems that we need to solve that the models don’t provide for us. You know, context.</p><p>So that’s one of the things that our AI scientists do really well. We’ve got advanced retrieval augmented generation (RAG), we’ve got context, and we really focus on that. Persistent memory is something that we are very good at, at the same time. And these are fundamental problems that AI scientists need to solve. These are the things that our team does, so we work with the best models out there. And we also have the capabilities of creating physical representations, and that’s something that we’ve got a huge advantage at.</p><p><strong>Doesn’t a lot of the value here just accrue back to these models? And yet, even if you’re building all this stuff above the models and around the models to make them work the way you want, it seems like, “Okay, my Ava is gonna be powered by ChatGPT no matter what.” If I want that unified experience, I’m just kind of, at the end of the day, talking to an instantiation of ChatGPT all day long, right? </strong></p><p><strong>Because then I have Grok over here and ChatGPT in the headphones, you can’t unify that. So at the end of the day, it’s all Gemini, or whatever model I choose. So, can you provide enough value to charge a premium on top of the ChatGPT subscription to make that work?</strong></p><p>So that’s, I think, where our angle is, from the software perspective. We believe that we can bring enough value of persistence across to the user, and progressively we will see even more users who will say, “Look, this is what I want, to be able to go from one model to another,” for example. Or if I’m happy with just a single model, and if I’m a techie and I’m happy to just go directly and play around with it, we provide that open platform. So being open is one of the things that we truly believe in.</p><p><strong>One of the things you notice when you cover AI enough is the idea that the AI startups are just wrappers on OpenAI, and then eventually OpenAI will just eat them as the models get more incapable. We’ve seen that play out already a little bit. </strong></p><p><strong>You obviously have hardware. Razer’s a different business, but you can see that dynamic here, where the core model capability might start to get the memory you’re talking about, where the core model capability might start to get the persistent personality across devices that you’re talking about. </strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/827607/openai-hardware-prototype-chatgpt-jony-ive-sam-altman"><strong>OpenAI is making hardware</strong></a><strong>, we are told. There’s a competition with the core provider that is coming in different dimensions. How are you thinking about that?</strong></p><p>Well, I think the entire tech industry has always been wrappers, for that matter, not necessarily from an AI perspective, but it’s the question of when you build a wrapper, do you provide enough value from the wrapper that you build? And that’s the thing, where it’s also very hard for anyone to be all things to all people. And I don’t think OpenAI wants to be all things to all people. I don’t think Grok wants to be all things to all people.</p><p>For us, we tend to be very focused on our vertical. We are not tempted to try to produce something else different at any point in time. And our vertical is really for the gamers. This is something we’ve got huge domain knowledge in terms of what the gamers want, what the game developers want. We’ve got distribution; we’ve got about 70,000 game developers using our SDK. We’ve got 150 million gamers on our software platform. We’ve got distribution, I think, across to that. Can the models go out there and try to build the distribution? Yes, but do they prefer to partner?</p><p>And I think the answer is they do prefer to partner. Fundamentally, we have a huge amount of data, I think, on the gamers, their preferences, what they want, what they like, and that we can bring that across to the models at the same time, which is our IP, for that matter. I think with that in mind, as I say, having all these verticals, you may call it building wrappers of sorts, but these are very deep wrappers that we have to build. A lot of customization, a lot of building, and it’s more than just hardware, right? It’s not hardware.</p><p>As I say, the hardware is just part of the equation. It’s the software part that we need to do. It’s the R and D work that we need to do, for example, to get persistence in this space and context. So to get the context for our users, that’s where our data comes in at the same time, to be able to kind of pivot and focus on that.</p><p><strong>I think one of the reasons people like companies like Razer, and like dealing with products that Razer makes, is that you just buy them and you’re done. Like you can just buy the mouse, and then you own it, and it’s fine. You can just buy the laptop. I’m not in an ongoing subscription relationship with you, unless I want to be.</strong></p><p>Sure.</p><p><strong>One of your competitors, Hanneke Faber from Logitech, </strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24206847/logitech-ceo-hanneke-faber-mouse-keyboard-gaming-decoder-podcast-interview"><strong>came on the show</strong></a><strong> a year or two ago, and she was like, “I wanna build a forever mouse,” and what she meant was a subscription mouse, and she’s never coming back on the show again, I think, </strong><a href="https://gizmodo.com/logitech-ceo-wants-to-sell-you-a-subscription-based-forever-mouse-2000480678"><strong>based</strong></a> <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2419903/logitech-forever-mouse-was-just-a-bad-idea.html"><strong>on</strong></a> <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/gaming-mice/logitechs-forever-mouse-could-mean-peripherals-go-the-way-of-coffee-beans-tvs-and-printer-ink-by-pushing-a-subscription/"><strong>the</strong></a> <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/07/31/logitech-ceo-forever-mouse-hanneke-faber-ai-hardware/"><strong>reaction</strong></a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/07/logitech-has-an-idea-for-a-forever-mouse-thatrequires-a-subscription/"><strong>to</strong></a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/6/24214857/logitech-subscription-mouse-decoder-podcast-hanneke-faber"><strong>that</strong></a><strong>. That’s my understanding of how they felt about that interview. </strong></p><p><strong>All the things you’re talking about are ongoing relationships, ongoing development costs. I hear it, and I hear the promise. I also hear, “I’m gonna have to pay a fee every month.” Like this is where that comes from. You need to pay the developers, you need to pay for cloud uptime to make the AI system alive. How much are you gonna charge for all of that?</strong></p><p>Well, we’ve always had an ongoing relationship with our customer. That’s the thing, right? The way that we see it from Razer is that when somebody buys a Razer mouse, they tend to buy another Razer mouse in the future. They expand the devices that they own from us. So we’ve always had a long-term relationship with our customer, from that perspective. At some point in time, as we think through the whole AI uptime, so on and so forth… I mean, we’ve had cloud costs also in the past, maintaining profiles in clouds. For us, I think that’s one of the things that we want to figure out. What can we do to ensure that we bring value?</p><p>I think that’s our obsession. If there is no value, our customers won’t pay for it, we won’t pay for it ourselves, right? So to that end, that’s our focus, I think, in respect of it. And it could be through… We build into the hardware cost, for that matter, if that makes sense, and I’ll be candid: We have literally not thought through this in great detail. But the way that we see it is, how do we identify that value to the user? And from there we are very clear, we message this. This is the value that we see out of this, and we’ll let the market decide.</p><p><strong>I look at that reaction from gamers, probably, to AI in the industry. There’s slop. I think there’s a lot of reaction to slop, and there’s a lot of reaction to game studios being in whatever amount of crisis the game studios appear to be in. There’s whatever reaction to consolidation. And then there’s the relentless fee seeking from the games industry, that everything is gonna be a subscription, everything is gonna be free to play with DLC, everything is gonna be an ongoing, recurring cost, over and over and over again. </strong></p><p><strong>The industry’s really moved to that model across the board, and I think people are feeling that pain. So then they hear AI, and they say, “Okay, someone else is gonna ask me for 10 bucks a month, or 20 bucks a month.” Can you avoid that? Can you just price it into the hardware? Is that going to be inevitable?</strong></p><p>So, as I mentioned, I don’t know if we’re gonna price it into the hardware. We are still figuring it out. But I would say that, at the end of the day, the question is how much value are you getting on it, right? I mean, I pay for Spotify because I see the value in paying for Spotify. I get a whole library of music, and so on, and with Xbox Game Pass, so on and so forth.</p><p>There are times when I would prefer... I mean, I look back, and I go like, “Oh, I wish I could just pay one time for this title.” There are microtransactions, there are subscription fees. But at the end of the day, I think, myself as a consumer, myself as a gamer, I would say… I would just look at anything. I would say if it’s worth that amount of money to me, I would pay for it. Otherwise, I’ll vote with my wallet. That’s the way I see it.</p><p><strong>Are you seeing signs that the AI stuff is gonna be worth paying for that way? I mean, this is the bubble. We’re gonna spend all this money, we’ll forward invest in all this infrastructure. We’re gonna skyrocket the price of RAM and GPUs, and then at the end of the day, people are going to say, “That’s not actually worth the 20 bucks a month.”</strong></p><p>I don’t necessarily see it as AI, per se, but I see the kind of value that I get out of it. So, for example, a ChatGPT subscription, or a Grok subscription, for that matter. I do see value in it, and that’s why I pay for it. And that’s the way I see it. I don’t see myself as paying for AI, per se. I see it as what am I getting out of a chatbot, for example, that can advise me on travel matters, health matters, whatever it is, my day-to-day, and stuff like that. Is that worth 20 bucks to me?</p><p><strong>Because you’re a billionaire, right?</strong></p><p>Sure.</p><p><strong>I’m just saying, the marginal cost is meaningless to you.</strong></p><p>20 bucks is still 20 bucks, that’s right.</p><p><strong>I’m just saying.</strong></p><p>Right.</p><p><strong>I think for a lot of people, that is meaningful, especially stacked on top of all the other money they pay. Basically, I’m saying, do you see that critique of AI as a bubble? That the investment has not yet delivered the value that will make it so obvious that the investment’s worth it?</strong></p><p>So I see that. I mean, huge amounts of investments are going into it. We are investing in AI, I think, as we speak. But I do see the potential at this point. In many cases, I mean, look at the number of paid subscribers for ChatGPT, for example. People do see the value in terms of whether it’s a chatbot AI, so on and so forth. I do think the potential is going to be realized.</p><p>Now, in many cases, I think there will be AI slop. I mean, I’ve paid for subscriptions that, at the start, I thought were gonna be great, but I’ve canceled them. But I do believe that in many cases, and in some cases that we have not even envisaged yet, the potential will be realized.</p><p><strong>Let me ask you broadly, I mean, you obviously talk a lot to game developers. You and I actually were just talking backstage about the nature of art in the age of AI, and the nature of craft. That industry is going through an enormous amount of turmoil right now. What do you think the outcome looks like? What do you think makes that all feel good at the end?</strong></p><p>I would say that the outcome that we see, and I think it’s gonna be the likely outcome, is that AI tools are gonna be helping human developers develop faster and better. And I think that’s the natural outcome, where we’re talking about graduating, whether it’s an analog kind of way of creating art versus digital. And I think it’s gonna be the same thing.</p><p>We’re going to see human artists use AI tools to kind of really bring their vision to life. We’ll see new forms of artists, artists of whom may not necessarily have been so adept in terms of using a paint brush or using Photoshop, now being able to kind of wordsmith and craft great pieces of art with prompts throughout. So that’s, I think, what’s going to happen, where we will see even more human creators, now with the help of more tools.</p><p>Maybe I’m an optimist, but I really, truly see that AI tools will come to fall, because at some point in time, we’re going to see so much slop out there that we’re going to crave for really great art, really great design. And that’s what’s gonna happen. We’ve seen a cycle go over and over and over again.</p><p>So, with the amount of slop out there, we’re going to see some level of art rise to the top, and that kind of art may still be created with the same tools that created the slop, but with great care, with great discernment, to be able to do something truly different. The difference will come from human ingenuity, not from countless prompt mashing, so to speak.</p><p><strong>So I feel like I have to ask you this now. What games are you playing right now?</strong></p><p>Oh, it depends.</p><p><strong>What meets the bar?</strong></p><p>What meets the bar? I play a lot of single-player games at this point in time, like Civilization and stuff like that. I still do a lot of that. I do play some MMOs of sorts, shooters, and I still play a lot of the battle royale genre. So things like that.</p><p><strong>You just named genres. What games are you playing that meet the bar?</strong></p><p>That meet which bar?</p><p><strong>You’re talking about human ingenuity and creativity. What games are you playing right now that meet the bar?</strong></p><p>Oh, well, I play random stuff. If you’re talking about human ingenuity… I even play some of the Roblox games at this point in time, right? But a lot of the games, and maybe I talked broadly in terms of genres primarily because I appreciate the human ingenuity that’s gone into the genres themselves.</p><p>One hundred people dropped on an island with a circle that comes through. I mean, while I enjoy the game itself, I also appreciate the mechanics, the thought that has gone into them, and the premise that the designer has figured out. In PUBG, for example, it’s this primal instinct of humans to be the last man standing, so to speak. So it’s things like that that I appreciate, and I think it’s art.</p><p><strong>Okay. What’s next for Razer? What should people be looking for?</strong></p><p>More of the same, I would say, in the sense. When I say more of the same, I’d say nothing has changed from day one for us, and that has always been our mantra. And we used to say, all the time, that the mantra for us… Our “for gamers, by gamers” mantra has really followed us from day one, where the gaming industry didn’t really exist as an industry, even the hardware industry or software, and so on and so forth.</p><p>We believe that we’ve designed products for ourselves that we enjoy, that I enjoy using at any point in time, and that tomorrow, when the gaming industry grows dramatically, we will still be focused on games. Even though there are multiple opportunities for us to kind of expand out there. And even now, when we talk about the gaming industry in somewhat of a doldrums at this juncture, I believe that we’re gonna see the next great genre come through, right? Whether it’s MMOs in the early days, MOBAs, and then battle royales, we’re gonna see the next great genre. We’re hoping to see Grand Theft Auto VI at some point in time, right?</p><p>So all that, we look forward to, but we’re just pretty much laser-focused. It’s just that the demographic has really changed. The word gamer has also changed through the years. The games have changed through the years, right? For us, we’re just sitting here, very focused, and designing great products for ourselves.</p><p><strong>Min, this has been great.

            <p>A first major update for Minecrafty block-build-and-basher <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a> arrived over the weekend, and it's added in some extra danger. There are now dinosaurs running around in the underground jungles. These are work-in-progress dinos, so who knows what might happen if you end up earning their big lizard ire. Also, the in-game bedtime's now half past seven.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>These things and more can be found in the update's <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2026/1/hytale-patch-notes-update-1">beefy notes</a>. The dinos and other NPCs which now roam the underground jungles use "placeholder behavious" for the moment, and you'll need to generate some new unexplored areas in the biome in order to have them pop up.</p>
<p>Outside of that, some inhabitants of Hytale's blockverse have had knockback resistance added to them, the likes of foxes have been made less gung-ho about attacking folks, and fire-themed characters can't take fire damage. "Skeletons should no longer take drowning damage," developers Hypixel add, seemingly hedging their bets in case bony bathing continues to prove fatal on occasion. Kweebecs and Trorks have also had a couple of tweaks made to them.</p>
<p>Outside of those, a few extra options have been added to the character creator, while the audio/visuals attached to hitting and breaking various materials have been made a bit more crunchy. "You can now sleep starting at 7:30 PM" reads another noteworthy note, with Hytale's previous earliest bedtime having been 9:00PM.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytales-first-hotfix-targets-crash-inducing-hairdos-and-buckets-as-its-devs-outline-update-plans-for-the-next-few-months">you'd imagine</a>, the update's also heavy on key bug fixes and crash abatement, plus less glamourous quality-of-life tweaks like ensuring weapon attacks check for line of sight. Hytale being like Minecraft, you can of course also turn to mods for minor tweaks which eliminate any remaining annoyances official updates have yet to deliver. Or, you know, if you think the game needs <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/mods/not-enough-poops">several different variants of poo</a>.</p>
<p>If you're still yet to give Hytale a go, we've got handy guides to the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-how-to-play-multiplayer-dedicated-server-hosting">setting up a server</a>, getting it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-hytale-on-steam-deck">running on the Steam Deck</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-how-to-get-cobalt">hunting down key materials</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Emergency Crews Briefly Seal Off GTA 6 Studio Following Boiler Explosion]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>First responders, including six fire engines, descended upon Rockstar Games’ Edinburgh office, Rockstar North, early on Monday following reports of structural damage to the offices of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-vi-new-trailer-rockstar-1851779300"><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> maker</a>. The result of an apparent explosion of some kind, the incident thankfully left no one injured.</p> <p>“We were alerted at 5:02 a.m. on Monday, 19 January to attend an incident on Holyrood Road, Edinburgh,” a spokesperson for emergency crews <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/25776012.gta6-dev-rockstar-north-building-taped-off-boiler-explosion/">told <em>The Herald</em></a>. “Operations Control mobilized three fire appliances and specialist resources to the scene, where firefighters worked to secure structural damage at a commercial building. There were no reported casualties and crews left the scene at 9:21 a.m.”</p>

 <p>According to Rockstar, the explosion was the result of a boiler malfunction and the studio remains fully operational as it prepares for the <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-delay-may-2026-too-many-games-rockstar-trailer-2-1851778860">launch of <em>GTA 6</em> in November</a>.</p> <p>“Early Monday morning, there was a malfunction in one of the heating boilers at Rockstar North,” a spokesperson for Rockstar Games told&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em> in an email. “Many thanks to those that reached out with concern, and also to the police and fire crews who were on scene quickly to assess the situation–please know that everyone is well and our studio remains open and operational.”</p>

 <p>The office has recently been at the center of an ongoing labor dispute with 31 fired developers who were <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-rockstar-games-union-busting-delay-2000640525">trying to unionize</a>. The workers claim they were targeted for trying to organize while Rockstar maintains they were fired for violations of confidentiality rules, including leaking <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-multiplayer-one-detail-leak-court-docs-player-count-32-rockstar-2000659780">development and gameplay details</a> in a union Discord channel with outside observers.</p>

 <p>A judge reviewing the case recently denied the fired <em>GTA 6</em> devs <a href="https://kotaku.com/rockstar-wins-initial-ruling-against-fired-gta-6-devs-we-regret-that-we-were-put-in-a-position-where-dismissals-were-necessary-2000658984">immediate relief</a> in the form of back pay, but a full ruling on the overall merits of the complaint is still pending.</p>
