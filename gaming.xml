<p>The DM-10 is a Marksman Rifle in Call of Duty <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> capable of killing enemies in just two shots. However, you must use the best set of attachments, Perks, and Equipment to make the most out of the weapon in multiplayer.</p>

</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-dm-10-loadout-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best DM-10 loadout attachments in Black Ops 6</h2>



<figure></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic</strong>: Kepler Microflex</li>



<li><strong>Muzzle</strong>: Ported Compensator</li>



<li><strong>Barrel</strong>: Long Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Underbarrel</strong>: Weighted Handguard</li>



<li><strong>Fire Mods</strong>: Rapid Fire</li>
</ul>



<p>The <strong>Kepler Microflex</strong> is a good optic choice for the DM-10 as the maps in Black Ops 6 are on the smaller side, and having a bigger scope would only leave you tunnel-visioned when the action is intense and fast-paced. This clean optic provides enough field of view to take down enemies easily.</p>



<p>Coming to the <strong>Ported Compensator</strong>, this muzzle will improve the accuracy of the Marksman Rifle by significantly enhancing the vertical and horizontal recoil. The <strong>Long Barrel</strong> will improve the damage range while the <strong>Weighted Handguard</strong> further lowers horizontal recoil.</p>



<p>Get hold of the <strong>Rapid Fire</strong> Fire Mods as it will increase the fire rate of the DM-10. This will come in handy to shoot down enemies faster, especially when they appear in numbers.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-dm-10">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment for DM-10</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Perk 1</strong>: Ghost</li>



<li><strong>Perk 2</strong>: Forward Intel</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3</strong>: Cold-Blooded</li>



<li><strong>Perk 4</strong>: Bankroll</li>



<li><strong>Wildcard</strong>: Perk Greed</li>



<li><strong>Lethal</strong>: Semtex</li>



<li><strong>Tactical</strong>: Stim Shot</li>



<li><strong>Field Upgrade</strong>: Tactical Insertion</li>
</ul>



<p>The combination of <strong>Ghost, Forward Intel, and Cold-Blooded</strong> will activate the <strong>Recon</strong> Specialty – which is crucial as a Marksman Rifler. You can briefly see opponents’ positions through walls during the start of a round and that split-second is enough to plan for lethal attacks.</p>



<p>Once you unlock Perk Greed, keep <strong>Bankroll</strong> in the fourth Perk slot to gain a +150 score toward <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-scorestreaks-black-ops-6-and-how-to-unlock-them/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Scorestreaks</a>. This will come in handy to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-level-weapons-fast-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">level your weapons quicker</a> as Scorestreaks will recharge faster.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-best-secondary-for-dm-10">Best Secondary for DM-10</h2>



<p>The ideal secondary weapon options for the DM-10 are Stryder .22 and GS45.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-dm-10-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock DM-10 in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>You need to reach <strong>player Level 43</strong> to unlock the DM-10 in Black Ops 6. This is the last Markman Rifle you can unlock at launch and will require you to play several matches to get this gun. In case you were wondering, here’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-level-up-fast-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how you can level up fast in BO6</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-dm-10-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the DM-10 any good in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>Yes, the DM-10 is one of the best Marksman Rifles in the game at the moment. It comes with a very fast TTK and offers great mobility at the same time. Although its ADS speed is a little slower and a semi-auto weapon, you can kill enemies in just two headshots.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-alternatives-to-the-dm-10-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives to the DM-10 in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>If you don’t like handling semi-auto weapons, then the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-xm4-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XM4</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-best-ak-74-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AK-74</a> would be the best DM-10 alternatives in BO6. They are fully automatic rifles and are two of the most hard-hitting ones you can use.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nexon-shows-off-the-first-berserker-khazan-and-many-more-games-ahead-of-g-star-2024/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>With G-Star 2024 scheduled to start in just two weeks at the usual venue (the Busan Exhibition and Convention Center), NEXON has shown off several trailers for its upcoming games, starting with The First Berserker: Khazan.</p>
<p>This intriguing Dungeon and Fighter spin-off is an action RPG that <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-gamescom-hands-on-preview-vast-potential/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">caught our attention at Gamescom</a> and then again during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-closed-beta-hands-on-preview-setting-up-for-greatness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent closed beta test</a>. Francesco De Meo wrote in his latest hands-on:</p>
<p><em>The First Berserker: Khazan may have been influenced by the Souls series for many of its game systems, but I feel, now more than ever, that the game will have what it takes to emerge from the competition. My time with the Technical Closed Beta Test build made me even more excited about the game, and I really cannot wait to experience more of the game when it launches next year on PC and consoles.</em></p>
<p>Today, NEXON published the game's opening cinematic. Check it out in the embedded video below.</p>
<p><iframe title="The First Berserker: Khazan | Opening Cinematic | G-STAR 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W8zwxh2FyHA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The South Korean company also published a new gameplay trailer for Project Overkill, another game set in the Dungeon and Fighter universe. Originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/nexons-overkill-is-a-3d-side-scrolling-arpg-set-in-the-dungeon-fighter-universe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> in early 2021, it is a 3D sidescrolling action RPG powered by Unreal Engine technology. It has no release date yet.</p>

<p>Today, NEXON unveiled a brand new Dungeon and Fighter game. Dungeon &amp; Fighter: Arad is an open-world action RPG for PC, consoles and mobiles in which players will experience exhilarating battle action and a journey with various characters on the Arad continent.</p>
<p><iframe title="G-STAR 2024ㅣ던전앤파이터: 아라드" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I-Ve5kMV37g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The game developer also shared a brief new trailer for Vindictus: Defying Fate, a character action RPG based on the Mabinogi Heroes IP (just like the Vindictus MMO-lite game). Defying Fate is coming to PC and consoles, with an Alpha test scheduled to go live next Summer.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Vindictus: Defying Fate - Delia and Karok Sneak Peek" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KKZ_nIeVn1Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Last but not least, NEXON announced Project DX, a dinosaur-themed MMORPG based on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/durango-wild-lands-is-nexons-next-dino-themed-mmo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Durango: Wild Lands</a> IP. Codenamed Project DX, it promises an immersive story with unique characters and battles with giant dinosaurs against the backdrop of a post-apocalyptic world. Let's hope it won't be confined to mobile like the predecessor.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="G-STAR 2024ㅣ프로젝트DX" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QyNjRtkoiW0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The publisher might share more footage and information when G-Star actually begins. Stay tuned.</p>

            <p>When they’re not doing environmental art for projects like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wasteland-3">Wasteland 3</a>, The Brotherhood have a history making enticingly odd games. Sin <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-very-nearly-like-stasis-bone-totem-this-is-a-recommendation">very nearly liked</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stasis-bone-totem">Stasis: Bone Totem</a>, landing positive despite giving up after several hours. That’s also my experience with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/beautiful-desolation">Beautiful Desolation</a> - an isometric <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> I got a real kick out of the art for before also stopping one day and just accidentally never playing it again. This might be a coincidence, but whatever else can be said about these projects, one thing is for certain: when compared to upcoming horror <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS </a><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/animal-use-protocol">Animal Use Protocol</a>, they both featured considerably less monke.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2591790/ANIMAL_USE_PROTOCOL/">Steam page</a> describes it as a “first-person, narrative-focused survival horror” (you’ve got a bad thing chasing you, one of those), but I also would have accepted “Grimdark <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ape-out">Ape Out</a>”, which sound facetious but is actually one heck of a sell. Your very smart monke, Penn, is escaping from a lab with a bunch of other test animals, including a little rat mate named Trip who lives on your gravity gun and does a little jump whenever you fire it.</p>
<p>The trailer shows off a similar sort of grimy, unnerving tech to Brotherhood’s previous games. This is good. It also does that horror game trailer thing where it has a bunch of kids singing the Barney The Dinosaur theme really slowly. This is bad and stupid. It’s got a massive tortoise in it. It also contains potassium benzoate etc. Most bad-ly of all, it’s not actually out until 2026. So why am I writing about it now?!</p>
<p><em>Monke.</em></p>
<p>Or Chimp, I suppose, although if you were about to type a comment along those lines, I would first suggest you make sure you know your phylum and genus from your ligma. Feel free to ask about that last one. Here are some more deets:</p>
<blockquote><p>In this 3D first-person, narrative-focused survival horror game, you play as Penn, a hyper-intelligent chimpanzee leading the desperate escape of lab animals from a nightmarish facility, where every corner hides new terror. Armed only with your wits, a gravity manipulation tool, and accompanied by your scrappy rat companion Trip, you’ll stealthily navigate the dystopian Anchorage Station, relentlessly stalked by a monstrous chimera of experiments gone wrong.</p></blockquote>
<p>There is, by the looks of it, also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-will-have-a-spider-free-mode-for-those-with-arachnophobia">no arachnophobia toggle</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-%E2%80%93-call-of-duty-zombies-original-crew-could-return-in-2025.1022889/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-2025-zombies/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Several sources have revealed that Call of Duty zombies original crew might be making their return in Call of Duty 2025.</p>



<p>The news comes from several sources who were invited to Call of Duty 2025 playtests and feedback sessions, where it was revealed that the original crew for zombies are set to make their return. </p>



<p>Dempsey, Tank, Takeo, and Nikolai were all said to be featured as a part of the feedback sessions, with one eagle-eyed zombies fan stating that the versions of the characters were not Ultimis, and that the characters looked older than Primis. </p>



<p>According to the same sources, the zombies storyline will evolve around a new enemy character who wants to absorb the “Dark Aether Essence” of the original four characters and bring back the old multiverse. </p>



<p>Sources also corroborated the recent zombies leak, that also originated from such playtests and feedback sessions. Sources said that the main zombies map will be “Tranzit inspired,” with some form of travel system to navigate around the map. One source, who was a part of such playtest also revealed that there was the plan to have 6 total zombies maps throughout the lifecycle of Call of Duty 2025, but whether or not the games scope has changed is unclear.</p>



<p>It’s worth stressing that these playtest events usually have some variations to the details, in order to gain valued feedback and potentially pinpoint the origin of leaks. However, from what we’re been able to determine, this information has been at various different feedback events worldwide over the past 12 months or so, suggesting that the information is almost certainly accurate (but never say never).</p>



<p>Per Insider Gaming’s reporting, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-2-call-of-duty-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty 2025 is set to be a Black Ops 2 sequel</a>. It’s understood that the games campaign follows Harper and Mason as they try to save the world from a new villain following the death of Menendez. </p>

<p>Black Ops 6 players have figured out that you can explore the upcoming Warzone map ‘Avalon’ by using Black Ops 6 spectator mode.</p>



<p>Video footage of people exploring the map have been ongoing since the games launch, which shows the entirety of the upcoming map and what exactly it’s going to entail.</p>



<p>To load the map yourself, simple load up the multiplayer map ‘Lowtown’ in a Black Ops 6 private match and enter spectator mode, from here, you’ll be able to explore the map in full detail in the ‘Codcaster’ role.</p>



<p>You can see a video of the full flythrough below:</p>

Black Ops 6 Accidentally Leaks New Avalon Map?!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OfWzQB1DdIM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>But don’t get your hopes up just yet. Despite the map being already fully complete (and being so for a while now), it isn’t actually the next Warzone map to be released. Earlier this year, we reported that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-verdansk-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verdansk is set to make its triumphant return first</a>, which was a decision made around the same time as the highly popular original Fortnite map made its return and was tremendously successful.</p>



<p>It’s understood that Verdansk is set to make it’s return sometime at the beginning for 2025, with Avalon releasing sometime later in the year depending on Verdansk’s success.</p>

Kotaku's number aligns with an <a href="https://www.dfcint.com/sony-acquires-video-game-studio/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">earlier report</a> saying that ProbablyMonsters — Firewalk's original parent company — raised $200 million in 2021. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Firewalk is signing off one last time.</p><p>Firewalk began with the idea of bringing the joy of multiplayer to a larger audience.

Looking back on the studio's history, the note reflects on being a new startup during the global pandemic, and how Concord only entered full production in 2022. It also talks about building a "new, customized next-generation FPS engine in Unreal 4 -&gt; 5, delivering top-tier gameplay feel, beautiful worlds, and a performant 60fps technical experience on a stable and scalable backend on PS5 and PC to hundreds of thousands of players in our beta."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It all points to Concord being seen as an ambitious project that was expected to attract a large audience. Instead it launched to tepid reviews and low interest, prompting PlayStation to pull the plug within days of release. One estimate suggested it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-estimated-to-have-sold-only-25000-units-heres-why-analysts-think-its-failing">only sold around 25,000 copies</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Midia Research Analyst Rhys Elliott told IGN shortly before Concord was shut down, “Pivoting to live services is high-risk, high-reward venture, and the risk is heightening to levels that might not be worth it for many AAA console/PC publishers that aren’t already active in the space."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Concord is hardly the only expensive live service game to fail to meet expectations, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-troubled-development-revealed-in-new-report">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League facing similar struggles</a>. Live service games are increasingly facing a calcified market dominated by the likes of Fortnite and Call of Duty while costing hundreds of millions dollars to make. Despite that, PlayStation continues to bet big on service games, with Fairgame$ and Marathon among the projects next on the docket.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">PlayStation Studios CEO Hermen Hulst says Sony will learn from its experience with Firewalk Studios. "The PvP first person shooter genre is a competitive space that’s continuously evolving, and unfortunately, we did not hit our targets with this title. We will take the lessons learned from Concord and continue to advance our live service capabilities to deliver future growth in this area."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.

Earlier today, <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/101385/amd-could-have-ton-of-reveals-for-ces-2025-strix-halo-rdna-4-gpus-new-x3d-cpus-and-more/index.html">a Chiphell leaker rumored</a> that AMD would announce its RDNA 4 graphics at CES 2025 in January, alongside its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/1/24211083/what-if-amd-gaming-tablet-but-hugely-more-powerful-plugged-in">leaked Strix Halo</a> and Fire Range gaming notebook parts, its confirmed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/6/24237735/amd-z2-extreme-gaming-handheld-pc-chip">Ryzen Z2 handheld gaming chips</a>, and more.</p><p>AMD expects its gaming revenue to continue to decline this quarter, due in no small part to the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles aging out, and<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/30/24209938/amd-q2-2024-earnings-datacenter-ai-revenue"> it’s not exactly the company’s primary focus these days anyhow</a>. On today’s call, Su pointed out how gaming only accounts for two percent of the company’s revenue, while data center is now well over half of the company’s business. She says that after spending 10 years turning AMD around, her next task is to “make AMD the end-to-end AI leader.”</p><div><p>The company had previously revealed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/9/24240173/amd-udna-gpu-ai-gaming-rdna-cdna-jack-huynh">it’s turning its back on flagship GPUs to chase AI first</a>, so you shouldn’t expect new consumer RDNA 4 parts to compete with Nvidia’s best and priciest GPUs. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In the wake of Anthem, Wilson said a "big shift happened" that saw "BioWare really returning to BioWare-type games; really returning to BioWare's strengths."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"BioWare has rallied around what made BioWare a fan-favorite studio and a fan-favorite brand and the types of games they make – incredibly rich worlds, incredibly nuanced characters, really powerful and compelling stories with comaraderie and friendships and relationships, and decisions that matter in the context of gameplay," Wilson said. "And I think it’s been that return to what made BioWare great and giving the studio time to deliver against what makes BioWare great in the context of the Dragon Age world is what amounts to Dragon Age: The Veilguard."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>BioWare has rallied around what made BioWare a fan-favorite studio and a fan-favorite brand and the types of games they make...</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Wilson's comments come in the context of what has been reported to be a sometimes fraught relationship with EA.

The game is currently headed toward season 23 in early November, and while its player numbers <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1172470/charts/#1y" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">aren't quite at the heights</a> they <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-games-concurrents-rankings">used to be</a>, the hero shooter still seems to be doing all right for itself. Some companies might be thinking right about now as to how they can refresh and replenish that playerbase with a sequel, but EA CEO Andrew Wilson doesn't seem interested.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During today's Q2 earnings call, Wilson stated in answer to an investor question that large live service games such as Apex that reach massive audiences must continue to creatively innovate and update, or they risk losing that coveted top spot. For that reason, he continued, EA recognizes a "need for meaningful systematic innovation that fundamentally changes the way the game plays," and said that this is something the teams are actively working on.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As a follow up, someone else asked him that as the teams are working on that "systematic rethink of Apex," if they're considering doing "a whole studs-up rebuild" on something like an "Apex 2.0", as opposed to incremental change over time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wilson's answer? No. Here's his response in full:</p><blockquote>Typically, what we have seen in the context of live service-driven games at scale is the 'version two' thing has almost never been as successful as the 'version one' thing. And so actually the objective right now is to ensure that we are continuing to support the global playerbase that we have, and deliver them new, innovative, creative content on a season-by-season basis, as well as build these other things, but build them in a way that players do not have to give up the progress that they've made or the investment that they've put into the existing ecosystem. Anytime we cause a global player community to have to choose between the investments they've made to date and future innovation and creativity, that's never a good place to put our community in.</blockquote><blockquote>Our objective will be to continue to innovate in the core experience...and then build additional opportunities for engagement in different modalities of play beyond what the current core mechanic delivers. And we think we can do those two things together, and we don't believe we have to separate the experience in order to do so.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">So, per Wilson, no Apex 2.0 for the foreseeable future, but there is some sort of "systemic innovation" on the horizon that could shake-up Apex Legends in a big way. The good news is that Wilson's comments seem to jive with what the developers want too. Last year, Respawn's game director Steve Ferreira <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/respawn-doesnt-want-to-make-an-apex-legends-2-thats-our-anti-vision/1100-6511276/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told GameSpot</a> that the studio doesn't want to ever put the game in a position where the only option is to shut the whole thing down and launch Apex Legends 2, calling the idea an "anti-vision."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-earnings-the-sims-4-manages-to-adds-15-million-new-players-in-2024-despite-being-more-than-10-years-old">reported a record Q2 today</a>, with $2.08 billion in net bookings, and The Sims 4 gaining 15 million players in 2024.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-sims-4-gained-15m-new-players-in-the-past-year-despite-being-over-a-decade-old.1022742/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4-gained-15m-new-players-in-the-past-year-despite-being-over-a-decade-old<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a> might be getting on a bit, what with having launched over a decade ago now, but that doesn't seem to have dulled interest in the long-running life sim series; EA just announced The Sims 4 has managed to gain over 15m new players this year alone.
</p>
<p>
To put that into perspective, it took The Sims 4 six years to amass 20m players after its launch back in 2014 - a figure that then skyrocketed following EA's decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4-base-game-is-going-permanently-free-starting-in-october">transition the formerly premium title into a free-to-play game</a> in October 2022. That business model shift more than quadrupled The Sims 4's audience, with EA touting 85m players back in May this year, and we now know the past 12 months have brought a total of 15m new players.
</p>
<p>
That most recent figure was revealed as part of EA's <a href="https://s204.q4cdn.com/701424631/files/doc_financials/2025/q2/Q2-FY25-Earnings-Release-FINAL.pdf">second-quarter 2025 financial earnings report</a> ("Increased engagement led to higher-than-expected net bookings for the franchise in
Q2", the publisher noted), and helps provide additional context for its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-5-not-happening-as-ea-moves-beyond-linear-sequential-sims-releases">announcement earlier this year</a> that, despite its age, The Sims 4 will remain "a foundational Sims experience" as the series moves "beyond linear, sequential Sims releases".

<p>
The Sims 4's surge in popularity also explains EA renewed focus on the ten-year-old game, with the publisher having pledged <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4-pledges-more-bug-fixes-more-often-as-it-looks-to-address-years-of-frustrating-technical-issues">more bug fixes more often</a> this May as it looks to address years of 'frustrating' technical issues. That's on top of a range of new in-game initiatives, such as the new live-service style Reaper's Rewards Event, and a continuing avalanche of new DLC.

Next on the expansion list is The Sims 4's extremely promising and wonderfully macabre <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sims-4-gets-embalming-grim-reaping-reincarnation-and-naked-moon-rituals-in-new-life-death-expansion">Life &amp; Death expansion</a>, which releases this Thursday, 31st October. Its launch follows a free base game update last week considerably expanding Sims' ghost-form gameplay (and making it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4-ghostly-update-puts-woohoo-ing-the-grim-reaper-back-on-the-table">possible to bonk Death</a>), and comes ahead of a new series of creator-designed DLC packs.
</p>
<p>
Things have certainly come a long way <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-responds-to-fan-outcry-over-the-sims-4-missing-features">since Swimmingpoolgate</a>.

For example, you can use the standard Xbox controller layout for first-person shooters, then flip to the six-button module for fighting games. We're not sure how helpful the extra two face buttons on the left module would be, but Turtle Beach was smart to move the D-pad into the other slot for fighting games, side-scrollers, and other games that feel more natural with D-pad movement controls.</p><p>Both thumbsticks use Hall Effect anti-drift sensors.</p></div>                      </div><p dir="ltr">While the reversible modules are the Stealth Pivot’s main features, the controller can be customized in other ways, such as adjustable trigger and thumbstick sensitivity, four remappable microswitch buttons, adjustable trigger locks, and digital or analog modes for the D-pad. </p><p dir="ltr">The Stealth Pivot sports some other cool features, including a mini-LED which is used to configure up to five custom control profiles, adjust settings, and even display social notifications or other alerts. It also supports rumble and various Turtle Beach audio enhancement features like EQ presets, chat volume mixing, and more. It can connect via 2.4GHz wireless, Bluetooth 5.2, or wired USB to Xbox consoles, PC, or mobile. In wireless mode, it offers up to 20 hours of battery life and has quick charging via USB-C. </p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4392241-unnamed%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4392241" data-ratio="0.41" data-width="1200" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4392241-unnamed%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4392241"></a><figcaption>Stealth Pivot's rotating modules</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4392241-unnamed%281%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Turtle Beach brought over many of the Stealth Pivot's features from the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/High-Performance-Wireless-Controller-Licensed-Xbox-X/dp/B0CJVQFZ1S?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Stealth Ultra</a>, which released last holiday for $200.

            <p>
If relentlessly amassing sticks and bopping rocks is starting to feel a little stale in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/disney-dreamlight-valley">Disney Dreamlight Valley</a>, there's something new on the horizon. Developer Gameloft has unveiled The Storybook Vale, a second paid expansion for the village-life sim, that'll whisk players to a world of Greek myths, Scottish folktales, and more when it launches on 20th November.
</p>
<p>
The Storybook Vale, which follows on from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disney-dreamlight-valleys-massive-a-rift-in-time-expansion-detailed">last year's A Rift in Time expansion</a>, introduces another world for Dreamlight Valley players to explore in the form of the titular Vale. Described as "the place in your heart where all your most treasured stories live", it's said to have previously hung in the sky over Dreamlight Valley - but was stolen away by Maleficent and Hades, eventually falling into disarray as the pair began to bicker. And that's where players come in, embarking on a quest for the Lorekeeper - an enchanted book who holds the world together - to retrieve her scattered pages and restore peace.
</p>
<p>
And all this takes place across The Storybook Vale's three new biomes. There's The Bind, inspired by "dark academia" and the "cool yet cosy ambience of an autumnal forest"; Mythtopia, themed around "Greco-Roman culture and ancient myths" (and it even gets its own Mount Olympus), plus Everafter, a blend of "dark enchanted mushroom forest and windswept moorlands" inspired by "Scottish and Scandinavian folklore".

<p>
The Storybook Vale will be released over two parts, the first arriving on 20th November and the second due next summer. Part one introduces three new villagers - Brave's Merida, Hercules' Hades, and Tangled's Flynn (who'll be able to reunite with Rapunzel if players happen to have last year's A Rift in Time expansion) - alongside new collectibles, tools, resources, and "dozens" of new recipes. Players can catch koi fish, for instance, or gather ambrosia, and there are new animal companions in the form of owls, mini dragons, and mini winged horses.
</p><p>
Additionally, the expansion introduces Trials, special quests inspired by fairy tales and myths that players will need to unscramble using their old and new tools. One of those new tools is the Royal Net, used to capture the Lorekeeper's scattered pages, come to life as ancient origami creatures known as Snippets, which can then be assembled into jigsaw-like tapestries and hung in in-game homes. And that's just Part One, with next year's Part Two, The Unwritten Realms, seeing players "venture into a strange world beneath the Storybook Vale [to] solve the mystery of the missing princess", alongside Maleficent and a currently unannounced second character. 
</p>
<p>
Both parts of The Storybook Vale are included in Disney Dreamlight Valley's second expansion pass, which releases on 20th November. Purchases also include 5,000 Moonstones - as the game's premium currency is known - and there's a Magical Edition, featuring 10,000 Moonstones, the Autumn Manor House stye, Storybook Vale dress and ensemble, plus Baby Pegasus companion and house. Alternatively, the Storybook Bundle includes the base game, new expansion, and 13,000 Moonstones, while the Enchanted Edition gathers together the base game, both expansions, 18,000 Moonstones, plus "exclusive rewards". Gameloft hasn't announced prices for any of these at the time of writing, but last year's A Rift in Time expansion cost £24.99 so expect things to start from there.

<p>
Alongside all <em>that</em>, Gameloft has shared a look ahead at the base game's next series of free updates, starting with Sew Delightful on 4th December. This brings Sally from A Nightmare Before Christmas to the Valley, complete with the usual introductory quest and Friendship rewards. That's alongside a new premium Star Path, which includes ice-themed furniture and other rewards. Sew Delightful also promises a number of new features, including floating islands. These act as extra building spaces, themed after existing base game biomes, that players can expand to if they need more room (object limits are independent from other locations) with each island being comparable to their Valley counterparts. Plaza Island, Forest Island, Sunlit Island, and Frosted Island as set to launch in December with more to follow. 
</p><p>
Additionally, builders feeling limited by the game's current four points of rotation will soon see that increased to 16, opening up new decorating possibilities. Gameloft says the enhanced placement system applies to furniture, buildings, landscaping items, resources, and even dropped items like prepared dishes, with support for fences and paths coming at a later date. 
</p>
<p>
But that's still not quite everything announced during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJJ6OqlJig0">Gameloft's latest Disney Dreamlight Valley stream</a>. The developer also shared a roadmap covering its three free updates for the first half of 2025. Early 2025, for instance, will let players explore "a whole new world and revel on a magical adventure" - the accompanying picture teasing the arrival of Aladdin and Jasmine - while Spring 2025 promises a "land of wonder", its image of the Cheshire Cat unquestionably marking the arrival of Alice's Adventures. And finally, Summer 2025 will give players the opportunity to "solve an ancient mystery and discover who is waiting inside Skull Rock." And given Skull Rock's origins and the red feather buried in the sand in Gameloft's tease, this should finally be the moment Disney Dreamlight Valley welcomes Peter Pan and friends.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-impressions<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I've played a lot of Call of Duty this year, so when I picked up Black Ops 6 over the weekend, I was coming in hot.</p><p>There's a lot you can say, and there's a lot that's been said, about this game's politics. And other <em>Black Ops</em> games’ politics. And other <em>Call of Duty</em> games’ politics. <em>Black Ops 6</em> has WMDs and Saddam; you're up to your eyeballs in the establishment of the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_world_order_(politics)#:~:text=Bush's%20speech%20of%20September,South%20economic%2C%20and%20security%20problems." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> New World Order</a>; you spend a lot of time, as is pretty standard in a <em>Call of Duty</em> game, mowing down dudes for whom English is not their first language at home. If that kind of stuff makes you want to bail on it, or not touch it at all, I get that, it's a lot!</p><figure></figure><p>As a white Western man, I have historically loved this shit, it's my video game comfort food, even as I appreciate the comfort zones at play and, as an Australian, give zero fucks about all the star-spangled HOO-RAHs. So when I say I love this shit, I don't mean the politics, which I let wash over my back like water off a duck, but everything <em>around </em>them. <em>Call of Duty</em> fills the same spot in my heart that Schwarzenegger movies (many also featuring pretty crummy politics!) used to, in that they are interactive versions of big, dumb, explosive action movies, something to switch off to, but which here also happen to have some of the best moment-to-moment rhythm in video games.</p><p>Sadly, the last few games haven't done it for me, but with<em> Black Ops 6, </em>the <em>Call of Duty</em> singleplayer campaign is back, baby. I'm not saying it's good, even by this series' dire standards over the last few years. But it does at least clear the low bar set by the <em>Modern Warfare </em>reboots, which given the state of their singleplayer campaigns is nothing short of extraordinary.</p><p>The contempt shown towards the last two <em>Modern Warfare</em> singleplayer campaigns (the third especially) pointed towards a future where <em>Call of Duty</em> simply gave up and abandoned them altogether.<a href="https://aftermath.site/call-duty-aaa-graphics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> The high cost of meeting (self-imposed) visual standards</a>, the priority given to the series' multiple multiplayer modes and some dismal story-telling doomed them from the start, a real shame considering the last campaign before that--2021's <em>Vanguard</em>--was pretty good!</p><figure></figure><p><em>Black Ops 6</em> isn't a return to the heights of the original <em>Modern Warfare</em> games, but it is at least a reversal out of the bin. It's a full, proper singleplayer campaign, complete with a fleshed-out cast, scripted missions, a plot, the works. None of it made any sense to me, of course, but I found it was more fun not knowing who anyone was or what they were doing, because this allowed me to write everything off--particularly an attempt at looping the zombies mode into the narrative--as a fever dream and just concentrate on the shooting.</p><p>I had fun blasting my way through a very well-animated, Tom Clancy-ass story about political intrigue and biological warfare. The series' gunplay, as always, is crisp, almost tangible. Pulling up your iron sights, pulling the trigger, seeing something fall down, this is where <em>Call of Duty </em>has always excelled, and <em>Black Ops 6</em> is no different. There's something about the speed it all takes place at, the sound, the animation–nobody does it better.</p><p>Panning back out from those iron sights, I appreciated some non-shooty bits of <em>Black Ops 6</em> as well. There's loads of interesting espionage gear to play with, an adventure game sequence set at a Bill Clinton fundraiser, a casino heist and some surprisingly enjoyable stealth missions (enjoyable because the second you're inevitably discovered it just turns into a regular <em>Call of Duty</em> mission, guns blazing). There are also some bigger missions set on the game's bigger multiplayer maps, where you're given multiple objectives to complete and the freedom to tackle it all at will. One plays out like a miniature <em>Far Cry</em>, another like a homage to <em>Control</em>, there’s even a Diet <em>Hitman </em>in there, and all are a nice little diversion from the more linear, traditional missions.</p><figure></figure><p>The tributes to other games don't end once you're between stages, either. For reasons that are never quite adequately explained, you and your team of wanted international mercenaries are holed up in a house in Bulgaria where you...can spend cash you pick up during actual levels to take part in what's essentially a home improvement minigame. You know, mercs for hire, on the run, taking time out to sink some brews and renovate. Normal <em>Call of Duty</em> stuff. It's extremely stupid, but also charming in its own way; getting to see these gruff killers cooking a stew is a vulnerable, personal touch I wish the series gave us more of.</p><p><em>Black Ops 6</em>'s campaign is not a great shooter. Not by general standards, not even by the franchise's own standards, which to be fair are, at their peaks, pretty close to some of the best ever made. But you know what, I don't really mind. It's just nice to have a <em>Call of Duty</em> singleplayer game around that's not terrible. Comfort food doesn't need Michelin stars. And with my brain switched off and my finger on the trigger, <em>Black Ops 6</em> sees <em>Call of Duty</em> once again hitting the spot.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Some are worried that it simply means Bandai Namco is planning to dole out each new style over months and years through a relentless drip-feed of microtransaction add-ons as it’s done with <em>Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2</em>. <em>Sparking</em>&nbsp;<em>Zero </em>seems destined to be the ultimate <em>DBZ</em> sim, but no <em>DBZ</em> sim is complete without more robust dress-up options. </p><p>Enter modders who are at least bringing some of these costume changes to the PC version of the game. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://gamebanana.com/mods/551869&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gamebanana.com/mods/551869" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Piccolo Postboy outfit</a></span> was added to the GameBanana mod repository yesterday.

Of course, there are plenty of other outfits still missing, like Goku and Vegeta’s “SAB” winter jackets from the <em>Dragon Ball Super: Broly </em>movie and Gohan’s Kai outfit from the Buu Saga. </p><p>I can forgive some of these missing from the game at launch, but too many of the best alternate costumes seem MIA at the moment. I’m not above paying for them all if they get rolled out later. It would have felt more satisfying if they were all late-game unlockables, though. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

If you're a live service game, you're lucky if you can keep your returning and new player numbers steady long-term. But The Sims 4 is currently dealing with the exact opposite of that trend: ten years after launch, it just brought in over 15 million new players in a year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from EA's Q2 earnings, which released today. The 15 million figure is fairly shocking for a ten-year-old game, even given that the base game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-sims-4-base-game-will-soon-become-totally-free">has been free-to-play since 2022</a>. For some perspective, it took The Sims 4 four years after launch to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2020/02/04/how-sims-navigated-20-years-change-become-one-most-successful-franchises-ever/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reach 20 million unique players</a> (this was back when it was a premium game). When it first went free-to-play, it gained a whopping 31 million new players out of the gate, and reached a total of 85 million as of May 2024. It's not clear how exactly the 15 million gained lines up with the last count of 85 million to give us a new, current total, but that's still a heck of a lot of people.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/03/21/sims4010829141280jpg-ed62e1-160w-1710983188147.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Sims 4 is still going strong more than 10 years after its original release. Image source: EA.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It helps that the game has improved significantly since its initial launch, which got a lukewarm reception for being rather thin on expected features at the time. In our re-review of The Sims 4 this year, we noted that while it's starting to feel its age, "a strong community and frequent updates have kept it at the top of the life simulator genre." And indeed, a regular cadence of expansion packs and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-sims-4-promises-more-bug-fixes-performance-improvements-in-response-to-community-frustration">ongoing commitment to technical and community support</a> have helped it grow massively since its shift to free-to-play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, it seems there's no clear upcoming successor to replace The Sims 4 and slow this growth down. EA has clarified it has <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/the-sims-5-update-multiplayer-creator-content-ea-interview-1236142010/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">no plans for The Sims 5</a> at this time, and while its mysterious Project Rene is holding <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-sims-project-rene-will-get-another-small-invite-only-playtest-this-fall">another invite-only playtest this fall</a>, it still seems to be quite a ways off...and perhaps <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-sims-community-is-blowing-up-amid-project-rene-leaks-suggesting-big-changes-are-in-store">undergoing some pretty big changes</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA also reported that the Madden and College Football franchises combined are on track to cross $1 billion in net bookings for the fiscal year ending March of 2025. For the quarter, EA reported $2.08 billion in net bookings, setting a new Q2 record, and $2.02 billion in net revenue. The company's shared its outlook for the full year to be between $7.4 billion and $7.7 billion in net revenue, while its revenue outlook for Q3 is between $1.87 billion and $2.02 billion.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best PC Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Contributing to that outlook is Dragon Age: The Veilguard, which launches at the end of this week and which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">we gave a 9/10</a>, saying it "refreshes and reinvigorates this storied series with enjoyable action combat, a fantastic cast of companions, and moving character writing."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA expects to release one more game this year after Dragon Age, but it hasn't announced it yet. Per its earnings slides, this is an "unannounced partner title." Though there's no way of knowing what this will be, it's possible this will be the project <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/it-takes-two-crosses-20-million-copies-sold-as-creator-teases-next-project">recently teased by Hazelight Studios' Josef Fares</a>, a "new IP" under the EA Originals label that we only know to be an "all-new co-op adventure."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

The paranormal thriller is more in the vein of <em>X-Files</em> than a conventional horror story, with creepy oddities folded into the fabric of its underground office building haunted by ghostly demons with guns. If you like spooky vibes and a good mystery, but also feeling empowered, than <em>Control</em> is the perfect antidote to gorier gaming adventures. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="bf401d057f2c90dbb72d22b679781825" data-recommend-id="image://bf401d057f2c90dbb72d22b679781825" data-format="png" data-width="2000" data-height="1125" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A guy and a young girl look confused" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A guy and a young girl look confused" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bf401d057f2c90dbb72d22b679781825" data-recommend-id="image://bf401d057f2c90dbb72d22b679781825" data-format="png" data-width="2000" data-height="1125" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A guy and a young girl look confused" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>The Last of Us</em> is prestige survival horror at its most cinematic and playable.

                <p>For anyone who has ever watched an Indiana Jones movie, there's no question about where the title character stands on Nazis. He's been punching them in the face ever since Raiders of the Lost Ark hit theaters in 1981. Nazis have also been recurring villains in two of the four films that followed. But Bethesda's upcoming game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-release-date-set-ps5-version-confirmed/1100-6525933/" data-ref-id="1100-6525933">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, will further emphasis the franchise's anti-Nazi stance with an in-game statement.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-includes-warning-denouncing-nazis/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Video Games Chronicle</a>, The Great Circle's developer, MachineGames, added the following disclaimer: "The story and contents of this game are not intended to and should not be construed in any way to condone, glorify, or endorse the beliefs, ideologies, events, actions, persons, or behavior of the Nazi and fascist regimes, nor any other regimes or to trivialize any war crimes, genocide, and other crimes against humanity."</p><p>This statement comes amidst <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/germanys-scholz-says-dark-neo-nazi-networks-are-rise-2024-01-26/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a resurgence in neo-Nazi activity</a>, in both Europe and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/09/27/neonazis-ai-hitler-videos/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in America</a>. The Indiana Jones movies have never really dealt with the weightier real-world implications of the Nazi atrocities, and the game will follow in those footsteps with some history mixed with fantasy elements. But rest assured, Dr. Jones will be dealing with the game's Nazis in the same way he's always done for the last 43 years.</p><p>GameSpot's Kurt Indovina recently shared <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-hands-on-preview/1100-6527431/" data-ref-id="1100-6527431">his early hands-on experience with Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, which he favorably compared to Dishonored. He also said that the game "understands more than just the aesthetic of Indiana Jones, but also what it means to be Indiana Jones. The result is a promising prospect not just for fans of the franchise, but the adventure genre as a whole."</p><p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will hit Xbox Series X|S and PC on December 9. A PlayStation 5 port will follow in 2025.</p>

Work together with the Ghost Huntin' Community to collect Blood Points and earn brand-new rewards. Be warned, during the Blood Moon, ghosts will be empowered and stronger than ever."</p><p dir="ltr">The blog post noted that accessing Blood Moon (and all "future seasonal or temporary events") will require an online connection, even when playing solo. This is due to the fact that temporary in-game events bring with them "a lot of technical changes," so keeping players online when interacting with live/seasonal events "will allow [Kinetic Games] to keep track of the event progress and make live changes on our cloud servers, if needed."</p><p dir="ltr">The Crimson Eye update also adds an Event Board to the Warehouse. The Event Board features "leaflets for current in-game events and challenges," which allow players to individually track their progress for each event they're taking part in. The game's photo cork board has been moved to the truck parked inside the Warehouse to make room for the Event Board, which is located between the truck and the Warehouse's door. The Event Board currently features two new challenges: Ranger Challenge and Sunny Meadows Survival.</p><p dir="ltr">Other improvements include a physics upgrade that makes doors <em>much</em> less frustrating. Moving doors can no longer push players out of the way (great for those moments when one's teammates can't seem to decide if they're coming or going), and doors can no longer be pulled off their hinges. Additionally, players can no longer be pushed through walls or other solid objects, and players suffering low frame rates can finally cross "accidentally clipping through the floor of Point Hope" off their list of totally rational fears, as the floor has evidently been reinforced with low-FPS-proof wood.</p><p>Phasmophobia's Crimson Eye update patch notes are listed in full below.

Sony purchased the former in 2023 and the latter in 2022. Now they’re both victims of what has proven to be a tumultuous year for the purveyor of all things PlayStation, which also <a href="https://aftermath.site/bungie-layoffs-destiny" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">laid off 17 percent of Bungie</a> and, of course, took <em>Concord </em>offline after the game <a href="https://aftermath.site/sony-concord-shutdown-offline-refund-ps5-pc-live-service" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crashed and burned</a> at launch after a <a href="https://x.com/ethangach/status/1851326669513953344" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lengthy, expensive development cycle</a> resulted in a game that was competently made but felt immediately dated.</p><p>"We have spent considerable time these past few months exploring all our options.

		<p>Following its aborted launch in early September, Sony has decided to permanently shut down <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/concord">Concord</a> and also close down developer Firewalk Studios. They are also closing mobile developer Neon Koi as they reevaluate the approach to mobile gaming, cancelling the studio’s “mobile action game”.</p>
<p>Taking the unusual step of self-publishing an internal email about the business decisions – to be fair, they would have just leaked, so this is far neater –&nbsp;CEO of Studio Business Group, Hermen Hulst said:</p>


<p>“After much thought, we have determined the best path forward is to permanently sunset [Concord] and close the studio.   I want to thank all of Firewalk for their craftsmanship, creative spirit and dedication.</p>
<p>“The PvP first person shooter genre is a competitive space that’s continuously evolving, and unfortunately, we did not hit our targets with this title. We will take the lessons learned from Concord and continue to advance our live service capabilities to deliver future growth in this area.</p>
<p>“I know none of this is easy news to hear, particularly with colleagues and friends departing SIE.&nbsp; Both decisions were given serious thought, and ultimately, we feel they are the right ones to strengthen the organization.&nbsp; Neon Koi and Firewalk were home to many talented individuals, and we will work to find placement for some of those impacted within our global community of studios where possible.”</p>

<p><a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/an-update-from-playstation-studios/">You can read the full statement here.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/FirewalkStudios/status/1851327043956592781?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1851327043956592781%7Ctwgr%5Eceedb39da2ddf519e667819c6b45a3e65245ea62%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F10%2F29%2F24282900%2Fsony-shutting-down-concord-firewalk-studios">Firewalk also had a public farewell</a>, taking to Twitter to tell the tale of the studio and game’s development. In it they reveal that following the studio’s founding in 2018, they didn’t really grow and enter full production on the game until 2022 – a two year turnaround is actually fairly respectable from that point. They also underwent the always tricky process of integrating following their acquisition by Sony.</p>
<p>“We took some risks along the way,” they wrote, “marrying aspects of card battlers and fighting games with first-person-shooters – and although some of these and other aspects of the IP didn’t land as we hoped, the idea of putting new things into the world is critical to pushing the medium forward. The talent at Firewalk and the level of individual craft is truly world-class, and teams within Sony Interactive Entertainment and across the industry will be fortunate to work with them. Please reach out to Recruiting at PlayStation for inquiries, and thank you to all the very many teams, partners and fans who supported us along the way.”</p>
<p>We certainly share that sentiment for both Firewalk and Neon Koi, with the last couple of years making for bleak reading across the game’s industry. Hopefully people can land on their feet as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Concord will go down as one of the biggest entertainment flops of all time, the game having reportedly cost hundreds of million of dollars to produce – including Sony’s acquisition of Firewalk mid-development. Despite aspirations to rival the likes of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/overwatch-2">Overwatch</a> or <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/valorant">Valorant</a>, the game barely got out of the starting blocks upon its launch in August. With a £35 price tag instead of being free-to-play, it drew a concurrent player count that <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2443720/charts/">maxed out at 697 players on Steam</a> and barely scraped three figures on PC after the first couple of days.</p>
<p>After a couple weeks, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/03/concord-is-shutting-down-this-week-refunds-being-issued-while-they-explore-options/">Sony took the decision to pull the game from sale</a>, suspend online service, and issue refunds to all players, while Firewalk was given time to “explore options” for a potential return. This was widely expected to be a pivot to free-to-play or a subscriber tie in for PlayStation Plus, but Sony has decided that writing the game off (and potential tax benefits from doing so) is the better path financially.</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/30/concord-review-a-fun-frenetic-hero-shooter/">Concord review</a> we scored it an 8/10 and were admittedly saddened to see the axe fall so soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-shuts-down-two-studios-including-concord-creator<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, Sony announced they are shutting down two of the studios that they have acquired over the last few years.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/an-update-from-playstation-studios/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="An Update from PlayStation Studios  ">email</a> that was originally distributed internally to Sony owned companies, Hermen Hulst (the CEO of the Sony Studio business group) shared that they had decided to shut down Neon Koi, and Firewalk Studios. Both of these studios were acquired by Sony over the last few years, with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-studios-mobile-announced-alongside-new-acquisition" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" PlayStation Studios Mobile Announced Alongside New Acquisition">Neon Koi</a> (then going by Savage Games) acquired in 2022, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-acquiring-firewalk-studios-to-help-grow-live-services" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" Sony Acquiring Firewalk Studios to Help Grow Live Services">Firewalk Studios </a>being acquired in 2023.</p>

<p>Firewalk Studios acquisition was part of a push towards live service games, with the company working to create <em>Concord</em>, which released this year to dismal reception. Infamously, <em>Concord</em>'s reception was so bad that within weeks <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" Concord Shutting Down, Sony Offering Full Refunds">Sony was offering refunds</a> to everyone for the game, and taking it off shelves while they pondered what to do. The decision seems to be to shutter the doors on <em>Concord</em>, and the people who made it completely.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The PvP first person shooter genre is a competitive space that’s continuously evolving, and unfortunately, we did not hit our targets with this title. We will take the lessons learned from <em>Concord </em>and continue to advance our live service capabilities to deliver future growth in this area. - Herman Hulst</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While Hulst's letter mentions taking lessons from <em>Concord</em>, it is notably far from PlayStation's first issue with the attempted push towards live service. There's been a variety of issues with Bungie leading to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-layoffs-200-employees" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" Bungie Lays Off Over 200 Staff as Part of &quot;New Path&quot;">repeated layoffs</a> including only a few months ago, and them reducing the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-revised-its-live-service-ganes-plans-with-only-6-games-coming-by-fy-2025" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" PlayStation Revised Plans for Live Service Games With Only 6 Titles Coming by FY 2025">number of live service games </a>that they aim to release in the next while.</p>

<p>Firewalk Studios <a href="https://x.com/FirewalkStudios/status/1851327043956592781" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Firewalk Studios Statement">released a statement </a>on the social media outlet formerly known as Twitter about the closure, saying in part,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We took some risks along the way – marrying aspects of card battlers and fighting games with first-person-shooters – and although some of these and other aspects of the IP didn’t land as we hoped, the idea of putting new things into the world is critical to pushing the medium forward.</p>

<p>The talent at Firewalk and the level of individual craft is truly world-class, and teams within Sony Interactive Entertainment and across the industry will be fortunate to work with them.&nbsp; Please reach out to Recruiting at PlayStation for inquiries, and thank you to all the very many teams, partners and fans who supported us along the way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Neon Koi's acquisition was aimed at helping grow their mobile games business, an area that the company has been struggling to break into for a long time now. Consistently outshined by the Sony Music division in mobile games, which famously publishes <em>Fate/Grand Order</em> and set up it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonys-new-publishing-label-unties-is-publishing-pc-and-switch-games" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" Sony's New Publishing Label Unties is Publishing PC And Switch Games">own publishing label</a> called Unties. Meanwhile, Sony Interactive Entertainment had issues with Forwardworks, and with the shutting down of Neon Koi, it seems that the PlayStation Studios Mobile effort is off to similar issues. Sadly, Neon Koi never got to ship a game either under it's original name or rebranding.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While mobile remains a priority growth area for the Studio Business, we are in the very early stage of our mobile efforts.&nbsp; To achieve success in this area we need to concentrate on titles that are in-line with PlayStation Studios’ pedigree and have the potential to reach more players globally.&nbsp; - Herman Hulst</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even while Sony has sold <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-sales-pass-548-milion-units-marvels-spider-man-2-has-sold-10-million-copies" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" PS5 Sales Pass 54.7 Milion Units, Marvel's Spider-Man 2 Has Sold 10 Million Copies">record numbers of games</a>, we are seeing them continue a disturbing trend of video game layoffs. By May we were already <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-10k-layoffs" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" This Week in Gaming Business - 10k Layoffs So Far This Year">over 10k layoffs</a>, and the hits have only kept coming. Following the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" Microsoft Shuts Down Redfall and Hi-Fi Rush Creators">earlier shutdowns by Microsoft</a> of Arkane Austin, and Tango Gameworks (among others), it serves as a reminder that an acquisition doesn't mean the team is safe.</p>
