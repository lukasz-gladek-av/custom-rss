<p>Fully compatible with Switch and Switch 2</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Accessory manufacturers GameSir and Hyperkin have joined forces to produce a fully modular controller that's compatible with the Switch and Switch 2: the <strong>GameSir x Hyperkin X5 Alteron</strong>.</p>
<p>Ignoring the terrible name for a moment, this thing actually looks pretty neat. Utilising an extendable telescopic arm design, you can clip it onto your Switch, Switch 2, iPhone, iPad, or Android devices for instant handheld play. It also comes with Bluetooth technology to allow for PC gaming, if you wish.</p>
<p>The biggest draw, however, is the modular design. You can swap out the front modules to completely customise your controller's layout, with options ranging from a fight pad design to faithful (ish) recreations of the GameCube and N64 controllers.</p>
<p>It also comes with a host of modern features that you'd come to expect from controllers these days, including triggers that can swap between tactile, micro-switch functionality to full Hall Effect analogue functionality. Similarly, the capacitive sticks come with the ability to alter their height to ensure maximum comfort for each individual player.</p>
<p>It all sounds lovely on paper, but we do wonder if this 'Jack of all Trades' approach will work out for Gamesir and Hyperkin. CES 2026 attendees can get an in-person view of an early model of the X5 Alteron, but we'll have to wait and see if this thing can be a legitimate contender in a world jam-packed with third-party controllers.</p>

<p>There's no word on when the X5 Alteron will launch, but we'll keep you posted as soon as we hear more.</p>

Titles that have assets, or made use of generative AI during development, often don't disclose their use even if the end product doesn't contain any of those assets.&nbsp;</p><p>When we decided to examine <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/bestofyear/2025" title="Steam Top New Sellers 2025" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Valve’s list of the top 100 selling new releases</a> in 2025, we found 18 of the top 100 made use of Generative AI, with less than 50% of them disclosing it.</p><p>Below we'll go through the games, broken up by their disclosure, or lack thereof.

            <guid>1399165</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>StarRupture has officially launched into early access, with the Creepy Jar title putting players on a hostile planet tasked with survival, and controller support is a feature players have raised questions about.</p>



<p>Early access to StarRupture launched on January 7, giving players the first opportunity to dive into the game, but there’s still a lot to come in development before the full release.</p>



<p>If you want to know all the details on the status of controller support in StarRupture, Insider Gaming has all the details.</p>







<h2 id="h-does-starrupture-have-controller-support">Does StarRupture Have Controller Support?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Not yet. Image via Creepy Jar</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, StarRupture does not include controller support following the launch of early access on January 6, with only mouse and keyboard support.</strong></p>



<p>While it is possible to map out controller inputs using Steam, the process can be complicated if you don’t know what you’re doing, and there’s a chance that you will miss some crucial inputs, particularly for features that might not be immediately clear at launch.</p>



<p>Steam does provide the option to download controller input profiles created by other players, so it’s worth keeping an eye on the Reddit and Discord pages for any creations.</p>



<p>The door is not closed to controller support entirely, however, as StarRupture launched in an early access stage and development of the title continues.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-starrupture-add-controller-support">Will StarRupture Add Controller Support?</h2>



<p><strong>StarRupture could add official controller support in the future, but there is no guarantee it will be added, and doesn’t seem to be a priority during development.</strong></p>



<p>The early access roadmap overview shared by the developers does not specify plans for controller support, although there are plans for additional accessibility support, including improved keybinds, subtitle options, and adjustable text size.</p>



<p>Controller support’s omission from the early access roadmap could indicate there are no plans to add it until post-launch of the full release, an approach that was seen in a previous release by Creepy Jar, Green Hell.</p>



<p>Initially launched in early access in August 2018, the 1.0 release of Green Hell followed in September 2019, with controller support then added in December of the same year.</p>



<p>No timeline has been stated yet for the duration of early access and the full launch, but it’s clear the addition of controller support could be a way off.</p>

            <p>It's been a while since we last had news on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a> (beyond talk of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-studio-naughty-dog-reportedly-mandated-crunch-to-ready-a-demo-for-intergalactic-the-heretic-profit">more crunch</a>), <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s newest IP, but boss Neil Druckmann has been able to openly talk about other things, such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-three-to-recast-manny">HBO's ongoing The Last of Us show</a>. Next month, however, he'll be found in the open again as he presents former partner Evan Wells with DICE's esteemed Hall of Fame Award.</p>
<p>Via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/neil-druckmann-will-present-former-naughty-dog-partner-evan-wells-with-dices-biggest-award/">VGC</a>, we've learned the PlayStation veterans <a href="https://www.interactive.org/awards/evan_wells_hof_29th_dice_awards.asp">will be meeting again</a> at the Aria Resort in Las Vegas on 12th February, 2026. Those who have been following the renowned studio for decades might remember Wells as one of the key creatives behind the Crash Bandicoot and Jak and Daxter series. This led to him becoming co-president of Naughty Dog in 2004. As the studio transitioned into more cinematic and blockbuster-y titles in its post-Uncharted era, he stuck around overseeing the creation and development of that series and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-last-of-us">The Last of Us</a>. In 2023, he announced his retirement.</p>
<p>Ahead of the DICE 2026 summit, Druckmann took some time to praise Wells' leadership and celebrate what he did to make Naughty Dog one of the industry's most respected companies over many years:</p>
<blockquote>"Naughty Dog was able to create some truly incredible games and leave a lasting mark on the industry because of Evan’s unwavering leadership and the trust he placed in all of us... I know I speak for many across the industry when I congratulate Evan on this well-deserved recognition. It’s a profound honor to present him with this Hall of Fame induction."</blockquote>
<p>In the past, the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences' Lifetime Achievement award has gone to names like PlayStation's Ken Kutaragi (2007), Nintendo legend Satoru Iwata (2015), and Xbox honcho <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> (2022), among many others.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, The Last of Us co-director and ex-Naughty Dog <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/generative-ai-is-a-snake-eating-its-own-tail-says-the-last-of-us-co-director-but-the-term-ai-is-easily-misinterpreted">Bruce Straley is working on the debut game of his new studio Wildflower Interactive</a>: Coven of the Chicken Foot. He's also gone on to explain he left the PlayStation-owned studio after feeling he was "answering the same questions over and over again," which sounds like a nice way to say maybe there's life beyond cinematic action-adventure games. Intergalactic doesn't appear to be substantially altering Naughty Dog's current direction though.</p>

            <p>New games performed really well on Steam last year - notably better than the year before.</p>
<p><a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/who-won-steams-best-of-2025-revenue">Data analysed by GamesDiscoverCo</a> shows that there were more new games (classified as being released this year or the previous year) in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/bestofyear/2025?tab=2">Steam's Top 100 highest-grossing games chart</a> than last year - 31 to 24, respectively - and that games released in 2025 made collectively significantly more money than games released in other years.</p>
<p>Steam categorises games into Platinum, Gold, Silver and Bronze tier in terms of the money made. The Platinum tier does feature Steam's perennial juggernauts <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dota-2">Dota 2</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/counter-strike-two">Counter-Strike 2</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>, but the eight other Platinum games are all newly released this year.</p>
<p>They are: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, Arc Raiders, Marvel Rivals, Battlefield 6, and, surprisingly, drug-pushing game <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuUX7qWQvG8">Schedule 1</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-hit-repo-hides-real-class-and-an-understanding-of-gaming-greats-behind-its-chummy-chaos-and-crude-emojis">co-op horror game REPO</a>. Call of Duty is considered new there courtesy of technical change to using a Call of Duty app.</p>

<p>In the Gold tier, there's Borderlands 4, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Split Fiction, Elden Ring Nightrein, The Elder Scrolls Oblivion remaster, and EA Sports FC 26. In the Silver tier there's Dune: Awakening, Silksong, Civ 7, Inzoi, Delta Force, Dispatch, Assassin's Creed Shadows, Stellar Blade, Peak and Where Winds Meet.</p><p>It's an encouraging result in a market that seems to be dominated by perennial juggernauts. Just yesterday we saw <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstations-top-five-most-played-games-of-2025-are-exactly-the-same-as-2024s">PlayStation data highlight that the most played games in 2025 were exactly the same as in 2024</a> - Fortnite, Call of Duty, Grand Theft Auto 5, Roblox, and Minecraft. And yes, 'most played' isn't the same as 'highest grossing', but the data paints a picture of apparent stagnation all the same - a market dominated by the endless tails of massive live service games.</p>
<p>In reference to the Steam data, GameDiscoverCo's Simon Carless said: "It's more front-loaded for recency than we expected. Why would this be? It's possible that 2025 was just a super-strong year for new games." It's also possible that perennial sellers had heavy discounts so weren't able to take as much money as full-priced games. "It's probably.. a combo of these things?" he reasoned.</p>

<p>Other tidbits from GameDiscoverCo's analysis show Warframe and Dead by Daylight - both games that are more than 10 years old now - staying strong as Gold-tier revenue-makers for the past four years. Elsewhere, Baldur's Gate 3 continues to show remarkable staying power as a Gold-tier game (the previous two years it was Platinum), as does Cyberpunk 2077, which is still Gold-tier five years after release. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-has-sold-a-lot-more-copies-than-you-think-and-faster-than-the-witcher-3">CD Projekt Red announced recently that Cyberpunk 2077 had sold 35 million copies</a>.</p>
<p>Which new games will feature this time next year, I wonder...</p>

            <p>
I'm a bit tantalised by FPS Quest, but I do worry that it has already defanged its most interesting ideas. Developed by Farlight Games Industry, it's a dungeon crawler in which your frame-rate "is your health", with mistakes and damage causing slowness and stuttering. 
</p>
<p>
To regain health/frame-rate, you must do what you do when running any game on a potato PC - fiddle with the settings like you're bargaining with an especially recalcitrant devil. This extends from lowering the quality of wall textures and characters, to plucking out whole pieces of environment. The more you do this, of course, the stranger the world becomes and the harder it is to navigate. The killer line from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3989240/FPS_Quest/">the Steam page</a>: "optimizing is risky". You'll also have to keep a lid on a simulation of your PC's temperature, and there are faux-prototype off-map areas to explore via noclip-style abilities.

</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=294EsqPD-1s" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>


<p>
It's a metafictional melange in the spirit of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-stanley-parable">The Stanley Parable</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pony-island">Pony Island</a>. The developers have woven a story around the 'give me performance or give me death' gimmick that engages some familiar philosophical disputation about authorial intention and reception. 
</p><p>
You are a random player who has installed a weird mod. The mod's developers are one of the factions - they're keen to monetise their creation. They're opposed by OutofBounds, "enemies of monetization and difficulty, guiding you with shortcuts and secrets". Both groups are at odds with the Custodians, "defenders of the original developer's vision, opponents of glitches and cheats". And then there are a couple of in-game AI personalities, the Null Process, "a broken AI that only wants you to stop progressing so it can rest", and the Dungeon Lord, "an overenthusiastic, paternalistic, and clumsily offensive AI who tries to 'help' by removing obstacles". 
</p>
<p>
You'll connect with these nebulous third parties mostly or exclusively through how you play, rather than by way of dialogue or text. There are unlockable "scripts" that seemingly affect your standing with the factions. One of these is a "dynamic bullet time" feature whereby you speed and slow the game using your mousewheel.
</p>
<p>
There is scope for more chinstroking beyond the intrigues detailed on that Steam page. If you literally make a bug a feature, is it still a bug? What counts as a 'real' glitch or technical error in a game that is 'designed to be broken'? What counts as genuinely unfinished in a game that models the unfinished? We end up in this bizarre position of tethering authenticity to the absence of intention. Now, imagine if DICE suddenly applied all these brainy convolutions to the writing of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-weapons-list">Battlefield 6</a>.
</p>
<p>
Again, though, I'm not sure FPS Quest has full confidence in its own concept. The narrative metaphor may prove to be set dressing for a regular fantasy action experience with progression elements, and a novel way of presenting secret areas. The developers already seem disinclined to push it too far, or take it too seriously. Death takes the form of an MS-DOS bluescreen with the text "the game will now close to prevent further humiliation" - more Borderlands than Barthes, for my onions.
</p><p>
The devs also qualify that they're only simulating FPS drops within the simulation, not actually altering your PC frame rate, because "playing at low real FPS is uncomfortable and nauseating. That's why the game simulates a low-FPS world and turns it into gameplay: a fun challenge, just like other games turn unfun or boring real-life tasks into playable mechanics." I understand the caution here, but... I do often like it when games make me feel uncomfortable, and now I know in advance that FPS Quest won't challenge me too much. Anyway, this is out: at some point. Thanks to <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/fps-quest/trailer">PCGN</a> for passing it on.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Amid the debate about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> players who focus on the PvP aspect of the game and little else, the boss of Embark Studios has made the developer’s position clear: this is not a game about killing other players, and it doesn’t want to “foster” that type of gameplay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arc Raiders is a multiplayer extraction adventure in which players scavenge the remnants of a devastated world, but the main threats are Arc’s machines and, as Embark Studios puts it, “the unpredictable choices of fellow survivors.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arc Raiders’ player versus environment versus player gameplay has resulted in a number of viral clips showing how friendly encounters can quickly devolve into a fight to the last. Yes, you can play solo or in parties up to three, working as a team to progress through the game. However, other players are a constant threat. This has sparked a vociferous debate within the community about the etiquette that has formed in-game, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-just-started-i-have-nothing-retired-pro-gamer-goes-viral-for-relentlessly-killing-casual-arc-raiders-players-but-is-it-griefing-or-just-fair-pvp"><u>a retired pro gamer going viral for relentlessly killing casual Arc Raiders players</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Embark recently confirmed that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-dev-confirms-it-recently-added-aggression-based-matchmaking-but-its-not-a-full-science">Arc Raiders does indeed feature ‘aggression-based matchmaking.’</a> This means that if you’re big into PvP, you’ll be matched up with players who are like-minded. Similarly, if you prefer PvE, you’ll be matchmade with players who tend to avoid conflict with other players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But according to Patrick Söderlund, CEO of Embark Studios, the developer won’t add a PvP leaderboard or other systems that promote PvP, because that’s not what Arc Raiders is about.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a href="https://gamesbeat.com/inside-arc-raiders-a-candid-interview-with-game-leaders-patrick-soderlund-and-owen-mahoney-while-playing-live/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a recent interview</u></a> / <a href="https://youtu.be/vY3u7wOmm4w?si=QKpGyvRhpr7r-Cdw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>video playthrough of the game</u></a> with Games Beat, Söderlund explained the studio’s position.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We've had several discussions about Nemesis systems and all types of things,” he said. “I don't know where the team are on them right now. I think one of the beauties of this game is the fact that we don't have those leaderboards and it's not competitive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We don't want to necessarily foster that type of gameplay. The game isn't about shooting other players. You can do that if you want to, but the ethos of the game has never been to go in and shoot players. It's a part that we use to craft tension.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Game of 2025</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Söderlund revealed that Arc Raiders spent quite a bit of time during development not having other players at all. But Embark added other players into the game, supported by subtle signaling so you know players were about, to create this important element of tension.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The game was without other players for a long time,” Söderlund said. “And yes, there were instances where the game was fun and there were areas where it worked quite well. But also the minute you added other players and then use subtle ways of signaling — you don't know how many players are on the server, you don't know how many players have died, you don’t know how many players are around you — but we signal to you that there are other players. You hear them shooting. That's why audio is a very important part of this game. You hear them encountering Arc and other players. You see the raider flares as they go down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“At one point — it was funny — I came back into a playtest and the raider flares were gone. I'm like, ‘Why did you remove those?’ And they're like, ‘Well, well…’ So I just said, ‘Just bring them back.’ They're such an iconic part of this game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And they also signal to other players that action is happening somewhere. It makes it feel populated in an important way. And you also know that there could be a downed raider somewhere. Should I go there? Should I take the risk and go there to see whether I can find something, or have they been brought back to life? There's a tension element in that that's very important.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Söderlund went on to suggest that private game servers are “absolutely something we could consider.” Private servers are something fans have been wondering about ever since Arc Raiders came out last year. Their addition would, theoretically at least, allow those who are big into PvP to perhaps create servers where that’s the focus.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, though, Arc Raiders won’t shake your hand for your player-killing exploits, or give you the chance for online glory through leaderboards. The emphasis here is PvE — with a dash of PvP thrown in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">In the fall of 2025, I had the great pleasure of attending Tokyo Game Show, a trip that also naturally included a few pit stops to meet local developers and see what they were up to. On the very last day of my trip, in the final hours just before I went to the airport, I arrived at what I desperately hoped was the Onion Games office. I was overburdened with two giant suitcases, in a foreign country, and unsure of exactly where it was. As I glanced up at the building where I thought I’d been directed to go, I caught a glimpse through a window of a silly-looking figure plastered on a wall: a man in an asparagus suit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yeah, that was it.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/19/fb-image-1766178908730.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">I lugged up a flight of stairs to a non-descript door where I tentatively knocked, and was shortly after greeted by James Wragg and Yoshiro Kimura. They welcomed me inside, and gracious invited me to sit down at a little round table covered in a red and white checked tablecloth. Kimura offered me some green tea from a large bottle. I was surrounded on all sides by bookcases of manga and a deluge of Onion Games memorabilia, more than I ever imagined existed for such a small studio.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What followed was genuinely one of the most warm and pleasant interviews I’ve ever conducted, but I’m going to need you to buckle up and bear with me for a bit to understand why. Kimura is a true industry veteran, a developer on games such as Romancing Saga 2 and 3, No More Heroes, and Little King’s Story, co-creator of Moon: Remix RPG Adventure, and now-head of Onion Games, which has created a long line of very silly games such as Million Onion Hotel and Black Bird, gained a little bit of fame globally for its Western localization of the classic Moon a few years ago, and just released a little RPG called Stray Children this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Stray Children is a game built upon some very, very specific DNA. To understand it, I really think you need to understand Moon, which originally came out in 1997 for the PlayStation 1, but only in Japan at the time. Moon is a goofy, esoteric RPG (Kimura will refer to it later in the interview as an “oddball” RPG) about a kid who gets sucked into a Dragon Quest-like video game, only to discover that the “hero” of the game is actually murdering innocent monsters. What follows is an upside down adventure where you follow the “hero” around, rescuing the souls of those monsters and doing good deeds to put the world right, raising your “Lv” or “Love” as you go. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Screens  -  Moon -- Remix RPG Adventure</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Moon was a truly strange game both for its time and even now, as I discovered when I played its English localization for Nintendo Switch in 2020. Its characters follow a full seven-day-long Majora’s Mask like time schedule, instead of a soundtrack it has an in-game music player with tracks from various 90s Japanese underground bands, and its puzzles and ending are extremely difficult to sus out, even for a 90s game. It’s so out there, that Onion Games translated and printed the original manual that came with Moon and released it online, so new players wouldn’t be totally lost as to why there was a timer in the top corner of the screen and why they kept collapsing for seemingly no reason.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But strange as it is, I think Moon is truly wonderful, and I’m not the only one who loved it. Toby Fox helped bolster the game’s profile a bit when he cited it as a major inspiration for Undertale, and having played both games it’s extremely easy to see the crossover. Kimura and Fox have since met and talked about their respective games, a friendship that in turn seems to have inspired Kimura to make another RPG, which takes us to Stray Children.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time I conducted this interview, Kimura had just let me play the first, oh, five minutes of the game before its release. In those few minutes, a young boy with a dog-like face is visited at home by an older man, a stranger, who basically convinces him to leave his house at night and follow him to a subway station, through a secret passage, and into a room full of computer monitors. And that’s where we stopped.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Having since played the full game, I know Stray Children is about that boy getting sucked into a video game world, just like in Moon, and what follows is a really incredible subversion of Moon, which was itself a subversion of RPG tropes. While it <em>can </em>stand alone, I guess, so many of Stray Children’s best moments are predicated on knowing Moon, which leads to it being a really niche experience that will probably confuse some people who stumble into it. But it’s the game Kimura wanted to make, without compromise, even in the moments where that lack of compromise became frustrating.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So with that background, here’s my interview with Yoshiro Kimura, conducted over green tea and surrounded by little decals of the asparagus man and cows and various other Onion Games mascots. This was mostly conducted in translation courtesy of Wragg, though there were a few points where Kimura stepped in and gave his answers directly in English. The interview has been very lightly edited for clarity.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yoshiro Kimura:</strong> My name is Yoshiro Kimura, the Japanese game designer. I have been developing games for more than 25 years. If I calculate from when I was 12 years old, I was making a lot of games for myself also. And now I'm the boss of the company called Onion Games and Onion Games is already 10 years old, and I spend time making indie games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>So Stray Children clearly follows from Moon, and I know you've told the story of how you ended up revisiting Moon and bringing it to Switch and bringing it to English and the rest of the world for the first time. But what inspired you to start making Stray Children?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kimura</strong>: I wanted to make an RPG. I was thinking about making an RPG from the day we started Onion Games, but developing an RPG requires a lot of hit points, a lot of experience. And when we started the company up, I did consider doing a Kickstarter to fund it, but I'm not that famous of a game creator, so I didn't think I would get the support. So instead we went the route of making smaller games first, like Million Onion Hotel, Dandy Dungeon, Black Bird. And we gained experience, leveled up to the point where I felt comfortable that we'd be able to, not just myself, but the team would be able to handle an RPG.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So regards to motivation for actually making Stray Children, there are several things that kickstarted the idea in my mind. Obviously one of them is Moon, but anyone who's played Moon would know a sequel to Moon isn't something that can be done. And I really like Moon myself as well, so I spent a long time thinking, "How can I make a game that has the same kind of feel, atmosphere, but without being directly connected to that game?" So once I got to the point where I could envisage the start and the end of this new story, that was when I knew we were ready to begin.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Even just from the first few minutes of Stray Children, it seems like you're exploring some of the same themes: like childhood, disconnection from adults and maybe the nature of what a video game actually is or can be. Is that fair to say?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kimura</strong>: To answer that question, I'm going back to the motivation for making an RPG in the first place. Part of that was wanting to make an RPG, part of it was wanting to make something with the same feeling as Moon. So it goes back to memories of the games I played, my generation played, so the ‘80s, the ‘90s. Back then games that I played had a really strong influence on me. And seeing and hearing about new releases was a really exciting thing back then. That experience that I had in the past from games, I wanted to put that into Stray Children for the player to experience anew.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So for me, those games, they weren't console games so much back then, partly they were, but it was PC as well and some arcade. But if you imagine, back when I was a kid, I was living in the countryside. One day I came across this guy who lived locally and he had a C64 and PC, I don't know, '88, '98, whatever. So I'm seeing games like Ultima, Wizardry, some games on the C64, and it's just amazing seeing... It's so new to me. And also in the arcade I'm seeing Xevious from Namco, Mappy, that kind of stuff. And I loved these games and I wanted to put the feeling that I had back then into the game so the player can experience it through it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>You made Moon, oh my gosh, what, 25... More? Almost 30 years ago?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kimura</strong>: Maybe 30 years ago.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>RPGs have changed and evolved since then, so I'm curious if there's anything you've been playing in the last couple of years that has inspired you or made you think differently?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kimura</strong>: It's a bit of an odd answer I suppose, but first recently, some stuff I've been playing anyway and I guess it has influenced me quite a lot, is I’ve been going through the first five Dragon Quest games again on Famicom and Super Famicom.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>The original versions?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kimura: </strong>The original, very hard one. And I don't know whether it's an inspiration, but I've certainly played recently, Odencat's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1783360/Megs_Monster/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Meg's Monster</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But when I talk about inspirations, I always end up with Undertale. But before I talk about that, I want to make sure that there's no misunderstanding. So I'm quite friendly with Toby Fox and when I answer I'm answering honestly, but I don't want it to seem like I'm trying to ride on the coattails, and don't want the press chasing him for comments.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But there is an element of influence from that and I think... So Toby, he plays my games right after release, sometimes before release. But I always ask him why, why he plays and why's he enjoying them? He said, "Because I like weird, oddball games," and I thought, "Oh, well, that's the same as me." So when I thought about Undertale, Undertale's kind of weird in many ways as well. And so in talking to Toby, because we've got this common interest, I feel relaxed, a sense of reassurance. Security. I feel at ease talking to him.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>One of the things that has fascinated me about Moon and Undertale and Stray Children is it feels like they're part of a larger tradition of weird, oddball games that are all inspired by one another and in conversation with one another. I put the Mother games in there, Contact.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kimura: </strong>Yume Nikki.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yeah. There's a bunch of them that are all playing off some of the same themes. And it's been interesting to see the conversations publicly between you and Toby Fox, where two different generations of game developers are inspiring one another back and forth. And that's a really cool thing to see.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kimura</strong>: It's like we're kind of pen friends almost or diary friends. All these creators.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I think all game creators share this kind of feeling, whether they share it with all other game creators or there's just the oddball game creators and the fighting game creators and the action game creators, but I think everybody's inspiring and inspired by their peers.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>So who all is Onion Games? How big is the team? Is it people who have been with you for a long time? Do you have any newer developers?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kimura</strong>: So from the core development people, there's seven including myself, and we've had some younger people join recently, but they've been with us for three years, so that's the shortest. Then there's people who've been with us from the start of Onion Games, we've been working together about 11 years. And there's one of the programmers was the programmer from Chulip, so that's a long time. But even longer than that, there's a coworker from my Square days, so I've known him for 30 years or so.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>You mentioned earlier you don't use this office anymore. Is everyone remote?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kimura</strong>: So I'm the person most frequently here and one of the younger team members is often here as well. So I work here a lot. And sometimes people will come in, but generally speaking, when we're all together it's when we're drinking.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Are you working with the same composers or any of the same people who did the music for Moon?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kimura</strong>: Yeah, basically it's the same composers. So Thelonious Monkees, which is comprised of [Hirofumi] Taniguchi-san, [Masanori] Adachi-san, and we've got [Keiichi] Sugiyami-san's doing the sound effects, so basically the same.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I interviewed them about how they composed Moon and got all those different artists together to do the Moon discs, the MDs is there anything like that in Stray Children?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kimura</strong>: Not this time, we didn't do anything like that. That was something that we were able to do because of the team makeup of Moon itself. And I didn't think that doing the same thing again with Stray Children would have the same impact. So I wanted to go with just a straight, new composition to the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But we did use that, I forget what it was called in English, but the odd voice, the scrambled voice. The way we did it this time again is we got the fans of Onion Games to send in lots of... We've got fans all around the world, so speaking in their native languages, they sent us lots of voice clips and they all got mixed up and put back in. The Japanese version, I wasn't able to get it to a level that I was happy with. But with the international release, that will all be kind of like a director's cut of the odd voices.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>So I saw just the very beginning of the game, but I've watched the trailers and so I have a little bit of a picture of what I'm in for, but what can you tell me about where this game goes? Especially, it seems like you're encountering people in some sort of... There's battles, but it's not a battle. What can you tell me about what's happening in Stray Children?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kimura</strong>: That's actually the first time, in memory, that somebody's asked me that. And it's such an average and proper... Like a normal question, in a good way, that I haven't had the opportunity to answer. So give me a little time to get the elevator pitch ready.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">[He thinks for a few moments.]</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So it's an RPG, and as you saw with a player being sucked into the world of a video game in RPG, and in that world, as the title Stray Children suggests, there's a kingdom built by children and outside of that kingdom, outside of that land is where the adults, we call them The Olders, live. And you mentioned the battles, the battles... So underground, when you leave the safety of the children's land, there's these creatures living underground and that's where the battles occur. But in the battles, you can fight or you can talk to the enemy, these creatures. And it's completely up to the player how they approach that.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/19/bafkreidc2ar4j6i5oe7cgwwgr3jqyomrkf6xeren25j5iry6d4mgqx2y4a-1766179198923.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Is this a game where the outcomes could be impacted by how you interact with those creatures?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kimura:</strong> That is down to the player and how they feel, how they react to the- So when talking about games, the way I feel about it is, I can tell you about the systems of the game and maybe how they work, but what occurs when you interact with those systems and the game's story, and how the game plays out, I would rather leave that up to the player to discover, to experience for themselves. Because I think that not knowing what you're getting when you go into the game gives a better experience to the player.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Moon's very funny and your other games are very funny. And I think humor is very difficult in video games sometimes, because at times games try very hard to be funny and it comes off as disingenuous. But I don't know, I'm curious how you approach making a game that is cheeky and silly and will make the player laugh? And especially when you have to then localize it because localizing humor is a whole different challenge in and of itself.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kimura</strong>: So, it's a difficult one to answer actually. So I'm not necessarily, when I make games, I'm not looking to manipulate how the player's feeling. I'm not necessarily looking to make them laugh because some of the humor, it will make some people laugh, but for other people it might make them feel almost fear. And then I might make a scene that makes some people feel, "Oh, that's so sad," but other people would think, "That's cruel and horrible." You played the opening, right?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yeah.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kimura</strong>: So it opens with this: The player meets this guy and basically he takes him away somewhere and then the player gets sucked into this game world. It's kind of funny, but at the same time it's also kind of foreboding and the player's getting a sense of anticipation but also, "Look, what is happening here?" And that's what I'm going for, trying to just grasp the player and really draw their interest. And I think that's common to all my games. I'm not necessarily going for a certain feeling every time, just mixing things up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So I get to thinking about what's good, bad, black, white, good versus evil, is there even a clear split? And I think a lot of it comes from the experiences I had and the adults I met when I was a kid and how I interpreted those experiences, those meetings. And so my games, they're based in fantasy worlds, but there's definitely a certain element of my past experiences in them as well. I don’t know quite what those are? I don't know because it's all mixed up inside, but I'm sure some of it is in there. And that's especially true of Stray Children.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>This is a really, really personal game for you, then?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kimura</strong>: Yeah. Yeah, it's personal, but it's also a piece of entertainment. So it is a product at the same time as being a piece of art, I guess.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What am I not asking you about that you wish journalists would ask you?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kimura</strong>: Apart from what type of game is this?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Haha, yes.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kimura</strong>: I don't know, to be honest. And the reason is, when I was at Marvelous Entertainment and I was a producer, if you asked me about this or if you asked me about the game, I would have a prepared answer. I could tell you what the sales points were from a marketing perspective, but I've been working on Stray Children for three years now and I can't say specific points that I like because I like it all so much. When you asked me that question earlier, I couldn't answer straight away, it's because, A, I haven't been asked but also, B, I don't have that clear answer anymore in my head. Not at all. But if you've got any questions, I'm an open book right now for answers.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Stray Children Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I like prompting people I interview like this at the end because sometimes creators have something that's in their head that is preoccupying them or that they're very excited about or that they think about all the time, but it's not always something that's been shown or announced or obvious for someone to ask about. So it's okay if you don't have an answer, but I like asking just in case.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kimura</strong>: Actually, yes, having answered that, now I think I realize what I wanted to say. When we live our lives, there's oftentimes when we want to clarify what is right and what is wrong, have everything black and white. But recently, especially recently, I've been thinking that maybe that's not a good idea, and to have things gray, have that lack of clarity, a lack of a clear dividing line between those two things is a good idea. And I've been trying to, in various ways, have that element part of the game. And I know I play games, I've been making for a long time, I know what the player expects what a normal game should be, the user-friendly experience. Maybe there should be a warning at the beginning, but I should say sorry, just that this game isn't that way and it is my intent to do that as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>A lot of video games over the years have tried to explore morality and as you say, in very black and white terms, where if you make certain decisions, you get a good ending and certain decisions you get a bad ending, and that's how it works. And even Undertale and Moon really worked that way, though I thought Moon's was…well, I got it wrong the first time. But I think now, especially in this oddball game space, there's a hunger to explore that a little more deeply and with more nuance. I'm experiencing that right now playing Deltarune, where I think the right and the wrong is a little less clear.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kimura</strong>: It's pretty refreshing to speak about this. It's there, but I haven't really vocalized these things. I've been making this game for a long time, like three years, so every day it's like my life's energy is being sucked into this thing that I'm making. So at the end of every day I'm really just wiped out. And like you say, it is an odd game, so I need to be able to express in the marketing message from now... When we're going to release the English version, I need to be able to tell people all about it, but I just don't have the energy. I'm like, "This is a bit of a problem."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So up until now, with all the games we've done at Onion Games, once I've finished the game, I shift gears into this marketing mode, but this time I just haven't been able to, so it's a completely new experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Well, I imagine the smaller the game, the more personal it is to the people making it. And I imagine it's very challenging to have to sell what amounts to the contents of your heart.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kimura</strong>: I've got really mixed feelings about it and it's kind of the same feeling about all of my games in some ways, and I think people who like my games would like this, and those that don't, won't. But this time around, the biggest difference is probably... Because the game was on Nintendo Direct, albeit in Japan, a lot more people probably know about it, than past games. So I think probably a lot more people will buy it, but I've been thinking about how some people think of games as a product and when you sell them, the more money you make the better. But I've recently been thinking about Stray Children that my strongest hope is that the people who buy it and play it will really love it. And if that's only a few people, then whatever. I really want it to reach the people that it should reach and the other people, if it doesn't reach them, then-</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It is really a complex series of a mix of emotions, but to repeat what I said, I think that having it reach the people who will like it, will really resonate with, that's what I'm really looking for I think.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Post-Japan release, we've been polishing like crazy and everything is much improved, but at the same time I also realized that however much we were improve it, I can't please all of the people all the time. It's only ever going to please the people it's going to please.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">[Translator pauses here and says, "I don't know how to translate this. Please do your best to make it into a comprehensive whole."] I haven't spoken to... I wouldn't say anybody, or that I haven't spoken to the media, but I'm half-feeling like when you get a bit tipsy and you start- So it's probably not your typical article that you'd write.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Well, I think you're better at selling your game than you think you are.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I turned off the recorder here, but I wanted to anecdotally include one last part of our conversation that occurred before Kimura sent me off with what turned out to be an excellent lunch recommendation, and has stuck with me since. As we were wrapping up, we got into a discussion about how overwhelming and oppressing the world feels nowadays, especially if you’re online or tuned into the news.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kimura shared that in response to this feeling, he tries to focus on small joys. For instance, he says he’s recently discovered at his local convenience store a little apple pie, that only costs a couple hundred yen (a dollar, maybe almost two in USD). While the apple pie is meant for one, he’s figured out a specific way he likes to slice the pie into several pieces, and then he puts just one piece in the oven at home before he eats it so that the edges become golden and crispy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In this way, he makes this very small joy last longer, and it tastes even better. That, he says, is how he’s trying to live his life right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. Got a story tip?

		<p>We’re back with our next batch of games that we are looking forward to in 2026, and you can look at them in two ways. Either they fell just outside the top 20 and failed to break into the upper echelons, or they made it into the rarified air of the top half of our list. It’s a classic glass half empty/full situation, but either way, keep on reading for another eclectic mix of games including horror, action, strategy, and Batman.</p>
<h2>25 – Valor Mortis</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 2026</em></p>
<p>As if warfare of the 18th and 19th centuries wasn’t brutal and dispassionate enough, as columns of men just march headlong into volley and cannon fire, One More Level’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/valor-mortis">Valor Mortis</a> twists it into an even worse situation. William is a soldier resurrected after death, only find himself confronting twisted versions of other soldiers as a plague descends upon Europe.</p>
<p><iframe title="Valor Mortis | Gameplay Trailer - The Crimson Plague" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YjGtfrFmxxM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Valor Mortis is a first person roguelike so expect to die a lot. As resurrections occur, William will learn new abilities and skills that can be utilised to take on twisted versions of soldiers, including historical figures. Those skills include using a variety of melee and ranged weapons, as well as fire to push back against enemies.</p>

<h2>24 – Fire Emblem: Fortune’s Weave</h2>
<p><em>NSW2 – 2026</em></p>
<p>Fire Emblem: Fortune’s Weave was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/12/fire-emblem-fortunes-weave-revealed-for-nintendo-switch-2/">announced back in September</a>, bringing a different tone for Nintendo’s much loved tactical RPG series. What we do know about the game, and it isn’t much as Nintendo keeps details scarce, is that Fire Emblem: Fortune’s Weave will centre around the Heroic Games.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fire Emblem: Fortune’s Weave – Nintendo Direct 9.12.2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j6eNaiftiWE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The tone of this announcement indicates that this game is drawing inspiration from the classic Olympic Games of Ancient Greece along with the Coliseum and other influences of Ancient Rome. Then the name Fortune’s Weave lends itself to the image of the Fates weaving the Threads of Life, again from Greek mythology. We will have to wait to learn more about Fire Emblem: Fortune’s Weave, but it’s sure to be one of the biggest games for Switch 2 this year.</p>
<h2>23 – The Sinking City 2</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 2026</em></p>
<p>Originally aiming for a 2025 release, Frogwares confirmed in October that The Sinking City 2’s release would be pushed to early 2026 with more time being needed. This primarily due to the war in Ukraine, where Frogwares is based, with the studio having to deal with power outages and missile attacks from Russia.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="The Sinking City 2 - Gameplay Reveal" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AtyEOb2IBZQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-sinking-city-2">The Sinking City 2</a> changes up the formula from The Sinking City, changing the game style from a primarily investigative affair to a survival horror experience. The setting is the drowning city of Arkham which is being consumed by the waves, and you can explore its crumbling mansions and hospitals on foot and by boat. Horrors lurk in all parts of Arkham and players are going to have to try to deal with them with scant resources and a limited inventory.</p>
<h2>22 – LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, NSW2, PC – 29th May 2026</em></p>
<p>Arkham is likely to be a significant part of our next game on the list too, but any horrors here won’t scare our protagonist so easily. LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight is going to be the biggest LEGO Batman game both in scope and depth. This is a celebration of all things Batman from the very beginning to his most modern iterations, with a Gotham City that moves with the times and is open to exploration however you see fit.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="LEGO® Batman™: Legacy of the Dark Knight - Official Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j5ha2VwHJCw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/12/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-gets-a-new-trailer-stuffed-with-villains-and-heroes/">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</a> draws from a history of Batman comics, shows, and movies to celebrate Batman, the Bat-family, and the villains that have all become iconic characters in their own right. The game itself will move through different generations, with key moments from the different eras providing a foundation for the game’s story. The story is not going to be the sole focus, with the open world Gotham City providing plenty of opportunities for Batman to stop criminals.</p>
<h2>21 – Stranger Than Heaven</h2>
<p><em>TBA – TBA</em></p>
<p>Originally going by its codename Project Century in 2024, it was back in June <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/07/rggs-project-century-revealed-as-stranger-than-heaven/">we got a new look at Stranger Than Heaven</a>, one of the big new games from Yakuza/Like A Dragon’s RGG Studio. Again details are still rather scarce about the gameplay we can expect from Stranger Than Fiction, but the trailer really sets a stylish tone.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="STRANGER THAN HEAVEN - Title Reveal Teaser Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5L3XVVzsmHE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>What we do know about Stranger Than Heaven is that it will follow the story of Mako Daito, and it will be set across different time periods. It seems things will begin in 1915, but 1929 and 1943 have been confirmed as the other years in which the game will take place. The location will be the city of Osaka too. Hopefully we will find out more about Stranger Than Heaven soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Following the earlier confirmation that Lara Croft <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-tv-crystal-dynamics-amazon-mgm-sophie-turner-lara-croft-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will be played by <strong>Sophie Turner</strong></a> (Sansa Stark in <strong>Game of Thrones</strong>, Jean Grey in <strong>X-Men: Dark Phoenix</strong>) in <strong>Amazon</strong>'s upcoming <strong>Tomb Raider</strong> TV show, it has now been confirmed that <strong>Sigourney Weaver</strong> and <strong>Jason Isaacs</strong> have joined the main cast.</p>



<p>In a reveal exclusive <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TombRaider/comments/1q5jcp0/reddit_exclusive_new_cast_and_characters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to the official Tomb Raider subreddit</a>, Amazon outlined both roles from the existing gaming franchise and brand-new characters created specifically for the series. These are the picks for characters gamers will know very well:</p>



<ul>
<li>Martin Bobb-Semple is&nbsp;<strong>Zip</strong>, Lara Croft's long-standing tech support and friend.</li>



<li>Jason Isaacs is&nbsp;<strong>Atlas DeMornay</strong>, Lara's uncle.</li>



<li>Bill Paterson is&nbsp;<strong>Winston</strong>, the butler of the Croft family.</li>
</ul>



<p>And these are the actors cast in entirely new roles:</p>



<ul>
<li>Jack Bannon is&nbsp;<strong>Gerry</strong>, Lara's personal pilot (and snack collector).</li>



<li>John Heffernan is&nbsp;<strong>David</strong>, an exhausted government official who finds himself tangled up in Lara's world.</li>



<li>Celia Imrie is&nbsp;<strong>Francine</strong>, the Head of Advancement at the British Museum, focused solely on raising funds and glasses of champagne.</li>



<li>Paterson Joseph is&nbsp;<strong>Thomas Warner</strong>, a senior government official brought in to clean up a mess.</li>



<li>Sasha Luss is&nbsp;<strong>Sasha</strong>, a fierce and deeply competitive new rival of Lara Croft.</li>



<li>Juliette Motamed is&nbsp;<strong>Georgia</strong>, a devoted curator at the British Museum, dedicated to preserving history.</li>



<li>Sigourney Weaver is&nbsp;<strong>Evelyn Wallis</strong>, a mysterious, high-flying woman who is keen to exploit Lara's unique talents.</li>



<li>August Wittgenstein is&nbsp;<strong>Lukas</strong>, an illegal tomb raider who shares history with Lara in more ways than one.</li>
</ul>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/tomb-raider-tv-cast.webp"></a></figure>



<p>Sigourney Weaver and Jason Isaacs are by far the most famous among the newly announced cast. Weaver's breakthrough role was, of course, <strong>Alien's Ellen Ripley</strong>, although she also featured prominently in the <strong>Ghostbusters</strong> and <strong>Avatar</strong> franchises, as Dana Barrett and Dr. Grace Augustine, respectively. As for Jason Isaacs, he is mainly known as <strong>Julius Malfoy</strong> in the <strong>Harry Potter</strong> movie saga; he also received acclaim for playing Captain Gabriel Lorca in <strong>Star Trek: Discovery,</strong> and more recently, as Timothy Ratliff in the third season of HBO's <strong>The White Lotus</strong>. Isaacs also voiced Lord Enver Gortash, one of the main antagonists in <strong>Baldur's Gate 3</strong>.</p>



<p>Amazon's announcement included messages from Sophie Turner and <strong>Phoebe Waller-Bridge</strong>, the creator, writer, executive producer, and co-showrunner, who <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-is-getting-an-interconnected-universe-through-games-film-and-tv-courtesy-of-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has been attached to the show since early 2023</a>.</p>



<p><em><strong>Sophie Turner:</strong> I’ve been a long-time fan of Tomb Raider and the character of Lara. She has always felt for me, very emboldened in a male dominated world. She’s a fierce female role model!</em></p>



<p><em><strong>Phoebe Waller-Bridge:</strong> Tomb Raider boasts a plethora of iconic characters. I am thrilled to have been able to bring some personal and fan favourites to the screen while also introducing a few new rascals of our own to the mix. This cast is beyond my wildest dreams!</em></p>



<p>The TV show's debut season is slated to start production on <strong>January 19, 2026</strong>. Its release will therefore realistically happen at some point in 2027 on Amazon's Prime Video. Meanwhile, Lara Croft fans can revisit the first game in 2026's <strong>Legacy of Atlantis remake</strong> and prepare for a bombastic 2027 that will also see the release of a brand new game titled <strong>Catalyst</strong>, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis-2026-tomb-raider-catalyst-new-entry-in-2027/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced at The Game Awards 2025</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Major collabs continue to come thick and fast in Fortnite, with continuous leaks indicating what players can expect, and South Park is currently the talk of the community.</p>



<p>Fortnite has regularly partnered with some of the biggest franchises from the world of gaming, movies, TV, and music, with a regular flurry of new collab items in the Item Shop, along with larger crossovers featuring in-game content.</p>



<p>South Park has been a rumored addition in Fortnite for a while, and Insider Gaming has all the collab details you need.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-south-park-coming-to-fortnite">Is South Park Coming to Fortnite?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Incoming. Image via South Park Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, Epic Games officially revealed the South Park collab on January 6, following a slew of leaks indicating that the infamous TV series would be landing in the game.</strong></p>



<p>Rumours of South Park’s addition in Fortnite <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-south-park-collab-coming-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first appeared in October 2025</a>, with additional leaks and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-south-park-leak-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">details then emerging in December</a> of the same year. A month later, the South Park collab has been officially confirmed by Epic Games.</p>



<p>Additional details have not been revealed at the time of writing, but HypeX stated in December that it won’t just be the addition of skins and cosmetic items into the Item Shop. Instead, it’s claimed that the collab will feature in-game content including rifts, a boss, a Mythic weapon, Medallions, and an unknown consumable.</p>



<p>It’s also unclear whether the collab items will be available in the main Battle Royale mode, or whether they will be a part of gameplay in other mode, like Blitz or Reload.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-south-park-coming-to-fortnite">When is South Park Coming to Fortnite?</h2>



<p><strong>Epic Games’ reveal of the South Park collab confirmed the drop will take place on Friday, January 9, coinciding with the first major update of the year.</strong></p>



<p>The January 9th update marks the end of Winterfest, and, with there still being almost two months of Chapter 6, Season 1 remaining, new content drops are expected, and there are some <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-og-driftboard-location/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bug fixes with specific quests to iron out</a>, too.</p>



<p>Details of exactly what is coming in the South Park collab will likely start to emerge in leaks when the servers go down for maintenance, with Epic Games then revealing everything officially in a blog or social media post.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>More than five years after its troubled original release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> continues to be one of the most relevant <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/from-serious-skyrim-to-cheerful-fantasy-obsidian-on-the-evolution-of-avowed-and-grappling-with-the-expectations-that-come-from-your-own-history">open-world RPGs</a> of the modern era. Much of its success comes from the believable relationships it quickly establishes between its key characters and V, but the pre-disaster prologue with preem choom Jackie was never meant to go on for too long.</p>
<p>"It's like saying we should spend more time on Tatooine with farmer Luke before he got involved with all this Jedi stuff," said Cyberpunk 2 creative director Igor Sarzynski <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/srznsk.bsky.social/post/3mbokwdsals27">on his BlueSky account</a> on 5th January, after a few too many comments from the community on how a longer Act 1 alongside doomed partner-in-crime Jackie Welles would've made the game better.</p>
<p>Considering how long <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-walkthrough-main-story-quest-list-main-missions-order-5077">the prologue</a> already felt - though it's topped by other recent sandbox games' early hours for sure - we’re inclined to agree with Sarzynski here, though we also understand where some players are coming from. Cyberpunk 2077 gets quite a bit of their time together out of the way with a quick montage that shows us some highlights of their chaotic gigs and good times at bars before things take a darker turn. And, in case you were wondering, the "half-year montage is not cut content".</p>
<p>"The game cannot be infinite," the creative director also stated. "I think we struck a good balance." After all, Cyberpunk 2077's early beats were never meant to represent the far more open experience that kicks off when the Relic comes into play and we get an unhealthy dose of Keanu Reeves injected into our head. You can roam around for a bit with Jackie, sure, but most players would agree it's more of an on-rails introduction to Night City's underworld and Arasaka's family drama.</p><p>In any case, the fact people are still yapping about whether we should've had more time with Jackie or not after half a decade and many discussions about CDPR essentially finishing the game for real in late 2023 is yet another reminder Cyberpunk 2077 has the staying power we rarely see in the single-player space. In fact, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-has-sold-a-lot-more-copies-than-you-think-and-faster-than-the-witcher-3">it’s performed even better than The Witcher 3</a>.</p>

            <p>While it hasn't taken as commanding a stranglehold over the world's collective consciousness as its debut series did, the second helping of Amazon's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tv-shows/fallout">Fallout TV show</a> is succeeding in helping drive a number of extra Steam players back to the wasteland. That said, a number of said wastelands being heavily discounted as part of the platform's recently concluded winter sale likely hasn't hindered those efforts.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/fallout-season-2-has-doubled-the-number-of-people-playing-the-fallout-games-on-steam/">Psycho Consuming Gamer</a>, SteamDB's charts since the episodes of the show started to drop on December 16th feature lines going up. Getting into <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/377160/charts/#3y">specifics</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a>'s gone from oscillating around the 20,000 players mark to hitting a peak of 44,000 players on January 4th, following a gradual rise over the festive period. So, that number's effectively doubled, though it's comfortably dwarfed by the mammoth 187,000 peak the game hit <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-fallout-tv-show-gave-the-fallout-games-a-huge-player-bump-as-everyone-remembers-they-like-fallout">thanks to the show's first series</a> back in April 2024.</p>
<p>Beavis and Butthead pairing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-3">Fallout 3</a> have also seen bumps in the same timespan. The former's naturally prospered more, rising from the region of 8,000 to a peak of <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/22380/charts/#3y">just over 19,000</a> the same day Fallout 4 had its biggest recent spike. Fallout 3's gone from averaging around 100 players to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/22300/charts/#3y">just under 200</a> at its version of this peak.</p>
<p>Then, there's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a>, the game Bethesda clearly pushed to be the intended main beneficiary of any second series player bump, with the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/take-a-tour-of-fallout-76s-burning-springs-with-our-recently-defrosted-ohioan-historian">Goggins ghoul-toting Burning Springs expansion</a> dropping just before the show. The multiplayerpocalyspse's numbers jumped from <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1151340/charts/#3y">around 10,000 to around 20,000</a> with Burning Springs' release in early December, and have since peaked at just under 30,000. For context, it hit a peak of 73,000 players with the show's first season. These latest New Vegas and Fallout 3 numbers are similarly dwarfed by their season one marks.</p><p>That's not too suprising. The first series of the Fallout show had that debut novelty to it and dropped at a time of year when everyone wasn't busy with the holidays and new year celebrations. That also usually means plenty of free time, something Amazon are almost certainly banking on in terms of watch numbers.</p>
<p>What's not clear is the extent to which the games being discounted in Steam's wallet-zapping winter sale helped, but for context, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a> Special Edition's <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/489830/charts/#1y">player count</a> has remained relatively close to the marks in the region of 30,000 to 40,000 players it was hitting prior to December 16th - its highest mark over the festive period was just over 46,000 players.</p>
<p>With the fourth episode of Fallout season two set to drop today, January 7th, we'll have to see if the lines continue to go up as things build up to the series finale in early February.</p>

            <p>Splitgate Arena Reloaded developer 1047 Games has shared some words regarding how its rereleased and repackaged game is doing over on Valve's PC platform, stating: "Steam Charts don't measure fun."</p>
<p>Splitgate Arena Reloaded started life as Splitgate 2. However, Splitgate 2 as it was failed to hit the mark, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-2-fails-to-make-fps-great-again-goes-back-into-beta-resulting-in-layoffs-and-server-shutdowns">1047 Games took the game back to beta in July of last year</a>, which resulted in a number of layoffs at the studio. In November, it was announced that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-2-take-two-coming-next-month-as-1047-games-announces-relaunch-for-its-free-to-play-shooter">Splitgate 2 would relaunch in December</a>. A new name - Splitgate Arena Reloaded - was then revealed, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-returning-to-beta-splitgate-2-is-coming-back-with-a-new-name">along with a relaunch date of 17th December</a>.</p>

<p>Since that relaunch less than a month ago, many picked up that Splitgate Arena Reloaded still wasn't bringing in big numbers over on Steam. As our Connor reported just this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-a-controversial-marketing-campaign-splitgate-2-fails-to-find-an-audience-despite-two-official-launches">the relaunch saw an initial peak concurrent player count of 2,297</a> on the PC platform, before that number dropped down to a relatively stable concurrent count of around 1,000 players in more recent days. It is unclear what its console player base is.</p>
<p>1047 Games has now addressed these Steam figures, saying you can't simply equate player numbers on a single platform with the amount of fun that is being had. "They show one number, on one platform, at one given moment," the Splitgate Arena Reloaded team said.</p>
<p>"They don't show the full picture or what it feels like to actually play, and they definitely don't capture the community that's actively helping shape what Arena Reloaded is becoming (including upcoming content like Arena Royale)."</p>
<p>Continuing, the developer said: "Over the past six months, we rebuilt Splitgate from the ground up because we believe in the game, our team, and our community. The 1047 team remains committed to delivering the best version of Splitgate possible."</p><p>It went on to thank Splitgate's community of players for their passion and feedback, before closing with an encouragement for others to give the game a go and "form your own opinion" on the relaunch. "To everyone who hasn't played yet: Arena Reloaded is free, the gameplay's the best it's ever been... A lot of passionate people worked very hard on it."</p>

<p>Splitgate Arena Reloaded is hosting a selection of competitive events in an effort to drum up interest. This includes a $5,000 tournament with Splitgate content creators, as well as a $25,000 community challenge. There's also a welcome back event, in which players can earn the T200 character skin, a popular relic of the original Splitgate.</p>
<p>Will this second go at things still yet be the time <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-2-director-apologises-for-causing-division-following-controversial-summer-game-fest-appearance">Splitgate makes FPS great again</a>? We will see.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Dreameffect Entertainment has confirmed that its third person openworld soulslike Duel Corp. will be launching into early access on January 21st. Duel Corp. is described as having an MMO feel as you will be able to meet other players in the world, and tackle the game in co-op with up to three other players too. There is no linear story path with players working out what has happened by interacting with the various factions that populate Duel Corp’s world.</p>
<p><iframe title="Early Access Release Announcement #shorts" width="563" height="1000" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4iESGgcI-qY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In the world of Duel Corp everyone has been cursed with darkened eyes which has also caused everyone to be immortal. This curse has also raised all of the dead that are a danger to the living. The factions in this world have been borne out of the fallout from the curse, with each faction having its own theories and ways of coping with the new reality. In this world, players will have access to an unrestricted class system so different builds can be experimented with to suit different playstyles. The world of Duel Corp will react to player actions. For example, destroying a caravan will mean a village does not get vital resources. This can be used to cause friction between different factions, or weaken the village so you can take it over yourself. It is not just villages that can be taken over, with cities ripe for conquering. There are co-op quests to take part in as well as 1v1 and 2v2 PvP encounters. Duel Corp also contains procedurally generated encounters that can have unique items and NPCs to encounter.</p>
<p>Duel Corp will be launched with a 20% discount, priced at $19.99.</p>

			<p>A new rumor suggests <strong>Microsoft</strong> is preparing to use its <strong>layoff axe</strong> once again, for the <strong>fourth consecutive January</strong>, cutting between 11 and 22 thousand jobs across various divisions (including <strong>Xbox</strong>) because of the <strong>rising costs of AI investment</strong>. If the figures were confirmed, it would be the biggest layoff round yet.</p>



<p>The rumor <a href="https://www.tipranks.com/news/microsoft-msft-eyes-major-january-layoffs-as-ai-costs-rise" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">comes from TipRanks</a>, which adds that the layoffs are expected to fall upon employees at some point <strong>in the third week of January</strong>. According to workers' anonymous sources, even the <strong>Azure</strong> cloud team could be affected.</p>



<p>Analyst projections had previously suggested that Microsoft may need to cut at least 10,000 employees annually just to offset increased capital depreciation costs from data center expansion. Looking back over the past few years, the current <strong>fourth-largest company in the world by market capitalization</strong> reduced its workforce by 5% in <strong>2023</strong>, primarily as part of a resizing effort following the pandemic's mass hiring spree. That year in January, it <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-slashing-10k-jobs-bethesda-the-coaltion-343-industries-affected/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">started with 10,000 jobs lost</a>, when the gaming teams affected were <strong>Bethesda</strong>, <strong>The Coalition</strong> (developers of <strong>Gears of War</strong>), and <strong>343 Industries</strong> (developers of the <strong>Halo </strong>series). </p>



<p>In January <strong>2024</strong>, gaming really took the brunt of the hit as Microsoft 'only' <a href="https://wccftech.com/four-months-after-the-merger-with-activision-blizzard-microsoft-is-laying-off-1900-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cut <strong>1,900 employees</strong></a>, around 1% of its workforce. It happened just three months after the finalization of the acquisition of <strong>Activision Blizzard</strong>, which cost <strong>$75.4 billion</strong> when all was said and done. Activision Blizzard was indeed the most affected studio, with the new survival game franchise codenamed <strong>Odyssey</strong> canceled as a result, but other teams at Xbox and Bethesda also suffered cuts. The worst was yet to come for gaming, though: <strong>Arkane Austin</strong> (<strong>Prey</strong>, <strong>Redfall</strong>), <strong>Tango Gameworks</strong> (<strong>The Evil Within</strong>, <strong>Ghostwire: Tokyo</strong>, <strong>Hi-Fi Rush</strong>), <strong>Alpha Dog Games</strong>, and <strong>Roundhouse Studios</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-a-couple-more-bethesda-softworks-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">were all abruptly shut down in May 2024</a>. Later that year, around 1,000 employees were removed from the HoloLens and Azure cloud teams, and another 650 from corporate and support divisions, but it was still a relatively quiet year compared to the other two for Microsoft as a whole.</p>



<p><span><strong>2025</strong>&nbsp;was&nbsp;<strong>by far the worst</strong>, and it once again began with a January cut of slightly less than 1% of Microsoft's employees based on performance.</span> That was just the start: 3% of the workforce was cut in May, and an even heavier blow landed in July, when Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">removed another 4% of its employees</a>, shutting down <strong>The Initiative</strong> (<a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/">and its </a><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Perfect Dark reboot</a></strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/"> project</a>) and cutting a lot of employees at <strong>ZeniMax Online Studios</strong> (leading to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-cancelled-mmorpg-story-gameplay-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancellation of <strong>Project Blackbird</strong></a>) and Rare (<a href="https://wccftech.com/rare-everwild-cancelled-microsoft-gaming-layoffs/">axing </a><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/rare-everwild-cancelled-microsoft-gaming-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Everwild</a></strong>). <strong>Turn 10 Studios</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-motorsport-developer-turn-10-hit-hard-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was hit hard</a>, too, essentially becoming a support studio for the <strong>Forza Horizon</strong> franchise following a few unsuccessful <strong>Forza Motorsport</strong> releases.</p>



<p>Following that round, a report from the inside <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-trying-replace-jobs-ai-agents/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that Microsoft was 'trying their damndest' to <strong>replace human jobs with AI agents</strong>. A couple of days later, another report <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-layoffs-funding-increased-spending-ai-infrastructure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mentioned</a> that the layoff rounds were fundamentally needed <strong>to fund increased spending in AI infrastructure</strong>, and that seems to be the case even with the new round that might be announced soon.</p>



<p>The TipRanks report also reveals that Microsoft plans to enforce stricter office policies starting from February 23, 2026. Employees residing within 50 miles of an office will be required to work on-site for at least three days per week. Internally, some people view this new rule as a subtle way to encourage even more people to leave.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Embark Studios' founder Patrick Soderlund has stated that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>, a game initially meant to release as a free-to-play title, launched as a $40 premium price point in part due to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>'s approach.</p>
<p>Speaking to Gamesbeat, Soderlund stated: "It's something we discussed as the game went from free-to-play to a traditional business model. We basically looked at games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> and other games and decided, 'OK, that is where we should sit'</p>
<p>Soderlund continued: "We made that decision, whether that was right or wrong one can argue. I like the fact that the game is relatively affordable and that people can come in and try the game."</p>

</figure>
<p>A further reason why the $40 price point was decided was a desire to sell the game without its cost acting as an "offender" to anyone, given that Arc Raiders is a purely multiplayer game without a campaign. Soderlund remarked: "We'd rather make people feel like it's totally worth 40 bucks. I hope that people, given how much time they seem to spend in the game, feel like we've given them value for money. That's where we want to be."</p><p>It appears to have been the correct decision. According to analyst estimates, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-12-million-sales">Arc Raiders recently passed the 12m sales milestone</a>, bringing in over $350m in revenue. It also was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-was-steams-best-selling-game-over-the-holiday-period">one of Steam's best selling games over the Christmas period</a>, thanks in part to a well-timed discount as well as an ongoing wave of positive word-of-mouth.</p>
<p>Part of this word of mouth surrounds the interesting social dynamics at play in Arc Raiders, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-are-arc-raiders-players-so-averse-to-pvp-to-find-out-we-spoke-to-a-sociologist">with a significant portion of the community opting out of PvP gameplay where they can</a>. This, supported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yes-aggression-matchmaking-is-now-a-thing-in-arc-raiders">by matchmaking that takes aggressiveness into account</a>, has resulted in a surprisingly friendly extraction shooter for many players.</p>

                <p>This past weekend has seen a new spate of Pokémon TCG-related crimes, with over $300,000 worth of rare cards stolen in two seperate incidents in Southern California. In one, thieves broke into a trading card store and smashed display cases, while a second incident saw a collector held up at gunpoint for a briefcase of rare cards.</p><p>Trading card store Simi Sportscards in the Simi Valley was the target of a break-in early Sunday morning, <a href="https://ktla.com/news/local-news/thieves-target-valuable-trading-cards-in-brazen-southern-california-heist/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">KTLA reports</a>, with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se-_LQPR98Q" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CCTV footage</a> showing a group of at least five thieves smashing display cases to steal the cards inside. Store owner Jake Miller says the group stole rare sports trading cards and valuable Pokémon TCG cards after sawing through the front door. He estimates the break-in will cost the store over $50,000 in repairs, lost merchandise, and security upgrades.</p>

            <guid>1399084</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Stranger Things recently wrapped after almost a decade of being on the air. On New Year’s Day, the final episode, with a whopping two-hour runtime, aired on Netflix and broke the hearts of millions of fans worldwide. Whether you loved it or hated it, the ultimate episode wrapped up almost every core story put forward by the writers over the last ten years.</p>



<p>In a recent interview, the Duffer brothers, the creators of Stranger Things, revealed what Dungeons &amp; Dragons-themed game inspired the <strong>ending battle </strong>against the Mind Flayer and Vecna in Stranger Things.</p>







<h2 id="h-that-s-how-you-take-down-these-monsters">‘That’s How You Take Down These Monsters’</h2>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://variety.com/2026/tv/news/stranger-things-finale-is-eleven-alive-vecna-killed-rock-spinoff-1236621528/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview with Variety</a>, Ross and Matt Duffer, the creators and directive minds behind Stranger Things, offered up all kinds of information about the show, how it wrapped, and what it took to get to this point.</p>



<p>Midway through the interview, the talk turned to the final battle between Vecna, the physical manifestation of the Mind Flayer, and the good guys from Hawkins. It was a phenomenal sequence that showed how these unlikely heroes were able to get the upper hand on a behemoth of an opponent like the Mind Flayer.</p>



<p>Matt Duffer explained what inspired the final battle:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We were thinking about D&amp;D, and I was playing&nbsp;Baldur’s Gate 3&nbsp;at the time, and&nbsp;we felt it was very important that the only way for them to defeat it was for the entire party to work together. Everyone had fully realized — either through self-acceptance or they’ve resolved all their various issues — moving into that final battle, they’re absolutely primed. </p>



<p>They’re the ultimate team, and it’s the party working all together to defeat this thing. And they each have their own individual skills, right? And that’s where I go back to Dungeons &amp; Dragons, and something like&nbsp;Baldur’s Gate. Because that’s how you take down these monsters that seem otherwise unstoppable. Lots of video game references were applied to that final battle.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Baldur’s Gate 3 and Stranger Things are inherently linked to the same Dungeons &amp; Dragons universe. The core exception is that Baldur’s Gate 3 remains more aligned with the source material, while Stranger Things is more <strong>inspired by </strong>it and uses references in an alternate way.</p>



<p>For instance, the young heroes in Stranger Things name the series’ Big Bad the ‘Mind Flayer’, flanked by ‘Vecna’, but that’s not their true identity; it’s just what the D&amp;D-loving kids refer to them as based on their attributes and make-up.</p>

<p>Detroit: Become Human is one of the best story-driven adventure titles ever made. It was pieced together by Quantic Dream and released way back in 2018, emerging on Steam as a port in 2020. The game tells the story of a race of androids breaking free from their programming and conditioning to rise against their human creators and oppressors.</p>



<p>In the last two weeks, Detroit: Become Human has established itself as a best-selling game on Steam, becoming the second-most bought title on the platform behind ARC Raiders and shifting almost (an estimated) <strong>one million copies</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-why-is-detroit-become-human-surging-on-steam">Why is Detroit: Become Human Surging on Steam?</h2>



<p>A recent report from Alinea Analytics revealed that Steam generated substantial revenue in December 2025. The Valve-backed storefront generated a whopping $1.6 billion, a year-over-year increase of more than 22%. The growth was elevated by games like ARC Raiders being released and selling extremely well in a short period.</p>



<p>One unexpected title to storm up the charts was 2018’s Detroit: Become Human, which Alinea estimates sold approximately 993,000 copies from December 21 to January 5. That’s almost <strong>one million sales</strong> for a game that was released nearly eight years ago.</p>



<p>Per the <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/the-steam-games-that-sold-the-most" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report from Alinea</a>, the staggering growth was spurred by the game having a deep discount – the steepest discount the title has ever seen on the platform. It crashed down from $40 to just $4, representing a fair amount of bang for the average gamer’s buck.</p>



<p>Detroit: Become Human was only topped by ARC Raiders, which sold around 1.2 million copies on Steam in the same timeframe.</p>



<p>The likes of PEAK, Battlefield 6, and R.E.P.O. also claimed spots in the best-seller charts on Steam.</p>



<p>Detroit: Become Human is a phenomenal and emotional game that is totally open-ended. It mirrors titles like Beyond: Two Souls, Heavy Rain, and Until Dawn, giving players full control over every action their characters make, allowing them to influence the direction of a story that has multiple endings and branching concepts.</p>



<p>The sales figures also pushed Detroit: Become Human to an all-time high peak player count of 25,615 users on January 4.</p>

<p>How will it hold up on Switch 2?</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> arrives on the Switch 2 and multiple other platforms next month, and ahead of the anticipated release, new footage has surfaced at CES 2026 this week.</p>
<p>During Nvidia's PC showcase of the title featuring path tracing and DLSS 4 with multi frame generation, a new setting in the series has reportedly been revealed. As <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/resident-evil-requiems-nvidia-trailer-includes-a-big-tease-at-a-new-environment/">highlighted by VGC</a>, it's a glimpse at a "new city environment" and what's believed to be the fictional location Wrenwood, where the game unfolds.</p>
<p>What's so unique here is it's a big contrast to what we're used to seeing in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil">Resident Evil</a> series. Instead of chaos and zombies in every direction, as you can see, it's actually a lively place, with humans and vehicles making their way through the streets. Of course, we don't know for sure how much activity will take place here, but it's an exciting glimpse!</p>
<figure data-uuid="71948ed41df8d"><a title="Resident Evil Requiem" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/71948ed41df8d/resident-evil-requiem.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom, Nvidia</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>As the source further notes, <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1">Resident Evil enthusiast Dusk Golem</a> (who has a history covering Capcom-related rumours) has previously mentioned how Requiem could contain some "big open levels". It follows the news last month that the legend and video game icon <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/leon-kennedy-is-confirmed-for-resident-evil-requiem">Leon Kennedy would be returning</a> in the latest outing. You can check out Nvidia's full clip above, which shows the new protagonist and FBI intelligence analyst Grace Ashcroft walking around the city.</p>
<p>As for the game's performance and visuals on the Switch 2, Nintendo Life contributor Lowell Bell went <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/hands-on-resident-evil-requiem-switch-2-footage-a-surprisingly-tense-port">hands on with the handheld build at the Tokyo Game Show</a> in 2025 - mentioning at the time how this version still "looked amazing" (even though there was a "visual downgrade") and didn't notice any "dropped frames". So, hopefully, the final build for Switch 2 launches in a good state when this title arrives on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[PlayStation Promotes Strange Resident Evil Rip-off Named ‘Ebola Village’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-promote-resident-evil-rip-off-ebola-village/</link>
            <guid>1399069</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a new trailer uploaded to the official PlayStation YouTube channel, gamers get a first-hand glimpse at ‘Ebola Village’, an upcoming first-person horror shooter coming January 23rd to PlayStation 5 and <strong>PlayStation 4</strong>. The title is the first bizarre note, and it only gets worse from there.</p>



<p>Fans were quick to point out the gen-AI cover for the video, the stark similarities to Resident Evil (right down to the game’s title font), and the low-quality make-up of the gameplay, which looks years out of date.</p>



<p>It’s worth stressing that Ebola Village came out on PC several months ago. What’s even more perplexing is that this is the latest in a line of similar titles, none of which have ever managed to gain any traction.</p>











<p>The comments under the recent trailer upload for Ebola Village are immensely negative and accurately representative of the <strong>confusion </strong>PlayStation fans have about this game.</p>



<p>One wrote, ‘We got Resident Evil at home,’ playing on a classic meme, while another declared, ‘Official PlayStation account advertising a genuine ripoff shovelware game might be a new low.’</p>



<p>Here’s the full trailer, in case you want to see the content for yourself:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Ebola Village - Release Date Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HRM0AdPcs3E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>The trailer showcases a few sequences that closely mirror content seen across the Resident Evil franchise in the last two decades or so. For instance, the player character being chased by a deranged villager wielding a chainsaw, which is instantly reminiscent of 2004’s Resident Evil 4.</p>



<p>Everything from the animations to the visuals screams ‘low budget’, and while that’s not normally a problem (we love indie games here), the subject matter of Ebola Village is much more than just ‘inspired’ by games like Resident Evil. In the comments under the video, gamers were quick to parody the title:</p>



<ul>
<li>‘What’s next, COVID City?’</li>



<li>‘Tuberculosis Town next’</li>



<li>‘From the makers of Coronaland and SARSville comes a terrifying new chapter’</li>
</ul>



<p>Ebola Village will be released digitally on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 on January 23, and perhaps it’ll be worth playing to see how it shapes up after all. On <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2306030/EBOLA_VILLAGE/?curator_clanid=33714941" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, the game somehow managed to scrape a ‘Very Positive’ rating from 319 reviews, at the time of writing.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/slasher-retires-cod-esports-not-fun-anymore/</link>
            <guid>1399066</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Austin ‘SlasheR’ Liddicoat has officially stepped back from competing in the Call of Duty League. This revelation comes after the 31-year-old secured multiple Major wins and a world championship title over a career spanning more than a decade. The veteran player made the announcement a few weeks into the 2026 CDL season, stepping down from the Carolina Royal Ravens.</p>



<p>In a recent stream, SlasheR went deep into why he retired, revealing that the competitive scene just wasn’t fun anymore. He stressed that the ‘new age’ competitors don’t have the same mindset, and he’s fed up with playing for the sake of playing.</p>







<h2 id="h-slasher-leaves-a-phenomenal-legacy">SlasheR Leaves a Phenomenal Legacy</h2>



<p>SlasheR has been one of the most impactful and stalwart players in the Call of Duty League over the years. At the time of his retirement, he was the most senior player in the scene and still putting up numbers.</p>



<p>His tenure at the topmost tier of Call of Duty esports saw him transition through some of the most prestigious teams in the space, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>FaZe Clan / Atlanta FaZe</li>



<li>Denial</li>



<li>Envy</li>



<li>100 Thieves / LA Thieves</li>



<li>OpTic</li>
</ul>



<p>In 2016, he won the CWL Championship while flying the Envy banner, fighting alongside JKap, John, and Apathy, all of whom have long since retired or moved on to content creation and coaching.</p>



<p>While streaming recently, SlasheR explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I started thinking about it over the… Honestly, even when we were practicing every day, I started thinking about it. It just wasn’t fun anymore. I feel like the way I approach practice and everything is very serious. Obviously, I want to have fun too, but I’m way more serious with it than a lot of the new-age kids.</p>



<p>It felt to me like a waste of time. We weren’t getting better, we were just playing to play, where I want to get better. I want to go hard every day. I was just like, ‘What’s the point of continuiing to Major I if I’m not enjoying it?’</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He explained that he was only playing this long because he was still qualifying for LAN events, because the ‘online shit was just never fun’ for him.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Slasher REVEALS The Real Reasons why he Retired! 👀 (he is done with CDL)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bSJg8iobNHQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>SlasheR also admitted that he hasn’t been ‘enjoying the games’, which is an unfortunate sentiment echoed by many pro players these days. The state of Call of Duty isn’t encouraging, and the reception of Black Ops 7 has been an all-time low.</p>



<p>Exceed will move up to take SlasheR’s spot on the Carolina Royal Ravens.</p>

<figure data-uuid="102b504602630"><a title="Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined Demo" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/102b504602630/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-demo.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Square Enix's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined</a> demo is now live in select locations around the globe, and we've got some early details about how this game runs. This comes from the <a href="https://youtu.be/nGIHRqRQWp0">YouTube channel SwitchUp</a>, which regularly investigates the performance of Switch and Switch 2 games.</p>
<p>Players on Nintendo's original hybrid system can seemingly expect 30fps (with some frame pacing stutters), and as you might have already guessed, there's a drop in resolution. On the Switch 2, the game will run at a "silky smooth" 60fps, with more consistent frame pacing. Both versions apparently deliver a respectable experience in handheld mode - with the Switch 2 build maintaining smoothness in portable play. The Switch OLED panel also makes the game look great, and Switch load times are "surprisingly solid".</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067irhojm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The TLDR is that on Switch 1, if you're playing on an OLED, it looks better, although it does run at 30 frames per second with a few visual downgrades. There are also some stutters below 30 frames in certain scenes and you'll notice that in the frame pacing...on the Switch 2, everything is silky smooth, 60fps - perhaps the very occasional stutter...it looks great"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's further mentioned how this reimagined version has gone "all in" with the shallow depth of field technique, as it gives everything a <em>proper</em> diorama look similar to Square Enix's previous <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">HD-2D</a> games. There's also some "noticeable aliasing" across both versions of the game, but overall, it's a better experience in the "higher resolution" Switch 2 version, even with some jaggy edges.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"...Generally, it looks absolutely stunning. The ocean waves, the way they've designed those to overlap each other to kind of almost be an illusion of three dimensions works great. There are a couple of issues in terms of texture overlap. If you look carefully you might see the straight lines in certain scenes, perhaps a little work needed there but nothing major."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are also differences in the level of detail and draw distance across the Switch and Switch 2 versions, but the overall image quality and amount of effects (minus some particle effects and other effects) remain intact on the original platform. Keep in mind the full game isn't out until <strong>5th February 2026</strong>, so the demo may not necessarily reflect the final release. When more information about the game's performance and resolution is revealed, we'll provide an update.</p>
