			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/atomfall-shadow-of-cumbria/">Atomfall</a> publisher and developer Rebellion has announced that their new post-apocalyptic adventure in the British countryside has attracted more than <strong>2 million players</strong> within the game's first month.</p>
<p>Rebellion also shared a few in-game statistics about how players have been interacting with Atomfall, like the fact that players have killed more than 5.9 million enemies with cricket bats, ordered over 250,000 pints of beer, drunk 500,000 cups of tea and died from rat swarms more than 420,000 times. Rebellion also pointed out that 'tin of meat' is players' preferred in-game food choice, with more than 14.1 million tins of meat being consumed so far.</p>
<p>In the game's opening weekend, Atomfall surpassed <a href="https://wccftech.com/atomfall-surpasses-1-5-million-players-in-its-opening-weekend/">1.5 million players</a>, so it's not surprising that it went well past 2 million within its first month of launch.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>It should also be pointed out that part of Atomfall reaching the audience it has is due in part to the game being available on Xbox Game Pass from day one. Still, even considering its inclusion in Microsoft's subscription service, 2 million players in weeks for a brand-new game is still an incredible feat.</p>
<p>Just one year ago, at the time of writing, there were no Fallout-esque games that took the adventure across the pond to the United Kingdom. Now, with the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-london-is-now-available-for-download/">Fallout: London</a> last July and Atomfall, we have two of them. This brings up an interesting point as to whether we'll start to see the same kind of post-nuclear apocalypse setting happening outside the United States more often.</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/atomfall-shadow-of-cumbria/">review</a> of Atomfall, we said, "<em>Atomfall is a thoroughly enjoyable game which looks and plays well, and offers a compelling narrative with surrounding exploration to keep you entertained. It's well-polished, offers good replay value, and encourages you to do things a little different, and isn't bad on the eyes either, with a good design that allows it to both look good and support last-gen consoles."</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/has-schedule-1-been-sued-lawsuit-controversy-explained/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Schedule 1 is one of the most impressive success stories of 2025. The indie drug-dealing game is a hit sensation on Steam, but a lawsuit controversy has jeopardized that feel-good story. </p>



<p>The concept of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-roadmap-all-future-content-fishing-shooting-mini-games-bribery-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Schedule 1</a> is simple. Players start as small-time drug dealers and work their way up, producing drugs and distributing them. However, It’s not always smooth sailing, as law enforcement and rival cartels will force you to defend your empire. </p>



<p>While relatively straightforward, the addicting gameplay loop is a massive draw. In only a few weeks after launching,  Schedule 1 reached nearly <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3164500/Schedule_I/#:~:text=You're%20a%20small%2Dtime,coast%20city%20of%20Hyland%20Point." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">half a million concurrent players</a> at its peak. The meteoric rise inspired <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-creator-gives-console-port-update-after-imitations-appear-on-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">console port imitations</a> as other developers tried to steal the magic formula. Yet, Schedule 1 also faces similar clone accusations. </p>



<h2 id="h-is-schedule-1-being-sued">Is Schedule 1 Being Sued?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Schedule 1 puts you in the shoes of a drug dealer. Image via TVGS</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, Schedule 1 is not being sued</strong>, <strong>but the game is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-being-investigated-for-ip-copyright-infringement-claims/#:~:text=April%204%2C%202025-,Schedule%201%20Being%20Investigated%20For%20IP%20Copyright%20Infringement%20Claims,full%20investigation%20into%20the%20game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">under investigation</a> for IP copyright infringement</strong>. </p>



<p><a href="https://biznes.pap.pl/wiadomosci/firmy/movie-games-sa-172025-podjecie-decyzji-o-rozpoczeciu-dochodzenia-wzgledem-tworcow" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">papbiznes</a> published a document titled “MOVIE GAMES SA (17/2025) Decision to commence investigation against the creators of the Schedule 1 production for claims regarding the infringement of the Issuer’s IP and related to committing an act of unfair competition against it.”</p>



<p>Movie Games S.A. already had an established foothold in drug-dealing games with Drug Dealer Simulator 1 and Drug Dealer Simulator 2 before Schedule 1, raising questions about whether it is too similar. </p>



<p>The investigation is strongly looking into: “Elements of the game’s plot, mechanics, as well as UI – User Interface.” It finishes by saying: “The Issuer will immediately inform about further actions related to the pursuit of claims regarding the infringement of the Issuer’s IP and the act of unfair competition in subsequent current reports.”</p>



<p>When news about the investigation surfaced, Schedule 1 fans lept into action and review-bombed the Drug Dealer Simulator games on Steam. The feud forced Movie Games to respond. </p>



<h2 id="h-will-schedule-1-be-sued">Will Schedule 1 be Sued?</h2>



<p><strong>If the investigation concludes that the similarities between Schedule 1 and Drug Dealer Simulator’s game plot, mechanics, UI, or anything else are too close, a lawsuit could be filed. </strong></p>



<p>After the incessant review bombing of Drug Dealer Simulator, Movie Games stepped forward and cleared up any confusion with a post on its <a href="https://x.com/MovieGamesSA/status/1909573722219888913" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official X account</a>. </p>



<p>The company made it abundantly clear, “<strong>There is no lawsuit</strong>,” and it’s not the company’s intention to “<strong>Prevent TVGS from selling or developing their game</strong>&nbsp;[Schedule 1].” The statement goes on to say the investigation is being conducted because of the similarities, and “Movie Games, being a publicly traded company,&nbsp;<strong>could face severe litigation for negligence.</strong>“</p>



<p>Movie Games emphasized, “There is no ill will toward TVGS,” and they “<strong>Emailed them best wishes shortly before the release.</strong>“</p>



<p>Despite the reassuring statements, the investigation is ongoing, and we won’t know if there will be a lawsuit until it concludes. </p>



<hr>



<p>The investigation hasn’t slowed down the creation of new content for TVGS. Schedule 1 has an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-roadmap-all-future-content-fishing-shooting-mini-games-bribery-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">extensive roadmap</a>, including the addition of fishing, shooting, mini-games, and more. In addition, the game regularly receives <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-april-7-update-adds-pawn-shop-boutique/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new updates</a> to ensure an enjoyable experience. </p>

<p>On the way to Room 46, you’re likely to come across the Billiard Room. No, we’re not stopping for a quick game as we need to head into here so we can complete the ever-changing Darts puzzle, which offers free bonuses if you can complete it.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-creator-praises-blue-prince-as-one-of-the-best-games-hes-ever-played/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blue Prince</a> is a game where I cherish the first few hours. Eventually, you come across the same rooms and items, and it becomes familiar. The initial wonderment comes from the beauty of exploration. You draft new rooms, see what they do and what they hold, and you find curiosities such as the Billiard Room.</p>



<p>Inside awaits a devious little puzzle. If you’re having trouble with it, don’t worry, I did at first. But once you understand its cunningness, it’s easily solvable.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-solve-the-billiard-room-dart-puzzle-in-blue-prince">How to Solve the Billiard Room Dart Puzzle in Blue Prince</h2>



<figure>
<figure><figcaption>You’ll probably find this note. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption>The maths don’t seem to add up. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p><strong>We need to use the mathematical properties of Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division to select the correct numbers on the dart board and beat the puzzle.</strong></p>



<p>In theory, with enough time and patience, you can solve the puzzle with a process of elimination. But it’s more fun and satisfying to work everything out for ourselves—<strong>and it would take hours!</strong></p>



<p>You need to complete several stages of increasingly more difficult calculations and understand the colors to beat <a href="https://www.blueprincegame.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Blue Prince</a>‘s Dartboard test in the Billiard Room.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-do-dartboard-colors-mean-in-blue-prince">What do Dartboard Colors Mean in Blue Prince?</h2>



<p>Below is a handy chart showing what each color means and how they influence the puzzle. You are likely to see one to complete the puzzle.</p>



<p>I haven’t seen any other colors during my playtime, but developer Dogubomb could always add more, or the late-game may feature further complications.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Segment Color</th><th data-align="center">What it Means</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Light Blue</td><td data-align="center">Addition</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Yellow</td><td data-align="center">Subtraction</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Pink</td><td data-align="center">Multiplication</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Purple</td><td data-align="center">Division</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-dartboard-puzzle-example-in-blue-prince">Dartboard Puzzle Example in Blue Prince</h2>



<p><strong>The puzzle, in my experience, has the same number of steps, and the equations become more difficult. Use the numbers on the inside of the board first and make your way to the outside of the board. Your answer should never be above 20.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s an example of how to complete the puzzle:</p>



<ol>
<li>Interact with the dartboard to start the puzzle.</li>



<li>The first step is likely to be a single blue number—<strong>the answer is the highlighted number</strong>.</li>



<li>So, if 14 is highlighted blue, the answer is <strong>14</strong> to start.</li>



<li>Next, 6 could be highlighted in yellow, with 14 still blue.</li>



<li>14 minus 6 equals <strong>8</strong>, so press this number.</li>



<li>8 could be in blue next, with the number 2 highlighted in pink.</li>



<li>If we take 8 and multiply it by 2, we get <strong>16</strong>.</li>



<li>Say the number 18 is in blue and 3 is purple now, we divide 18 by 3 to get <strong>6</strong>.</li>



<li>For the next step, 20 is blue, 10 is yellow, 2 is pink, and 4 is purple.</li>



<li>This means 20 minus 10 equals 10. Then 10 multiplied by 2 equals 20 again, and then 20 divided by 4 equals <strong>5</strong>!</li>
</ol>

<p>Three more Sega Genesis games have been added to the console library for Nintendo Switch Online members.</p>

When the Nintendo Switch 2 launches, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-online-adds-gamecube-games-to-nintendo-switch-2-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GameCube games will also</a> become available. </p>



<p>Nintendo Switch Online costs $20 for the base plan that gives players access to online gaming, Nintendo Music, Cloud Saves, NES, SNES, and Game Boy games. Adding the Expansion Pack brings the yearly cost to $50. That includes the base features along with the aforementioned game libraries as well Mario Kart 8 Deluxe’s Booster Course Pass, Animal Crossing: New Horizons Happy Home Paradise pack, and more.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-confirmed-for-nintendo-switch-2-as-a-launch-title/1100-6530557/">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</a> seem like they could be the most technically ambitious games coming to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. But neither surprised Digital Foundry as much as Ubisoft's Star Wars Outlaws--an open-world title that is current-gen only and never arrived on PS4 and Xbox One.</p><p dir="ltr">Digital Foundry technology editor Richard Leadbetter opened up the discussion about Star Wars Outlaws on Switch 2 on this week's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZZAr1c0Wqg">DF Direct</a> podcast (seen below). "I think this one's quite surprising, to be honest, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/star-wars-outlaws-review-missing-the-mark/1900-6418273/">Star Wars Outlaws</a>," said Leadbetter. "This is like a technologically demanding game on the new Snowdrop engine for Ubisoft Massive. The concept that it's running on this class of hardware is pretty mind-blowing, I'd say."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZZAr1c0Wqg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EZZAr1c0Wqg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Leadbetter wasn't alone, as the rest of the crew seemed quite intrigued by Ubisoft bringing Star Wars Outlaws to Switch 2. In fact, Digital Foundry contributor Oliver Mackenzie called it "a really exciting port, possibly an impossible port, if you will." That's because it's such a large game utilizing features like ray tracing. Plus, there isn't say a PS4 edition, while other third-party titles like Elden Ring and Street Fighter 6 did come to last-gen consoles.</p><p dir="ltr">All of that led to Digital Foundry video producer ​​Alex Battaglia saying, "This is by far the most technically ambitious game that we've seen mentioned as having been ported to Switch 2, like by far." The crew believes the Xbox Series S version of Star Wars Outlaws could give us a clue of what to expect on Nintendo's upcoming system. However, Leadbetter noted how Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora struggled when he played that on an Asus ROG Ally, since both games share the Snowdrop engine.</p><p dir="ltr">Star Wars Outlaws originally launched on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S in August and follows the adventures of Kay Vess in the Outer Rim. Ubisoft has continued to overhaul the game since release, such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-is-dropping-forced-stealth-so-you-can-start-blasting-your-way-out-of-trouble/1100-6527925/">dropping forced stealth</a>. Star Wars Outlaws has also received <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/landos-back-in-star-wars-outlaw-wild-card-launch-trailer/1100-6527960/">story DLC in which you get to team up with Lando Calrissian</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">There is no release date for Star Wars Outlaws on Switch 2 yet, though it is planned to arrive this year.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> Season 2 begins today, which means it’s time to jam another syringe into the scarred and bleeding flanks of the Great Marvelbeast and extract a fresh superhero. This season kicks off with Emma Frost, a Vanguard hero with very large hams and a couple of strings to her bow. By default, she fights as a midranged psychic, casting beams, damage-multiplying orbs and crystalline shields. Switch to her diamond form, however, and she becomes a tanky brawler with the ability to grab and slam people out of their ultimates or boot them into walls.</p><!--more-->

<p>That’s your first new Marvel Rivals character in Season 2, out now. The second will be Ultron, the bot with a god complex, who lands in a few weeks. He’s a nimble Strategist who does his dirty work using drones. More details to follow.</p>
<p>There’s also a new map, the Krakoa Hellfire Gala. It’s the kind of high society do where you’d expect to find Agent 47 pushing a mop, eyes peeled for weaponisable suitcases. Hmm, how would a Hitman party level work if all the guests were superheroes? I can’t really see Agent 47 dragging Ultron into a closet and stealing his trousers.</p>
<p>The new Marvel Rivals heroes and map accompany the usual live service avalanche of character skins and balancing or structural changes. There will now be weekly missions in addition to daily missions and challenges. Ranked mode is being given a rigorous rejig: the minimum level for competitive will now be 15, not 10, and players in Eternity and above will only be able to queue alone or in pairs to stop people forming big groups in advance. We can expect <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/%E2%80%9Dhttps://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marvel-rivals-season-2-will-add-more-team-up-skills-plus-the-usual-new-heroes%E2%80%9D">new team-up skills</a> (and the loss of a couple of older ones). </p>
<p>Possibly most anticipated is the addition of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marvel-rivals-performance-bottlenecks-are-a-very-big-problem-agree-netease-but-dont-worry-theyre-adding-a-box">a box that makes your computer go faster</a>. This being the new switch shader compilation mode, an experimental performance-boosting feature which is being added to the game’s launcher.</p>
<p>“Since our launch, we've heard your battle cries through the community and customer service channels,” <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2767030/view/541101973283275818?l=english">explains a blog post</a>. “Players on various PC configurations have encountered performance stutters and crashes, often due to high memory consumption during gameplay. PCs equipped with 16GB of RAM or less, when faced with excessive RAM usage can force the system to use swap memory, leading to unwanted slowdowns in the heat of battle.”</p>
<p>The switch shader compilation feature promises to “dramatically reduce” the game’s memory usage, “cutting down on severe FPS drops, frozen visuals, and crashes triggered by memory shortages.” The developers caution, however, that it might have a few teething troubles to begin with.</p>
<p>NetEase have elsewhere revealed that from Season 3 onwards, each Marvel Rivals update will only last two months instead of three, which means you’ll get a new hero every month. Which is a lot of heroes. I hope the developers aren’t crunching to meet the demand. NetEase <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/netease-reward-us-based-developers-of-live-service-hit-marvel-rivals-by-sacrificing-their-jobs-to-efficiency">don’t have a spotless track record</a> for looking after their staff.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>I’m of the opinion that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-train">Monster Train</a> is one of the best roguelike deckbuilders ever made. Frankly, I prefer it to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/07/04/slay-the-spire-review/">Slay the Spire</a>, and I think that mixing in tower defence elements was a stroke of genius that allowed the game to become more interesting overall. So, you can imagine that I was pretty excited about the idea of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-train-2">Monster Train 2</a>. You’ll be happy to hear that I adore what I’ve played of the second game so far, and I can’t wait for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/01/monster-train-2-pulls-in-for-release-in-may/">the full release in May</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monster Train 2 Release Date Trailer | Coming May 21" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ryQ0iFNC5pY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Monster Train 2 takes place after the first game – shocking, I know – and has you teaming up with some former angels who were previously fighting against to try and take out the mighty Titans who’ve taken control of Heaven. It’s basically an excuse to go up to Heaven instead of down to the depths of Hell, but you’ve still got to protect your Pyre to succeed.</p>


<p>The core gameplay loop is very much the same at the outset. You choose two clans to begin with, and then set off on a journey where you place your units and cast spells to try and come out on top in various battles.</p>
<p>You can upgrade your units and spells as you go, and also grab special artifacts that’ll help you gain more universal buffs, or really niche but powerful ones. Where you place your units and the synergies you manage to pick up are essential to actually succeeding, and putting one unit on the wrong floor or wrong position can really mess things up. That’s all the stuff we had last time, so let’s chat about what’s new.</p>


<p>In terms of combat, you can now get room cards and equipment cards. Rooms give buffs on a specific floor, and equipment cards are a new way to give even more buffs to units, with some of the clans really wanting you to focus on them. You can also fuse different equipment cards together to make them even stronger, but while also combining their cost. It means you can make a single card that’ll take a weak unit into one that can solo and entire battle, which is fun.</p>
<p>You’ve then also got the ability to change your Pyre Heart, which allows it to have different stats and different abilities. My favourite lets you click it once per battle to gain three energy, but there are a bunch to unlock and play around with. Then there are random events that give out lroe, train customization, and more. It’s a lot, and it’s all really good.</p>

<p>While I’m going to wait to make my full verdict until I’ve played the final version of Monster Train 2, I’m also still going to be playing this version of it for as long as I can because it’s just so damn entertaining! It’s fluid, the new mechanics all make perfect sense, and there are plenty of interesting builds to mess around with and try and figure out. If you liked Monster Train, you’re going to love Monster Train 2.</p>

			<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will use the power of the PlayStation 5 Pro to offer an enhanced experience over the base hardware running at native 4K resolution.</p>
<p>In a new post on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/11/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-comes-to-ps5-on-april-17-with-ps5-pro-enhancements/">Official PlayStation Blog</a>, it has been confirmed that the excellent game developed by MachineGames, launching on Sony's consoles next week on April 17th, will be a PlayStation 5 Pro Enhanced game. The optimized console performance on the system will offer higher and more consistent frame rates, native 4K resolution, and advanced ray tracing. Sadly, no other detail has been provided, but it's definitely impressive to learn that the power of the mid-generation refresh system allows for native 4K resolution gameplay in a demanding game such as this.</p>
<p>While Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will likely play best on PlayStation 5 Pro, the game will be perfectly enjoyable on base hardware as well. Besides featuring faster streaming and loading with frictionless loading and SSD optimization, the game will take advantage of the system CPU and GPU to achieve stable 60 FPS with high-quality resolution. Completely new to all versions of the game will be support for the DualSense controller features, such as haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, and unique usage of the controller's lightbar, which will provide visual feedback about Indy's current status with different colors.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/minecraft-movies-success-continues-the-trend-of-film-tv-adaptations-bolstering-game-sales-and-engagement/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-minecraft-movie-marks-new-opening-record-for-a-videogame-adaptation/">Minecraft movie</a> is the latest video game adaptation to find wild financial success that goes beyond any realistic expectations viewers and industry professionals might have had for it. So it's no surprise that the film has also continued the trend of an adaptation, leading to more game sales.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/what-does-the-minecraft-movie-and">The Game Business</a>, following the launch of the Minecraft movie, daily active users in Minecraft rose 9% week-on-week, according to Ampere Analysis data. Minecraft sales, particularly on Nintendo Switch, went up 25% per Nielsen/GfK data before the movie was released and another 8% after the movie launched.</p>
<p>The Game Business then goes on to show how the Minecraft film is participating in what's now become a trend with film and TV adaptations of video games. Regardless of whether the adaptation is good, engagement and game sales get a nice spike. Some are smaller than others, but the point is that the line goes up in every case.</p>
<p>Even without financial success, like in the case of the Borderlands movie. Critics have panned the Minecraft movie, but it's a major box office success, so game sales and engagement both getting a bump makes sense. Critics also panned the Borderlands film, and it was also a box office failure. It still led to a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-movie-may-have-bombed-but-it-still-helped-sell-more-games/1100-6527626/">bump in sales</a> for the Borderlands series. However, as The Game Business does, it should be noted that a 90% discount on Borderlands 3 at the time also helped.</p>
<p>The Fallout TV show led to a <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-4-sales/">bump in sales for Fallout 4,</a> and HBO's The Last of Us led to a massive spike in sales for both The Last of Us games. The Super Mario Bros. movie increased the sales of Mario games and Nintendo merchandise. As The Game Business points out, the Gran Turismo movie, the Halo TV show, and the Five Nights at Freddy's film all boosted game sales and engagement for the games they were adapted from.</p>
<p>Microsoft's Minecraft movie is the latest to participate in this trend, and it is another sign that the video game industry is very interested in keeping these adaptations going, just as Hollywood is excited to have finally found a way to mine a new bevy of popular series that'll help fill seats in movie theatres.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/infinity-nikki-steam-release-date-set-for-the-end-of-april.1161897/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/infinity-nikki-steam-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Infold Games has announced the&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>Steam release date, with the cozy open-world adventure on its way to Valve's platform later this month.</p>

<p>Back in February, Infold revealed that&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>would be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/infinity-nikki-steam-confirmed" rel="nofollow">making its way to Steam</a>, and now, in a <a href="https://x.com/InfinityNikkiEN/status/1910543603606446579" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on social media platform X, the studio has confirmed that the game's Steam release date is April 29th.</p>

<p>What's more,&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>has apparently surpassed 200,000 wishlists on Steam, and to celebrate, Infold is gifting players with 10 of the game's Resonite Crystal currency, which you can use as part of the gacha system. That's on top of the items that were already promised for the 100,000 wishlist goal.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/infinity-nikki-steam-release-date-rainbow.jpg?itok=9y_bMxWv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/infinity-nikki-steam-release-date-rainbow.jpg?itok=0WHVE9vP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>is heading to Steam later this month.</figcaption></figure><p>It's not just the Resonite Crystals, either; you'll also be getting 3 Energy Crystals "and more as special gifts", and all you need to do to claim them is to play the game after its Steam launch on April 29th.</p>

<p>It doesn't sound like you'll need to be playing&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>on Steam to reap the rewards, either; rather, it sounds as though all players will be getting these rewards, even if they're on console. Huzzah!</p>

<p>Given&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki</em>'s popularity, it's not hard to see why Infold wants to bring it to Steam. The game managed to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/infinity-nikki-downloads-10m" rel="nofollow">hit 10 million downloads</a> within its first few days of release, and that number is only going to go up now it's coming to Valve's storefront.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>is, it's a cutesy, cozy open-world adventure that emphasizes platforming and minigames over traditional combat (although it's got its own spin on that too).</p>




<p>Playing as Nikki and her companion Momo, you'll explore the world of Miraland, meet its inhabitants, and discover its mysteries. The game has a gacha system, too, through which you can obtain new outfits and clothing pieces for Nikki.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>on <a href="https://infinitynikki.infoldgames.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices</a>&nbsp;right now, and the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3164330/Infinity_Nikki/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam version</a> is set to launch on April 29th.</p>

While the upgrade is free for Switch Online Expansion Pack subscribers, it’ll be $10 for everyone else, making <em>Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> a $70 game on Switch 2. </p><p>But Nintendo <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wilds-nintendo-switch-2-edition-wont-include-the-dlc&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wilds-nintendo-switch-2-edition-wont-include-the-dlc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently confirmed to<em> IGN</em></a></span> that that version still won’t include the game’s year-one DLC. The <em>Breath of the Wild</em> Expansion Pass, which contains a harder difficulty mode, more gear, additional side quests, new story missions, and an honest-to-god motorcycle, will still be locked behind an additional $20 upgrade. In other words, anyone coming to<em> Breath of the Wild</em> for the first time on Switch 2 will need to spend $90 for the full experience. The price of saving Hyrule has never been so high. </p><p>Contrast Nintendo’s approach to its eight-year old mega hit with CD Projekt Red’s to <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>. Both games have sold over 30 million copies. Both games are dense open-world adventures. Both are coming to Switch 2. Both will be $70 there. Except<em> Cyberpunk 2077 </em>will include its <em>Phantom Liberty</em> expansion which came out less than two years ago as a “Complete Edition” pack-in at no extra charge.

If an ongoing trade war doesn’t completely sabotage the launch in the U.S., early adopters may go hands-on with the Switch 2 on June 5 and instantly fall in love, forgetting all of the current noise and bellyaching. But in the meantime it’s all we have, and the nickel-and-diming has gotten completely out of control. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is set to release on PlayStation 5 (PS5) on April 17, and with it comes enhancements for the game on the PS5 Pro.</p>



<p>In a post on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/11/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-comes-to-ps5-on-april-17-with-ps5-pro-enhancements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Blog</a>, Bethesda went into details on what players with the high-end console will get when they load up the game.</p>



<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will have native 4K resolution on the system along with advanced ray tracing features. The goal of the optimizations, per Bethesda, is to ensure players “achieve higher and more consistent frame rates”.</p>



<p>“Playing Indiana Jones and the Great Circle at a native 4K resolution really is the best way to appreciate the level of detail the team at MachineGames has poured into every corner of the world,” production director John Jennings said via the post. “You could spend hours just walking around the different environments admiring every little thing, from each artifact in Marshall College’s impressive collection to the verdant beauty of Sukhothai’s jungles.”</p>



<h2 id="h-other-ps5-features-for-indiana-jones">Other PS5 Features For Indiana Jones</h2>



<p>Aside from the PS5 Pro enhancements, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on PS5 will utilize the DualSense controller’s haptic feedback and adaptive triggers. The controller’s light bar will also give players visual feedback into Indy’s current status.</p>



<p>“For example, when you enter combat, the LED light around the touchpad will turn yellow, or pulse yellow if the NPCs are searching for you,” Bethesda’s Anne Lewis writes. “If your health gets low, the light will pulse red until you heal up. Using a consumable to restore health like food or a bandage will turn the light green for a few seconds.”</p>



<p>Other features on the console include SSD optimization, 60 frames per second, 3D audio, HD rumble, and more.</p>

                <p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is whipping its way onto PS5 on April 17--or April 15 as an early access bonus for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-edition-preorders-are-live-including-a-collectors-edition/1100-6530384/">Premium and Collector's Edition preorders</a>--and several of the new features for the game on Sony's platform have been revealed. That includes the PS5 Pro features that will distinguish it from other console versions, including Xbox.</p><p>Starting in the controller department, the DualSense's haptic feedback and adaptive triggers have been tied to several parts of the game, including combat, exploration, and using Indy's tools. Bethesda added (via the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/11/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-comes-to-ps5-on-april-17-with-ps5-pro-enhancements/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS Blog</a>) that the controller's lightbar is connected to game actions, with some examples being the LED light pulsing yellow if NPCs are searching for you or red if your health is low.</p><p>On the performance side, Bethesda explained that the game will benefit from numerous technical features, like frictionless loading, selective installation, and SSD optimization on PS5 and PS5 Pro. The game targets a stable 60fps on PS5 consoles, and if you find yourself stumped by any of the puzzles, you can consult the Community Game Help hub for tips on how to progress through certain sections.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1343973721" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

            <p>In just under a week, PlayStation users will be able to don the iconic fedora and whip of Indiana Jones, with the arrival of the Great Circle on PS5.</p>
<p>Ahead of this, the team has shared a few more details on what players can expect, both in terms of DualSense features and console performance.</p>

<p>On the DualSense side of things, players will notice their lightbar changes depending on what's going on in-game. When Indy enters combat, for example, the light around the touchpad will turn yellow. If NPCs are on the search for Indy, it will pulse yellow, and if his health gets low, it will pulse red.</p>
<p>Performance wise, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> "benefits from frictionless loading", Bethesda said, as well as "selective installation that prioritises your system language (other languages can be installed separately), and SSD optimisation, ensuring a seamless experience with faster streaming and loading".</p>
<p>The game will also come with a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> enhanced label on its release, which will give users higher and more consistent framerates when playing. This Pro also promises image clarity thanks to its native 4K resolution and advanced ray tracing.</p>
<p>"Playing Indiana Jones and the Great Circle at a native 4K resolution really is the best way to appreciate the level of detail the team at MachineGames has poured into every corner of the world," production director John Jennings says. "You could spend hours just walking around the different environments admiring every little thing, from each artifact in Marshall College's impressive collection to the verdant beauty of Sukhothai's jungles."</p>
<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-release-date-confirmed">make its PS5 debut on 17th April</a>. You can check out <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/11/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-comes-to-ps5-on-april-17-with-ps5-pro-enhancements/">full details on the PlayStation blog</a>.</p>

<p>We awarded Indiana Jones and the Great Circle five stars on its release. "Indiana Jones really feels like he comes full circle (sorry) in this latest adventure. At long last, there's an Indy game that nails both the puzzles and the kind of action we know so well from the films, and it does so with wit, charm and a real eye for spectacle," Katharine Castle wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Eurogamer's Indiana Jones and the Great Circle review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
