              <p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> just swept at The Game Awards. French studio Sandfall Interactive—the devs behind this stylistic turn-based RPG—set a record for the show winning in nine separate categories including Game of the Year. Want to see what all the fuss is about? Secure yourself an Xbox Series X to play it in beautiful 4K. The full MSRP as of late has been $650 for Xbox’s most elite gaming console. However for a limited time, Amazon is selling it for an 8% discount. This shaves the price down by $50, bringing it to just $600.</p>
<p>Okay, let’s take a quick detour into the Xbox Series X’s price history. Back when the Xbox Series X and Series S first launched in 2020, the former of which was priced at just $500. Back in May, Microsoft announced the company would be increasing the console prices, which raised the Series X by a whole $100 to $600. Then just a couple months back, they did it again—by $50 to $650. This might just be the only console generation to see it’s systems go up in price rather than down. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6384/">So with all that said, this discount does save you $50, by bringing the Xbox consoles back down to it’s Spring and Summer MSRP.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6384/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Xbox Series X vs. Xbox Series S</h2>
<p>When looking at the Xbox Series X next to it’s more affordable counterpart—the Xbox Series S—you’ll find some substantial perks that justifies the price gap. For one, the Xbox Series X can play games in 4K resolutions. Both consoles are capable of running games with fast refresh rates of up to 120fps and support HDR content.</p>
<p>The Series X is also equipped with a disc drive. If you value keeping a physical collection of your games, the the Xbox Series X is the way to go. It’s also good to have at least one Blu-ray player in the house and this console can be that for your home.</p>



<p>Both the Xbox Series X and the Xbox Series S makes use of the Xbox Velocity Architecture. This Microsoft tech is what makes the consoles super-fast load times possible. It also allows support for Quick Resume. This feature allows you to hop back and forth between games without having to close out or restart them. They will suspend your progress and return you right to where you were when you last had on the game. No need to hunt down a save point before shutting down for the day.</p>
<p>Enjoy streaming your favorite TV shows and movies right from the Xbox. You can download all the apps like YouTube, Netflix, HBO Max, or Dropout, and watch supported content in full 4K and HDR.</p>
<p>To get the full experience Xbox has to offer, subscribe to Game Pass Ultimate. This comes with the ability to play multiplayer games over Xbox Live as well as a lengthy catalogue of games to play at your fingertips. It’s Netflix, but for video games. And guess what? The multi-award-winning <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> is part of the Game Pass library. Pop in and see for yourself why its so critically acclaimed.</p>

            <p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's new patch shadow-dropped earlier this week, and Sandfall Interactive sure wasn't kidding when it promised "challenging boss battles for late-game players to overcome within the Endless Tower".</p>
<p>Along with new playable environment Verso's Drafts, localisation efforts, and costumes, Patch 1.5.0 introduced "new boss battles for late-game players to overcome in the Endless Tower", described as "variations of iconic bosses from the main game, designed to be even more challenging". This includes a brutal reimagining of Simon, one of the RPG's hardest bosses.</p>

<p>Almost unbelievably, the Divergent Star version of Simon is even more challenging than his brutal vanilla appearance, and social media is filling up with players who are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/expedition33/comments/1pmh5y4/the_new_dlc_is_incredible_the_new_endless_tower/">stumped</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/expedition33/comments/1pmfxij/ok_so_how_are_we_supposed_to_tackle_this/">shocked</a>, and struggling not just with Simon, but the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/expedition33/comments/1plaela/comment/nttdjz4/">new red ring</a> diving board <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/expedition33/comments/1pmfgxo/33_centimeters_away_from_glory/">challenge</a>, too.</p><p>"I honestly played many games considered 'hard', but this is driving me insane....," said one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/expedition33/comments/1pmf9va/are_dlc_bosses_one_of_the_hardest_in_video_game/">player</a>. "I beated [sic] Simon in expert within 10 tries, then Osquio also in expert on my second attempt. But these 4 bosses in the Endless Tower are something else... I don't think i've ever encountered anything that hard ever, Simon specially."</p>
<p>Another, in a thread entitled <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/expedition33/comments/1pmefqk/this_dlc_thing_is_a_joke/">"This DLC thing is a joke?"</a>, wrote: "I finally 'beat' Osqio after hours upon hours of trying. The last battle took about 1.5h, no joke. And then I mistime a gradient attack at the end and it’s all over? No reserve team, no resurrection? So I’ll have to go through those 1.5h again without failing just to get another chance, and probably fail, the gradient parry again?</p>
<p>"I mean overall this DLC is amazing, but this is something I honestly hate. I won’t give this more tries probably, I don’t have 8 hours to waste to get maybe 5 tries at parrying something that leads to instant death."</p>
<p>The previously revealed expansion to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> is available right now, as announced at The Game Awards. Developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-will-receive-new-update-with-a-bit-of-whee-and-a-bit-of-whoo-as-studio-celebrates-new-sales-milestone">Sandfall Interactive told Eurogamer back in October</a> the update would include "a bit of whee, and a bit of whoo", hinting at a focus on lovable sidekick Esquie. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-expansion-is-available-right-now-adding-a-photo-mode-and-vibrant-new-world">The expansion's availability was confirmed by director Guillaume Broche as Expedition 33 won Game of the Year</a>, and the free update comes from the team "as our way of saying thank you" to "celebrate an incredible year".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/french-president-publicly-congratulates-clair-obscur-expedition-33-calling-the-game-of-the-year-win-a-historic-first">French President Emmanuel Macron has once again publicly congratulated Sandfall Interactive</a> for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, this time for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-is-game-of-the-year-but-what-about-everything-else-here-are-the-winners-of-the-2025-game-awards">securing a record-breaking nine wins at The Game Awards earlier this week</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/forget-samsung-odyssey-alienware-restocks-its-34-curved-gaming-monitor-at-an-all-time-low-after-sellout-2000651038</link>
            <guid>1382893</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="129" data-end="949">If you’ve never spent time using a curved monitor, it’s easy to assume the design is just a marketing trick. I used to think the same until I started gaming on one myself. Once you’re positioned at the ideal distance and angle, the curve subtly pulls you into whatever you’re playing or watching in a way that a flat screen doesn’t quite match. The viewing experience feels more natural as the display envelopes your view. Curved monitors have come down in price over the last several years, so they’re far more accessible additions to gaming setups today. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6383/">A great example is the Alienware 34-inch curved gaming monitor, which is currently 28% off.</a> Although it normally lists for $699 on Amazon, the discount drops it to just $500—leaving you with an extra $199 in your pocket.</p>
<p data-start="993" data-end="1509">Alienware’s 34-inch OLED monitor makes a strong first impression through its sheer size and shape. The ultrawide screen features a 1800R curvature, a design meant to better align with the natural way our eyes perceive the world. We don’t see our surroundings in a flat rectangle; our view is curved and panoramic. That’s why displays like this can make games feel more cinematic and immersive. The curved layout draws your attention toward the center while still keeping peripheral details within comfortable view.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6383/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="993" data-end="1509">Lag-Free Gameplay</h2>
<p data-start="1511" data-end="1948">In terms of performance, the monitor delivers a crisp QHD 1440p resolution, backed by a fast 165 Hz maximum refresh rate. This combination ensures smooth, responsive motion, which is especially valuable in fast-paced games. AMD FreeSync Premium and VESA Adaptive Sync both work to reduce stuttering and eliminate screen tearing for a consistently fluid gaming experience.</p>
<p data-start="1511" data-end="1948">Remarkably, this monitor’s input time i just 0.1ms. You read that right. Not 1ms, but 0.1ms. You kind of don’t realize just what a game changer a good response time is until you’ve experienced it, and this is the industry’s fastest.</p>


<p data-start="1950" data-end="2355">We also know extended screen time can strain your eyes, particularly with bright displays. For long sessions—whether you’re gaming, editing, or working—the Alienware curved monitor includes hardware-driven blue light reduction settings accessible through its onboard console. This helps maintain visual comfort while still delivering rich colors and contrast, so you don’t have to sacrifice image quality.</p>
<p data-start="2357" data-end="2881">Connectivity is another strong point. On the back, you’ll find an HDMI ports and two DisplayPorts, allowing you to connect multiple devices simultaneously. You might use it primarily with your gaming PC, while also keeping something like a Nintendo Switch 2 plugged in and ready. Switching between inputs is seamless, saving you from unplugging cables or rearranging your entire setup. The monitor also includes multiple USB ports for added convenience.</p>
<p data-start="3089" data-end="3252" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6383/">For a limited time, you can pick up the Alienware 34-inch curved gaming monitor for just $500—a strong value for anyone looking to make the best of their gaming experience.</a></p>

            <p>Saber Interactive and Boss Team Games has released a developer diary for the upcoming horror, Clive Barker's Hellraiser: Revival, revealing a little more about what we can expect from the all-new story and its, uh, "mature" themes.</p>
<p>Revealed at last night's 2025 Horror Game Awards, the seven-minute teaser includes an interview with Hellraiser himself, Doug Bradley, who reprises the titular role. In the interview, he revealed that when he heard that a Hellraiser game was on the way, his first thought was: "At last! What kept you?"</p>

<p>As art director Petra Nikolic explained, the game has "a lot of sexual[ly] explicit stuff, and a lot of gore, and a lot of violence", so make sure you aren't next to your kids or your boss before the video clicking above. In fact, game director Emil Esov advises anyone "sensitive" to mature themes should "be wary".</p><p>Esov describes Hellraiser: Revival as a "discomforting and dark story about people with inner voids. It's like a mix between violence and action, all wrapped in leather, flesh, and chains" and said it should appeal to fans of psychological horror and Pinhead himself.</p>
<p>The team also discussed working with noted horror writer Clive Barker, who was keen that the developers "understood the soul" of the work before taking on the game.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/first-ever-hellraiser-game-announced-with-doug-bradley-returning-as-pinhead">The first-ever Hellraiser game – described as a single-player, survival horror action release – was announced in July</a>, with the team behind it all promising the chance to experience the series "like never before". It will deliver a totally new Hellraiser story starring Aidan, who is on a journey to save his girlfriend Sunny from Hell and "the realm of terrors ahead".</p>
<p>"Using the Genesis Configuration puzzle box, unlock dark and mysterious powers as you face dark cultist worshippers, sex-crazed deviants, and infernal monstrosities," the blurb teases. "Arm yourself with various jaw-dropping weapons - some cruel, some strangely fun - but will it be enough to spare you from an eternity of torment?"</p>
<p> Clive Barker's Hellraiser: Revival has no release date at present, but is slated to come to PC via Steam, PS5, and Xbox Series.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I still wouldn’t buy an Xbox Ally, and I still don’t think the tweaked version of Windows that shipped with it is ready for primetime. The Xbox Full Screen Experience (FSE) needs work. But two months after I <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/799698/xbox-ally-x-review-asus-microsoft-full-screen-experience">panned the cheaper $600 white Xbox Ally and wasn’t quite sold on the $1,000 black one</a>, one of my most-hated Windows issues is getting better.</p><p>I didn’t stop testing these handhelds <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/799698/xbox-ally-x-review-asus-microsoft-full-screen-experience">after my October review</a>; I’ve been playing <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> and <em>Blue Prince</em> on them. I installed FSE on an MSI Claw 8 AI Plus, too. And after too many updates to count, I’m finally beginning to trust two of these handhelds to save my game (and battery life) when I put them to sleep. Even the third isn’t as bad as it was.</p><p>Sleep has been the biggest reason to buy a Steam Deck or a Nintendo Switch over a Windows handheld. For me, it’s the whole point of handheld gaming. If I can pause and resume at any time just by pressing the power button, I can tackle big games five, 10, 20 minutes at a time and actually finish them. It’s a whole different gaming lifestyle when you don’t have to save and quit every session, and when you can just press one button to do it.</p><p>Windows has been <em>terrible</em> at sleep for years, but in December, I haven’t lost my game once with the pricier black Xbox Ally X when trusting it to sleep. I recently left a game open for almost exactly nine full days, and the game was right where I left off when I came back. Battery drain while sleeping seems reasonable, too: I’m only losing 4 to 8 percent of its battery from one day to the next. (I lost 40 percent of the battery during that nine-day span.)</p><p>There are other bugs: Sometimes I don’t have control right away after resuming from sleep; sometimes the Xbox and Asus buttons stop working for a bit when Windows decides to automatically update things in the background. And, after that nine-day stretch, Windows spontaneously decided I had to authenticate and reset my PIN before it’d let me log in.</p><p>Also, the SSD in my colleague Tom Warren’s Xbox Ally X died, so there’s that, but sleep worked reliably for him before then. Assuming the SSD is the drive maker’s fault, the Xbox Ally X is feeling like a product I can live with. (We’ve asked Asus about the SSD.)</p><p>The white vanilla Xbox Ally, with AMD’s Z2 A chip, is a different story. I’ve been testing <em>two</em> of them for months, and even after installing every Windows, Asus, Game Bar, and Xbox App update, including several that claimed to address sleep, I’ve watched both units repeatedly wake up without ever being touched. I’d leave them on my desk all day while I worked and watch them light up all by themselves, draining their batteries in the process.</p><p>On November 19th, I put a black Xbox Ally X and a white Xbox Ally to sleep, side by side, with 96 percent and 93 percent battery, respectively. Thirteen hours later, the white unit was completely dead, while the black unit was still at 91 percent.</p><p>On November 20th, I tried again at 88 percent and 82 percent battery, respectively. Nearly four days later, the white one was dead; the black one had 61 percent left.</p><p>I tried factory resetting one of the white units, and I think something has improved since then. I’ve had many days where my game’s waiting for me when I wake it from sleep. But on December 6th, I found it roasting itself inside my shoulder bag at 10:55AM. Logs showed me it woke itself up around midnight the previous evening and turned off its own screen at around 1AM, but never went back to sleep. Because its screen was off and its fan near silent, I didn’t notice it was still on when I put it in the bag.</p><p>And on December 7th, that same factory-reset, fully updated Xbox Ally mysteriously stopped charging overnight at 54 percent.</p><p>Asus claimed it wasn’t yet able to reproduce my issues. But I’m seeing these problems across two different units, I’ve seen scattered reports elsewhere on the web, and we know that the Xbox Ally’s AMD Z2 A processor fundamentally supports fewer sleep modes than the Xbox Ally X. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/807711/xbox-ally-sleep-fail-bazzite-fix-performance#:~:text=Two%20days%20after%20programmer%20Antheas%20Kapenekakis%20obtained%20the%20hardware%20and%20consulted%20with%20two%20contacts%20at%20AMD%2C%20the%20three%20fixed%20it">Bazzite had to consult with AMD</a> to get sleep working in Linux on the Z2 A chip.</p><p>I’m not sure why Microsoft is taking so long to fix it in Windows, or how complicated the issue might be there. Microsoft didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment, and hasn’t offered me a substantive comment in the past. But I wonder if it might be unique to that Z2 A chip, because I’m not having much trouble with the Intel Lunar Lake inside the MSI Claw 8 AI Plus, either, now that I’ve manually <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/812970/xbox-full-screen-experience-is-worse-on-my-msi-claw-than-it-is-on-the-xbox-ally">updated to a later BIOS that wasn’t showing up</a> when I first tested the Xbox experience there.</p><p>With the Intel Claw 8, a handheld <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/769609/msi-claw-8-ai-plus-intel-review">I originally couldn’t trust to sleep</a>, I now can — and I’ve seen battery drain as little as 2 percent per day while it’s snoozing. I ran into bugs in the Insider Preview, including one black screen and a persistent issue that capped my frame rate at 30fps until I changed power modes, but bugs are to be expected there.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/22960536/steam-deck-faq-valve-one-month-later">It took time for the Steam Deck</a> to be fully baked, and perhaps Microsoft needs some time too. If it’s finally figured out how to put a PC to sleep, and the vanilla Xbox Ally is just one exception, that’ll change the whole conversation around Windows handhelds.</p><p>Even today, the vanilla Xbox Ally may no longer be a bad deal. You can currently find it <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0FM6C3ZMN?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">for $489 at Amazon</a>, or <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.asus.com%2Fus%2Frog-xbox-ally.html" rel="sponsored">$499 at Asus</a>, and just <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.asus.com%2Fus%2Frog-xbox-ally.html" rel="sponsored">install Bazzite instead</a>. Bazzite is more reliable than Windows, has higher performance, and is just all around better in my tests, unless you play games that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/31/24284644/apex-legends-loses-linux-steam-deck-support-anti-cheat">use incompatible anti-cheat software</a> or you’re tightly tied to a library of “Xbox” PC games.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/843010/xbox-ally-x-sleep-battery-drain-two-months-later]]></content:encoded>

              <p>Forza Horizon 5 hit the PlayStation 5 storefront earlier this year. You best dip in to experience one of the best racing games of the generation. And if you want to make the experience extra special, get yourself the right tool to make it feel like you’re really behind the wheel—because you’re really be behind the wheel. A wheel. The Logitech G923 racing wheel and pedals for PlayStation consoles, PC, and Mac is heavily discounted at the moment. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6381/">The pair is normally sold for $400 at Amazon, but right now, it’s been brought down by 30%.</a> That cuts out a whole $130, bringing the price to just $280 for a limited time.</p>
<p>Not on PlayStation yourself? You’re an Xbox kid? Say no more. Amazon also has the same Logitech G923 racing wheel and pedals kit but for Xbox consoles.&nbsp; If you’re on PC, you get your pick of the litter. Either model will work for you. Just decide which you like better. Xbox’s AXYB setup, or PlayStation’s X, square, circle, triangle setup.</p>
<p>This racing kit is designed for ultra-realism. It’s all built out of premium materials. Brushed metal wheel with a hand-stitched black leather cover and polished metal petals.&nbsp; That’s nicer than what the wheel of my actual car looks like.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6381/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Fully Immersive Racing</h2>
<p>You need the weight of a real wheel in your hand to translate to full immersion with your racing game. Your movements are processed by the wheel at 4,000 times per second, ensuring you have the best control over your in-game car, and the provide feedback through the hardware to make it feel like you’re really putting rubber to the pavement. You’ll feel every little bump along the racetrack like you would in the seat of a real race car.</p>
<p>The wheel has a programmable dual clutch, allowing you to kick out of the starting line clean and fast. It simulates a real race car launch assist when playing with games that support it.</p>



<p>The pedals are pressure sensitive, allowing you to brake slowly or immediately like you would driving a real vehicle.</p>
<p>The levels of force feedback and wheel sensitivity is fully customizable. You can make any tweak you need from major to minor right in the Logitech G Hub app, which can be launched with one button press on the controller.</p>
<p>Now, pockets of the gaming community love to get their hands on weird controllers to speed run notoriously difficult games with them. Folks have become Elden Lord on a DDR pad or slain Crota with a Rock Band drum set. Are you one of these gamers? Maybe you can be the first to dethrone Grandmother Silk with a racing wheel and pedal kit. Just got to set your mind to it.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 4 Multiplayer Is Reportedly ‘A Complete Copy of Modern Warfare 2’]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The rumored Modern Warfare 4 release—set for 2026—allegedly copies almost all of its multiplayer components from 2022’s Modern Warfare 2 reboot, and excessive ‘visual recoil’ is reportedly back as well.</p>



<p>The Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 reboot wasn’t the most memorable CoD, but it was a huge success for Activision. Players aimed reservations at the multiplayer and other features, and if reports are true, those reservations might be repeated in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-2026-campaign-reportedly-set-in-north-south-korea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2026’s Modern Warfare 4</a>.</p>







<h2 id="h-modern-warfare-4-leaks-indicate-a-ton-of-visual-recoil">Modern Warfare 4 Leaks Indicate ‘A Ton Of Visual Recoil’</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Oh boy, here we go. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>Reputable leaker TheGhostOfHope delivered some bombshell news on December 14 about the upcoming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-2026-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoD 2026</a> game—rumored to be Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 4.</p>







<p>The first reveal was huge:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Modern Warfare 4 Multiplayer in its current state is currently a complete copy of Modern Warfare II except for no perk charging system and less ADS/slide penalties…”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>To what extent ‘a complete copy’ entails, we’re not sure, but it means we could have Platforms and Receivers back, leaving the community to scramble across all classes to unlock specific weapons and attachments. It was a convoluted and complex system that didn’t fit the usual casual unlock mechanics the franchise has become known for.</p>



<p>This might not be the smartest decision, and when prompted by a user, “Sooo… no Ninja and no red dots? FUNNNNN,” Hope simply replied: “Nope lol it’s literally MWII 2.0.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The leaks and reports didn’t stop there. Hope went on to explain about one of the prominent fixtures in MW4’s multiplayer:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“There is A TON of visual recoil on weapons in Modern Warfare 4 just like Modern Warfare II. Like I said in my last tweet it’s pretty much a complete copy outside of a few little things.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>After a lackluster Black Ops 7 in terms of revenue and player base, Activision really needs a win with Call of Duty 2026. The reception to Hope’s reports is already a bit frosty, to say the least, and the game is currently slated to release in and around GTA 6. It’ll be interesting to see if Hope’s leaks are true, and if so, how the CoD community would receive this.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">There is A TON of visual recoil on weapons in Modern Warfare 4 just like Modern Warfare II. Like I said in my last tweet it's pretty much a complete copy outside of a few little things.</p>— Hope (@TheGhostOfHope) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1999997428465090593?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 14, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-duel-metroid-prime-pinball">Last week's</a> epic battle saw Europe and North America go up against Japan to see which <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/metroid_prime_pinball">Metroid Prime Pinball</a> design is the very best. It was a close one, but in the end, Japan won the day with 55% of the vote. Bravo!</p>
<p>This time, to celebrate the announcement of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mega-man-dual-override">Mega Man: Dual Override</a> for Switch and Switch (though we have to wait until 2027 – ouch!), we're heading back to the NES to check out Mega Man 6. This one didn't launch in Europe, but saw a release in Japan in 1993 and the US in 1994. Basically around the same time that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/mega_man_x">Mega Man X</a> launched for the SNES, then.</p><div><figure data-videoid="1cjcr-XtVQw" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1cjcr-XtVQw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt1cjcr-XtVQw" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1cjcr-XtVQw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1cjcr-XtVQw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f68bgrwizy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<h2>North America</h2>
<figure data-uuid="29221beb7acd0"><a title="Mega Man 6 - NA" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/29221beb7acd0/mega-man-6-na.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/346-mega-man-6">Capcom / Launchbox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>In what is no doubt a slight break from tradition, the North American design here showcases Mega Man wearing the red Rush Jet Adaptor. It's a really cool composition, overall, and a huge step up from the disastrous box art designs for the earlier entries.</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure data-uuid="7d204b2b6d414"><a title="Mega Man 6 - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7d204b2b6d414/mega-man-6-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/346-mega-man-6">Capcom / Launchbox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Japan follows in the footsteps of prior entries by shoving as many characters on the front cover as humanly possible. Heck, it works though. The familiar yellow theme with the classic 'Rockman' logo looks wonderful, and the overall art style is quintessentially Mega Man.</p>

<p>Nintendo released a new update for the Switch 2 earlier this week, bumping the system up to Version 21.1.0. Once again, it's followed with Switch game compatibility updates.</p>
<p>Some of the highlights this week include <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_4">Resident Evil 4</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/miitopia">Miitopia</a>, which have had "previously identified issues" resolved. The game behaviour in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/little_nightmares_complete_edition">Little Nightmares: Complete Edition</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/streets_of_rage_4">Streets of Rage 4</a> on the Switch 2 is now also consistent with the experience on Switch.</p>
<p>Here's every Switch game that's received a Switch 2 compatibility update this week (via Nintendo Everything):</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067uhzwqn&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>Team Vitality and FaZe Clan will take to the stage later today in Budapest for a shot at a $500,000 prize and one of the most coveted trophies of 2025. The former team enters as the clear favorite, but FaZe Clan has managed to push into the grand final with some outsider energy that might sustain a final victory in 2025.</p>



<p>In this breakdown, we’re taking a closer look at the betting predictions for the StarLadder Budapest Major grand final, a frantic showdown between two very capable teams.</p>



<p>If you want to bet on the grand finals of the Budapest Major, look no further. Insider Gaming, together with the international betting brand GG.BET, brings you to the heart of unforgettable moments of the StarLadder Major Budapest 2025. Visit&nbsp;<a href="https://gg.bet/news/betbuilder-now-on-ggbet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gg.bet</a>&nbsp;to dive deeper, place your bets, and feel the adrenaline of esports!</p>



<figure><a href="https://gg.bet/news/betbuilder-now-on-ggbet" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"></a></figure>











<h2 id="h-will-vitality-dominate-the-final-run-of-2025">Will Vitality Dominate The Final Run of 2025?</h2>



<p>Team Vitality has been the most consistent force in Counter-Strike 2 throughout much of 2025. They have stormed through the major with clinical precision, defeating Team Spirit with a sweep in the semifinals and refusing to drop a map thus far.</p>



<p>ZywOo has led the roster to greater heights than this in 2025, and this is just another potential trophy for the jam-packed cabinet.</p>



<p>On the other side of the fence, you’ve got FaZe Clan, a team that has pushed for a miraculous run throughout this event. FaZe Clan also dropped from the running in the tournament’s opening stage, but stellar performances from the likes of broky, Twistzz, and, of course, karrigan, have kept them afloat.</p>



<p>However, we need to be critical ahead of the betting predictions for the StarLadder Budapest Major.</p>



<p>Team Vitality is easily the safe bet for the outright market. They’ve proven that already time and again this year, and if you want an easy (but small) return, you’ll float this wager.</p>



<p>For bigger potential returns and the love of the game, you might back FaZe Clan, as the final best-of-five could be anyone’s series in truth. That’s the beauty of Counter-Strike esports, and stranger things have happened.</p>



<p>If you want to have a flutter on MVP markets, consider backing ZywOo to take the accolade away.</p>



<p>Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> which team you think will win the StarLadder Budapest Major.</p>

<p>FaZe Clan has eliminated Natus Vincere to reach the grand final of the StarLadder Budapest Major. The team, which had a rocky road to get where it is, will now face Team Vitality with the hopes of securing a massive $500,000 grand prize. The team, led by the iconic karrigan, almost dropped in the first stage of the tournament, but the resilience from the squad has proven insane.</p>



<p>The semifinal clash against Natus Vincere could have gone either way, and it went to the wire, with FaZe Clan securing a 2-1 victory over the Ukrainian side.</p>

<h2 id="h-faze-clan-makes-the-grand-final">FaZe Clan Makes The Grand Final</h2>



<p>FaZe Clan will now need to contend with Team Vitality at the final post. This is a team that has dominated much of 2025 with near-flawless consistency. Recently, Team Vitality won awards based on its consistency this year, marking it as the greatest esports organization of 2025.</p>

<figure data-uuid="cdb9de8a84832"><a title="Tomb Raider" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/cdb9de8a84832/tomb-raider.large.jpg"></a></figure><p>Aspyr surprised Nintendo fans in November when it shadow dropped <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tomb-raider-definitive-edition">Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition</a> on Switch and Switch 2.</p>
<p>As mentioned in our review, it's not quite as "Definitive" as the name might imply – fortunately, there will be patch updates in the future. Speaking to Nintendo Everything recently, Aspyr product manager Jordon Reese mentioned how improvements are on the way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reese also confirmed that Aspyr intends “to make game improvements via patches over time so that the game can be the best possible experience for all players.” It’s unclear what that will entail, but we’ll keep our eyes out.</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="BvMG4aVuxgs" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BvMG4aVuxgs?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytBvMG4aVuxgs" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BvMG4aVuxgs?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BvMG4aVuxgs?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed6dee37ylkusq&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>In our own review for Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition on the Switch 2, we noted how the visual fidelity was lacking, despite the resolution bump. The team at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/digital-foundry-dives-into-tomb-raider-definitive-editions-big-downgrades-on-switch-2">Digital Foundry also highlighted some downgrades</a>. Despite this, this particular entry in the Tomb Raider series remains one of Lara Croft's best adventures.</p>
<p>If you missed, two new Tomb Raider games were also announced this week. One is a reimagining of the original game, due out in 2026, and the second title marks a brand-new chapter in the Tomb Raider series and will be arriving in 2027. There's no mention of Nintendo versions, but if we hear any updates, we'll let you know.</p>

One a them Star Wars was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-revealed-a-kotor-spiritual-successor-rpg-led-by-mass-effects-casey-hudson">announced</a> at the Let Geoff Have This He's Got Nothing Else Going On Awards this week, from none other than Casey Hudson. It's called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic">Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic</a>, a name that will instantly make any Knights of the Old Republic oldhead point at their screen that's Chappie style, which also happens to be a game that Hudson was project director on. The only problem with Fate of the Old Republic is that the studio that's making it only got started this year, calling into question how far away it is - a question that Hudson, kind of, answered.
</p>
<p>
As noted, developer of the game Arcanaut Studios is a wee babby of a studio, with RPS overlord Julian pointing out in his and Mark's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rps-verdict-the-game-awards-2025">Geoffies verdict</a> that optimistically, we'd be looking at a 2028 or 2029 release date for the game. Hudson's response to such an estimation (which is more likely in direct response to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3m7sj6bcoxk2o">some guy who often seems to know a lot about what happens in the industry</a>) is one of unconvincing substance. "Don’t worry about the 'not till 2030' rumors," he wrote on his personal Dwitter account. "Game will be out before then. I’m not getting any younger!"

<p>
You're honestly trying to convince us that a game of likely quite a large scale, with probably too many people working on it, that only has a quite short, pre-rendered trailer that shows off scenes you could find in literally any modern day Star Wars, will be out within the next four years? Hogwash! Malarkey! Balderdash! This isn't the '90s, or the 2000s, or even the 2010s, big name games almost always get delayed, whether it's internally or externally, and I can't see that not happening to this one.
</p>
<p>
For the sake of Hudson and his team at Arcanaut, I do genuinely hope they manage to get it done within such a timeframe, and done in a healthy manner, even if I don't believe it to be possible. You see the water droplets in that trailer? That looked like fricken' real life! If that's what they're aiming for, only the gods can help them.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">But it still feels far, far away.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">In the wake of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-announced-from-former-kotor-and-mass-effect-director-casey-hudson-the-game-awards-2025">Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic’s big announcement at The Game Awards</a>, you might have seen social media posts saying the game won't be out until 2030. Director Casey Hudson has now stepped in to address those posts, insisting the game will be out before then.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic is in development at Edmonton, Alberta-based developer Arcanaut Studios, which Hudson and his partners only founded in July. It stole the show at The Game Awards with a flashy, tantalising CG trailer that contained no gameplay. But fans are particularly excited because Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic is billed as the spiritual successor to the much-loved Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, which Hudson directed while at BioWare.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So where did all the “not till 2030” posts come from? It seems <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3m7sj6bcoxk2o" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a social media comment</a> from Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier, in which he called a 2030 release window an “optimistic guess” based on the fact the studio was founded this year, ended up being framed elsewhere online as “Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic may not release until at least 2030.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, Hudson himself has stepped in. “Don’t worry about the ‘not till 2030’ rumors,” <a href="https://x.com/CaseyDHudson/status/1999652683972489385" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hudson tweeted</a>. “Game will be out before then. I’m not getting any younger!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic is in “early development,” so it still feels a fair while away. But based on Hudson’s comment, it will launch at some point in 2029 <em>at the latest</em>, which is four years away. In that time, Hudson will need to build out his new studio (almost certainly a factor in announcing the game so early), which will be a huge effort all on its own, as well as build what is expected to be a high quality AAA game with huge fan expectations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Details are thin on the ground, but we do have some top-line information as well as enthusiasm from LucasFilm Games, which is collaborating with Arcanaut Studios on the project. Obviously Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic is set in the Old Republic era, given its name. It’s a “narrative-driven single-player action RPG” where you “step into the role of a Force user on a journey through a galaxy on the edge of rebirth.” We’re told players can expect an experience “where every decision deepens their journey toward light or darkness.” It sounds a lot like KOTOR, and while it may end up feeling a lot like KOTOR, Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic is a completely new and different story that will introduce new characters.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Star Wars Fate of the Old Republic Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’re still early in development, with many challenges ahead,” Hudson said in a blog post on <a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-trailer" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">StarWars.com</a>. “I’m grateful to have enjoyed the support of KOTOR fans for many years, and I look forward to embarking upon this journey together, sharing more of what we’re doing as soon as we can!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite Hudson’s comment reassuring fans, there is some debate about whether Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic will end up missing the current generation of consoles and end up launching on the PlayStation 6 and the next Xbox, as well as PC.

            <p>
There is something that lies in the belly of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metamorphosis">Metamorphosis</a> that makes me recoil. The surface level concept is easy enough to follow. It is a 2D pixel art <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> where you play as a "forsaken nun" who "walks the long road to absolution." The world you find yourself in in the game's demo is overbearing, crushing. Initially you find yourself in the depths of a church, and even that is worth questioning - what church has depths? When you come across a device, and what on the offset looks like gothic horror a la <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bloodborne">Bloodborne</a> becomes perplexingly technological.
</p>
<p>
This device is, mechanically speaking, your main menu. Booting up this menu, you are met with a voice, in text form, that asks you to speak to it. You type in help, literally, with your real-world keyboard, and it gives you a list of options: inventory, journal, settings, all of them with appropriate descriptions, and then OS, the only bit of detail about this option being "me." What else could OS be but operating system, and if that's true, what kind of a world is this?

<p>
These questions go unanswered in the demo, because why would they be, but we must press on. Which would be all well and good if pressing on wasn't such a challenge. Metamorphosis harbours a cruel reality, one where you can die quite quickly and easily, its disgustingly abstract enemies frightening enough to cause you to panic, the purposefully dim lighting causing you to second guess every shadow and precarious jump. Dying puts you right back to where you last saved, which can, of course, be longer ago than you wished it was, and further back to - you can only save at certain points, unless you have some candles to make temporary restore points.

Despite writing for a PC site, I am not particularly good at playing with a keyboard and mouse, and while Metamorphosis is playable on controller, most of the tutorialisation UI is for PC only, forcing me into the old ways as I wasn't sure which button did what. There are a lot of buttons to keep in mind in this game, making it a touch challenging in a potentially unfair way, though I can forgive this for now, as the atmosphere has won me over.

<p>
Metamorphosis doesn't have a release date just yet, but you can wishlist it on Steam, and maybe check out its demo for yourself, right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3470140/METAMORPHOSIS/">here</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Team Vitality has secured a prestigious place in the grand final of the Budapest Major after a thrilling semifinal victory over Team Spirit, one of the favorites to go all the way. In one of the most anticipated fixtures of the tournament, the powerhouse platform of Vitality easily overcame Team Spirit, issuing a 2-0 sweep to kick the Russian side out of the running.</p>



<p>Now, Team Vitality will wait patiently in the grand final slot, and Natus Vincere and FaZe Clan will duke it out for a shot at the grand final and the $500,000 prize.</p>



<p>If you want to place a wager on what’s left of the playoffs, Insider Gaming, together with the international betting brand GG.BET, brings you to the heart of unforgettable moments of the StarLadder Major Budapest 2025. Visit&nbsp;<a href="https://gg.bet/news/betbuilder-now-on-ggbet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gg.bet</a>&nbsp;to dive deeper, place your bets, and feel the adrenaline of esports!</p>



<figure></figure>







<h2 id="h-team-vitality-navi-and-faze-remain-in-budapest">Team Vitality, NAVI, and FaZe Remain in Budapest</h2>



<p>Team Spirit had one heck of a run thus far, with donk going so far as to set a new record, but it wasn’t enough to beat Vitality to the punch in Budapest. The first map of the series, Mirage, proved to be a tenuous enough battle, going long into overtime, but the second map, Dust II, was much easier for Vitality to handle.</p>



<p>Vitality has had a remarkable run in Budapest. The team failed to secure a perfect record in the tournament’s third stage ahead of the playoffs, but the squad has made up for that in the bracket by refusing to drop a single map.</p>



<p>The streak has been enough for ZywOo to rack up a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/zywoo-secures-record-for-best-map-performance-starladder/">new single-map Major record</a>.</p>



<p>In our recent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/budapest-semi-finals-predictions-and-betting-tips/">predictions piece for the semi-finals</a>, we accurately predicted that Team Vitality would make it through to the grand final, and we also suggested that Natus Vincere would rise to meet them. The accuracy of that prediction will be revealed very soon.</p>



<p>Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> who you think will secure the trophy tomorrow in Budapest.</p>

There has never been a time where the presence of a big Hollywood celeb making an appearance in a video game has drawn me in. Who cares! Most of the time they are not voice actors, and are just doing their own voice, maybe sometimes lending their face. And yet here we are with Matthew McConaughey, a man who is <a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/matthew-mcconaughey-michael-caine-ai-voice-elevenlabs-1236574041/">happily lending his voice to some AI software</a>, in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/exodus">Exodus</a>, a game that's basically just another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> from some folks who actually made Mass Effect. But! Said folks would like you to know that McConaughey's performance is all him, thanks very much.

<p>
"No, no. Everything that's in Exodus - 100 percent of what's in Exodus - is bespoke VO recording just for us," co-founder of Exodus studio Archetype Chad Robertson explained to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/matthew-mcconaughey-ai-voice-generation-but-sci-fi-rpg-exodus-authentically-him">Eurogamer</a> when asked if the Ghosts of Girlfriends Past actor was at all AI-generated in-game.

"He has a completely separate deal of his own design that he's worked out with Elevenlabs, which happens to be one of the most prominent, AI voice-generation tools, that is being used by other video game companies. Such that people could leverage his voice in non-bespoke VO sessions in a different way. He has a bunch of really strict rules around how it could be used. The reason I mentioned it more is that even stuff like that catches us off guard, because our engagement with Matthew is very specific."
</p><p>
Robertson also touched on what the studio's long-term stance on AI is, which is currently essentially they have none, but will "have to be smart and intelligent about how we adopt it ourselves," as the tech becomes more widely used. When it comes to Exodus, Robertson also clarified that there's no AI to be found in it: "With respect to the game, we don't have plans to use generative AI for any elements of it, but we reserve the right to change that if things require it to get the game at the quality that we need it, or the timeline or budget that we need. But currently that's not our plan."
</p>
<p>
A current lack of AI doesn't convince me of the game right now, personally. There's nothing about it that screams particularly unique <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-space-games-on-pc">sci-fi</a>, just perhaps expensive sci-fi, which is often the worst and most boring kind. Still, it's a while away until any of us find out if that is the case or not, as its Geoffies trailer also positioned it for a 2027 release date.

            <p>Former Striking Distance and Sledgehammer founder Glen Schofield has shared his concerns about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-privately-acquired-in-55bn-deal-by-group-of-investors-including-saudi-arabias-investment-fund-and-donald-trumps-son-in-law">the sale of his former employer, EA</a>, saying it's a "bittersweet moment" that reminds him of the sale of Activision to Microsoft.</p>
<p>"in the span of just a few years, the two publishing giants who shaped the last 20+ years of our industry have both entered new eras," he said.</p>
<p>"I spent roughly a decade at each company, right in their primes," he wrote to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/glenschofield_ea-and-activision-thank-you-when-the-news-activity-7405032019358851072-hPut/">LinkedIn</a>.

<p>"EA was buttoned-up, disciplined, and structured in a way that forced you to rise to the level of the room. Franchise reviews were intense – no shortcuts, no guessing. You had to know every inch of your game. And they’d challenge you, push you, test you. But when you walked out of that meeting, you knew exactly where you stood."</p><p>Reflecting on his first meeting as an executive producer, Schofield revealed that "being [at EA] felt like a creative all-star lineup", with "so many legends in one place". Activision, by contrast, "was a storm of A-type personalities, but in the best possible way".</p>
<p>"Review meetings were loud, passionate, borderline chaotic, with people calling out questions over one another," he said. "But the questions were sharp, focused, and always aimed at making the game better. A one-hour meeting becoming two and a half was normal and somehow, the time always felt well spent.</p>
<p>"So yes, it’s tough to watch these companies step back from what they once were: major publishers, major developers, and incredible places to grow, learn, and sharpen your craft. They trained generations of us. They made careers. Mine included."</p>
<p>But despite the "bittersweet" nature of his message, Schofield did acknowledged that the "bright side" of the acquisition means others will now be able to step up.</p>
<p>"New leaders. New studios. New publishers. Someone will take that mantle, we always do as an industry. And when they do, I hope they lead, teach, and invest in talent the way EA and Activision did. They set a bar that pushed all of us to be better. They’re both still around, and I sincerely wish them success in whatever comes next.</p>
<p>"From the bottom of my heart, thank you EA and Activision for an amazing run and for everything you helped me become."</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Eurogamer reported that Dead Space creator Glen Schofield <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-space-creator-hopeful-eas-new-owners-will-let-him-make-dead-space-4-promising-to-save-them-millions-of-dollars">was "already making calls" to EA's new owners in the hope he can make Dead Space 4</a>. Schofield was executive producer on the first Dead Space game in 2008, and while he wasn't involved in its two follow-ups, he later developed the spiritual successor <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-callisto-protocol">The Callisto Protocol</a> at Striking Distance Studios in 2022. He  <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-space-co-creator-glen-schofield-departs-callisto-protocol-studio-after-flop">left Striking Distance in 2023 after the game flopped</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Schofield posted on LinkedIn the games industry is "tough" after failing to obtain financial backing for his latest project, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-space-creator-glen-schofield-hints-at-retiring-from-game-development-after-struggling-to-fund-latest-project">hinting he may have directed his last game</a>.</p>

            <p>
It's funny to think that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/runescape-dragonwilds">RuneScape: Dragonwilds</a>, one of those cosy-ish, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> crafty type of games doesn't have farming just yet, but I suppose that's understandable given it is an early access game. Doesn't matter much either, as farming will be coming to the game next week as part of its Fellhollow update, which just got another look-in through a new gameplay trailer that also shows off all sorts of undead bashing you'll be doing.
</p>
<p>
Where thus far the game has presented a slightly more idyllic fantasy world, Fellhollow looks like it is filled with giant, very indigo orcish brutes, zombie-esque creatures with three flavours of haircut (bald on top, bald at the front, bald), a dragon (it's in the name!), and quite angry skeletons. Well, there's one friendly skeleton that's only a skull who makes a pun so groanworthy not even the strapline of an RPS story would welcome it.
</p>

<p>
That aforementioned dragon is a smaller one that appears to appear somewhere in the overworld, though it also looks like you'll be able to do noble battle with a much bigger, sometimes invisible, always with its chest completely cut open dragon that'll probably do a number on you and your mates if you're not careful.
</p><p>
And, of course there's the farming, which sounds suitably in depth. The type of seed your planting will need to be planted in a different kind of planter, ash, oak, or willow. Watering them requires some thinking, as you can either use dirty water from your watering can, or clean water from a well or raincatcher barrel. You can also forgo doing the watering yourself and cast a spell instead. There's even composting! And there are other new spells too like uproot, which as you can probably guess uproots any of your veggies from the ground.
</p>
<p>
It all seems varied enough, and I'm sure it will be enjoyable if you're particularly into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/runescape">RuneScape</a>'s flavour of fantasy. Fellhollow will be available as a free update next week, December 15th.
