<p>This one is more focused on general bug fixes and gameplay improvements, but it's a welcome update nonetheless. Highlights include fixes to soft-locks and freezing scenarios, collision issues, improved visual consistency, and more.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/ninja-gaiden-ragebound">Our review for Ragebound</a> was largely positive, stating that "the way it implements all of its mechanics, along with increasingly interesting, beautiful, and ever-taut stage design, is a treat". One of our key criticisms was that the frame rate can be a little bit dodgy, and while this may still be true on Switch, players on Switch 2 can enjoy much improved performance.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067hijzps&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>835k</span></a></p>

<li>Adjusted Rhyvashi’s encounters: <strong>improved stagger cooldown</strong> and prevented attacks from lingering after defeat.</li>

</ul>
<h3><strong>Gameplay Flow &amp; Checkpoints</strong></h3>

<li>Environmental hazards (lava, fire, etc.) now correctly respect <strong>accessibility knockback settings</strong>.<br>
Several background and asset display issues corrected (floating containers in S-8, mountain edges in S-3, camera transitions in 3-5).</li>
<li><strong>Music and dialogue triggers</strong> are fixed in multiple levels to align correctly with progression.<br></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Talismans &amp; Accessibility</strong></h3>

</ul>
<h3><strong>Enemies &amp; Animations</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Corrected <strong>erratic behavior</strong> in enemies like Bio Harpies, Flying Turrets, and Bio Blockers.</li>
<li>Fixed <strong>Kumori-specific issues</strong> (Guillotine charge talisman wrongly affecting Kenji, roll/jump behaviors).</li>

</ul>
<h3><strong>System &amp; Miscellaneous</strong></h3>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/former-tt-games-boss-opens-new-studio-to-make-games-set-in-peter-pan%E2%80%99s-neverland.1312363/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Tom Stone, former managing director at TT Games, the studio behind every major LEGO game (including the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-tt-games-gamescom-onl-2025/">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</a>), has left his most recent position as chair of FuturLab (the <a href="https://wccftech.com/futurlab-releases-final-powerwash-simulator-content-update-as-all-focus-shifts-to-powerwash-simulator-2/">Powerwash Simulator studio</a>) to open Second Star Games. Stone and his new studio is going back to what he did with TT Games for nearly two decades; not making LEGO games, of course, but making games based on licensed IP, starting with Neverland and the adventures of Peter Pan.</p>



<p>This all comes from a new interview with Stone on <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/former-tt-games-head-takes-on-peter-pan">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>, where he discusses his tenure at TT Games and the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/features/22891555/lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga-has-led-to-extensive-crunch-at-tt-games/">reports of crunch that went on at the studio for years</a>, all of which came to a head with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga/">LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</a>, and the attitude with which Stone and his 17 other studio members at Second Star Games approach their work now.</p>



<p>"<em>I think we're going to take a breath and look up occasionally.</em> <em>When we were making the LEGO games, it was intense. It was blood, sweat and tears. I loved every single moment of it, but upon reflection, we could</em> <em>have made fewer games slightly better and sold probably the same number of units that we sold</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>It was a pretty tough 15, 16, 17 years we had at TT. We were on a mission. We were focused. We achieved</em> <em>incredible things. Everything in life is a trade; people worked incredibly hard and the games were phenomenally successful. I don't think everyone complained that it was a tough culture. As happens, there were a number of people who justifiably and rightly said it was a tough environment; their voices were louder than the people who were saying they enjoyed working there and loved making LEGO games. Their voices weren't heard so much</em>." </p>



<p>Stone doesn't comment too much on what the studio will be working on, but does confirm what the studio's name already gives away, that they'll begin by making games based on Neverland and Peter Pan, but that's not all Stone wants his new team to do. Eventually, he wants the studio to have the same breadth of licensed titles that TT Games has.</p>



<p>"<em>The first is Neverland and the adventures of Peter Pan. Once we announced the studio, we actually had quite a lot of inbound interest, asking whether we'd be interested in working on this IP or that piece of IP. Obviously, we will be selective and thoughtful. We have to be mindful that we can't do it all at the same time, but the goal is to build out a stable of expertise in this young gamer space</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Peter Pan is the fire that everyone is watching</em>, <em>while they all gather around the television together. The vision is to build a stable,</em> <em>bring the thoroughbreds in, and have everyone playing together around a screen.</em>"</p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see what Stone and his new team bring to the table with Neverland and Peter Pan-based games, and whether they'll sway closer to the kind of puzzle-platforming adventures that he used to make at TT Games, or if they'll be something entirely new. A few key members of Second Star Games are former TT Games staff who Stone says are all like-minded and on the same page about how they work together.</p>



<p>"<em>We're currently a team of 18 full-time employees. Everyone's the same. We're all in this boat together. Everyone knows each other. We don't want an HR department. Everyone is there to support one another in building this game together</em>. <em>It's going to be tough and challenging because we're setting ourselves incredibly high goals. We had a meeting last week in the studio, where we agreed on a particular design feature, which is going to be very, very challenging to achieve."</em></p>



<p>"<em>If we are not going to do stuff like that, what's the point of doing it? If we aren't going to break through and make this game truly memorable, then why bother? Everyone is on board. Everyone knows we are going to set ourselves some really, really high bar challenges, and everyone wants to do it</em>."</p>

            <p>"That's not a minotaur, that's just a guy with horns," yells one of the YouTube commenters on the reveal trailer of Minos. They might be right with their Monty Python-esque accusation, but regardless of how much the maze-building <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> and its developers Artificer have put the cat amongst the Greek mythology-loving pigeons, the demo that's currently out for it is good fun.</p>

<p>Announced over the weekend by the devs of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sumerian-six-is-shadow-tactics-but-youre-hitting-nazis-in-the-back-of-the-skull-with-a-hammer">Sumerian Six</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/homicidal-all-stars-is-now-called-showgunners-releasing-in-may">Showgunners</a>, the premise of Minos is simple, but effective. You play as famed labyrinth architect Daedalus and his pet, the horny guy/minotaur Asterion. Hordes of plucky adventurers with various combat styles wish to slay Asterion, and the only things standing in the way of their waves are squares of maze which you can use your prep time to rearrange and line with sneaky traps.</p>
<p>'Oh, so it's like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dungeon-keeper">Dungeon Keeper</a>?' said Edwin upon listening to that explanation in this morning's meeting of the RPS hivemind. Yes, probably, I answered, going slightly red at the mention of yet another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-dungeon-keeper">classic game</a> I've yet to get around to playing for myself. Regardless of my dungeon keeping credentials, I enjoyed my dip into the demo for the currently release dateless Minos.</p><p>You start off by selecting a chamber in the labyrinth, which you'll have to defend against three or four waves of would-be-slayers with different fighting styles. The first wave enters the maze from one direction, and must be given a route to Asterion's lair within. Naturally, you'll want to rearrange walls and break through dirt blockages to send them the long way, having stuffed the route you're channeling them down full of as many lethal traps and twists as possible. Asterion can fight, but the game's very clear that it wants you to do the lion's share of your killing with traps, leaving the relatively vulnerable beast simply to clean up any stragglers.</p>
<p>The traps are suitably Tom and Jerry in nature, a collection of implements that wouldn't look out of place in Wile E Coyote's bottomless bag of ACME tricks. There's a satisfying ping to each backbiter floor panel that can only wipe out the last shuffler in a group. Flame traps crackle and trigger screams from the sizzling soldiers who wander on along their path, gradually burning to death. Balliste snipe sorry souls on sight. Lures are mounted in dead ends rather than on the designated mounting spots other traps have to be placed on, and will cleave through warriors who're attracted into straying from the beaten path. There are spikes, saws, Medusa heads and all manner of other day-ruiners waiting in the wings that I haven't had a chance to try yet.</p>
<p>As you progress in a run, typical roguelikery occurs. Mazes get more complex to modify, new variants of adventurer with different strengths and weaknesses join the hunt, and you delve ever deeper into the labyrinth. If Asterion falls, you'll be rocketed back to square one minus some resources, but having progressed towards upgrades that switch things up by unlocking the likes of new traps and upgrades to the minotaur.</p>
<p>I've yet to really get into the upgrading woods, but it all works well thus far. Minos does seem a fair bit drier and lacking in unique character compared to felllow Greek mythology-tinged roguelike Hades, but that's not necessarily an issue, more just an observation that stuck out to me having <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hades-2-10-review">recently played a bunch</a> of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a>.</p>
<p>I'd say the demo's certainly worth giving a try, and you can find both it and the wishlist button on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3181650/Minos/">Minos' Steam page</a>, if you're so inclined. Say hello to the guy with horns on my behalf.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>As one of the longest-running survival horror series, <i>Resident Evil</i> has had somewhat of an identity struggle over its many years. Some entries have been more action-focused, while others prioritized the dread and horror many come to the genre for. The last entry, <i>Resident Evil Village</i>, arguably leaned toward the action side of the equation. But the upcoming ninth entry, <i>Requiem</i>, aims to double down on the series’ horror elements.</p> <p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-devs-say-they-cant-tell-if-the-games-actually-scary-anymore">Speaking with <i>IGN</i></a>, <i>Resident Evil: Requiem</i>’s director Koshi Nakanishi describes the series as existing on a sort of <i>Resident Evil 2</i> and <i>Resident Evil 4</i> continuum, with <i>2</i> demonstrating the series at the height of its terror as a horror franchise, and <i>4</i> representing its desire to indulge in giving you more action-based solutions to confronting cities full of the undead. “Firmly swinging the scale [for <i>Requiem</i>] toward the <i>Resident Evil 2</i> style was our intention,” Nakanishi said. “It’s almost an upgrade of that <i>Resident Evil 2</i> style.”</p> <h2><i>RE </i>devs on what makes a game scary: ‘we don’t even know anymore’</h2> <p>A return to horror is good news for those of us who love <i>RE</i> for the frights first and foremost, and the ability for the protagonists to aim a gun competently second. The only problem is that the devs have made so many of these games that they’re starting to lose a sense of what’s actually scary. “We can’t tell anymore,” Nakanisi said of the fright factor in <i>RE</i> games.</p> <blockquote><p>There was actually a bit of worry internally before we showed the [<i>Requiem</i>] hands-off at SGF and the first hands-on at Gamescom, was this actually scary? Because we don’t even know anymore. This is our bread and butter, what we make every day.</p></blockquote> <p>In efforts to make <i>Requiem</i> scarier, the team debated whether or not it was worth mutilating the game’s protagonist, Grace, like previous characters in the series: “What if [she] gets a big gash in her leg, or her leg gets cut off?” Nakanishi said. While we don’t exactly know what bodily harm awaits our girl, based on early footage of the game, it looks like Capcom has dialed in an appropriate amount of horror. I mean <a href="https://youtu.be/4ikhM0aVofA?t=414">look at this friggin’ thing</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://youtu.be/4ikhM0aVofA?t=414">https://youtu.be/4ikhM0aVofA?t=414</a></p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/avalanche-studios">Avalanche Studios</a> is the latest developer to be impacted by layoffs, as the company's UK studio is set to be closed as part of a workforce restructure that will impact its Swedish studios too.</p>
<p>The studio is known for the Just Cause series (not to be confused with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a> developer Avalanche Software, owned by Warner Bros.) and was previously working on an Xbox exclusive called Contraband.</p>
<p>However, that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-exclusive-contraband-reportedly-cancelled-as-avalanche-states-its-active-development-has-now-stopped">project was cancelled by Microsoft back in August</a>, with the studio writing in a statement: "Active development has now stopped while we evaluate the project's future."</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://avalanchestudios.com/stories/studio-update">statement shared by the company</a> today, the decision to restructure has been made "in light of current challenges to our business and the industry".</p>
<p>It continued: "This review had led us to the difficult conclusion that we must make changes to our staffing and locations. As a result, we are proposing to close our Liverpool studio, and to initiate a collective consultation process, as required by UK law. This will impact all Avalanchers in Liverpool. The changes will also impact our other studio locations in Malmő and Stockholm, where we will reduce our workforce and restructure the teams to address our games' needs."</p>
<p>It concluded: "Despite these changes, we remain deeply committed to providing amazing games to our passionate player communities." The statement does not mention Contraband and its cancellation specifically.</p>
<p>Contraband, a co-op smuggling game, was revealed in June 2021 at the Xbox and Bethesda Games Showcase, but little of the game has been shown since. Its official trailer has been removed from the Avalanche website, though you can see IGN's video above.</p>
<p>Its cancellation arrived in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-begins-substantial-layoff-process-across-gaming-division-king-and-zenimax-impacted">wake of layoffs across Microsoft</a> in July, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-june-2025-tracking-the-situation-as-it-happens">resulted in the cancellation of multiple projects</a> including The Initiative's Perfect Dark, Rare's Everwild, and an unannounced ZeniMax MMO.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-is-thriving-claims-ceo-doubling-down-on-ai-after-9000-employees-lost-jobs-in-latest-layoffs">Microsoft CEO and chairman Satya Nadella later claimed "Microsoft is thriving"</a>, largely due to its investments in AI.</p>
<p>Back in 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-100-avalanche-studios-developers-are-unionising">Avalanche Studios entered a collective bargaining agreement with Swedish unions</a>, which was planned to go into effect by the second quarter of this year.</p>
<p>"Over the past years, we've taken significant steps toward making Avalanche one of the best workplaces in the games industry," Avalanche CEO Stefanía Halldórsdóttir said at the time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>It’s the big Four-Oh for Mario, and while that would signal a bit of a midlife crisis in many men, he’s already taken up all manner of sports, been an avid kart racer for decades, and even spends many a weekend playing board games. What else to do, then, but reminisce about that time he went to space in Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Galaxy 2?</p>
<p><iframe title="Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2 – Overview Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rmwOnsJoj8M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This pair of games are rightly held up as two of the very best platformers of all time. Those opening hours of Mario Galaxy are still an absolute delight as you bounce between small celestial bodies, run any and all directions around oddly shaped planetoids and structures, head into a strange space pill for some gravity-shifting 2D platforming, and then still find that there’s more traditional feeling Mario levels as well. Well, about as traditional as you can be when you turn into Bee Mario and have to clamber around on a queen bee. Super Mario Galaxy 2 showed just how fertile this platforming concept was, adding Yoshi into the gameplay mix, using his tongue to grab things with the pointer, new power ups, and more.</p>


<p>Remastering these two beloved platformers is no small feat. One of the problems with Nintendo’s more experimental phase starting with the Wii and DS is how difficult it can be to translate their Wiimote pointer and touchscreen to more typical controllers. Mario Galaxy was built with the screen pointer in mind, to gobble up star chunks, fire them at enemies and interactive objects, grab onto items on screen and to trigger spin moves with a quick waggle (with a button press backup). It becomes even more integral in Galaxy 2 as you often rely on Yoshi to gobble things up and grab things with his tongue.</p>


<p>None of that’s a problem for the Switch or Switch 2, with motion sensors built into all the official controllers, and playing on a TV with Joy-Con in hand, moving with the left stick and pointing with your right hand, does a great job of capturing that original Wii feel – just tie the wrist straps together for a truly authentic Wiimote and nunchuck experience. The one thing missing is that you can’t use your right hand as a mouse pointer, which is reserved only for a player 2. I guess this might have required a few too many button remapping gymnastics. Playing with a Switch Pro Controller also works great, though it feels a bit more clumsy to be tilting both hands together to move that cursor.</p>
<p>The real pain point for the 35th anniversary 3D All-Stars rendition of Mario Galaxy came with the handheld experience. Here, instead of letting you tilt the console to move a pointer, you were forced to lift a hand and touch the screen to interact. That’s still an option with these 40th anniversary remasters, but now you can use motion as well.</p>

<p>The handheld experience is just one sign of a remaster that digs deeper and goes much further to make these two games feel as native as possible. It extends to many more areas as well, so while the menus still look and feel like Nintendo Wii menus with gigantic buttons you can point at or touch, the cursor can also snap to buttons when using an analogue stick. New and revised game options are built into the game’s menus instead of a Switch Online-like emulator overlay, you’re no longer prompted to save after every level completion, and there’s a whole new Assist mode that modifies the game with more health for Mario, health recovery when standing still, and easy recoveries from falls into oblivion.</p>
<p>And then there’s the graphical improvements. On Switch 2, you now have 1080p when playing handheld and a 4K output to TV. Nintendo’s aversion to anti-aliasing remains, but when the resolutions match your screens, it feels better, and it’s paired with revamped textures that generally feel like someone’s wiped the Vaseline off your glasses – other petroleum jellies are also available to smear on your glasses. Grass textures go from mottled colours to having more distinct shaped patches, or there’s now a checkerboard pattern overlaid on the sky of the Honeyhive Galaxy.</p>

<p>Is it perfect? Not quite. There are some texture swaps that shift in what feels like a less detailed direction, and there’s also places that aren’t improved, like Captain Toad’s very low poly count model, and I’d argue that the Switch 2 in particular should be able to handle a longer draw distance and remove some more shadow pop in.</p>
<p>I also feel like the pre-rendered cutscenes could have had a bigger improvement. They’ve been re-rendered and have an opened up aspect ratio, but they still come off as being relatively low resolution from the massive amounts of depth of field in place. Still, this is a generally handsome set of remaster works that (judging by the initial reaction to the announcement thinking that it was a simple upscaling) does a great job of capturing what you remember these games as having looked like 15+ years ago.</p>

<p>There’s not too much more to this bundle beyond that – a new storybook in Galaxy 2, for example – and that’s part of why the £34/$40 per game and £59/$70 combined pricing might feel steep. In truth, it’s in keeping with the Metroid Prime remaster, per game, and if you’re still into physical games, you can get a good few quid off that way.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<p><em>Reviewer's note: Although this is a Switch 1 release, we were only permitted to play the game on Switch 2 during the review period. On launch day, we'll update the text below with specific Switch 1 performance impressions.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>I have to admit, prior to this review, it’s been a while since I played either <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_galaxy_2">Galaxy 2</a>. I dabbled a bit in the first entry in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_3d_all-stars">Super Mario 3D All-Stars</a>, but I spent the majority of my time there playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_mario_sunshine">Mario Sunshine</a> (still my ‘favourite’ of the 3D entries – blame nostalgia, I guess) before getting sidetracked by other games.</p>
<figure><a title="Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2 Review - Screenshot 1 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159162/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>So in the time since I last properly ventured into the great beyond with my favourite plumber, I’ve experienced a plethora of genuinely incredible 3D platformers like <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/astro_bot">Astro Bot</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/crash_bandicoot_4_its_about_time">Crash Bandicoot 4</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, and of course, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>. Jumping back into Galaxy and Galaxy 2 on Switch 2, two things became apparent: first, a few minor technical hiccups with the games are perhaps more noticeable now than they were 15 years ago; and second, they <em>still</em> represent 3D Mario at its absolute peak.</p>
<p>These games are Nintendo’s crowning achievement. They’re bursting with creativity to a degree I’ve not seen elsewhere before or since. Whether you’re skating across a frozen lake against a backdrop of stars and a beautiful piano melody, or ground-pounding a bloomin’ <em>meteor</em> into a giant floating Bowser accompanied by the most bombastic orchestral track imaginable, this pair provides experiences that will stick with you forever. They’re simply that impactful.</p>
<p>They've never looked as beautiful as they do here, either. Not only do you get to enjoy them at up to 4K in docked mode and 1080p in handheld, but many textures have been updated to take advantage of those crisper resolutions. There’s nothing here that’s comparable to the upgrades seen in, say, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_remastered">Metroid Prime Remastered</a>, and it’s possible you might not immediately register the changes, but many environmental assets in particular look much more detailed.</p>
<figure><a title="Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2 Review - Screenshot 2 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159163/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The UI is also cleaner, with an altered font and slightly smaller icons. The version of Galaxy 1 included in 3D All-Stars did the bare minimum, but Nintendo has finally given both games the love that they deserve, and they look glorious.</p>
<p>In addition to the enhanced visuals, these releases also feature several gameplay additions. ‘Co-Star Mode’ makes a welcome return for those who wish to bring a friend on board to help gather Star Bits or defeat enemies. Player Two waggles their Joy-Con about to move the onscreen cursor, but if you’re on Switch 2, you can also use the console’s mouse functionality, and it works wonderfully. Chances are you’ll play both games solo, but it’s a nice little extra regardless.</p>
<p>Taking inspiration from Odyssey, both games also feature ‘Assist Mode’ to help out newcomers or really anyone who needs a bit of a leg up. This automatically doubles available health, and you can even nullify damage by standing still to regain it. Finally, if you happen to fall off a ledge, a bubble will encircle Mario and bring him safely back to land. Galaxy 2 in particular can be pretty tricky, so it may prove useful.</p>
<figure><a title="Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2 Review - Screenshot 3 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159164/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>For those interested in Galaxy’s in-game storybook, the first entry has a brand-new chapter. In addition, a completely fresh storybook has been added to Galaxy 2, with its own new accompanying music. I won’t go into detail, but they’re fun, albeit inconsequential additions that I enjoyed reading.</p>
<p>And finally, amiibo are supported, though you’d be hard-pressed to find a scenario in which they actually prove useful. I don’t have many, granted, but every amiibo I tapped into the game yielded about three Star Bits. Pretty useless, then. There are, however, two <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/mario-galaxy-amiibo-are-on-the-way-plus-two-new-kirby-ones-with-swappable-bases">Mario Galaxy amiibo</a> coming on 2nd April 2026 (yeah, only 182 days after the games launch!) - the Mario &amp; Luma amiibo provides a health boost, while Rosalina grants a 1-Up mushroom.</p>
<p>As for the general controls, if you’ve played 3D All-Stars, then you’ll know roughly what to expect. Naturally, you can't use a Wii Sensor Bar on Switch, so gyro is used for collecting Star Bits and executing the Spin Attack (though you can also just tap ‘Y’ for this). It’s undoubtedly the most sensible solution, but it’s still not ideal; you’ll find yourself frequently tapping ‘R’ to recentre the pointer, and if you’re using a Pro Controller, twisting and turning it constantly feels somewhat awkward. Using the Joy-Con separately is the best way to play in docked mode.</p>
<figure><a title="Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2 Review - Screenshot 4 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159165/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In handheld mode, you can use the touchscreen, but gyro control (for the pointer) is also available, which was missing from 3D All-Stars. Waggling the console around to collect Star Bits can sometimes feel a bit weird, and again, you’ll be resetting the cursor with ‘R’ constantly. The sensitivity feels about right, though, so relatively small movements yield big results. Regardless, let’s just say you probably won’t find me playing these games on public transport.</p>
<p>Otherwise, Mario feels just as natural to control as ever. You could argue that Nintendo pushed the movement fluidity even further with Odyssey, but whether you’re hopping around on a series of tiny planets or swinging from flowers atop Yoshi’s back, it never feels any less than exhilarating. Mario Sunshine rightly garnered some criticism for its twitchy, unpredictable movement, but the Galaxy games struck the perfect balance, taking everything that worked so well in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Mario 64</a> and polishing it to a mirror sheen.</p>
<p>As for the games themselves, if you’ve somehow never played either before, then it’s worth knowing roughly what each entails. The first — you'll be <em>shocked</em> to hear — sees the dastardly Bowser kidnap Peach (along with her entire castle) before blasting Mario off into the far reaches of space. Our hero meets Rosalina and the Lumas, and must travel to a host of galaxies to collect enough stars to reach Peach and defeat Bowser. It’s standard stuff, but Rosalina's introduction is significant, with the character making multiple appearances in subsequent games and becoming a fan favourite. It's also worth adding here that if you also own Galaxy via 3D All-Stars, you can't transfer your save over to this new version.</p>
<figure><a title="Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2 Review - Screenshot 5 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159152/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In Galaxy 2, the setup remains roughly the same, with newcomer Lubba taking over Rosalina’s role as leader of the Lumas. Here, you travel between galaxies via Starship Mario, a delightful little fortress fashioned after the plumber’s head. Neither game provides a particularly captivating story (though the storybooks do a good job at fleshing things out), but this really doesn’t matter one iota – the gameplay more than makes up for any narrative shortcomings.</p>
<p>Indeed, the real draw of both games is the galaxies themselves, with standouts including SpaceJunk Galaxy (oh man, the music!), Throwback Galaxy (a Mario 64 recreation, are you kidding me?!), and Toy Time Galaxy (giant Mecha Bowser – need I say more?) . I also adore Bowser's levels, which include an awesome rendition of his classic theme from Mario 64 before ending with spectacular boss encounters that feel genuinely epic.</p>
<p>Sending Mario into space sounds ridiculous on paper, but it really was a stroke of genius. The way the games subvert expectations around how a 3D platformer should function is marvellous. Gravity plays tricks at every turn, and there are countless moments where you think you might fall into the abyss only to flip upside down and land on the underbelly of a teeny, tiny planet. It’s utterly absurd, but it just <em>works</em>.</p>
<figure><a title="Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2 Review - Screenshot 6 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159153/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The only caveat is that sudden changes in camera angles can occasionally mess with your directional inputs; you need to release the left stick entirely and let things recentre before continuing.</p>
<p>The absurdity is really what makes these games so special. They go places and do things that aren’t possible elsewhere, even in the mighty Mario Odyssey. Most games are tied to the limitations of their worlds, but going into space gave Nintendo licence to break the rules and create scenarios that stretch the absolute limits of creativity. There’s nothing else quite like it. One moment you'll be buzzing around and climbing a wall of honey with the Bee Mario power-up in Honeyhive Galaxy, and the next you'll be flipping up and down as the gravity shifts in time with the funky music in Upside Dizzy Galaxy.</p>
<figure><a title="Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2 Review - Screenshot 7 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159154/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>I mentioned one power-up there, but both games include several awesome transformations that completely turn the gameplay on its head, and they're all wonderful. If you want, you can also swap over to Luigi in both games after meeting certain criteria; a lovely little bonus for fans of Green 'Stache.</p>
<p>Which brings me to the price. You’re looking at $39.99 / £33.99 for each game separately, or $69.99 / £58.99 for the bundle. That’s a lot of money, no question about it. I can understand why folks have gotten up in arms about it, but it's hard to deny <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/nintendo-comments-on-mario-kart-worlds-controversial-price">the quality of the "content" and "value"</a> here; Galaxy and Galaxy 2 are two of the greatest platformers of all time that, if you’re playing on Switch 2, run at native 4K while docked. Even if you’re on Switch 1, you’re still going to benefit from a whole bunch of upgraded textures that make the games look better than ever.</p>
<figure><a title="Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2 Review - Screenshot 8 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159155/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Should they be cheaper simply because they’re ‘old’? I don’t know. It’s a tough scenario, and ultimately, I wouldn’t begrudge anyone for skipping these releases if you already own them on the Wii. What I can say with absolute certainty, however, is that if you do pick them up on Switch, you’ll be treating yourself to 40 hours+ of borderline perfect video gaming.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>There’s no question about it: Super Mario Galaxy and Galaxy 2 are two of the most sublime games ever created. With gameplay that subverts expectations and scenarios that wouldn’t be possible if not for the creative freedom of the cosmos, they represent the Mario series at its absolute best. They look better than ever, boast small yet welcome additions, and expand upon the narrative with new storybook pages.</p>
<p>Gyro aiming simply isn’t as effective as the Wii pointer, however, and you’ll be recentring the onscreen cursor a lot. Very minor issues with the camera are also a bit more noticeable now than they were 15 years ago, but the fact that Nintendo managed to pull off some utterly ridiculous sequences without the camera going haywire remains a remarkable feat. These games command a high price on Switch, to be sure, but you’ll be playing them for the rest of your life.</p></section>

			<p>Today, NVIDIA has released a new GeForce Game Ready driver (version 581.42) optimized for EA's Battlefield 6 game. The driver lands a week and a half before the launch of Battlefield 6, scheduled for October 10. Just as in the recent beta, the game will support NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, Frame Generation, Super Resolution, DLAA, and Reflex. Unlike Battlefield V and Battlefield 2042, <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-ditched-ray-tracing-focus-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">there won't be any ray traced effects as the developers focused entirely on performance</a>. On that note, they also recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-limitations-battlefield-6-better-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">credited their work on optimizing the game for the Xbox Series S</a> as key to improving performance even on other platforms, PC included.</p>



<p>The new GeForce Game Ready driver is also optimized for FBC: Firebreak's Breakpoint Update, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-first-big-update-september-29/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which was released yesterday on all platforms</a>. FBC: Firebreak already included support for path tracing, NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, Frame Generation, Super Resolution, Ray Reconstruction, and Reflex.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, the space simulation sandbox game X4: Foundations received NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation and Frame Generation support alongside the game's 8.00 Diplomacy update. The game previously supported DLSS Super Resolution (which has now been upgraded to the transformer model) and DLAA.</p>



<p>Today, <a href="https://wccftech.com/alien-rogue-incursion-part-one-evolved-edition-announced-no-vr-headset-needed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alien: Rogue Incursion Evolved Edition from Survios</a> launches on PC (and consoles) with day-one support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation, DLSS Frame Generation, DLSS Super Resolution, and Reflex.</p>



<p>NVIDIA also unveiled that Project G-Assist, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-project-g-assist-makes-ai-useful-to-gamers-assists-in-game-tuning-performance-diagnostics-pc-customization/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the experimental AI assistant</a> that helps users tune, control, and optimize their PCs with voice or text commands, is rolling out new updates and adding new commands for laptop users, including optimizing game and app settings for on-the-go play, controlling BatteryBoost to improve battery life while maintaining a smooth frame rate, and enabling WhisperMode to reduce fan acoustics by up to 50% by adjusting game and app settings and frame pacing.</p>



<p>Lastly, the GeForce company alerted would-be buyers to the week's latest deals for its GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Super Mario is officially leaping into middle-age, as this year marks the 40th anniversary of the 8-bit classic that started it all. Nintendo doesn’t have much in the way of original content to celebrate Super Mario Bros. turning the big four-oh, but they are rolling out newly-remastered versions of <a href="https://wccftech.com/super-mario-galaxy-2-launch-on-nintendo-switch-systems-next-month/">Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Galaxy 2 for Switch</a>, with an additional free upgrade available for Switch 2 owners. In the case of Super Mario Galaxy 2, this is actually the first time the red-headed stepchild of the Super Mario series has been re-released since it’s initial debut on the Wii in 2010.</p>



<p>Are Super Mario Galaxy 1 and 2 still out-of-this-world experiences? Or should you keep your expectations down to earth? Blast off for my impressions...</p>



<p><em>Note: This is an opinion piece and, thus, not as detailed as a full scored review would be.</em></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>To this day, there aren’t many, if any, other platformers quite like the Mario Galaxy games. The action in both titles mostly unfolds across a series of floating spheres and irregular objects, with Mario gravitationally drawn to these mini planets and asteroids. This allows Nintendo to create stages that offer full 3D freedom of movement, including some mind-bending gravity-defying stuff, while simultaneously eliminating the need for complex camera controls as the planetoids Mario explores are limited in size and move as he does.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The end result is a very fun and approachable form of 3D platforming, which, in turn, allows Nintendo to push the bar in terms of action and spectacle without overwhelming people. Mario Galaxy 2 largely sticks to the same formula, while upping the difficult a smidge and introducing Yoshi, an addition I’ve always been a bit mixed on, as I don't love the pointer-based controls for his tongue (I think Galaxy 1 is the better game overall, but your mileage may vary).</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>No question about it, Super Mario Galaxy 1 and 2 are still a blast to play, although Nintendo has pushed the weirdness bar so hard with <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/super-mario-odyssey/">Super Mario Odyssey</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/super-mario-bros-wonder/">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/donkey-kong-bananza/">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> that the Galaxy games almost feel a little reserved today, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing. If you're looking for traditional platforming with a little extra flash, the Mario Galaxy games deliver even if they do feel a bit dated in some respects in 2025.</p>



<p>The Mario Galaxy games were originally designed around a Wiimote and Nunchuck control scheme, and while a pair of Joy-Cons stand in okay, gyro aiming just doesn’t feel as good or reliable as the old IR pointer. I admit, I also miss the sheer amount of secrets and extra stuff packed into Nintendo’s newer 3D platformers – the Galaxy games can feel a bit one-note and barren in comparison at times.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Only minimal changes have been made to Super Mario Galaxy 1 and 2’s gameplay, with a new Assist Mode being the only real addition -- a somewhat odd choice of focus given the Galaxy games aren't known for their overwhelming difficulty. Nintendo has also expanded the Rosalina storybook content from the original game, which is cute, but obviously not something that's going to change your experience in a major way.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It was borderline miraculous what Nintendo was able to achieve visually with the Mario Galaxy games on the Wii, and the games held up well aesthetically for years afterwards, but they are starting to show their age now. These new versions of Super Mario Galaxy 1 and 2 are actual remasters, rather than the emulated ROMs running at a higher resolution we got in the<a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/super-mario-3d-all-stars/"> Super Mario 3D All-Stars</a> collection, although Nintendo has taken a pretty light touch here. Some textures, assets, and the UI have been updated, and on Switch 2 you can play at an uprezed 4K, but I played both the 3D All-Stars and new versions of Super Mario Galaxy back-to-back to test, and the latter was only a marginally better experience. Also, I &nbsp;swear the pointer controls actually feel better in the 3D All-Stars version of the game.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Nintendo is being more flexible than usual when it comes to these new versions of Super Mario Galaxy 1 and 2, offering both a two-game physical/digital bundle for $70 and the ability to buy each individually digitally for $40, giving those happy enough with the 3D All-Stars version of Mario Galaxy an option to just buy Mario Galaxy 2. Of course, some will question Nintendo's pricing given these are older games, but it's hard to be too terribly upset when you're getting 30 to 60 hours of high-quality platforming for your 70 coin investment. &nbsp;</p>

</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-still-a-satisfying-star-trek"><strong>Still a Satisfying Star Trek</strong></h2>



<p>Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Galaxy 2 are still great games that offer a stripped-down, streamlined, blockbuster brand of action that still stands out as unique next to Nintendo’s more recent exploratory collection-heavy 3D platformers. These new remasters do the games justice, but not a whole lot more than that, with little in the way of new content and a very light-touch visual makeover. Whether these games are for you, and in what configuration you want to buy them, will largely come down to your own personal play history with the series, but Super Mario Galaxy's skies haven't lost their sparkle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2 can be bought as a 2-pack for $70, or individually for $40 each, on October 2 for Nintendo Switch. Owners of the Switch versions can download Switch 2 upgrades for free.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cygames-co-founder-yuito-kimura-steps-down-due-to-health-issues.1312285/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Yuito Kimura, one of the two co-founders of&nbsp;<em>Granblue&nbsp;</em>developer Cygames, has stepped down from his role as executive director at the company, citing ongoing health concerns.</p>

<p>Kimura's departure was announced today via the official Cygames <a href="https://www.cygames.co.jp/en/news/id-24576" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>, with the company confirming that his responsibilities "have been allocated among the current board members", so it sounds like they won't be searching for a specific replacement for Kimura.</p>

<p>Cygames' announcement doesn't give a reason for Kimura's departure, but over on <a href="https://x.com/KimuraYuito/status/1972912672619516331" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">social media</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/cygames-executive-director-yuito-kimura-steps-down" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gematsu</a>), the man himself says that he has ongoing health issues that have made his duties at Cygames difficult to carry out. These health issues are, however, not life-threatening, according to Kimura.</p>

Let's hope not!</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with Cygames, it's the studio responsible for most of the games in the&nbsp;<em>Granblue&nbsp;</em>series, including the 2024 action RPG&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/granblue-fantasy-relink" rel="nofollow">Granblue Fantasy: Relink</a>&nbsp;</em>and fighting game&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy Versus&nbsp;</em>(although development on that game was handled by Arc System Works).</p>

<p>Cygames was founded by Kimura and president Koichi Watanabe back in 2011, going on to develop a number of mobile games for the Japanese market, including&nbsp;<em>Rage of Bahamut</em>,&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest Monsters: Super Light</em>, and, of course,&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy</em>.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, given how big the&nbsp;<em>Granblue&nbsp;</em>series has become overseas, it's still not possible to play the original&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy&nbsp;</em>in English. Other Cygames titles, like <i><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragalia-lost-shutdown-coming-this-november" rel="nofollow">Dragalia Lost</a>&nbsp;</i>and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/umamusume-pretty-derby-western-release-date" rel="nofollow">positively meme-worthy&nbsp;<em>Umamusume: Pretty Derby</em></a>, have received Western releases.</p>

Stay tuned for more on this.</p>

                <p>Microsoft is gearing up to make some kind of Halo announcement.

There will also be a "deep dive" panel lined up that Halo Studios says "you won't want to miss."</p><p>These events both take place on Friday, October 24.

              <p>A Florida woman, who games under the name Legi0n, recently won a local&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat</em> tournament, taking home a prize pool of $28. That might not seem a particularly noteworthy incident, until you learn she achieved this with a five-day-old baby sleeping in her arms.</p> <p>As <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/mortal-kombat/florida-woman-wins-mortal-kombat-tournament-playing-with-newborn-baby-in-arms-3259005/">superbly reported by Virginia Glaze at <em>Dexerto</em></a>, the Juicy Game Night of Orlando Florida offers a range of fighting game tournaments for locals to take part in, within which was a <a href="https://www.start.gg/tournament/juicy-monthly-september-27th-2025/event/mortal-kombat-xl/brackets/2029391/2971575">four-person bracket</a>, competing to be the best of a very small bunch at <em>Mortal Kombat XL.</em> But what caused this to become a viral sensation was that the winner, Legi0n, was caring for her newborn baby at the time.</p> <p>You might see this as impressive, simply for the extra complication of having a whole other human being sleeping on you as you attempt to play an aggressive, competitive fighting game, and yes, it certainly is. But what is more mindblowing is that Legi0n had had a cesarean section just five days earlier, following a complicated end to the pregnancy. Honestly, it’s beyond belief she was out of bed, let alone owning at <em>MKXL</em>.</p>

 <p>It took me and my wife a full week before we were even able to get our shit together to the level of being able to leave the house, and then it was to stumble into a local coffee shop, our lower eyelids scraping on the ground, as we stared zombie-like at each other for the seventeen minutes he stayed asleep. And that was without a c-section, which I’m pretty sure is supposed to have you laid up in hospital for a good few days on its own. This person is <em>extraordinary</em>.</p>

 <p>“I only won because she coached me mid set,” <a href="https://x.com/_Legi0n_/status/1972110483789627805">Legi0n posted to her X account</a>, along with the cutest picture of her baby sleeping next to a piece of paper bearing the legend, “<em>Mortal Kombat</em>, 1st Place, $28.”</p> <p>“Sending our daughter to Dreamhack,” she continues, her prize including tickets to the event.</p>

 <p>The Juicy Game Night turns out to be where Legi0n met her husband, whom she beat during the same <em>Mortal Kombat</em> tournament she won this weekend.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">One of my buddies/long time rivals of mine were just happy to have an excuse to boot up the game. <br>You guys should check out his event <a href="https://twitter.com/CFFOSeries?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@CFFOSeries</a> and other local events from <a href="https://twitter.com/JuicyGameNight?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@JuicyGameNight</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/RetroRevivalFGC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@RetroRevivalFGC</a>.

During her pregnancy with that daughter, she had played a lot of&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6</em>, meaning the game had become inextricably linked with Alcina and obviously too hard to continue to play.</p>

 <p>Their new daughter, Cereza, seems destined to be a&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat&nbsp;</em>girl. And her mom is, genuinely, such an inspiration. Not because she won a local fighting game tourney, but because reading through her socials, I want her to be my therapist.</p>

 <p>“I just want people to feel like no matter what they can do things that they still love even if it’s in small chunks,” <a href="https://x.com/_Legi0n_/status/1972114768849781231">she posted to X on September 28</a>. “Never feel like it isn’t worth it. I also want to be very vocal about how serious pregnancy and childbirth as a whole is. You can literally die and I almost did. Twice.”</p> <p>Also, I just want to embed this post because it’s the best damn thing:</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Also lmao at any butthurt men commenting negatively towards me living my life.

I could manage low-key RPGs at the very most, my all-consuming tiredness removing any hope of coordination. And—key information here—I personally had taken only a minor side-role in act of giving birth. So the maddest of props to Legi0n, my new gaming hero: I wish her all the rest it’s possible to get.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The use of AI is one of the most contentious points in modern culture, as people lean on it more and more, for everything from research and programming through to fashion tips and companionship. Within gaming and the wider arts, its use to replace voice actors and other professionals has opened up questions about putting hard-working actors out of work, and where these AI models have been trained – almost certainly on copyrighted material that has not approved that use. SAG-AFTRA, the labour union that represents 160,000 actors, announcers, broadcast journalists, dancers, DJs, news writers, news editors, program hosts, puppeteers, recording artists, singers, stunt performers, voiceover artists, influencers and other entertainment and media professionals, has made a fresh statement on where they stand on the use of AI performers.</p>
<p>The following statement was released following the announcement of “Tilly Norwood,” an A.I.-generated “actor” that is reportedly seeking representation:</p>


<p>“SAG-AFTRA believes creativity is, and should remain, human-centered. The union is opposed to the replacement of human performers by synthetics.</p>
<p>“To be clear, “Tilly Norwood” is not an actor, it’s a character generated by a computer program that was trained on the work of countless professional performers — without permission or compensation. It has no life experience to draw from, no emotion and, from what we’ve seen, audiences aren’t interested in watching computer-generated content untethered from the human experience. It doesn’t solve any “problem” — it creates the problem of using stolen performances to put actors out of work, jeopardizing performer livelihoods and devaluing human artistry.</p>
<p>“Additionally, signatory producers should be aware that they may not use synthetic performers without complying with our contractual obligations, which generally require notice and bargaining whenever a synthetic performer is going to be used.”</p>

<p>This conversation isn’t going to go away any time soon. AI should be used to improve and ease humanity’s daily struggles, not replace our artistic and creative ventures.</p>

<figure data-uuid="30c0e42f95afc"><a title="RE Requiem" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/30c0e42f95afc/re-requiem.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure><p>When <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> was announced for the Switch 2, we must admit to being a little surprised that the game could conceivably run well on Nintendo's new console.</p>
<p>We weren't the only ones either. According to a new interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202509/53825">Famitsu</a> (thanks, <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-devs-surprised-how-well-it-runs-switch-2/">wccftech</a>), director Koshi Nakanishi said that the development team itself was also surprised at how well Requiem ran on the Switch 2.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>To begin with, this game is made to be fairly scalable. We've been making it by adjusting various options so that it can be compatible with a wide range of specs, from high to relatively low, so the Switch 2 can be optimized to suit the specs quite smoothly.</em></p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p><em>"We haven't tried to force something made for high-end performance to slow down, but have assumed a variety of spec conditions in advance. Even we were surprised when we first saw it, how beautifully it ran. I think it was thanks to the engine team's hard work that it ran so smoothly.</em>"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, our recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/hands-on-resident-evil-requiem-switch-2-footage-a-surprisingly-tense-port">hands-on time</a> with Requiem revealed that the game has been remarkably optimised for the Switch 2. Playing at TGS 2025, Lowell Bell said that it "has broken me of that Nintendo stigma that third-party blockbusters can’t run on their hardware".</p>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem is currently scheduled to launch on the Switch 2 on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>. If that's not enough, native ports of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-7-biohazard-gold-edition">Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-village-gold-edition">Resident Evil: Village</a> will also land on the same day. The series will be celebrating its 30th anniversary next year, so we're expecting to see even more big things from Capcom's survival horror behemoth in the months to come.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The rumored upcoming PlayStation 5 Pro revision is reportedly launching together with a new version of the DualSense controller, which will sport a highly requested feature, according to rumors circulating online.</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.ppe.pl/news/384532/nowe-ps5-pro-i-kontrolery-dualsense-z-pozadana-funkcja-zdradzamy-szczegoly.html">Polish publication PPE</a>, the same source that correctly revealed <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-playstation-5-november/">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 would be coming this year on PlayStation 5</a> ahead of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-coming-to-ps5-december-psvr2-support-2026/">game's official announcement</a>, the rumored PlayStation 5 Pro hardware revision will be 3% more power efficient than the current model. This information lines up with <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-5-pro-hardware-revision-is-rumored-to-launch-in-europe-this-month/">what reliable leaker billbil-kun revealed last week</a> regarding the rumored new revision for Sony's current generation console.</p>



<p>According to the report, the new PlayStation 5 Pro hardware revision won't be the only revised product launching before the end of the year. Reportedly, a new DualSense V3 controller will hit shelves this November. Replacing every controller model available to date, this new controller will come with a removable battery, which is a great addition, as this will allow users to replace the battery of the controller if it fails, extending its life considerably over the older models. This controller will also reportedly be bundled with the new PS5 Pro hardware revision.</p>



<p>Although this source has proven to be reliable in the past, we have to take the new details on the new PlayStation 5 Pro hardware revision and DualSense controller with a grain of salt until they are officially revealed, or hit stores like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-5-cfi-2100-model-addresses-critial-liquid-metal-issue/">new base PS5 model with a smaller SSD </a>did this month in Europe. Hopefully, it won't take much longer to see these new products hit shelves and learn how they improve the current hardware.</p>

                <p>Nearly three years ago, Ken Levine <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/judas-new-game-from-the-creators-of-bioshock-announced-at-the-game-awards/1100-6509890/" data-ref-id="1100-6509890">shared the first look</a> at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/judas/" data-ref-id="5000-577619">Judas</a>, his long-awaited follow-up to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/bioshock-infinite/" data-ref-id="5000-82374">BioShock Infinite</a>. Players have noticed some obvious visual similarities between Judas and the BioShock games, but according to Levine, it represents "the biggest radical departure" for him since the original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/bioshock/" data-ref-id="5000-22526">BioShock</a>.</p><p>"There are parts of Judas that are more similar to BioShock, and there are parts of Judas that are really really radically different," explained Levine during an appearance on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPbdgQpA6Uc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MrMattyPlays</a>' YouTube show. "I'm sure people notice there's a gun in one hand [and] powers [in] the other hand. We have an additional hacking thing which we haven't shown off that much. But the way the game works, the way the game is populated, and the way you choose between these relationships is something we've never ever done before. The way the world is decorated, the way encounters come in, the way you choose paths in the game, those are all so radically different. ... This is probably the biggest radical departure we've made since I did BioShock."</p><p>Judas is the name of the game's main character, who finds herself trapped on a generational spaceship called the Mayflower. The Mayflower is carrying the last survivors of humanity, and their fate may be tied to three powerful individuals on the ship and Judas' decisions to befriend or alienate them.</p><p>During the interview, Levine described his new story engine as "narrative Legos," which can place important events at different parts of the story depending on which choices the player makes. Levine also indicated that he is "placing trust in your audience and being okay with them just missing stuff" if they choose one narrative path over the other.</p><p>Earlier this summer, Levine stressed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioshock-creator-says-new-game-judas-bucks-all-these-major-gaming-trends/1100-6533130/" data-ref-id="1100-6533130">Judas will avoid live-service elements</a> and other major gaming trends in favor of preserving a single-player experience. Levine also demonstrated <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/judas-release-date-isnt-ready-to-be-revealed-yet-but-heres-how-youll-make-frenemies-in-it/1100-6534315/" data-ref-id="1100-6534315">how players will make friends and enemies</a> among the three major characters in the game.</p><p>Judas doesn't currently have a release date.</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-privately-acquired-in-55bn-deal-by-group-of-investors-including-saudi-arabias-investment-fund-and-donald-trumps-son-in-law">$55bn private acquisition of EA</a> is expected to run smoothly, the Financial Times has reported, due to the influence of Jared Kushner and Saudi Arabia on The White House.</p>
<p>The acquisition announced yesterday will see a group of investors comprising Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, and investment firms Silver Lake and Affinity Partners, acquiring EA, the publisher known for its sports games, BioWare's RPGs, The Sims, and many more.</p>
<p>Though the acquisition won't be completed until Q1 FY27, a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/61cef75e-ceba-43ee-80e3-040756c6154f">report from The FT</a> suggests it won't face much opposition.</p>
<p>That's due to Saudi Arabia being considered a key ally to the US, as well as the involvement of President Trump's son-in-law Kushner, CEO of Affinity Partners.</p>
<p>"Kushner has a personal relationship and he has deep ties in Saudi Arabia. He is very comfortable operating in the Middle East. It created a basis of trust," a person briefed on the talks told the FT.</p>
<p>Another source stated: "We are in a regulatory environment that is welcoming of [Saudi Arabia]. We are not in what was the previous regime."</p>
<p>"What regulator is going to say no to the president's son-in-law?" stated another source close to the inner workings of the Trump administration.</p>
<p>The involvment of Saudi Arabia's PIF is controversial, due to the country's ruler Prince Mohammed bin Salman chairing the fund. He's been <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cia-concludes-saudi-crown-prince-ordered-jamal-khashoggis-assassination/2018/11/16/98c89fe6-e9b2-11e8-a939-9469f1166f9d_story.html">blamed by the CIA for the assassination of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi</a>, and has upheld <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/middle-east-and-north-africa/middle-east/saudi-arabia/report-saudi-arabia/">the country's notoriously poor human rights record</a>.</p>
<p>While the last big video game acquisition - Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard - was met with opposition, it seems this latest deal for EA will be less contested.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted the US Federal Trade Commission for comment on EA's private acquisition.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/be980240-13ec-498c-ba79-71eada30d133">further report from the FT</a>, it's suggested the deal is a huge bet that AI can significantly cut EA's operating costs.</p>
<p>The $55bn buyout is backed by $36bn in equity and $20bn in JPMorgan debt, which EA will need to cover. AI will therefore be a key factor in cutting costs, according to sources involved in the transaction.</p>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ai-is-the-very-core-of-our-business-says-ea-ceo">EA CEO Andrew Wilson stated AI is "the very core of our business"</a> at the company's Investor Day 2024. "For years we have talked about our games delivering experiences that are always new and different," he said. "We predict that with generative AI we will truly be able to fulfil this promise for billions of people for billions and billions of hours."</p>
<p>One area of AI innovation for the company is efficiency, which Wilson described as not just about cost saving but "doing what we do today faster, cheaper, and at a higher quality".</p>
<p>With the growing reputation of AI tools being used across the games industry, no doubt this presentation proved influential in the eventual acquisition by private investors.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ceo-of-ea-says-values-remain-unchanged-following-sale-saudi-investment-firms">statement to employees yesterday</a>, Wilson stated EA's "values and our commitment to players and fans around the world remain unchanged". However, the deal has sparked fear among fans for the future of EA's most queer-friendly franchises, including The Sims, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>, due to the involvement of Saudi Arabia.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Styling itself as a spiritual successor to the popular Silent Hunter series, UBOAT is a World War II submarine sim that places you in command of your own crew, patrolling the North Sea. Developed by Deep Water Studio, it offers a rich, detailed simulation that, like most games in the genre, comes with a steep learning curve with many plates to spin. Console players will also have to contend with inherently awkward controls, sifting through menus and action screens that were clearly designed for keyboard and mouse.</p>
<p><iframe title="UBOAT - Full Release Official Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pu93U02aUjo?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You can jump into one of several campaigns, each taking place during different flashpoints as the war rages across Europe. This timeline will determine several factors, such as the occupation of various ports and territories, as well as the availability of more advanced torpedoes. Whatever campaign you choose, and whichever submarine you start with, there’s no option to change your faction. As the name implies, UBOAT is focused on the Kriegsmarine, which naturally means playing from the perspective of Nazi Germany.</p>


<p>UBOAT wants you to develop an intimate knowledge of the vessel under your command. Actions that sound relatively simple, such as mapping a course, scanning for enemies, or firing a torpedo, each require several steps to complete, with various factors and resource checks determining their success. For example, attempting to track down another vessel in the North Sea will require assigning a crewmate to listen for contacts, using the hydrophone to triangulate a location. You’ll need to then assign another crew member to man the periscope and manually identify any vessels that come into sight, all while trying to keep a low profile. This is all done while keeping an eye on not just your fuel, but electric power, morale, and air quality too.</p>


<p>Even on its most casual difficulty setting, UBOAT throws players in at the deep end. It’s just that kind of game. Fans of hardcore simulations will revel in the game’s immersive web of overlays, dials, gauges, and menus, while newcomers may want to pare back many of these features, offloading and automating tasks such as setting daily schedules for each crew member. If you’re a total maniac (or just so happen to be a submarine boffin) you can go the opposite way, micromanaging to your heart’s content and engaging in the most authentic, most rewarding UBOAT experience.</p>
<p>The tutorials do a decent job of explaining core concepts, though it will take a long time before you feel adept at handling engagements with other ships. Launching torpedoes is where the real action is at, though these set pieces take a lot of preparation to pull off, calculating the size, range, speed, and bearing of a target before lining up a missile perfectly. Again, for those playing on harder difficulties, this process is a lot more involved, as you use rulers and protractors to work out your calculations, even whipping out a stopwatch to monitor how fast an enemy ship is moving while monitoring them via the periscope.</p>
<p>Those moments of practiced ingenuity, narrow escapes, and unexpected scenarios will form an emergent narrative as you progress through the campaign. Not only will your knowledge of the game’s systems grow over time, your crew will also advance and learn new skills as you unlock various submarine upgrades, allowing you to tackle tougher assignments.</p>

<p>Bringing such a dense simulation game to consoles wasn’t going to be the smoothest of transitions. While it’s perfectly playable using a gamepad, there is a constant sense of unwieldiness as you cycle between the various icons and menus, using a combination of button shortcuts and the on-screen mouse. This is very much a PC-first game, and although UBOAT only hit version 1.0 a year ago, the game spent half a decade in early access being tweaked and refined for players who favour keyboard and mouse.</p>
<p>The visuals aren’t exactly pushing console hardware to the max, either, though it’s hard to poke too many holes in UBOAT’s presentation. The menus and UI manage to streamline a wealth of information in a way that’s easy to process, even under pressure. There’s nothing uncanny in the way crewmates look or move around the submarine, though you’ll usually be seeing them from a distance, focusing more on the carefully recreated vessels themselves.</p>

            <p>Dark Ties, the Like A Dragon spin-off game that's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties-drops-in-early-2026-as-rgg-pair-remake-with-a-new-spin-off-starring-baddie-mine">set to arrive alongside Yakuza Kiwami 3 next year</a>, was originally just going to be a video. That was, obviously, until devs RGG studio opted to let folks wander around in the shoes of Yakuza 3 antagonist Yoshitaka Mine, whose karaoke singing to a picture of a follically-challenged gangster they've now also explained.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>These bits of info come from an interview Kiwami 3 director Ryosuke Horii and Yakuza series chief producer Hiroyuki Sakamoto gave to Japanese publication <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202509/53863">Famitsu</a>, which has been partly translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/yakuza-dark-ties-was-originally-supposed-to-be-just-a-viewable-movie-but-rgg-studio-couldnt-miss-out-on-its-last-opportunity-to-make-mine-playable/">Automaton</a>.</p>
<p>According to Horii, the original plan was for Dark Ties to ship with the remake, but be “something that could be viewed like a video”. However, the devs decided to make Mine playable as a tip of the hat to players who've rendered him one of the most popular Yakuza characters, despite only appearing in Yakuza 3 - unless you count the character's likeness being used in series spin-off Like A Dragon: Ishin.</p>
<p>Horii also acknowledged that the team were aware they likely wouldn't get another chance to let folks step into Mine's shoes, given his lack of appearances.</p>
<p>Naturally, because Yakuza, one of the results of that call to make calculating businessguy Mine playable is that players can do the series' usual array of wacky side activities as him, including belting out Baka Mitai at a karaoke booth. We've already gotten a taste of just that via videos of Kiwami 3 coming out of the Tokyo Game Show (head to the ten minute mark below). While flexing his pipes to deliver the sad ballad  made famous by Kazuma Kiryu, Mine stares at a photo of himself and bellicose underworld sidekick Tsuyoshi Kanda.</p>

<p>Dark Ties delves into the relationship between Mine and the bald Yakuza brawler, so it's not a huge surprise, but it did catch some long-time fans a bit off guard given that the former's presented as arguably having an even closer relationship with Tojo Clan chairman Daigo Dojima in Yakuza 3.</p><p>Famitsu asked Horii and Sakamoto why they opted to go with a snap of Kanda over Daigo. As a warning, I have relied on machine translation for the following answer from Horii, but it's too important a remark not to convey: "Well, that's where the punchline really hits home, isn't it? (laughs) If it were too ordinary, it would actually be rather disappointing."</p>
<p>Well, from now on that's how I'll be summing up the Yakuza series whenever anyone asks me if the games about duffing up tatted goons before getting up to zany hijinks are worth a go.</p>

*cavernous, torturous, 20-second-long sucking-in of breath*
</p><!--more-->
<p>
RICHAAAARRRRD. RICHAARD WAAAAALKER. RICHARD WALKER, DEPUTY EDITOR OF XBOX ACHIEVEMENTS. RETURN IT TO ME, RICHARD. RETURN WHAT IS OWED. YOU KNOW OF WHAT I SPEAK. J'ACCUSE, RICHARD. J'ACCUSE YOU OF DÉROBING MA JEUX PORE LE ORDINATEUR. VOULEZ VOUS COUCHER AVEC MON TACTICS RPG, RICHARD?? LE VAUTOUR ENCERCLE LA CARCASSE, LE BOL EST SUR LA TABLE - COMMENT PUIS-JE ME RENDER CHEZ LE BOULANGER????
</p>
<p>
The year was 2010 when you took it from me, Richard - the mother of all grid-based battlers, one of the greatest digital fables of all time, a thrilling study in dynastic intrigue and medieval warfare. I had yet to even finish the game myself, having long coveted it as a youth consigned to PS1 PAL purgatory. But I could not resist your overtures, Richard! I assumed that you would return it to me in a month, perhaps two. Little did I know that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-tactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a>' acclaimed branching Job system would school you in the dark arts of back-stabbing and betrayal, that it would poison your dove-white temperament and set you upon the road to villainy.
</p>
<p>
I thought we were bros, Richard! Kindred spirits forged in the flame of mutual incompetence! We came up in this business together! Remember when I held your dictaphone for you while you interviewed BioWare's Ray Muzyka, Richard? I was terrified it wouldn't pick up his audio, so resorted to kneeling between you like a penitent sinner, waggling the mic back and forth! We looked like idiots, but it's fine! It's fine! We got over it! I barely ever think of the scalding embarrassment and humiliation!! Muzyka is some kind of magic medicine brewer now, anyway - who gives a fuck what he thinks? The key thing is that it was a bonding experience, a foundation for everlasting trust! What did I ever do to you, Richard!? What crime have I committed for you to treat me this way?!?!
</p><p>
I name you, Richard, I name you in the public forum, in the court of our peers. With bleeding hands I carve these words in ten-feet high letters upon the mausoleum of posterity: "Here stands indicted Richard Walker, bastard. Faithless one! Breaker of oaths! Smudger of covenants! Pact-shirker! Dog-leech! Cut-purse! Larkspell! Trencher-mouth! Let none welcome him. Let all faces turn from him. Let all doors be closed to him! Let his food taste like ashes and his favourite videogames play like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-lord-of-the-rings-gollum">The Lord of the Rings: Gollum</a>!"
</p>
<p>
You thought I had forgotten, Richard. And to be honest, I did forget, because <em>it has been such a very long time, Richard</em>, but Square Enix did not forget - today, they release <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1004640/FINAL_FANTASY_TACTICS__The_Ivalice_Chronicles/">a new version of the game on Steam</a> with enhanced visuals, and lo do I rouse in horrified recognition from my dreamless sleep in the murmuring silt of the abysmal sea, lo do I rise in the coruscating incandescence of my absolute fury and indignation to burst upon the surface world and accost the traitor! 
</p>
<p>
RICHAAAARD. RICHAAAARD WAAAALKER. My PSP's battery may have swollen up like a diseased appendix, but I still have my 32MB Memory Stick Duo with a campaign save. It cries out to me for vengeance! Vengeance upon that great unclean soul and fugitive from justice, Richard Walker, Deputy Editor of Xbox Achievements!

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Yesterday, a group of moneyfolk including private equity firm Silver Lake, Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, and Donald Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-are-about-to-be-bought-for-50-billion-by-saudi-arabia-and-jared-kushners-investment-firms-claims-report">unveiled plans</a> to acquire Electronic Arts for an estimated $55 billion. 
</p>
<p>The buyers are committing $36 billion of their own equity (briefly and inexpertly, "equity" is the value of your assets after you deduct anything you owe), including the value of the PIF's existing investments in EA. They're making up the rest of the total thanks to a $20 billion loan from JPMorgan Chase Bank. How will they manage that massive debt? According to the Financial Times, who cite unnamed insiders, they're gambling on the deployment of generative AI tools as a gigantic cost-saving measure.
</p><!--more-->
<p>"The investors are betting that AI-based cost cuts will significantly boost EA's profits in the coming years, people involved in the transaction told the Financial Times," the paper <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/be980240-13ec-498c-ba79-71eada30d133">wrote</a> (paywall) in their own coverage of the story. The FT elsewhere commented that the acquisition "is a huge bet that artificial intelligence can significantly cut EA's operating costs, allowing the equity consortium to manage a large debt load on a company that historically carried limited net debt."
</p>
<p>It isn't hugely surprising to hear that generative AI is part of the vision for EA's second coming as a private company, though the multiple billion dollar loan situation certainly raises the stakes. Like Microsoft and Ubisoft, EA have already poured a lot of resources into generative AI tools, via such initiatives as the Search for Extraordinary Experiences Division - not a reference to the mercs in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a>, apparently - whose efforts include <a href="https://www.ea.com/seed/news/siggraphasia2024-skull-carving">this intriguingly nightmarish blog about "skull carving"</a>. 
</p>
<p>They have also <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-desperately-wants-investors-to-know-it-s-on-the-generative-ai-bandwagon">touted the tech at length to investors</a>, in language that ranges from daydreams about "deeper", "richer" experiences to the quieter prospect of "doing what we do today faster, cheaper, and at a higher quality."  
</p>
<p>Back in May 2024, CEO Andrew Wilson <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/sports/ea-boss-doubles-down-on-commitment-to-ai-believes-more-than-50-of-our-development-process-will-be-impacted/">assured moguls</a> that generative AI would make EA's game development processes "more efficient", commenting of the publisher's licensed football sims that "we've moved from being able to create stadiums in six months to six weeks", and that the technology would in general allow devs "to get to the fun more quickly."</p><p>Efficiency doesn't automatically mean "cutting staff", of course, but as Microsoft have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dear-microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-please-prove-that-an-ai-didnt-write-your-insulting-vacuous-blog-about-why-youre-laying-off-thousands-during-a-time-of-huge-profits">amply demonstrated</a>, workforce reduction is a conspicuous element of the great generative AI tomorrow. Wilson's gushing about stadiums came a few months after EA <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ceo-andrew-wilson-tells-ea-staff-5-of-them-will-be-laid-off-via-empty-and-infuriating-email">laid off 5% of their workforce</a> - around 670 people - and around a year before EA laid off <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/respawn-reportedly-lay-off-staff-across-apex-legends-and-star-wars-jedi-teams-cancel-two-incubation-projects">a further 300 people</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-shut-down-studio-they-opened-less-than-two-years-ago-cancel-black-panther-game">closed one of their headline new studios</a>. I'm not sure these are the Extraordinary Experiences the people are searching for, Andrew.
</p>
<p>Best of luck to EA game developers navigating all this. The acquisition is expected to close in early 2027, pending approval from regulators, which could be a whole saga in itself - Microsoft spent years fighting the US Federal Trade Commission in courts after announcing that they would purchase Activision Blizzard.
