The Elite Series 2's superb weighting, incredibly solid build and high-quality components make it feel like a controller that's worth its $180 asking price. It's an absolute steal at $124. Numerous third-party brands have tried to outshine the Elite Series 2 in recent years, and although there have been a few controllers that have come close, all of the solid wireless alternatives cost either the same price or higher. And that's when the Elite Series 2 is at full price.</p><p>Our favorite third-party competitive controllers for Xbox are the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Gaming-Controller-Remappable-Customizable-Console/dp/B0CQ3PJKRV?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Victrix Pro BFG</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Wolverine-Wireless-Gaming-Controller-Console/dp/B0DB6S6R89?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Razer's recently released Wolverine V3 Pro</a>. To their credit, each controller has at least one feature that is arguably better than the Elite Series 2. The Victrix Pro BFG is a modular controller, so you can swap the thumbsticks to be be offset or aligned. It also comes with a six-button fight pad module. The Wolverine V3 Pro, meanwhile, has excellent microswitch face buttons, and two extra bumpers in addition to four back triggers.

<p>It’s all stations go in the streaming world today as Ludwig announces a return to Twitch after a three-year platform hiatus <strong>and </strong>Adin Ross reveals he’s stepping down from Kick.com ‘indefinitely’. These bombshell announcements left the content creation community reeling, but Ross’ revelation was much more impactful than Ludwig’s tidbit.</p>



<p>Multiple streamers have returned to Twitch in recent weeks, particularly as exclusivity deals with YouTube dry up and expire.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-ludwig-and-ross-back-on-twitch">Ludwig and Ross Back on Twitch</h2>



<p>Adin Ross has an obstacle to overcome before he makes it back to Twitch, and that’s his permanent ban from the popular streaming platform. The controversial creator has cleaned up his act in recent months, but will it be enough to sway the Twitch leadership team and earn him a prestigious spot back on the site?</p>



<p>In a post on Twitter, Adin Ross revealed his split from Kick.com:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I will be making a full video on why I am leaving Kick indefinitely. I am stepping down officially and will be going into detail about this this week. I will tell you all everything.</p>



<p>With that being said, I am going to fully focus on being reinstated on Twitch. Thank you.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Elsewhere, Ludwig, one of the world’s most popular streamers, revealed <a href="https://x.com/LudwigAhgren/status/1865882864652546356" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">in a video on social media</a> that after three years of YouTube exclusivity, he’s back on Twitch. Recently, Ludwig scooped the Best Streamed Event award at The Streamer Awards, and he’s still got  more lined up for the future.</p>



<p>Are you happy to see Ludwig back on Twitch? Would you rather see Adin Ross remain on Kick.com? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

The retailer no longer discloses whether you are getting a North American release or an imported game. All Nintendo Switch games are region-free, and every game in the list above is playable in English. That said, this is important to consider for games with DLC, such as Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet. If you do not get a North American version and want the DLC, you will need to purchase that content from the eShop matching your game. So if you get a UK game, you need to download DLC from the UK eShop, which requires making a separate Nintendo account. Not many games in the list above--or Nintendo games in general--have DLC, but this is worth keeping in mind.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4411880-4411613-nintendoswitchgameswootdeals.png" data-ref-id="1300-4411880" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4411880-4411613-nintendoswitchgameswootdeals.png" data-ref-id="1300-4411880"></a><figcaption>Nintendo Switch games box art</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4411880-4411613-nintendoswitchgameswootdeals.png"></figure><p>A trio of Mario platformers have received big discounts: <strong><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jdoqocy.com%2Fclick-100770772-13142092%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fsuper-mario-odyssey-2&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fwoot-has-over-40-nintendo-switch-game-deals-including-many-of-the-best-exclusives-and-rare-finds%2F1100-6528302%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Super Mario Odyssey</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jdoqocy.com%2Fclick-100770772-13142092%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fnew-super-mario-bros-u-deluxe&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fwoot-has-over-40-nintendo-switch-game-deals-including-many-of-the-best-exclusives-and-rare-finds%2F1100-6528302%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">New Super Mario Bros.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-og-has-up-to-90-bots-per-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Following the highly successful launch and return of Fortnite OG, it has been claimed that some matches can have up to 90 bots in a single game.</p>



<p>That’s according to reputable Fortnite data miners and leakers such as <a href="https://x.com/osirion_gg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">osirion_gg</a>, who’s claimed that Fortnite OG lobbies will have 90 bots per match in low skill-based matchmaking (SBMM) lobbies. Low SBMM lobbies are essentially players who are not good at the game, so they need to be matched with similarly skilled players, or in this case, a huge amount of bots, to make them feel like they are doing well when playing.</p>



<p>According to leakers, the move was made because of the influx of skilled players returning to Fortnite because of Fortnite OG, which likely led to lower-skilled players not having fun and not playing. The same leaker also said that in high SBMM lobbies, there are only ten bots and 90 real players. </p>



<p>Following the leaks, several videos of players that appear to be low-skilled bots have <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1865513248457474262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">surfaced online</a>. </p>



<p>SBMM has become a huge discussion in recent years, with players arguing that it makes them less inclined to continue playing multiplayer games. On the flip side, Activision, who has implemented a stronger SBMM system in Call of Duty in recent years argues that it has seen an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-reveal-sbmm-bible/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">improvement in player retention because of it</a>. </p>



<p>Epic Games is yet to officially comment on the addition of bots and skill based matchmaking in Fortnite, but if there is an official announcement, we’ll be sure to update this article.</p>

			<p>If you're getting stuck into<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2677660/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Great_Circle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> the latest game by MachineGames</a>, you'll know that there is a ton of exploration to do in Indiana Jones and The Great Circle. It can be pretty overwhelming. However, there are certain things within the game that will make your life a little bit more manageable so that you don't find yourself getting overwhelmed trying to find every little item in the game. There are side quests that you can undertake if you want more of the story, but of course, they aren't necessary. Here are some top tips for playing Indiana Jones and The Great Circle.</p>
<h2>Top Tips For Playing Indiana Jones and The Great Circle</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p>While you can find guides for pretty much everything in this game online already, you may feel that you want to solve things by yourself with minimal handholding. Luckily, the game has a built-in hint mode, which is achieved by using the camera you are given. When there is something to take a picture of, a camera icon will appear. This is a sign that you can take pictures of certain items, people, or landmarks in this area, which will provide information on what you want to do next. Additionally, they provide Adventure Points, which are key to using Skill Books.</p>
<p>Skill Books are also a great way to give you an advantage in Indiana Jones and The Great Circle, as they can upgrade your abilities. They can also upgrade Indiana's strength, health, and stamina. You can get Adventure Points in a variety of ways by exploring and collecting them, such as taking pictures and finding collectibles in the game. By doing so and being thorough in your exploration, you can rack up Adventure Points pretty fast.</p>
<p>Stealth is a huge part of Indiana Jones and The Great Circle. Of course, you don't have to be stealthy in the game if you don't want to, as you can choose to fight your way through the enemies. However, if you do choose to be stealthy, it will show up on your HUD that there is a little eye that shows you're being watched. This is helpful if you're trying to be sneaky around specific areas and trying to loot everything you see depending on what clearance you have in the area (depending on the costume Indiana Jones is wearing). This eyeball icon doesn't necessarily mean that they are suspicious of you, but they will be if you steal from them directly in front of them.</p>
<p>Looting food and bandages is key to your survival in Indiana Jones and The Great Circle, regardless of what difficulty you play it. You never know when you're going to take damage or when things will get dicey. Food can help replenish stamina, which you may need if you're in a lot of difficult fights. Additionally, you can get your hands on Medicine Bottles to exchange with an NPC in Vatican City. Using this item will provide you with a permanent boost to your health and stamina.</p>
<p>These are some tips that will help you survive and explore Indiana Jones and The Great Circle. Good luck out there, adventurer.

<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is out now for early access users, and it’ll be released worldwide on December 9. MachineGames just published the game’s first major update, which unlocks full ray tracing (path tracing) and applies a few dozen fixes and amendments to the base game.</p>



<p>Read on to check out the full ‘Update 1’ patch notes.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-an-epic-adventure">An Epic Adventure</h2>



<p>Indiana Jones is performing remarkably well – and it’s not even available to the general market just yet. It has been scoring remarkably high reviews across the board, and some have dubbed it MachineGames’ best title to date.</p>



<p>Today, MachineGames released Update 1 for early access players, and it’ll be compounded with the day one update that’ll drop tomorrow with the full release of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.</p>

			<p>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim may have celebrated its thirteenth birthday around a month ago, but its modding community is more alive than ever. The last few days brought several exciting developments, starting with the long-awaited release of <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/86492?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Community Shaders 1.0</a>, a plugin that introduces advanced graphics features to the open world roleplaying game.</p>
<p>Historically, Boris Vorontsov's ENB has been the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-visuals-natural-culminated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">go-to graphics enhancement framework for Skyrim</a> and many other PC games. However, at least when it comes to Bethesda's best-selling game, CS 1.0 has arguably surpassed it with the latest release, mainly due to the introduction of PBR - also known as Physically Based Rendering.</p>
<p>PBR was a major advancement that was introduced to new games in late 2015 and early 2016. One of the first titles to adopt physically based rendering <a href="http://wccftech.com/the-division-features-pbr-dynamic-gi-realtime-bounce-lighting-completely-dynamic-light-sources/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was Ubisoft Massive's Tom Clancy The Division</a>. With PBR, materials are realistically influenced by lighting, making for a dramatic visual improvement.</p>
<p>While main Community Shaders modder doodlum (the same author of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-light-mod-greatly-improves-visuals-starfield/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Light Limit Fix mod</a> that backported Starfield's clustered shading to introduce limitless dynamic light sources to Skyrim) worked on this major new release, some of the most active texture modders began adapting their work to the new graphics feature. I'm told by <a href="https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/RealExist?gameId=1704" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RealExist</a>, one of the texture modders who already produced several PBR mods, that it was not easy as the game's lighting did not work well at first with PBR (it was not built for it, after all). The modders also had to come up with a mesh patcher (<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/120946" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ParallaxGen</a>) that enables meshes to be compatible with the new PBR textures.</p>
<p>As they say, a picture is worth a thousand words, so you can take a look at the first examples below, with several mods already available on Nexus and others to follow.</p>
<figure>
<div>

</figure>


<p>Community Shaders 1.0 added more than just PBR to Skyrim. The full changelog <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/9415" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> by doodlum on Nexus mentions:</p>
<ul>
<li>'extremely higher performance' when using the aforementioned Light Limit Fix</li>
<li>deferred rendering for global illumination, reflections, and subsurface scattering</li>
<li>native support for DLAA and Native FSR 3.1 AA</li>
<li>improved shadow rendering performance and quality</li>
<li>optimized subsurface scattering</li>
<li>optimized parallax</li>
<li>improved water reflections</li>
<li>improved water performance</li>
<li>optimized water parallax</li>
<li>directional shadows support for water and all transparent objects, such as eyes and glass</li>
<li>significantly optimized (up to 16x faster) Dynamic Cubemaps</li>
<li>optimized Water Caustics</li>
<li>improved grass shading model</li>
<li>improved grass SSS and SSS on foliage, glaciers, etc.</li>
<li>significantly improved particle light scalability</li>
<li>new contact shadows algorithm</li>
<li>unlocked internal game HDR rendering</li>
<li>massively increased SSR (screen space reflections) visibility and range</li>
<li>redone wetness and puddle build-up that is now consistent across Skyrim saves</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<p>There's more. CS 1.0 also supports <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/135817" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Terrain Shadows</a>, a new feature developed by modder ProfJack that enables rough terrain shadows with infinite distance, both in Skyrim and on the game's world map. You can check out a preview in the impressive GIF above.</p>
<p>Last but certainly not least, Community Shaders 1.0 supports <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/127557" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Light Placer</a>, the latest framework developed by powerofthree, the author of several key frameworks for Skyrim (Spell Perk Item Distributor, Base Object Swapper, and Keyword Item Distributor, to name a few). With Light Placer, modders can manually add real light bulbs with unlimited range and brightness to actors and objects. These lights can flicker, affect detection, change color based on the time of day, and so on. Light Placer has great potential to improve lighting by allowing modders to add many more lights across the whole game (and its many content mods, potentially) as they see fit.</p>
<p>Version 1.0 is far from the final release of Community Shaders. The authors are already testing new big features such as Screen Space Global Illumination (SSGI), Skylighting, Cloud Shadows, proper support for HDR displays, built-in Frame Generation, Capsule Shadows/Ambient Occlusion, sharper textures when using anti-aliasing, and more.</p>
<p>I plan to delve deeper into the realm of Skyrim modding soon. Stay tuned for a much more detailed article on everything that's going on in this vibrant mod scene.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/apple-partnership-with-sony-for-playstation-vr2-controller-support-for-vision-pro/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple%E2%80%99s-stalling-vision-pro-sales-prompt-partnership-with-sony-to-add-playstation-vr2-controller-support.1055238/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/apple-partnership-with-sony-for-playstation-vr2-controller-support-for-vision-pro/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It was recently reported that Apple has <a href="https://wccftech.com/apple-vision-pro-recorded-less-than-500000-units-buyers-are-not-using-it/">only sold 500,000 units</a> of the Vision Pro since its launch in February, and it appears that the company is aware of it and exploring ways to enhance sales. A new report claims that the company is expanding the Vision Pro headset use case by potentially partnering with Sony for its VR Gaming Controller support. The partnership has been in the works for several months now, and Sony's VR controllers will be available to users as optional accessories.</p>
<h2>Apple and Sony are working to bring PlayStation VR2 controller support to the Vision Pro</h2>
<p>The news was shared by Mark Gurman in his latest <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-12-08/apple-sony-talk-playstation-vr-ps-vr2-hand-controller-support-for-vision-pro">Power On newsletter</a>, stating that Apple will diversify the list of accessories for the Vision Pro by introducing support for Sony's VR controllers. The analyst also noted that Apple's handset supports the PlayStation 5 and Xbox controllers, but they are not optimized for the augmented reality experience. Sony's VR controller, on the other hand, is designed to take advantage of a virtual reality user experience and would go along with Vision Pro's essence.</p>
<p>The PlayStation and Xbox controllers lack the 6DOF or the six degrees of freedom required for precise VR gaming controls. Sony would have to make some changes to its product distribution strategy if it goes ahead with Apple's plans, requiring it to offer the PlayStation VR2 controller separately, as it is currently bundled with the company's headset. Apple could offer the controllers directly though its online stores and its retail outlets.</p>
<p>It brings us to question whether Apple is aiming to market the Vision Pro as a dedicated gaming headset. While it should head that road, the PlayStation VR2 controller will enhance productivity tasks as well as aid in media editing in visionOS, according to Mark Gurman. However, it will also serve its true purpose - gaming on the Vision Pro, which has been a hit or miss at this point. Nonetheless, it will make it easier for users to control and navigate the operating system using the thumb sticks and the directional pad. The finger pinch gesture could be replaced by the trigger button.</p>
<p>At this stage, it remains to be seen if the two companies have sealed the deal, and if so, there are no official statements on when we can expect the company to add support for the controller. Apple is aiming to expand its market for the Vision Pro, and offering support for the PlayStation VR2 controller could allow the device to extend its reach. We will share additional details on the matter, so do stick around.</p>

You have to pay for all 12 months upfront, but that’s a great value for the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/1/24146547/t-mobile-mint-mobile-acquisition-complete">T-Mobile-owned MVNO carrier</a>. Just bring your phone, drop in the SIM card (or activate via eSIM), and you can connect to the same 4G LTE and 5G towers that T-Mobile customers do.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/08/fortnites-new-ballistic-mode-turns-it-into-a-5v5-tactical-fps/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>I don’t think anyone would have had <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fortnite">Fortnite</a> turning into a 5v5 FPS on their 2024 bingo cards, but here we are, as Epic has revealed Fortnite’s new Ballistic mode, launching on 11th December across all platforms, but with an Early Access label on it.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fortnite Ballistic Cinematic Teaser" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZcbOAdIFmaE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Fortnite Ballistic is a 5v5 round-based competitive shooter, looking to take a bite out of Counter-Strike’s cake. The two teams will take turns attacking and defending, with the attackers aiming to plant a reality-tearing Rift Point Device at one of two sites on the map, while defenders try to prevent this or defuse it before it can go off. Of course, you’ll also be able to win a round by taking out the whole opposing team.</p>
<p>The game is first to win 7 rounds, with attackers and defenders set in their role for 6 rounds before switching. Players will start off with a Ranger Pistol and 800 credits to spend on weapons, shields and gear between rounds, earning credits from scoring eliminations and planting the RPD.</p>
<p>So yeah, it’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/counter-strike-2">Counter-Strike</a> or what <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/call-of-duty">Call of Duty</a> calls Search and Destroy, and a real staple of the FPS genre as a whole. Both unranked and ranked queues will be available.</p>

<p>To start off, there will be a single map, Skyline 10, and a starting set of weapons and items. This is a starting point that Epic will look to build on, taking feedback to adjust the current offering and shape what is developed next.</p>
<p>Ballistic is a huge shift away from the bread and butter of Fortnite Battle Royale, with its third person view and building, though Fortnite has morphed over the last couple years into a sprawl of multiple game modes, collaborative franchises and IP, and user generated content. Within that space, Epic and their partners are able to bring new game modes and themes as part of the company’s long-term goal of building out a metaverse of online gaming – since last December, there’s been Lego Fortnite, Rocket Racing, and Fortnite Festival.</p>
<p>We’ve seen a similar shift back toward more traditional competitive shooters from Fortnite’s rivals, as well. Having started off with some limited time modes, Respawn permanently added Team Deathmatch, Gun Run and Control game modes to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> in early 2023.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> players have hit out at "AI slop" they believe has been used within the game and its promotional materials.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, players noticed a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h850ur/black_ops_6_loading_screen_look_at_the_hand/">six-figured zombified Father Christmas</a> had popped up on the loading screen, and whilst some fans simply attributed this as a nod to the fact this is the sixth Black Ops game, others alleged it was evidence that the art was machine-generated, as <a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/future-technology/why-ai-generated-hands-are-the-stuff-of-nightmares-explained-by-a-scientist">AI typically struggles to generate realistic-looking hands</a>.</p>

<p>More generous fans suggested the rogue digit could be the curb of a pavement behind the spooky Santa, or indeed just loose skin from a degloved finger giving the <em>impression</em> of a sixth finger.</p>
<p>Santa's teeth and moustache have also come under scrutiny.</p>

<p>"It's very clear that the game is full of AI," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blackops6/comments/1h8m2qy/this_is_unacceptable_at_this_point/">said</a> one player in a thread entitled, "this is unacceptable at this point".</p>
<p>"This alone is fucked but the fact the the zombies crew is almost fully recasted because they want to use AI to replicate the actors' voices so they can STOP PAYING THEM.</p>
<p>"I don't care if this isn't read by many but it's needs to be know how fucked and inexcusable this shit is. They are feeding us slop because they want to pay their millionaire executives a little bit more. It's ridiculous."</p><p>Last week, Activision announced it'll be giving those few remaining Call of Duty fans who haven't already bought this year's Black Ops 6 or played it through Game Pass the chance to get stuck in for free next week, as part of a seven-day trial. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-is-having-a-7-day-free-trial-starting-next-week">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's Free Trial starts next Friday, 13th December</a>, on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC. It'll continue into the following week, wrapping up on Friday, 20th December.</p>
<p>"For a series built on high-octane thrills and explosive gratification, its withdrawal to the well-trodden formula echoes the wider industry's continued allergy to risk," Chris Tapsell wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-review">Eurogamer's Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"Ever since we started letting players get their hands on Soulframe earlier this year in our pre-alpha playtests, things have ramped up in the best way possible," Crookes said. "We've always had a greater vision for what we aspire Soulframe to be, but feedback from the community will always remain our north star.</p><p>"That community feedback paves a tailored roadmap on changes to make and focus on in our current Pre-Alpha around nearly every aspect of the game as we ramp things up for full public access," Crookes added. "We hear the feedback around combat and lack of social features, which is why you've seen those elements become major focuses for us as we add new things like social hubs."</p>
<p>For more, you can check out the teaser above, which shows off the player social hub and some new quests, as well as introduce some new NPCs (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/soulframe-shows-off-a-new-teaser-trailer-and-a-cool-giant-wolf-to-hang-out-with/">PC Gamer</a>).</p>
<p>"Even as Ode'n shadow spreads across Alca, the future of Soulframe: Preludes is bright, Envoys! Enjoy a preview of what's to come to Preludes in 2025," DE teases in the description.</p>
<p>Back in July 2022, Digital Extremes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warframe-dev-announces-free-to-play-fantasy-action-mmorpg-soulframe">unveiled its first new property since Warframe's release</a> back in 2013. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warframe-devs-free-to-play-fantasy-mmorpg-soulframe-shows-off-30-minutes-of-gameplay">Besides a 30-minute gameplay teaser this time last year</a>, though, we've seen very little else. Back in July, however, at TennoCon 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/soulframe-will-open-up-to-a-lot-more-players-this-autumn-says-digital-extremes">we finally got our first extended look at it</a>.</p>
<p>Soulframe will be Digital Extremes' first new game in over five years, following on from 2017's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warframe-dev-hits-pause-on-deck-building-shooter-the-amazing-eternals">short-lived team-based FPS The Amazing Eternals</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/8/24316130/apple-vision-pro-sony-psvr2-controller-support-gaming<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The Vision Pro could gain support for Sony PSVR2 controllers soon, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-12-08/apple-sony-talk-playstation-vr-ps-vr2-hand-controller-support-for-vision-pro?srnd=undefined">according to Mark Gurman</a> in today’s <em>Power On</em> newsletter for <em>Bloomberg. </em>Apple and Sony apparently planned to announce support for the controllers “weeks ago” but have pushed back the rollout. Under this rumored partnership, Apple would begin selling Sony’s controllers, which aren’t currently available on their own.</p><p>Sony has apparently been working on adding the support for months, while Apple has asked third-party developers if they would take advantage of Sony’s VR controllers. That’s potentially great news for Vision Pro owners who wish the headset had more gaming chops. (There are precious few good, native visionOS games — <em>Thrasher, </em>a mesmerizing game where you fling a giant worm / dragon thing around a psychadelic space using just hand movements, comes to mind.) </p><p>Gurman writes that Apple also wants to use the controllers for more than gaming — the controllers will be able to navigate visionOS, and would offer more precise controls in apps like Final Cut Pro and Adobe Photoshop. Right now, you can pair a standard Bluetooth controller and navigate visionOS — tapping buttons to select things, scrolling with the analog sticks, and so on. They also work for gaming, but you’re mostly limited to iPad and iPhone games with controller support or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24139004/apple-app-store-retro-game-emulators-ios-console-ports-storystream">made-for-iOS emulators</a> or that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/10/24217643/vision-pro-nintendo-virtual-boy-emulator-virtualfriend-impressions">native Virtual Boy one</a>.</p><p>Will this partnership bear fruit and help games actually flourish on the platform? I’m not immediately hopeful, given the Vision Pro’s sales and Apple’s track record of support from game publishers.</p><p>Still, the Vision Pro is fundamentally different from Apple’s other devices, and VR is its own landscape. And there are signs the community wants this, with at least one <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/surreal-interactive/surreal-touch-1-controllers-for-apple-vision-pro">fully-funded Kickstarter project</a> to develop Meta Quest 3-style controllers, called the Surreal Touch, for the Vision Pro. Maybe the Vision Pro will get some great VR games — whether anyone will be around to buy them is another question entirely.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Fighting game Hunter x Hunter Nen x Impact has been refused a rating by the notoriously-strict Australian ratings board.</p>
<p>Hunter x Hunter Nen x Impact has been effectively banned down under by the country's Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications, and the Arts' Classification Board for "implied sexual violence".</p>

<p>Whilst no specific reason was given on the <a href="https://www.classification.gov.au/titles/hunterhunter-nenimpact">ratings website itself</a> - in "reason for refused classification", it simply invites people to contact the organisation for more information - a <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-za/entertainment/other/hunter-x-hunter-fighting-game-refused-classification-in-australia-for-implied-sexual-violence-against-minors/ar-AA1v8DFO">statement</a> from the Australian Classification Board said the game “contains a scene of a visual depiction of implied sexual violence, where an adult male exposes himself to persons under the age of 18 years".</p><p>Hunter x Hunter's first full-fledged fighting game is set to release in 2025, featuring 3v3 Nen ability team battles. It's unclear at this time if publisher Arc System Works will appeal the decision or censor its game accordingly to appease the board.</p>
<p>Just last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-suddenly-pulls-hotline-miami-2-from-aussie-ps5-owners-after-realising-countrys-ratings-board-denied-games-release-a-decade-ago">PlayStation removed Hotline Miami 2 from sale in Australia and refunded PS5 owners</a> who bought the game, a decade on from the infamous kerfuffle over its release down under.</p>
<p>Back in January 2015, designer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hotline-miami-2-banned-in-australia">Jonatan Söderström memorably told Aussie fans to simply pirate Hotline Miami 2 after its release was blocked by the Australian Classification Board</a>, due to its inclusion of a skippable scene that showed simulated sexual violence.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>There’s something eerily exciting about a game set in the ‘post-apocalypse’. They’re typically morbid, darker adventures that see players tackle all the threats that come with surviving in a world devastated by a virus or a nuclear holocaust, but despite those bleak elements, they’re often highly enjoyable experiences. In this list, we’re taking a look at the best post-apocalyptic games ever.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-best-post-apocalyptic-games">What Are The Best Post-Apocalyptic Games?</h2>



<p>There’s a huge library to work with, as post-apocalyptic games are traditionally quite good sellers that are able to ultimately stitch together expansive universes that traverse as a series of unique releases. Some of them will even go on to spawn post-apocalyptic movies, books, or television shows.</p>



<p>So, what are the best post-apocalyptic games? Let’s find out.</p>



<h3 id="h-1-fallout-4">1. Fallout 4</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Fallout 4 is easily one of the best post-apocalyptic games you’ll ever play. It’s expansive and it embodies the ‘wasteland vibe’ perfectly. It wasn’t a favourite of the die-hard Fallout fans because it became more ‘mainstream’ and sold out a little, but it’s a solid choice and offers hundreds of hours of entertainment in one of the most engaging maps in the game’s history.</p>







<h3 id="h-2-the-last-of-us">2. The Last of Us</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Last of Us (and later, Part II) was a smash hit when it was released back in 2013 exclusively on PlayStation 3. It became an overnight sensation and birthed one of the most memorable and emotional post-apocalyptic stories in gaming history. With the player getting the opportunity to travel across the outbreak-ravaged United States, it’s easily one of the top titles on offer in the post-apocalyptic scene.</p>







<h3 id="h-3-metro-exodus">3. Metro Exodus</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Metro is a legendary series that was a novel before it became a best-selling video game. In Metro, the player embarks on a perilous journey through the subways of Moscow, with the above-ground environment having been turned into a post-apocalyptic nightmare. In Exodus specifically, an open-world formula was introduced, and the player went far beyond Moscow…</p>



<h3 id="h-4-half-life-alyx">4. Half-Life: Alyx</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Half-Life: Alyx is one of the best VR games ever made, and it’s set in a gritty, harrowing post-apocalyptic world that never fails to keep you on your toes. Following a cataclysmic event during an experiment at a research facility, portals are torn open to alien worlds that instantly threaten Earth.</p>



<p>As Alyx, you’ll take a journey through a world torn apart by alien oppressors and invaders. Every step is fraught with danger, and you’ll need to scavenge, fight, and hide to survive. </p>



<h3 id="h-5-horizon-zero-dawn">5. Horizon Zero Dawn</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Horizon Zero Dawn (and later, Forbidden West) boasts a unique story that lends itself perfectly to this post-apocalyptic games list. It’s a gorgeous game on the surface, making use of cutting-edge technology to deliver a visual display that amazes the player. It’s marvellously well-written, boasts a star cast, and has some of the most innovative combat we’ve seen for years. </p>



<h3 id="h-6-gears-of-war-3">6. Gears of War 3</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>There’s no list of the best post-apocalyptic games that doesn’t include Gears of War – and in this case, we’re looking at the third game in the series. This all-out action-packed saga sees enormous men in hefty suits of armour fight to defend their home planet from an uprising of subterranean mutants.</p>



<h3 id="h-7-dying-light">7. Dying Light</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Dying Light (and 2022’s Dying Light 2) emerged into the post-apocalyptic world of games as one of the most fast-paced and high-octane titles in years. It dropped in 2015, bringing a parkour-fuelled, zombie-slaying adventure to gamers the world over. In Dying Light, the stage was set, and in Dying Light 2, the world fell so much deeper into its apocalypse.</p>



<h3 id="h-8-fallout-3">8. Fallout 3</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>We’ve already named Fallout 4 on this list, but a special space must be reserved for Fallout 3. This is easily one of the best post-apocalyptic games ever made, and it was a turning point for the franchise itself when it was released. It introduced gamers to a massive, open-world bursting at the seams with danger and destruction, and even fifteen years later, it’s still a fan-favourite game.</p>



<h3 id="h-9-left-4-dead">9. Left 4 Dead</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Left 4 Dead was designed to be a cooperative slayer of sorts, but it fared well as a single-player game nonetheless. If you’re listing the best zombie games, you can’t help but mention Left 4 Dead, and even though it has some years today, it remains one of the best post-apocalyptic games ever. It’s littered with bloodthirsty zombies, one-liner quips, and pure, unbridled violence.</p>



<h3 id="h-10-dead-rising">10. Dead Rising</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Dead Rising is an iconic zombie series that only just makes this list by way of technicality. It’s one of the best post-apocalyptic games, but in this series, it’s usually just one area that’s impacted by a zombie outbreak – like a town or a shopping mall. Regardless, all the Dead Rising games boast large, open worlds, thousands of zombies to slay, and more weapon-crafting mechanics than you could shake a sharp stick at. </p>

<p>Battlefield is one of the most tumultuous first-person shooter franchises ever made. It has fallen from grace in recent years, but once upon a time, it was a legitimate Call of Duty killer – or at least, it could have been. In this list, I’m breaking down all Battlefield games, ranking them from worst to best and determining where things went wrong for the series.</p>



<p>There are high expectations for the future of the series with Battlefield 6, which is set to be the most ambitious game the team has ever cooked up, but the proof will be in the final delivery, of course.</p>



<p>Without further ado, here’s the list – all Battlefield games, ranked.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-all-battlefield-games-ranked">All Battlefield Games, Ranked</h2>



<p>If you think our organisation of all the Battlefield games is a little off, feel free to mention that in the comments and we might consider jiggling our list around a little!</p>



<p><strong>Update: Based on some valuable feedback, we’ve made adjustments to the list. It’s encouraging to see such a loyal fanbase still exists that is passionate about Battlefield games both new and old!</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-12-battlefield-hardline">12. Battlefield Hardline</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Hardline was a strange paradigm shift that didn’t hit too well with the Battlefield community. It was sort of Battlefield as knew it, but it was fused with a ‘Cops vs. Robbers’ foundation that at no point lent itself to the classic Battlefield formula. It had an entertaining enough campaign and it was visually pleasing, but it just never at any point felt as though you were playing a Battlefield game.</p>



<h3 id="h-11-battlefield-vietnam">11. Battlefield Vietnam</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Battlefield Vietnam was released in 2004, exclusively on PC. It was the second Battlefield game ever, and for some, it seemed odd jumping from World War II to the jungles of Vietnam, but it was their game to make, I guess. It was a little more visceral than its predecessor but it didn’t move mountains, and aside from a brief Bad Company expansion, this theatre of war hasn’t been revisited.</p>



<h3 id="h-10-battlefield-1942">10. Battlefield 1942</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Battlefield 1942 is where it all began – way back in 2002. It was a remarkable game for the era and boasted near-unparalleled realism, and it easily became one of the best-selling games of the day. It kickstarted the entire franchise, but that’s not enough to rank it at the top of all Battlefield games. </p>







<h3 id="h-9-battlefield-2042">9. Battlefield 2042</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Battlefield 2042 launched in a terrible, heartbreaking condition but has been on a road of redemption ever since. It’s a tough one to place on the list of all Battlefield games, as those who never went back to it following its disappointing release will <strong>not </strong>remember it fondly. However, hundreds of changes have been made and it’s now at least a <strong>good </strong>game if not a great game. </p>



<h3 id="h-8-battlefield-v">8. Battlefield V</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Battlefield V has a bad rap, but it wasn’t a terrible title. It boasted some of the best features we’ve ever seen out of all Battlefield games, including construction, a sorely missed and personal favourite attribute of mine. It had gorgeous maps, exhilarating combat mechanics, great customisation options, a brilliantly mixed campaign, and plenty of post-launch content – and battle royale!</p>



<p>Sadly, it was also seen as the beginning of the downfall of the Battlefield franchise, and it couldn’t ever live up to the greatness of Battlefield 1, which was this game’s predecessor.</p>







<h3 id="h-7-battlefield-2142">7. Battlefield 2142</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Battlefield 2142 was an outlier – a futuristic title set two centuries beyond the ‘oldest’ Battlefield game. It wasn’t a terrible game by any means and boasted some highly enjoyable combat sequences and solid multiplayer, but it was an almost unexpected injection of innovation (or so they thought) into a series that had, until then, focused on real-world conflicts. Do we ever want to see mechs again in Battlefield? Probably not – but they were fine in 2142.</p>



<h3 id="h-6-battlefield-bad-company">6. Battlefield: Bad Company</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Bad Company, good game. This 2008 release introduced us to the foursome that we’d follow for a total of two releases. This was a Battlefield packed with humour, one-liners, and pleasing action sequences that unfolded over semi-linear maps, and it was great. Even today, we mourn the loss of Bad Company, and the servers were recently taken offline, too.</p>



<h3 id="h-5-battlefield-2">5. Battlefield 2</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Battlefield 2 is, according to Metacritic, the highest-ranked title out of all Battlefield games. It was technically the third game in the series, and it was a great step up from the first title that was launched three years prior. It was one of the most collaborative shooters of its time, making it a brilliant multiplayer option and one of the best team-based first</p>







<h3 id="h-4-battlefield-4">4. Battlefield 4</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Battlefield 4 boasted one of the best campaigns we’ve ever seen in the series, so much so that certain characters made a return in 2042 almost ten years later. It also featured one of the most balanced and memorable multiplayer modes in franchise history, which went hand-in-hand with fantastic destruction mechanics, multi-faceted combat roles, and some of the greatest maps we’ve ever seen.</p>



<h3 id="h-3-battlefield-bad-company-2">3. Battlefield Bad Company 2</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Bad Company 2 was a send-off of sorts for the sub-franchise, but to this day, fans are still expecting a resurgence. It took everything the first game did and improved upon it, introducing a better story, more quips, larger maps, and a more immersive multiplayer experience. It was released in 2010, but the next game to be released in the franchise would be so mighty that it would completely overshadow Bad Company 2.</p>







<h3 id="h-2-battlefield-1">2. Battlefield 1</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Out of all Battlefield games, Battlefield 1 was the most emotional, heart-wrenching title of them all. It was a cutting-edge experience that remains the best-selling Battlefield game ever, and it was iconic for the story mode alone. In the multiplayer offering, players discovered a brutally realistic, immersive ecosystem that felt incredible to play every single time. It felt authentic, it looked flawless, and it was a gritty and honest portrayal of one of human history’s most devastating wars.</p>



<h2 id="h-1-battlefield-3">1. Battlefield 3</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Battlefield 3 is the best Battlefield game ever made, period. It is a masterpiece of a first-person shooter, and despite launching way back in 2011, it still holds up to scrutiny today. It effortlessly competed against the likes of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, Killzone 3, and Crysis 2, and even if it didn’t come out on top in some of those bouts, it was a game that never refused to quit. </p>



<p>With stacks of post-launch content, some of the most instantly recognisable maps in franchise history, jaw-dropping visuals, and mountains of destruction, this truly was the Battlefield game to end all Battlefield games. It had a fantastic and gripping story and cooperative missions, and the multiplayer just felt so good to play over and over again.</p>

In it, host Steve Burke says the company is still misleading customers, despite adjustments made in response to his previous video in which he <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/1/24310181/nzxt-pc-rental-program-gamers-nexus-investigation">called the program</a> “a scam.”</p><p>NZXT <a href="https://nzxt.com/news/nzxt-update-addressing-your-concerns-about-the-flex-subscription-program">said in its response</a> this week that it would clarify details about its Flex program, which Gamers Nexus had criticized for having specs that would change sometimes “day-to-day.” The company has appeared to update specs and performance numbers for its purchase builds. But Gamers Nexus reports it still spotted issues like inconsistent FPS numbers and a FAQ that implied NZXT’s for-sale Player: Three Prime build uses an RTX 4090 graphics card, despite its specs saying otherwise. </p><p>The FAQ entry Burke mentions seems to be gone now, but as of this writing, there’s still an entry titled “What GPU is right for me?” that lists the RTX 4090 and its benefits. Such inconsistencies are a problem for potential customers, Burke says.</p><div><blockquote><p>The fact that NZXT misrepresented its product, even after its statement, as having a 4090 when it still had a 4080 Super ... seemingly indicates that even NZXT can’t keep up with its own specs changes. If NZXT can’t keep up with it ... how are they expecting the customer to keep up with it?</p></blockquote></div><p>Gamers Nexus offers other criticisms of the company’s rental program, from “improper packaging” damage fees with upper bounds that exceed the cost of equivalent non-rental versions of the PCs to the creator-based ad videos that continue to exist, despite the company saying it had “pulled all influencer-led Flex advertising.” NZXT did not immediately respond to our request for comment on the new video.</p><p>Gamers Nexus said Thursday that it’s working on a deeper investigation, and its video today ends with Burke saying he’s received “a number of very concerning tips” from former employees and customers. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>There's no perfect time to release a video game, but if I were deciding when to release one, do you know when I'd do it? Alongside the largest blockbusters of the year, at a time when everyone is broke from buying presents, and on the same day as a huge awards show is distracting the industry's media. 
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ballionaire">Ballionaire</a> apparently shares my thinking. The pachinko-inspired roguelike is launching on December 10th.

<p>"Pachinko-inspired" might conjure certain images, and recent pachinko roguelike <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/peglin">Peglin</a> among them. Ballionaire takes a different tact, with no traditional goblin-based combat staredown at the top of the screen. Instead, players are charged with designing the pachinko bored itself, placing different kinds of pegs in advance of their ball's descent. Pegs include axes which cut you in half, so you continue tumbling in multiple directions, and teleporters, which shift you back to the top of the board. The aim is to collect as much cash as possible, with the gadgets helping to prolong and multiply your physicsy journey.
</p><p>There's then a roguelike wrapper around this bally good time: it's run-based, there are many different boards to encounter, there are between-board upgrades, and so on. There's also a sandbox mode if you just want some free balls, and best of all, mod support that allows folks to script their own pegs.
</p>
<p>Brendy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ballionaire-is-a-pachinko-roguelike-where-you-build-your-board-as-you-play">loved the demo</a> when he played it during Next Fest in October. That demo is no longer available, but I'm looking forward to giving the full game a go - whenever I manage to find the time.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Spanish leaker eXtas1s has heard that South of Midnight, the next game in development at Compulsion Games, might be featured at The Game Awards 2024 with a release window announcement for March 2025. The leaker revealed the rumor <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5xdIjl9pFg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in his latest YouTube video</a>, saying that Microsoft will have a lower key presence than previous TGA shows. Still, this announcement should tickle fans.</p>
<p>South of Midnight was originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/south-of-midnight-is-a-new-ip-from-we-happy-few-studio-compulsion-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at Microsoft's Xbox and Bethesda Showcase in June 2023. Made by the same folks who released Contrast and We Happy Few, it is a third-person action adventure game set in a Gothic fantasy version of the Southern United States inspired by local folk tales. Protagonist Hazel is forced to become a Weaver, a magical mender of broken ties and spirits, after a hurricane strikes her hometown of Prospero. Armed with these new skills, Hazel must confront and subdue dangerous creatures to save her mother, untangle the webs of her own family's shared past, and possibly find her way to a place that feels like home.</p>
<p>Players will use an ancient power to restore creatures and uncover the traumas that consumed them. They can cast weaving magic to battle destructive Haints, explore the diverse regions of the south, and reweave the tears in the Great Tapestry. They'll explore the lush, decaying county of Prospero and its inhabitants while experiencing an artful, stop-motion-like visual style, not to mention haunting storytelling and music inspired by the complex and rich history of the South.</p>
<p>The developers recently said they're mainly focusing on storytelling rather than combat. Also, gamers can expect it to last around twelve hours, which is not a lot compared to most action adventure titles. However, the game will be available on Game Pass, which should make it more appealing for subscribers. South of Midnight is powered by Unreal Engine 4 and will be released on PC and Xbox Series S|X. The consoles will run the game at 60 frames per second.</p>
