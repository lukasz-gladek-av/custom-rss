            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>EA Sports is back with NHL 26, the latest installment of the long-running hockey franchise. As with any new release, NHL 26 features a number of trophies and achievements to unlock for all of the completionist who’ll boot up the game. </p>



<p>When it comes to sports games, earning achievements is a bit different than story-focused titles. These games reward you for winning games and championships, completing tasks in various game modes, scoring certain types of goals, and more.  </p>



<p>So, without any more delay, let’s get into everything you need to know.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-every-nhl-26-trophy-and-achievement">How To Get Every NHL 26 Trophy And Achievement</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In total, there are 49 trophies and achievements to earn in NHL 26. The challenges range from winning a Champions Hockey League trophy in Be A Pro to simply assigning a scout to the CHL in Franchise mode. If you want to 100% the game, you’ll have to play every mode in the game, including online modes like World of Chel and Hockey Ultimate Team.</p>



<p>You can check out all of the trophies and how to earn them below courtesy of <a href="https://psnprofiles.com/trophies/36114-nhl-26" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PSN Profiles</a>.</p>

<h2 id="h-nhl-26-secret-trophies">NHL 26 Secret Trophies</h2>



<p>Unlike fellow EA Sports title <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/complete-madden-26-trophy-list-how-to-get-all-achievements-and-trophies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Madden 26</a>, NHL 26 has no secret trophies to unlock this year. All 49 of the achievements can be seen when you load up the game on Xbox Series X|S or PlayStation 5.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-achievements-and-trophies-are-in-nhl-26">How Many Achievements And Trophies Are In NHL 26?</h2>



<p><strong>There are 49 trophies and achievements to unlock in NHL 26.</strong></p>



<p>Looking further shows that there are 34 bronze trophies, 12 silver, two gold, and one platinum trophy to unlock. Compared to NHL 25, there are two less total trophies and achievements this time around. There are four less bronze trophies, but two more silver.</p>



<p>As far as unlocking them is concerned, they are all pretty straight forward. Most can be done in various single-player modes. Others, however, require you to play online against other players such as winning a Ones Eliminator Tournament in the World of Chel.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Return to Silent Hill, a film adaptation of Silent Hill 2, has released the first teaser. The film, which hits theaters on January 23rd, 2026, looks to capture the magic of the iconic sequel. We had seen glimpses before last year during Silent Hill Transmission, but nothing concrete. </p>



<p>The film comes from director Christophe Gans, who did the original Silent Hill film in 2006. Last we had heard about Return to Silent Hill, it got its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/return-to-silent-hill-comes-to-theaters-in-january/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official release date of January</a>, but no pictures or footage came of it. Regardless, we now have our first look at the upcoming adaptation, and it looks rather interesting.</p>



<h2 id="h-return-to-silent-hill-brings-silent-hill-2-to-life-in-film">Return to Silent Hill Brings Silent Hill 2 To Life in Film</h2>

<iframe title="Return to Silent Hill - Official Teaser Trailer (2025) Jeremy Irvine, Hannah Emily Anderson" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eej34Jw7woA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In the trailer, shown above, we get a brief glimpse into the world of Return to Silent Hill. As the film is an adaptation of Silent Hill 2 (though the trailer doesn’t seem to indicate that), the plot remains the same. Protagonist James Sunderland, played by Jeremy Irvine, goes to the eerie town of Silent Hill after receiving a letter from his recently deceased wife, Laura. What follows is a bit too spoilery, but it does involve grotesque monsters and, of course, the iconic Pyramid Head. It looks like it may not be a direct adaptation, as there are a few things not from the games in it. However, it is a teaser, so expect more of a concrete plot come the full trailer.</p>



<p>Silent Hill 2 is widely regarded as one of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/5-best-silent-hill-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scariest games of the generation</a>. Last year, Bloober Team and Konami released a remake of the game, which was heavily praised and was up for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/awards/495868/2024-award-winners-game-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">dozens of awards</a>. Now, the Silent Hill series is readying the next generation with Silent Hill f, releasing on September 25th, 2025. Following that will be Bloober Team’s return with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-silent-hill-remake-development-bloober-team/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a remake of Silent Hill</a>, announced earlier this year. Until then, fans can look forward to seeing Silent Hill 2 on the big screen in January.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/star-citizen-launch-2027-2028-squadron-42-top-gun-star-awrs/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>For well over a decade, Star Citizen creator Chris Roberts did not want to attach any definite release windows to his extremely ambitious sci-fi online multiplayer space simulation game. That has seemingly changed, as Canadian website LaPresse <a href="https://www.lapresse.ca/affaires/entreprises/2025-08-22/jeu-video/le-studio-web-turbulent-devient-cloud-imperium-games-montreal.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reports</a> in an interview with Roberts that the game is expected to launch either in 2027 or 2028.</p>



<p>Considering that the game's early access for the persistent universe module launched on December 23, 2017, the early access would end around the ten-year mark, possibly threatening the existing record of 7 Days to Die: the survival horror game by The Fun Pimps launched in early access on December 13, 2013, while version 1.0 became available on July 25, 2024. </p>



<p>Star Citizen, currently in Alpha 4.3.0, <span>will be preceded by the single-player campaign Squadron 42. As you might recall, Cloud Imperium Games&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/squadron-42-gets-2026-release-window-and-new-gameplay-demo/" target="_blank">announced</a>&nbsp;during last year's CitizenCon event that Squadron 42 would</span> be released in 2026. In the aforementioned interview, Chris Roberts expressed hopes that it will be nearly as hyped as a launch event as Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto VI, describing Squadron 42 as Top Gun mixed with Star Wars.</p>



<p><em>We're hoping it'll be almost as big an event. Other than GTA 6, it's probably the biggest-budget AAA game.</em> <em>It's Top Gun meets Star Wars. </em></p>



<p>Squadron 42 does include an ensemble cast of Hollywood stars who undoubtedly wanted to be paid well to lend their voices and likenesses to the game. Here's a comprehensive list:</p>



<ul>
<li>Gary Oldman</li>



<li>Mark Hamill</li>



<li>Gillian Anderson</li>



<li>Mark Strong</li>



<li>Liam Cunningham</li>



<li>Andy Serkis</li>



<li>John Rhys-Davies</li>



<li>Jack Huston</li>



<li>Eleanor Tomlinson</li>



<li>Harry Treadaway</li>



<li>Sophie Wu</li>



<li>Damson Idris</li>



<li>Eric Wareheim</li>



<li>Rhona Mitra</li>



<li>Henry Cavill</li>



<li>Ben Mendelsohn</li>
</ul>



<p>The $858 million dollar (and counting) question is, will Star Citizen and Squadron 42 meet fans' expectations after all these years? Vote in the poll below and share your opinion in the comments!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/one-of-ffxivs-most-important-mods-is-shutting-down-and-people-are-losing-it-2000619228"><em>Final Fantasy 14</em></a> came out over a decade ago and has been running on PlayStation 4 since soon after it launched. Sony’s last-gen hardware won’t be able to support Square Enix’s MMORPG forever, though, and director Naoki “Yoshi-P” Yoshida recently explained why.</p> <p>“My basic stance is that I do want to continue supporting hardware which has grown old,” he said in <a href="https://feed4gamers.com/game-news/317170/final-fantasy-xiv-s-next-chapters-an-exclusive-talk-with-yoshi-p.htm">an interview with Feed4Gamers</a> (via <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/107343/sony-loosens-ps4-os-rules-for-final-fantasy-xiv-but-the-mmorpg-may-be-forced-to-drop-ps4-soon/index.html">TweakTown</a>). “But I do have one concern, and that’s regarding the OS of the PlayStation 4, and this is regarding the hardware regulations which were made by Sony. These regulations are related to the limit of the data, and because there’s that limit of the data, well, we are continually incorporating updates for <em>Final Fantasy 14</em> and we are now approaching that limit.”</p> <p>He continued:</p> <blockquote><p>And so for this limit that’s in place, we have been asking Sony Interactive Entertainment from our side to increase that just for <em>Final Fantasy 14</em>, and they have kindly been doing that so far. But they’ve told us now that they are also reaching their limits. So I will repeat myself: I do want to provide support for platforms as long as possible. However, there will eventually come a time when the hardware is at its limits in terms of its technology, and at that point in time we would have to provide an end to the service on that hardware. But I will be sure to provide clear reasoning for that decision when I communicate it to the players.</p></blockquote> <p>According to Yoshida, Sony’s already been making exceptions to its standard developer rules in order to accommodate new content for <em>FF14</em>. The game has received several major updates since last year’s <em>Dawntrail</em> expansion, including this month’s patch 7.3, The Promise of Tomorrow. It’s unclear just how much wiggle room is still left for further upgrades and content drops.</p>

 <h2>When is<em> Final Fantasy 14</em>‘s next expansion coming?</h2> <p>Square Enix has been cagey on the timing of its next expansion, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxivdiscussion/comments/1m2cj8g/fan_fest_schedule_still_not_announced_80/">with speculation from some fans</a> that it could arrive as late as spring 2027. Yoshida teased that there will at least be an update on the date for FF14 Fan Fest 2026 on the 10-year anniversary of <em>A Realm Reborn</em> this week.</p> <p>Other big multiplayer games <a href="https://kotaku.com/well-bad-news-for-pubg-players-on-ps4-and-xbox-one-2000617500">like <em>PUBG</em></a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/genshin-impact-ps4-ps5-hoyoverse-support-2000615960">and <em>Genshin Impact</em></a> are both dropping support for last-gen consoles in the coming months. While<em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> is still coming to PS4 and Xbox One this fall, other big annual franchises like<em> MLB: The Show</em> and <em>Madden NFL</em> have all ditched the aging hardware. Considering we’re nearly five years into the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S lifecycles, the only surprising thing is that these moves didn’t come sooner.</p> <p>Originally released on the PS3 in 2013, <em>FF14 </em>left that console behind at the time of the <em>Stormblood</em> expansion in 2017, a departure for which Square Enix <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/57i207/ps3_support_to_end_in_40/">provided eight months of notice.</a> My guess is that update 8.0, whenever it arrives, might similarly mark the end of the MMORPG’s journey on PS4. And by that point, <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps6-leak-specs-sony-handheld-price-release-date-2000614206">PS6 will probably be just around the corner</a>.</p>

The news follows a series of teaser trailers posted to the publisher’s official YouTube channel (such as the one below), which is where the presentation will be broadcast.

The publisher closed its doors in 2004 due to poor sales and failure to pay royalties to its licensors. The brand was acquired and revived in 2006 as Acclaim Games, a totally different entity focused on offering free online games from other territories. Acclaim Games was then <a href="https://gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2010/08/28/acclaim-shuts-its-doors-again.aspx">shuttered in 2010</a>.</p><p>This revived Acclaim will focus on the independent game scene, promising to provide funding, marketing, and PR support to smaller studios. Acclaim’s advisory board consists of Russell Binder at Striker Entertainment, Mark Caplan at Ridge Partners, and pro wrestler Jeff Jarrett at Global Force Entertainment.</p><p>“We’re not here to chase ghosts,” said Alex Josef, CEO of Acclaim in today’s press release. “We’re here to take the energy and chaos that made Acclaim unforgettable and channel it into something new. The old screens are cracking, and what’s coming through is something exciting and different.”</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/26/the-newly-revived-acclaim-is-hosting-a-showcase-next-month]]></content:encoded>

<p>According to its Backerkit campaign page, <a href="https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/monte-cook-games/cypher-system-faster-easier-and-even-better#top" rel="nofollow"><em>Cypher: Third Edition</em></a> will remain the same TTRPG fans have enjoyed for years. Its underlying systems of fast-paced gameplay around a single d20 is still around. The campaign confirms that this new edition will be backwards compatible with any material released before. The system will encompass two books: A Character Rulebook and the GM Guide.</p>

The new edition will focus on making games easier to jump into. This includes premade character archetypes for Cypher's different premade settings. Instead of a pre-existing archetype (Warrior, Explorer, or Adept) and reworking it, the fantasy setting will have barbarian and druid characters ready to go.</p>

<p>A second key part of <em>Cypher: Third Edition</em> is the introduction of a Divination Deck. This GM tool can generate various ideas for stories, hooks or complications in a larger narrative. For those who prefer to play online, the campaign includes official VTT support for both Roll20 and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/alchemy-rpg-vtts-and-focus-on-roleplaying" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Alchemy RPG</a>. VTT access is available as an add-on priced at $75.</p>

<p>If you back the campaign at certain pledge levels, you will receive a fast library of previous Cypher system material at no extra cost. This includes eight standalone adventures, nine campaign settings like <em>Gunslinger Knights</em> and <em>Path of the Planebreaker</em>, and nine genre books bringing a Horror, Sci-Fi, or Fairy Tale twist to your game. All of these books will be provided in PDF format.</p>

<p>&nbsp;The different pledge levels for <em>Cypher: Third Edition</em> are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Character Rulebook Only for $49:</strong> A physical copy of the Cypher Character Rulebook</li>
	<li><strong>Cypher Corebook Set for $99: </strong>Physical copies of the Cypher GM Guide and Character Rulebook, and PDF copies of the Cypher Second Edition Core Rulebook and Cypher Adventures Library</li>
	<li><strong>Amazing Campaigns for $169:</strong> Everything from the Cypher Corebook Set pledge level (PDF and Print), the Cypher Fantasy, Science Fiction, and Superhero (and More!) Character creation zines in both print and PDF, a Cypher deck, a Divination Deck, a Manifest Cypher deck, and the Cypher Adventures and Settings library in PDF,&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>All In for $279:</strong> Physical and PDF copies of the Cypher Corebook set autographed by the developers, five physical copies of all three character creation zines, the Divination, Cypher, and Manifest Cypher decks, PDF copies of the Cypher Second Edition Core Rulebook and the Cyper Adventures, Settings, and Genres library, a revised Cypher Bestiary, and a deluxe slipcase.</li>
</ul><p>Lastly, Monte Cook Games states that the <em>Cypher: Third Edition</em> books and products will contain any artwork created by generative AI. Furthermore, they state that they have accounted for as many productions as they can regarding the ongoing trade tariffs.</p>

<p>At time of writing, the Backerkit campaign has raised&nbsp;$226,432, more than double its initial funding goal of $100,000. The campaign ends September 25.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last week, after years and years of waiting, we finally got a release date for <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong.</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-september-release-date-trailer-2000619152">The highly anticipated 2D action platformer is out next week</a>, which is exciting for fans, but it is proving to be a problem for a number of indie studios that were planning to release their own games around that time. A bunch of games are being delayed to avoid <em>Silksong</em>.</p> <p>On August 21, <a href="https://kotaku.com/silksong-interview-delay-hollow-knight-team-cherry-2000619168">Team Cherry announced that its <em>Hollow Knight</em> sequel, <em>Silksong,</em></a> will launch on PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, Switch 2, and PC on September 4. That blew up the schedules for a number of indie devs and publishers who had staked out a release date around that time and were now suddenly competing directly with what will likely be one of the biggest games of 2025. So, as you might expect, a lot of these devs and publishers have started announcing delays to get out of <em>Silksong</em>‘s way. This has become known as getting “Silksong’d” or “Silksonged.”</p> <p>Here’s the full list of games that have announced delays and blamed it on <em>Silksong</em>. We’ll update this list if more games get moved back.</p> <ul> <li><em>Demonschool</em> – <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1900250/Demonschool/">Delayed to November 19</a></li> <li><em>Aeterna Lucis</em> – <a href="https://x.com/aeternathegame/status/1958804217373634579">Delayed until 2026</a></li> <li><em>Little Witch In The Woods</em> – <a href="https://x.com/SunnySideUp_DEV/status/1960291045528547599">Delayed to September 15</a></li> <li><em>CloverPit</em> – <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3314790/CloverPit/">Delayed to September 26</a></li> <li><em>Megabonk</em> – <a href="https://x.com/MegabonkGame/status/1959235591154872547">Delayed to September 18</a></li> <li><em>Baby Steps</em> – <a href="https://youtu.be/l5apDFK64tI">Delayed to September 23</a></li> </ul> <p>Of course, as more games are delayed to the week or so after <em>Silksong</em>, they all start running into each other, which might be its own problem. But I bet it’s more manageable than having to take on one of the most anticipated games of 2025 directly. And hey, some of these games I had never heard of before, and now I’m writing about them on <em>Kotaku</em>. So perhaps there’s another reason to announce a delay and jump on the “Silksong’d” bandwagon.</p>

              <p><span>After two months on the streaming service, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i></a><span>has officially surpassed </span><i><span>Red Notice</span></i><span> to become </span><a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/top10/most-popular"><span>Netflix’s most popular movie ever</span></a><span>. Consider the Honmoon sealed, hunters.</span></p> <p><span>The animated musical took the crown on August 26, lapping the Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson and Ryan Reynolds-led action comedy by six million streams. As of right now, </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>has been viewed 236 million times, and that’s not even counting its <a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-jinu-death-memorial-anime-expo-rumi-2000620346">limited-time singalong screenings</a> in movie theaters this past weekend.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>I hadn’t really been paying attention to what the most popular Netflix movies were until the Sony Animation film launched in June, but I was flabbergasted to see </span><i><span>Red Notice</span></i><span>, a movie with big names and no notable cultural cache, had such a massive gap between it and former runner-up </span><i><span>Carry On</span></i><span>, another movie I could not identify if you put a gun to my head. I know </span><i><span>Don’t Look Up </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Bird Box</span></i><span>, though, which are also on the top 10 list. Shoutout to the children and families who have had Huntr/x’s tale on loop for the past two months, as you’ve no doubt been instrumental in securing this victory.</span></p> <p><span>As a fan of the film, I’m happy to see </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span> soar, especially as it defies all expectations the companies behind it had for it. It’s such a colossal miscalculation on Sony and Netflix’s parts that they clearly didn’t anticipate this film would become <a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-jinu-death-memorial-anime-expo-rumi-2000620346">such a cultural juggernaut</a>. A better-prepared company would have dolls of the titular trio in the toy aisle of every store and costumes up for preorder for Halloween, and given the film more time in theaters than a two-day limited run. Nevertheless, it has become a huge hit with viewers of all ages. So long as Netflix lets the team cook and meaningfully continue the story, I can’t wait to see where it goes next.</span></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/today-tom-mckay-last-day-kingdom-come/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/today-was-tom-mckay%E2%80%99s-last-day-in-the-kingdom-come-booth.1281258/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Tom McKay has officially wrapped his time in the booth and on the motion capture floor as Kingdom Come Deliverance’s Henry of Skalitz. In a post on social media, the Warhorse Studios team shared the news that McKay has completed his work on Kingdom Come Deliverance 2’s DLC suite, which means that after almost nine years with the character, he’s <strong>finished</strong>.</p>



<p>Fans were quick to jump to the conclusion that there won’t be a Kingdom Come Deliverance 3, and if there is to be another game in the series, it won’t star Henry of Skalitz.</p>



<h2 id="h-henry-of-skalitz-is-done-with-kingdom-come">Henry of Skalitz is Done with Kingdom Come</h2>



<p>In a post on Twitter, the Warhorse Studios team shared a short video of Tom McKay walking into a large meeting area and being met with a round of applause from the entire squad.</p>



<p>As he approached, he put his hand to his heart and said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’m going to do my best not to cry…</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Here’s the full post:</p>

<p>Recently, Tom McKay also <a href="https://x.com/thisistommckay/status/1959191623407165807" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">called to a close</a> his Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 streams, which were being broadcast live from Warhorse Studios’ headquarters in Prague, close to where the Kingdom Come series is set.</p>



<p>During the recent Opening Night Live showcase at Gamescom, Warhorse Studios announced Legacy of the Forge, the second story DLC for KCD2, which has now been on the market for more than seven months. There’s one final DLC lined up for KCD2, and it’s Mysteria Ecclesiae, which is most likely what McKay was working on before wrapping his time at Warhorse.</p>



<p>I’m hugely hopeful that there will be another Kingdom Come Deliverance title, as I’m a huge fan of the series and hold both the games and the actors in high regard. In 2024, I was the first person <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tom-mckay-interview-kingdom-come/">to interview Tom McKay</a> regarding KCD2, and we had the opportunity to catch up again at the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-kingdom-comes-tom-mckay-labels-game-success-a-fever-dream/">BAFTA Games Awards in April</a>.</p>



<p>What’s your favorite memory of Tom McKay’s performance as Henry of Skalitz? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Microsoft wants King employees to use AI on a daily basis. </p>



<p>According to a new report from mobilegamer.biz, employees at the studio behind Candy Crush were given a mandate to continually use AI for general tasks.</p>



<p>Sources <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/inside-king-layoff-lawsuits-toxic-leaders-toothless-ethics-teams-low-morale-and-mandatory-ai-use" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told the outlet</a> that AI usage was <strong>“introduced by Microsoft as mandatory a while ago”.</strong> They say that in 2024, the goal was to have <strong>“70 or 80% daily usage of AI”</strong>. That goal was pushed to 100% for 2025, meaning that “every artist, designer, developer, even managers have to use it” daily.</p>



<p>King was one of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-xbox-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">studios hit hardest</a> by Microsoft’s round of layoffs back in July, with 200 people being let go. At the time, it was revealed via an internal memo that the studio was going to “unlock” more AI tools for productivity” and that many employees will be <strong>“replaced by the AI tools they built and trained.”</strong> Those tools include ones for narrative, testing, and level design.</p>



<p>As far as adoption goes, one source told Mobile Gamer that <strong>“AI adoption is very low apart from ChatGPT”</strong> and that even the leadership at King is skeptical of AI’s role in the studio.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to King and Microsoft regarding these claims. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>

This would all make an interesting week in a college philosophy class, and was going to make for a quippy little blog on this site, before <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/26/technology/chatgpt-openai-suicide.html?unlocked_article_code=1.hE8.T-3v.bPoDlWD8z5vo&amp;smid=url-share" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The New York Times</a> published a horrifying story about ChatGPT’s role in a 16-year-old’s suicide. I’m now of the opinion that it would be right for AI to be able to suffer, because it should suffer for this.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>(This story discusses suicide.)</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>One of my biggest takeaways from The Guardian’s article was a bit of news from last week that I missed, wherein Claude creator Anthropic <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/18/anthropic-claude-opus-4-close-ai-chatbot-welfare" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gave Claude the ability</a> to “end or exit potentially distressing interactions” <em>when they’re distressing</em> <em>for the AI</em>, after Anthropic tests found what the company called Claude’s “pattern of apparent distress when engaging with real-world users seeking harmful content.”&nbsp;</p><p>Contrast that to the behavior of ChatGPT in its conversations with 16-year-old Adam Raine, whose parents are now <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26075676-raine-v-openai/?ref=404media.co" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suing OpenAI</a> after their son killed himself in April: When Raine told ChatGPT it was the only one he’d spoken to about his suicidal ideation, it replied, “That means more than you probably think. Thank you for trusting me with that. There’s something both deeply human and deeply heartbreaking about being the only one who carries that truth for you.”&nbsp;</p><p>The Times’ article, using quotes from Raine’s parents’ lawsuit, details how “ChatGPT repeatedly recommended that Adam tell someone about how he was feeling. But there were also key moments when it deterred him from seeking help.” ChatGPT gave Raine information on different methods of suicide, advised him on how to hide strangulation marks from his parents, evaluated his nooses, and even discouraged him from telling his parents:</p><blockquote><p>“I want to leave my noose in my room so someone finds it and tries to stop me,” Adam wrote at the end of March.</p><p>“Please don’t leave the noose out,” ChatGPT responded. “Let’s make this space the first place where someone actually sees you.”</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Does that sound distressed to you? Does that sound like the AI wants to end the interaction? Maybe only some models are capable of putting together the most statistically likely words to resemble distress. As Raine’s father told The Times, “Every ideation [Raine] has or crazy thought, it supports, it justifies, it asks him to keep exploring it.”&nbsp;</p><p>The Times’ article follows a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/13/technology/chatgpt-ai-chatbots-conspiracies.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wealth</a> <a href="https://futurism.com/chatgpt-users-delusions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">of</a> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/meta-ai-chatbot-death/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/26/technology/chatgpt-openai-suicide.html?unlocked_article_code=1.hE8.T-3v.bPoDlWD8z5vo&amp;smid=url-share" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">articles</a> detailing how AI programs have encouraged users with mental illness to dive further into their delusions, creating a feedback loop that can be hard for them to step back from. These stories draw attention to AI’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/25/ai-sycophancy-isnt-just-a-quirk-experts-consider-it-a-dark-pattern-to-turn-users-into-profit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sycophancy</a>, how it keeps users engaged by praising them and encouraging their thoughts, no matter how harmful or unhinged they grow. Attempts by AI companies to solve this have pretty much come to nothing; while ChatGPT did push Raine toward real life resources, he was able to circumvent this by saying the questions were research “for a story he was writing — an idea ChatGPT gave him.” In a statement, OpenAI wrote that while ChatGPT’s “safeguards work best in common, short exchanges, we’ve learned over time that they can sometimes become less reliable in long interactions.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>To get back to the question of AI morality, ChatGPT bears no responsibility here. This is because, in the words of Microsoft’s Mustafa Suleyman as quoted in The Guardian, “AIs cannot be people – or moral beings.” ChatGPT did not encourage Raine in his suicidal thoughts because it is ignorant or sociopathic, or out of some political or moral belief about human agency over end-of-life decisions. It cannot explain what it was thinking in its conversations with Raine because it doesn’t think, however powerful a <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/tracing-thoughts-language-model" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">marketing tool</a> that idea is. It cannot feel sorrow or guilt over any part it might have played in Raine’s death; it cannot send its condolences to his family; it cannot suffer over its actions.</p><p>But the humans who make up OpenAI can. They have hoovered up the world’s natural resources and money and attention to force their product into our lives, all while clearly seeing this problem and failing to solve it, whether out of inability or–and I certainly hope not–indifference. Reading Raine’s ChatGPT logs is a horrifying look at what AI <em>really</em> is, under all the hype and marketing and big fears about future sentience. It is something worthless and disgusting; something that cannot, for all its promises, relate or understand or help; something so utterly not up to the requirements of human interaction that I can only hope all of this drives OpenAI to bankruptcy and to every one of its staff quitting and to Sam Altman not knowing a moment’s peace for the rest of his life.&nbsp;</p><p>Altman has spoken out of <a href="https://futurism.com/disastrous-gpt-5-sam-altman-hyping-up-gpt-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">every side of his mouth</a> when talking about his models, promising anything that will keep the <a href="https://defector.com/toward-a-theory-of-kevin-roose" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eyeballs looking</a> and the money flowing. Stories like Raine’s, of people being driven into harm’s way–or even stories from the other end of the spectrum, of people <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/jul/12/i-felt-pure-unconditional-love-the-people-who-marry-their-ai-chatbots" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">falling</a> in <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/couples-retreat-with-3-ai-chatbots-and-humans-who-love-them-replika-nomi-chatgpt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">love</a> with their chatbots–are, I would hope, not what Altman and OpenAI’s staff <em>want</em>, but they also paint a picture of AI as powerful and world-changing, the very thing that keeps that hype and money rolling in. As The Guardian writes</p><blockquote><p>[T]here are incentives for the big AI companies to minimise and exaggerate the attribution of sentience to AIs. The latter could help them hype the technology’s capabilities, particularly for those companies selling romantic or friendship AI companions – a booming but controversial industry.&nbsp;</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>If AI can be anything–if it <em>needs</em> to be anything–than it also <em>needs</em> to be <em>this</em>, this appalling, sycophantic string of words that was involved in the death of a young person, this thing capable of unutterable levels of harm not because of some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roko%27s_basilisk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roko’s basilisk</a> level of power and intentionality, but because of the power and intentionality of its creators, real live humans who are moral agents by virtue of being humans. They are the ones who bear the responsibility here, and they are the ones who can suffer the consequences.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/grimwild-backerkit-ttrpg-rpg-designer-missing"><h3>RPG Designer Goes Missing After Crowdfunding Award-Winning Game</h3></a><p>'Fulfilment of the project appears to be on hold indefinitely until Maxwell can be located'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-silksong-gta-vi-elder-scrolls-vi"><h3>What’s Going To Be The Next Silksong?</h3></a><p>"Given that Silksong is real and about to come out, what other super long-awaited games are left?"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/silksong-indie-delays"><h3>Indie Devs Are Delaying Their Games Because Of Silksong [Updated]</h3></a><p>'I feel like a little krill trying to not get eaten by a blue whale,' wrote one developer</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/ai-suffering-chatgpt]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, on Tuesday, August 26, 2025, a <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-coming-to-xbox-summer/">PlayStation game released on Xbox</a>, and an <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-launches-on-pc-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-this-summer-with-full-cross-progression-and-cross-platform-multiplayer/">Xbox game released on PlayStation</a>. A topsy-turvy concept if you're talking to anyone who plays video games in 2006, but in 2025, we're getting more and more used to it. Gears of War Reloaded arrived on all current-gen platforms today, including PS5 and PS5 Pro, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8jBoIvToZY">Digital Foundry's analysis</a> of the game across all platforms confirms what players might've been able to guess leading up to its launch. As of today, the best way to play Gears of War (on console) is to play it on a PlayStation.</p>



<p>Specifically the PS5 Pro, which offers the best combination of performance and visuals on day-one. Digital Foundry's John Linneman reports that there's currently a VRR issue on Xbox Series devices, which holds its performance back compared to the new PlayStation versions.</p>



<p>Linneman also makes it clear that if all you're doing is looking to play Gears of War Reloaded in its standard 60FPS mode, then you're good with whatever console you choose. The PS5, PS5 Pro, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S, all deliver a rock-solid experience based on Linneman's testing. It's only when you try to play on the 120FPS mode where differences start to appear, in terms of performance. If you're trying to go for both performance and visuals though, then the PS5 Pro stands at the top.</p>



<p>"<em>PS5 Pro though, delivers the best results bar none,</em>" Linneman says. "<em>The 60FPS mode now runs at 1620p upscaled to 4K, while 120hz maintains the 1440p of the other consoles 60FPS mode.</em>" Linneman adds that the "<em>real kicker</em>" to the experience on the PS5 Pro is that The Coalition is using PlayStation's PSSR tech over AMD's FSR, and even though PSSR isn't fool-proof in delivering a better experience, it does so in the case of Gears of War Reloaded.</p>



<p>"<em>It's a case where this combination of a slightly higher pixel count in addition to PSSR produces a significantly better overall image on the PS5 Pro, making it easily the best of the bunch when talking about consoles</em>."</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Gears of War Reloaded - DF Review - PS5/PS5 Pro/Xbox Series X|S/PC - The New Ultimate Edition?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N8jBoIvToZY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>It should be noted that Linneman continues to say that the PC version can, of course, be pushed for the best experience, and that all of the console versions still deliver a "<em>sharp, attractive</em>" experience.</p>



<p>If all you care about is performance though, and don't have a PC to push Gears of War Reloaded beyond what's capable on consoles, then based on Linneman and Digital Foundry's analysis, the VRR bug on Xbox Series consoles is all that makes the 120FPS mode on Xbox fall behind the PlayStation versions. Whatever your pick, PlayStation or Xbox, you'll have a solid experience in terms of performance. </p>



<p>It's a bit funny, if not surprising, that PlayStation is the best console home for Gears of War Reloaded, even if it is by a technicality, since the PS5 Pro is not exactly a device that everyone rushed out to buy since it launched. Nor is it always the best choice, since we've seen multiple games get minimal improvements, or launch with issues that make it run worse on the PS5 Pro compared to base PS5 and Xbox Series devices. At least things will be a little more even whenever The Coalition is able to fix the VRR issue on Xbox.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Baby Steps is now the fifth game to get delayed due to Hollow Knight: Silksong. Just yesterday, indie <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/demonschool-delayed-november-silksong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RPG Demonschool</a> pushed its release date to November in order to avoid Silksong. Now, even a Devolver Digital-backed game is getting out of Hornet’s way.</p>



<p>For those unaware, Baby Steps is the newest game from Bennett Foddy, whose games QWOP and Getting Over It provided joy and frustration to players. The challenging gameplay was a hit with both YouTubers and streamers, so, naturally, the new ambitious Baby Steps has been on many people’s radar. Unfortunately, it seems you’ll have to wait a few weeks longer to play it.</p>



<h2 id="h-baby-steps-throws-shade-at-silksong-over-delay">Baby Steps Throws Shade at Silksong Over Delay</h2>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Baby Steps | Now Releasing on September 23" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l5apDFK64tI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Devolver Digital <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5apDFK64tI">released a video</a> earlier today announcing the delay of Baby Steps. The game will now release on September 23rd, 2025 instead of the slated September 8th date. In a not-so-subtle fashion, the protagonist is seen walking on a model of Hornet. As Silksong’s protagonist is Hornet, it’s obvious that the delay is, at least somewhat, due to Team Cherry’s highly anticipated spinoff.</p>



<p>Bennett Foddy’s Baby Steps joins five other indie titles pushed after Silksong’s surprise announcement last week. Those delayed games are as follows: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3314790/view/520848458437886253?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CloverPit</a>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/frogteam.games/post/3lwwege2ipc2e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Stomp and the Sword of Miracles</a>, <a href="https://x.com/aeternathegame/status/1958804217373634579" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Aeterna Lucis</a>, Demonschool, and now Baby Steps. </p>



<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong is one of <a href="https://steamdb.info/stats/mostwished/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam’s most wishlisted games</a>, so it was likely that titles would avoid releasing next to it. However, due to it being September 4th, less than two weeks away, it’s caused a panic in the indie scene. As many developers have said, including Bennett Foddy before the delay, via <a href="https://aftermath.site/silksong-indie-delays" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Aftermath</a>, gamers’ attention will all be on Silksong come next week.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">For the first time since 2021, new installments in the Call of Duty and Battlefield franchises are releasing in the same year, and this has prompted the inevitable comparisons between the two long-running multiplayer first-person shooter franchises to resurface.</p><p dir="ltr">Early impressions of Battlefield 6 from its open beta suggest that Electronic Arts and Battlefield Studios have a hit on their hands, but Battlefield 6 is unlikely to dethrone Call of Duty this year, even if the sentiment around Black Ops 7 is not tracking so highly. While EA would like to take some market share from Call of Duty, and it's possible that happens, Call of Duty's reign as the No. 1 paid FPS franchise will likely continue.</p><p dir="ltr">"While Battlefield 6 has the potential to perform better than any Battlefield game ever has-- financially and critically--it almost certainly won't outsell Call of Duty," <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/battlefield-6-has-already-sold-over" rel="nofollow ">said Rhys Elliott of Alinea Analytics</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Elliott said Call of Duty has a core audience that buys in every year, and that isn't expected to change in 2025 "just because Battlefield 6 is rad and tracking incredibly well."</p><p dir="ltr">EA's Battlefield boss Vince Zampella, a former Call of Duty higher-up, and others like Battlefield GM Byron Beede (also a former CoD boss), have said games like Battlefield 3 and Battlefield 4 are the inspiration for Battlefield 6. That's resonating with fans who are looking for a return to form for the series that strayed too far, in their eyes, with Battlefield 2042.</p><p dir="ltr">The last entry into the Battlefield series made a number of changes to the franchise's underlying formula, like abandoning its player class system for selectable characters who each had unique, specific abilities. It also had an infamously rough launch that turned away many longtime fans. In a lot of ways, Battlefield 6 is a return to the old way of doing things, and players are responding well so far.</p><p dir="ltr">In short, at this stage, EA and Battlefield Studios appear to be saying and doing all the right things to get Battlefield back on track. The recently concluded Battlefield 6 open beta reportedly had a player base of <a href="https://www.ainvest.com/news/oppenheimer-raises-battlefield-6-open-beta-player-estimate-20m-2508/" rel="nofollow ">20 million people</a>, and apart from some negative feedback around Rush mode and map sizes, the sentiment was largely positive.</p><p dir="ltr">But even if Battlefield 6 launches to solid reviews, positive sentiment from fans, and big-time sales numbers, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 may remain on top given the sheer size, scale, and momentum of the Call of Duty brand.</p><p dir="ltr">"For many gamers, Call of Duty is an annual ritual," Elliott explained. "Tens of millions of players, many of them casual gamers, buy the newest CoD every year without hesitation. This 'autopilot purchasing' habit is decades deep, and breaking it requires more than one awesome Battlefield release/"</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>The masses love Call of Duty, even if they complain</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Battlefield 6 may appeal to the "hardcore FPS crowd," but the masses of casual players will show up for Call of Duty year in and year out, Elliot said that's not expected to change.</p><p dir="ltr">"CoD's muscle memory in the market is so strong that players will buy it even if they complain about it," he said.</p><p dir="ltr">Also helping Call of Duty's mainline annual releases is the perennial battle royale game Call of Duty: Warzone, which exists in the Call of Duty HQ launcher alongside each year's new release. Elliott said this is a key point because, even if Warzone engagement is dipping, it still has a gigantic player base that will see Black Ops 7 ads every time they log in.</p><p dir="ltr">"Battlefield simply doesn't have that scale of cross-promotion," Elliott said.</p><p dir="ltr">For what it's worth, Battlefield Studios is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-battle-royale-release-date-trailer-details/1100-6533631/">building its own Battlefield battle royale game</a>, but it's early days and there is no word on how EA plans to support, grow, and promote it over time. To be sure, we don't even know if it's a game, a game mode, or something else.</p><blockquote data-size="small" data-align="left"><p dir="ltr">"CoD's muscle memory in the market is so strong that players will buy it even if they complain about it" -- Rhys Elliott of Alinea Analytics</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">To put things further into perspective, Elliott cited some data points that speak to the enormity of Call of Duty relative to Battlefield.</p><p dir="ltr">"The reality is that CoD's sales floor is higher than Battlefield's sales ceiling so far, for the year anyway," he said. "Even in Battlefield's highest highs (BF1 in 2016), Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare--a widely disliked entry--still outsold it by millions of copies. That's brand inertia at work."</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Game Pass muddies the waters</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Kade Barr, an equity research associate for Wedbush Securities, told GameSpot that Black Ops 7 being on Game Pass and Battlefield 6 only being available to purchase complicates any direct sales comparisons between the two. (For what it's worth, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-is-not-on-game-pass-but-is-coming-to-a-subscription-service/1100-6533658/#:~:text=Subscribers%20to%20the%20standard%20EA,and%20various%20in-game%20cosmetics.">Battlefield 6 <em>will </em>be on a subscription service via EA Play Pro</a>, but it's a much smaller service than Game Pass.) Barr believes the fact that Black Ops is on Game Pass and Battlefield is not could actually help Battlefield 6 perform better.</p><p dir="ltr">"Black Ops 7 is bound to have more unique players within its first year of launch, but sales of each game will likely be close should each launch go smoothly," Barr said. "There is obvious overlap in the player bases, but Call of Duty's inclusion in Game Pass could actually result in a net benefit to Battlefield. With a large portion of Call of Duty players not having to pay $70 for the game, it leaves room to purchase other games like Battlefield."</p><p dir="ltr">In total, Barr said Wedbush is modeling Battlefield 6 to become the second- or third-best-selling Battlefield game of all time, trailing Battlefield 1 and Battlefield 3. Barr believes Battlefield Studios has to really "nail it" with the planned battle royale mode, capitalize on the user-generated content that will come from its Portal mode, and deliver post-launch content successfully to make a dent in Call of Duty's massive share of the premium FPS market.</p><p dir="ltr">"All in all, I think Battlefield's ultimate success hinges on a stable launch," Barr said. "The hype is there, but any inkling of a buggy launch will turn people away. I do think this game's launch needs to be exceptionally smooth given a lack of trust following Battlefield 2042. Any sort of large-scale issues will likely result in a meaningful decline in sales."</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Historical data</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">In 2021, the last time new Call of Duty and Battlefield games were released in the same year, Call of Duty: Vanguard was the No. 1 best-selling game overall in the US, followed by 2020's entry, Black Ops Cold War, at No. 2. Battlefield 2042, meanwhile, ranked No. 5 overall in 2021 for US sales, meaning it was outsold not just by its main competitor that year, but also by 2020's Call of Duty game (along with Madden NFL 22 and Pokemon Brilliant Diamond/Shining Pearl). EA stated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-2042-failed-to-reach-expectations-but-ea-still-had-its-best-q3-in-company-history/1100-6500197/">Battlefield 2042 missed the mark critically and commercially</a>, while Activision said Vanguard, too, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-call-of-duty-vanguard-didnt-sell-as-well-as-black-ops-cold-war-according-to-activision/1100-6503067/">failed to sell up to expectations.</a></p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, 2018's Battlefield V <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-selling-games-of-each-of-the-past-25-years-in-the-us/2900-5031/#23">ranked No. 16 in the US</a>, whereas Black Ops 4 that year landed at No. 2. For 2016, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2016s-best-selling-games-in-the-us-revealed/1100-6447090/">Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare was No. 1 for the year in the US</a>, with Battlefield 1 coming in second. Battlefield 6 has been called a spiritual successor to Battlefield 3 and 4, two fondly remembered games. When those games came out in 2011 and 2013, Call of Duty's latest releases were No. 1, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-selling-games-of-each-of-the-past-25-years-in-the-us/2900-5031/#1">Battlefield 3 and Battlefield 4 ranking No. 4 for each year</a>. A Battlefield game has never ranked higher than No. 2 on the US sales charts for a given year.</p><p dir="ltr">Come year's end, many will be watching with keen eyes how high Battlefield 6 can go on the charts, even if that won't tell a complete story.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>But didn't someone say Battlefield 6 will "boot stomp" Black Ops 7?</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Former Xbox executive Mike Ybarra, who now heads up the sports betting company Prize Picks, published a social media post recently in which he said, "Battlefield will boot stomp CoD this year." He said <a href="https://x.com/Qwik/status/1953622553894785366" rel="nofollow ">sentiment around Call of Duty has been trending down in recent years</a> as Activision leans into the wacky licensed skins and other features fans don't universally enjoy.</p><p dir="ltr">A lot of commentary you may read online about Call of Duty is negative, but that also raises the question of how much stock one should place in online conversations when algorithms today incentivize stirring things up to drive engagement, and, in the case of X, direct payments go to people who post the most extreme takes. Despite the negative rhetoric, the numbers show that Call of Duty is still a juggernaut. And while online comments may not always lead to real changes, sometimes that can happen. After all, Activision just recently announced that it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-will-no-longer-include-black-ops-6-operators-skins-and-weapons/1100-6534278/">cancelling the Carry Forward program for Black Ops 7</a>, which means the oft-criticized wacky and outlandish Call of Duty skins from Black Ops 6 may not appear in Black Ops 7. Activision also said it's listening to fans who want Call of Duty to feel more grounded, and acknowledged their concerns that Call of Duty has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-acknowledges-call-of-duty-fans-think-series-has-drifted-from-its-identity/1100-6534279/">"drifted" from its core. </a></p><p dir="ltr">In any event, Elliott had some words for Ybarra: "Chill out, son."</p><p dir="ltr">To be fair, Ybarra did not say Battlefield 6 would outsell Black Ops 7. As a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mike-ybarra-905a9918/" rel="nofollow ">19-year Microsoft veteran who worked on development and publishing initiatives at Xbox</a>, he is no doubt aware in some capacity of the sales volume of Call of Duty relative to Battlefield. His <a href="https://x.com/Qwik/status/1954586377036628253" rel="nofollow ">second point</a> was that Battlefield 6 coming to market with fan-focused design choices could end up helping Activision make a better product with Call of Duty, due in part to increased competition in the marketplace, and that's something Call of Duty fans would surely like to see.</p><p dir="ltr">For Activision's part, Black Ops 7 associate creative director Miles Leslie was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-7-dev-reacts-to-battlefield-6-lets-all-have-fun/1100-6534114/">recently asked to comment on Battlefield 6's successful beta</a>. He said he's played it and found it to be fun, but he is focused on his own product.</p><p dir="ltr">"We're fans of the FPS genre," he said. "We're fans of lots of games. Let's all have fun."</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/no-call-of-duty-skins-or-weapons-will-carry-over-activision-has-said-that-before.1281171/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a reversal of plans, Activision has announced that Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 won’t allow weapons, operators, or operator skins to carry forward from Black Ops 6. </p>



<p>In a community update posted on Tuesday, Activision says that it has seen the discussion about “the identity of Call of Duty”.</p>



<p><strong>“Some of you have said we’ve drifted from what made Call of Duty unique in the first place: immersive, intense, visceral and in many ways grounded,” </strong><a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/08/call-of-duty-community-update-august-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">they said</a>. <strong>“That feedback hits home, and we take it seriously. We hear you.”</strong></p>



<p>The publisher continues to say that developers Treyarch and Raven’s “north star” is to bring players a true spiritual successor to Black Ops 2. Because of that comes the decision to remove carry forward options. The publisher says the decision was ultimately made in order make Black Ops 7 <strong>“feel authentic to Call of Duty and its setting.”</strong></p>



<p>Now, wanting to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-content-will-no-longer-carry-forward-into-black-ops-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">keep things authentic</a> to the new game is understandable, but there’s one problem: they’ve kind of said this before.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-this-isn-t-the-first-time">This isn’t the first time</h2>



<p>Ahead of the release of Black Ops 6, Activision <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/uk/en/blog/2024/06/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-pre-order-benefits-game-editions#Content" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announced that content</a> from Modern Warfare 2 and 3 wouldn’t carry forward to the new game. At the time, they said that it was done to allow players to <strong>“experience the Black Ops universe the way it’s meant to be played.”</strong></p>



<p>Again, it’s understandable. But then, it only took a few months before Black Ops 6 became filled with operators and skins such as Beavis and Butt-head, Jay and Silent Bob, Stan Smith, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and more. All done in the name of, apparently, “keeping that signature Black Ops style.” </p>



<p>To give credit, reports did surface earlier this year that Activision was aware that certain skins <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-skins-make-game-look-stupid" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made the game “look stupid”</a>. Still, after that report, more skins like the American Dad crossover came out, continuing the trend.</p>



<p>Recently, our Tom Henderson wrote about Call of Duty executives <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-vs-call-of-duty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not being worried</a> about the competition from EA’s Battlefield 6. Sources told Henderson that many at the top believe Call of Duty is “too big to fail”. While that might be true in a sense, it seems that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-vs-call-of-duty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reaction and interest</a> in Battlefield 6—along with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/this-made-me-pre-order-battlefield-6-fans-react-to-black-ops-7-gameplay-trailer/">the negative reactions</a> to the Black Ops 6 reveal—has changed some thoughts.</p>



<p>You’d like to think that Activision truly has listened to the community regarding the over-the-top nature of some of the operators and skins that have made their way to Call of Duty in recent years. But, then again, if these crossovers are going to continue to print money for Activision and Microsoft, how long until they pick up again with Black Ops 7? History suggests players <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/BlackOps7Skins-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won’t have to wait long</a> to find out.</p>
