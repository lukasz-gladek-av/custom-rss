Reuniting with my beloved Scions, and going on a new adventure with ties to some of the game’s oldest mysteries, has been a delight. I am fascinated by returning to the Thirteenth (the world completely flooded with darkness) and am already deeply in love with Zero—she’s an incredibly compelling character who has somehow made my least favorite villain in the MMO more interesting by association.

I think I’ve also been grasping for new casual multiplayer games to play with my usual group of friends, and <em>Helldivers 2 </em>kind of fits that bill. We played it a bunch in the first few weeks, and then sharply dropped off, but recently there’s been some interest in returning. I think we’re going to bite the bullet and do it. —Moises Taveras  </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b5e6b20f40d9c72402f36fffa960195d" data-recommend-id="image://b5e6b20f40d9c72402f36fffa960195d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Abel speedruns Mario Kart DS on Twitch." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Abel speedruns Mario Kart DS on Twitch." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / GDQ / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b5e6b20f40d9c72402f36fffa960195d" data-recommend-id="image://b5e6b20f40d9c72402f36fffa960195d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Abel speedruns Mario Kart DS on Twitch." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Watch it on:</strong> Twitch<br><strong>Current goal: </strong>Donate to MSF while watching some amazing speedruns</p><p>Summer Games Done Quick has been going on all week, raising money for Doctors Without Borders/MSF while showcasing <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sgdq-2024-summer-games-done-quick-schedule-1851573798&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sgdq-2024-summer-games-done-quick-schedule-1851573798">a spectacular assortment of speedruns</a></span>. However, the final weekend of a GDQ event is usually particularly packed, as the hype builds and the donations start rolling in faster and faster, and this marathon looks to be no different. You can check out <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://gamesdonequick.com/schedule/48&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gamesdonequick.com/schedule/48" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the schedule yourself here</a></span>, but let me highlight a few runs that I definitely don’t want to miss. </p><p><em>Mario </em>relay races at GDQs are always a treat, and the one on Friday at 7PM ET should be absolutely bananas. It pits two teams head-to-head in a series of Kaizo levels (fan-made levels that are typically <em>extremely </em>difficult) that the players have never seen before, meaning they’re racing to both understand the demanding challenges before them and how to tackle them, <em>and </em>execute on overcoming those challenges before their rivals on the other team can do so. That’s followed at around 9:15 ET by a quick <em>Ocarina of Time </em>speedrun. <em>OoT </em>is one of the quintessential speedrun games, and seeing all the ways in which it can be broken never ceases to fascinate me. </p><p>Then on Saturday, things enter absolutely must-see territory in my opinion at around 7:10 PM ET, when two of the best <em>Super Metroid </em>players in the world race to see who can beat it first. That’s followed by even more <em>Mario </em>racing with two players racing through a series of troll levels in <em>Mario Maker 2</em>, and then a glitchless run of <em>Elden Ring </em>which should see the game finished in under 90 minutes. Closing things out with vibes that are sure to be warm and cozy, as we give all we can to support the absolutely essential work that Doctors Without Borders is doing, it’s a nice run of last year’s Switch remake of <em>Super Mario RPG</em>.

I’ve honestly forgotten the entire thing, other than a really clear visual memory of the Saudi hotel room. A few years back, I wanted to give it another play, which is how I discovered <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/cult-classic-alpha-protocol-removed-from-sale-on-steam-1835662074&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/cult-classic-alpha-protocol-removed-from-sale-on-steam-1835662074">its mysterious absence</a></span>.

I’m amazed how decent the game still looks, especially running at 1440p. It came out in that sweet spot, when ears were <em>almost</em> round, and glasses could sit on a character’s face, rather than be part of it, and that era has lasted nicely. But it is so monstrously unforgiving when it comes to sneaking my way around the mission-based RPG’s enemy bases. This isn’t helped by a really terrible checkpoint save system, where the save points are always right <em>before</em> I have to complete the hacking game to unlock a door that leads to a long corridor, before a ladder that goes down to the crates where the psychic enemy keeps spotting me.</p><p>Still, the acting’s great, and it’s often a lot of fun to approach it like an im-sim and allow chaos to reign when things go wrong, and just try to shoot your way out of trouble. — John Walker</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="215cfb83e1669d8a2b5c07fd0c19d324" data-recommend-id="image://215cfb83e1669d8a2b5c07fd0c19d324" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Spartans engage in battle to attack and defend a massive robot." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Spartans engage in battle to attack and defend a massive robot." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->343 Industries / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="215cfb83e1669d8a2b5c07fd0c19d324" data-recommend-id="image://215cfb83e1669d8a2b5c07fd0c19d324" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Spartans engage in battle to attack and defend a massive robot." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> Xbox Series X/S, Windows (Steam Deck: YMMV)<br><strong>Current goal: </strong>Enjoy the hell out of Sentry Defense</p><p>So <em>Halo Infinite</em> has an interesting playlist right now: Sentry Defense. And by interesting, I mean pretty friggin’ awesome. It’s a semi PvPvE mode where two large opposing teams each get a pair of “Sentries” to defend. The sentries are a boss from <em>Infinite</em>’s campaign: Adjutant Resolution, an enemy that’s fully capable of doing damage on its own, and requires players to shoot specific parts of it to do damage. It still plays like a PvP game, not terribly dissimilar to something like Capture the Flag, but the added bosses on both ends really mixes things up for the old <em>Halo </em>format.</p><p>Since <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/halo-infinite-forge-ai-season-5-multiplayer-bots-1850922553&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/halo-infinite-forge-ai-season-5-multiplayer-bots-1850922553">the inclusion of campaign bots</a></span> in <em>Halo Infinite</em>’s multiplayer, I’ve mostly played quirky custom games, and the series’ classic “Firefight” wave-based “horde” mode. That’s been fun, naturally, but I’ve been really eager to see what the added functionality of bots in <em>Halo</em> could do, and I’m pleasantly surprised with Sentry Defense.</p><p>Each team getting their own bosses means there’s an added layer of combat you need to bring to your arrival at the enemy base. Or, if you’re running defense, having these bosses capable of dealing lethal damage on their own really changes things up. It’s an added layer of challenge to the already challenging PvP nature of <em>Infinite</em>. I’ve also noticed that players seem to be resorting to vehicles a lot more as a result, perhaps with the hopes of the added firepower making a significant difference when it comes to chipping away at the bosses’ health. Because of that, players need to respond to more frequent vehicle encounters, which in my experience has made defending the base a lot more fun (with way more potential for multi-kills when a crew rolls up with a Warthog). </p><p><br>Sentry Defense is pretty resistant thus far to getting too repetitive. Overall, I’m finding it to be an excellent preview of where <em>Halo</em> can grow…wherever the future is likely to take this 20+ year series. — Claire Jackson  </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ab4d48b99fcfacab8b5639763de052af" data-recommend-id="image://ab4d48b99fcfacab8b5639763de052af" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A character holds a large knife at someone off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A character holds a large knife at someone off-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->sunset visitor</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ab4d48b99fcfacab8b5639763de052af" data-recommend-id="image://ab4d48b99fcfacab8b5639763de052af" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A character holds a large knife at someone off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> Switch, Windows (Steam Deck: YMMV)<br><strong>Current goal: </strong>Like games again</p><p>I have a problem where every so often I just get into a rut where I don’t play that many games. Sure, I’ll boot up <em>Overwatch 2 </em>and do my dailies, but broadly, I stop playing most of what passes through the public consciousness. Part of it is growing up and having more responsibilities, but a lot of the time I just can’t muster the willpower to play a game. I make up for it at the end of the year when GOTY lists are coming together, and I’m trying to be better about that right now by playing <em>1000xResist</em>, an adventure game that has come highly recommended by people I respect and trust. Everyone is swearing to me its melancholy, gay as hell sci-fi drama is going to hook me, and even in the first hour, I can see how this might pull me in. Every now and then you need an incredible experience that will remind you why you like video games in the first place. I’m hoping <em>1000xResist </em>can be that for me right now. — Kenneth Shepard</p><hr><p>And that wraps our picks for the weekend. Happy gaming!</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Unlike its source material, Metal Gear Rising tosses stealth out of a skyscraper window and goes all in on its premise of lightning-fast action. Over the last few years, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-memes-and-an-immortal-soundtrack-have-revived-metal-gear-rising/1100-6504409/" data-ref-id="1100-6504409">the game has seen a resurgence in interest</a> thanks to its polished action, killer soundtrack, and exciting boss fights.</p><p>This release also includes all the extra VR missions alongside the story expansions for Blade Wolf and Jetstream Sam. You'll also get all cosmetic armor sets for Raiden, including his White, Inferno, Commando, Metal Gear Solid 4, and Cyborg Ninja skins. Additionally, there are options to rewatch all of the game's cutscenes, listen to every codec conversation, and tweak the graphics.</p><p>The game runs just fine on mobile gaming PCs like the ROG Ally, making this a fun title to install and take with you on trips. Just remember to shout "<a href="https://youtu.be/WM33Hr94SKw" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">rules of nature</a>" when you block a Metal Gear Ray attack in the game's opening level.</p>

                <p>Plain old cobblestone or regular stone are fine building blocks in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/" data-ref-id="5000-73990">Minecraft</a>, but why not add some flair to your next project? Smooth Stone is a variation of stone that unlocks some new recipes as well as looks extremely clean and unique compared to other blocks like it. Below, you can see the whole process of acquiring Smooth Stone and what it can be used for in Minecraft.</p><h2>How to get Smooth Stone in Minecraft</h2><p>Fortunately, Smooth Stone is crafted in a similar way to regular stone. In fact, you need regular stone to make Smooth Stone. For those of you who need a refresher, you make regular stone by following this process:</p><ul><li>Craft a Furnace and place a smelting agent on the bottom box (Coal)</li><li>Then place cobblestone in the top box and it will turn into regular stone</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4329257-minecraftscreenshot2024.07.05-13.01.19.82.png" data-ref-id="1300-4329257" data-ratio="0.537890625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4329257-minecraftscreenshot2024.07.05-13.01.19.82.png" data-ref-id="1300-4329257"></a><figcaption>Making stone in a Furnace</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4329257-minecraftscreenshot2024.07.05-13.01.19.82.png"></figure><p>Using regular stone, you can follow the same process. This time, however, you need to put the regular stone in the top box and the furnace and coal will turn it into Smooth Stone. Unfortunately, this can take quite a long time, especially if you need large quantities of Smooth Stone.</p><p>My best advice is to craft several Furnaces and place coal/stone in all of them. This speeds up the process tremendously and allows you to make much more of the resource. You can't make Smooth Stone in a Blast Furnace, though, so don't try and use one of those to speed up the process.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4329258-minecraftscreenshot2024.07.05-13.00.31.53.png" data-ref-id="1300-4329258" data-ratio="0.537890625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4329258-minecraftscreenshot2024.07.05-13.00.31.53.png" data-ref-id="1300-4329258"></a><figcaption>Turning stone into Smooth Stone</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4329258-minecraftscreenshot2024.07.05-13.00.31.53.png"></figure><h2>Using Smooth Stone in Minecraft</h2><p>Aside from being used as a building block, you can use Smooth Stone for a couple of specific recipes in Minecraft. This includes:</p><ul><li>Blast Furnace</li><li>Smooth Stone Slab</li></ul><p>Smooth Stone is required to make a Blast Furnace, but aside from that, you can simply use it as a building block for your next construction in Minecraft.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/escape-from-tarkov">Escape from Tarkov</a> is taking extra steps to crack down on cheaters by offering players a cash bounty - in the extraction shooter’s in-game currency, anyway - for reporting ne’er-do-wells.</p>
<!--more-->

<p><span data-type="targeting">

<p>The popular shooter has long been waging war against cheaters, naming and shaming thousands of banned players by dropping lists of usernames as proof that “justice has been served”. Even so, cheats remain - developers Battlestate Games said <a href="https://x.com/tarkov/status/1745868257054101741">they banned over 11,000</a> in a matter of weeks earlier this year - so the game’s creators are now introducing the bounty system.</p>
<p>Officially referred to in the game’s <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/news/id/303">latest patch notes</a> as “compensation for reporting players who violated game rules”, the bounty system is fairly straightforward in practice. Players who successfully report a cheater - in other words, you can’t just cash in by reporting everyone you see - will receive an amount of in-game money once the cheater is confirmed and banned.</p>
<p>It’s not specified how much money players will receive for their efforts, though dedicated bounty hunters will receive a combined amount for successfully reporting multiple cheaters.</p>
<p>The system is live now alongside latest patch 0.14.9.5, which also adds item wishlists, some tweaks to PMC and Scav AI, and the ability to play its PvE Zone mode offline. You might recall said PvE mode as being at the centre of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-escape-from-tarkov-pve-mode-exclusive-to-pricey-unheard-edition-despite-promises-of-free-dlc">a player backlash to a new $250 edition of Escape from Tarkov revealed in April</a>, to which it was exclusive despite a past top-tier version of the game promising that all future DLC would be included for free. After <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/escape-from-tarkov-studio-head-doubles-down-on-belief-new-mode-is-not-dlc-but-says-players-can-have-it-when-the-game-is-done">some initial resistance</a>, the studio later relented and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/escape-from-tarkov-studio-boss-says-he-did-not-foresee-players-would-get-mad-about-charging-extra-for-pve">allowed owners of the older Edge of Darkness bundle into the PvE mode</a>.</p>

They grant an overshield when a Titan sprints at full health while they have Seismic Strike, Hammer Strike, or Shield Bash equipped, and charged hits refund a portion of melee energy. The stats on this roll are all over the place, as strength is quite low, mobility is unnecessarily high, and the resilience stat leaves a lot to be desired. You probably have a better version of these boots already--or you have the funds to get a fresh roll from Rahool--so feel free to give it a skip this week.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Mobility: 21</li><li dir="ltr">Resilience: 7</li><li dir="ltr">Recovery: 6</li><li dir="ltr">Discipline: 10</li><li dir="ltr">Intellect: 16</li><li dir="ltr">Strength: 6</li><li dir="ltr">Total: 66</li></ul><h3>Liar's Handshake (Exotic Hunter gauntlets)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4329245-destiny22024-07-0519-03-19.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4329245" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4329245-destiny22024-07-0519-03-19.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4329245"></a><figcaption>Liar's Handshake</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4329245-destiny22024-07-0519-03-19.jpg"></figure><p>Liar's handshake is great for Hunters who like to move in, deliver a knockout blow, and get out of danger.

For his rotating selection of Exotic weapon catalysts, he'll sell two each week. His selection will contain older catalysts that are found through random drops prior to The Witch Queen expansion, and he will not have catalysts associated with quests, Exotic missions, Season Pass Exotics, campaign Exotics, preorder Exotics, raid Exotics, or dungeon Exotics.</p><p>Xur will also have three random Exotic weapons available for sale, in addition to Hawkmoon. Xur will still sell Legendary armor and weapons, as well as engrams that can yield any item in those pools at random. Like other vendors, Xur also has his own reputation track now and the more you spend, the more reputation rewards you'll earn, including an Exotic Cipher after every rank reset.</p><p>Additionally, Xur's loyalty program kicks in after you spend 47 Strange Coins, granting you a Strange Favor buff. This lasts for 11 days and can be stacked up to three times--once per week--giving you a chance to earn a bonus Strange Coin from activities that reward you with the currency. Xur is present every weekend in Destiny 2, starting with the daily reset at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET each Friday.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ain%E2%80%99t-no-party-like-a-lan-party-because-lan-parties-don%E2%80%99t-happen-anymore.919905/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-lan-party<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Back in my day, we lugged our PC towers through 15 miles of bitter cold to play the original <em>StarCraft </em>in somebody’s mom’s living room, and we liked it. But not anymore. Now we’re lucky if two people on the same subway train have Steam Decks, and <em>no one</em> speaks of it. What happened to LAN parties? Why did they die, and what did we lose when the modern cyber-dystopia rendered them obsolete? On a special bonus episode of Aftermath Hours, we discuss that.</p><p>Due to the Fourth of July holiday, we weren’t able to get everybody together to stream on Twitch and record this week, so instead, this week’s episode takes the form of a live discussion we had a couple months ago with Merritt K, author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LAN-Party-Inside-Multiplayer-Revolution/dp/0500026955/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_w=Qo37m&amp;content-id=amzn1.sym.35cab78c-35e3-4fc1-aab0-27eaa6c86063%3Aamzn1.symc.e5c80209-769f-4ade-a325-2eaec14b8e0e&amp;pf_rd_p=35cab78c-35e3-4fc1-aab0-27eaa6c86063&amp;pf_rd_r=7MCWN9YAVVE81KH33VDS&amp;pd_rd_wg=5XaOX&amp;pd_rd_r=7c7cf918-4ce7-4bc2-86fa-4f46dd2b146a&amp;ref_=pd_gw_ci_mcx_mr_hp_atf_m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>LAN Party: Inside the Multiplayer Revolution</em></a>. (You can read an excerpt from the book <a href="https://aftermath.site/lan-party-merritt-k-book-read-only-memory-rom" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.)&nbsp;</p><p>We spent our time on stage at Wonderville in Brooklyn discussing the golden age of LAN parties and why they (sadly) went away. Also Bawls soda, because you can’t have a discussion of LAN parties and the early 2000s without Bawls. Here is the never-before-released recording of… all of that.&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can bring back LAN parties for all and ensure that they are <em>mandatory</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>A portion of our conversation:</p><p><strong>Merritt: </strong>Is there anything to this idea that we’ve lost something by people not getting together to play games like this anymore? Because I know obviously people still do it, but when you look at the ways young men, especially, interact with people online and how that’s often organized around gaming, the way those people play games is [that] they’re in their rooms connecting to strangers on <em>Fortnite</em>. There’s a limit to how much of an asshole you can be if you’re in a room with a bunch of other people, because at some point, you’re just gonna get your ass kicked, whereas no one can reach through the computer yet. I mean, once that technology gets developed… just a gloved hand reaches through and goes [slapping sound]. But obviously a lot of LAN parties were mainly but not exclusively young, white guys.</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>When you think about that, the interesting counterpoint – it’s not really a counterpoint, but it’s the exception that proves the rule – is the fighting game community. That comes from an urban environment mostly, places where there are local arcades, so you don’t need to have your own personal computer to have a LAN party. The LAN party as a suburban phenomenon was something that was bridging the gap of not having access to a local arcade. That’s probably why they played different types of games. But the fighting game community, I’m thinking specifically of the one that comes from Times Square-area arcades that’s so different demographically. It’s not a problem-less community; there’s problems in it, obviously. But it’s way, way, way more diverse than the rest of the mainstream gaming community. There’s just so many more black people there.</p><figure><figcaption>Tierney Cyren</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Chris:</strong> There’s also a more common persistence of memory of what the culture was. And I think that has to do with how the fighting game community interacts with Japanese arcade culture in some ways. There’s more memory to it, and it’s healthier. LAN party shit ends up being extended to esports. Esports culture is where a lot of this American LAN party culture comes from aesthetically too.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>The Riot Games people were people who were doing LAN parties in their dorm room and then made a company.</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>Yeah, and when we talk about Y2K aesthetic… I mean, on some level it never left, because I still have to buy an ugly Razer mouse. They’ve been trying to get it to be more Reddit and Scandinavian, but in a bad way with Logitech and all that shit where it’s like “Oh, what if we put a wood panel on this?”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>I hate when they add a wood panel to it! I hate it.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I don’t want you to put a wood panel on a case. Powder coat it and make it metal. I need to rack-mount my PC case. That’s all. But no, I think there are aesthetic parts of the Y2K stuff now that is part of the basic language of PC gaming culture, but it’s tournaments-only and shit like that in a lot of ways. In the fighting game community, you can do remote stuff, but your locals are real. There’s oral knowledge there.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Yeah, [fighting game community] people have to interact with a physical space in a way that carries history with that space. There’s pictures of people in the same space from 20 years ago, whereas a lot of these [LAN party] spaces are someone’s parents’ house. Which is also fascinating. I love the curtain treatment in this picture [from Merritt’s book on the projector behind us].&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Merritt: </strong>I love photos like this because, whenever we look back, there’s this retrospective imagining of what the time was like. When we think Y2K, we think bubble furniture, we think silver. But people’s houses still just looked like the ‘90s. They had these gauzy curtains and grandma’s china cabinet.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I don’t know if anyone saw <em>Love Lies Bleeding</em>. Great movie, but they actually got the ‘80s right, in that most of it looks beige. And then occasionally there’s ambient synth, and it’s like, you understand what that actually looked like. And it’s similar here. You’re in a weird basement with flash photography. Because the way the photos are taken is also very specifically rendered to late film or early digital. It renders flesh in an unflattering way. It’s untouched by AI. It’s straight flash. It’s somebody who has not moisturized or cleansed their face. It’s just the reddest guy you know. And there’s always curtains and shit, or a guy hanging from the ceiling.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Tierney Cyren</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Oh yeah, there’s the <a href="https://kotaku.com/15-years-later-heres-why-a-gamer-was-duct-taped-to-a-c-1796679499" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">famous photo of a guy who’s taped to the ceiling</a> at a LAN party!</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> You just don’t get hijinks like that anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I mean, you can’t.</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>You physically cannot. The best I see is, I’ve been into <em>Helldivers </em>a bit, and the thing I keep thinking of is, somebody posted to the subreddit recently a chat message they got from a stranger which was “Hang on, I need to take another big hit of this democracy bong.”</p><p><strong>Everybody: </strong>[Laughs]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>They might have one of those at QuakeCon, to be honest. But I do think there’s kind of a case to be made for the modern state of things, but in a way that’s a little more bittersweet. I’ve seen a lot of stories online of people who met somebody online, played games with them for years, and then eventually that game kind of fell off, and they’re like “With the game falling off, this relationship I had with somebody where we talked every night for two years – they were one of my closest friends – just kinda went away. I never really heard from them again.”&nbsp;</p><p>That’s really interesting, because on one hand you have these instances of very strong male friendship, which is often hard to come by in adulthood, but on the other hand, it can just go away like that – with all this stuff unspoken. They probably never said to each other “You are my best friend. I care so much about you.” Because if they had said that, they probably would’ve kept in touch. But it was just always implied, and then it went away.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/factorio">Factorio</a>’s whopping Space Age expansion has been in the works for <a href="https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-74">a good few years now</a>, and we finally know when we’ll get our hands on it. Space Age will arrive this October alongside a major 2.0 update for the moreish factory-automating hit, with the expansion costing as much as the base game. It sounds like there’ll be plenty to show for that price, mind.</p>

<p>Space Age <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/factorios-huge-space-age-expansion-will-let-you-build-conveyor-belts-among-the-stars">got a proper reveal last summer</a>, with developers Wube revealing its addition of five new planets - complete with new resources and technology to contend with - and the new ability to build space platforms after the end of the original game’s levels. Those space platforms will need defending from asteroids, either by shooting them down or catching them to refine into useful resources, with the operational platforms working to send cargo between planets.</p>
<p>The new planets will include the volcanic Vulcanus, where Tungsten allows for new metallurgic tech and lava can be used to smelt iron and copper. Fulgora, meanwhile, is a desolate planet racked by lightning storms that can be harnessed for electrical power, especially when used together with the new material of Holmium, while the remains of a lost civilisation can be dug up and turned into new items. There’s also a swampy planet, Gleba, full of fruit and biochemicals, while the devs tease a fifth planet that “promises some of the most unique gameplay” among its dark and cold landscape far from the sun.</p>
<p><a href="https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-418">Other additions</a> in the expansion include elevated train tracks to cross over terrain or simply lift rails above each other for more transportation, new enemies and ways to defend against them, and quality tiers for items, entities and equipment that grant various bonuses as you advance them across five levels from Normal quality up to Legendary - whether that’s better range, faster crafting or something else.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/factorio-space-age-conveyor-belts.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Wube</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In other words, it sounds like there’ll be a lot, with Wube previously <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/factorio-expansion-goal-is-to-feel-as-big-an-addition-as-the-whole-vanilla-game">comparing the size of Space Age to the original game</a>, without taking more than 80 hours for veteran players to finish. With that in mind, the expansion’s $35 price tag - in line with the base game - seems fair enough to me.</p>
<p>Even if that price is a bit much for you when Space Age arrives, you’ll be able to download Factorio’s 2.0 update for free when it arrives alongside the expansion. The overhaul will add various new features, from a new fluid system and remote view to improvements to train controls, combinators and worker robot AI.</p>
<p>Both Space Age and update 2.0 will <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/645390/Factorio_Space_Age/">drop on October 21st</a>, not far off the release estimate Wube gave last year. The devs say the time between now and then will be spent polishing for the launch, with enough time before Christmas to follow up with any necessary bug fixes.</p>

			<p>Today, CAPCOM <a href="https://x.com/exoprimal/status/1809175429737062400" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that Exoprimal support - at least in terms of new content - is over, around one year after the game's launch. Starting next week, previously released seasonal content will be continuously cycled following a predetermined pattern. Moreover, the previous season passes will return on sale, allowing players to obtain items from all seasons.</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Season 1</strong></td>
<td><strong>Season 2</strong></td>
<td><strong>Season 3</strong></td>
<td><strong>Season 4</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span>November</span></td>
<td><span>December</span></td>
<td>January</td>
<td>February</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>March</td>
<td>April</td>
<td>May</td>
<td>June</td>

<tr>
<td><span>July</span></td>
<td>August</td>
<td>September</td>
<td>October</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>November</td>
<td>December</td>
<td><span>January</span></td>
<td><span>February</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>When Exoprimal re-enters a season, the progression from the previous instance of that season is carried over. Moreover, each Survival Pass: Premium tier is only valid for the corresponding seasons listed above. For example, if a Survival Pass Season 2: Premium Tier is purchased in July, it can only be used in April, August, or December.</p>
<p>Exoprimal will also feature weekly campaigns and routine missions. The latter will only be available once every four weeks, according to the cycle shown in the image below.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>CAPCOM clarifies that all content remains available to play, though they do mention that should there be a lack of players, users can take advantage of AI-powered bots to reach the game's ending.</p>
<p>Exoprimal launched in July 2023 to a lukewarm reception. Whereas most recent CAPCOM games got high scores and strong sales, Exoprimal failed on both accounts. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/exoprimal-not-dino-crisis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In Wccftech's 7/10 review</a>, Francesco De Meo wrote:</p>
<p><em>As I played Exoprimal more during the various betas, I couldn't help but feel that the game needed something more to rise above the competition, and the game's final version hasn't changed my opinion. In short bursts, the multiplayer game by CAPCOM can be fun, but the novelty of killing off hordes of dinosaurs wears off quickly, leaving only a passable experience that most people won't come back to after experiencing the surprisingly interesting story.</em></p>
<p>One thing is for sure - CAPCOM would have been better off resurrecting Dino Crisis, which still has more than a few fans patiently waiting.</p>

The small studio behind the game, Cat Daddy, started working on the project in 2004. The team put  together some playable demos and showed the game off at E3 2006. </p><p>But as time went on, it became clear to the devs that the people working on the film were in way over their heads and were unlikely to finish <em>Foodfight! </em>on schedule.

So while we can’t play the unfinished demos, we can at least dig around the tie-in game’s models, music, and other digital bits like video game archeologists. And I guess, <em>Foodfight! </em>(the movie) was released eventually. Okay, maybe it’s not a complete happy ending. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The whole gacha gaming style varies significantly, with Genshin Impact offering an open world for players to explore but others providing instanced gameplay. You’d be forgiven for not grasping Zenless Zone Zero and how its world works. I didn’t at first, either. So, is Zenless Zone Zero open world? Let’s find out!</p>



<h2 id="h-does-zenless-zone-zero-have-an-open-world">Does Zenless Zone Zero Have An Open World?</h2>



<p>After you progress through the relatively short introduction, in which the game teaches you numerous mechanics and systems, you’ll wind up choosing a central character to play as for the overarching story. Here, in the real world outside of Hollows, you can explore a hub zone. It’s a small neighborhood outside the shop, with a newsstand, noodle shop, electronics store, and plenty of NPCs to interact with or ignore.</p>



<p>But as to whether Zenless Zone Zero is an open world or not, no, it’s not. It’s a small hub area, a single street with a few shops and nothing more. </p>







<h2 id="h-are-zenless-zone-zero-battles-open-world">Are Zenless Zone Zero Battles Open World?</h2>



<p>When you’re not busy interacting with characters, scratching lottery tickets, or ordering noodles at the local food stall, you’ll spend time battling monsters within a Hollow in ZZZ. These battles are in an instanced environment, encompassing a few small areas with a handful of enemies before you move on to the next area. Ultimately, you wind up fighting a boss or interacting with a story element, such as tracking down a lost courier.</p>



<p>There is no open-world environment to explore in the game.</p>

While you can also ride a mount, which requires the use of a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-get-a-saddle-in-minecraft/1100-6524656/" data-ref-id="1100-6524656">saddle</a>, these methods are often too slow for eager players who want to get across the map in an instant. Fortunately, there is a way to teleport in Minecraft, but it requires some setup to accomplish.</p><h2>Teleporting in Minecraft</h2><p>First and foremost, teleporting is considered an unofficial act of cheating in Survival or Hardcore worlds. While teleporting won't get you officially banned by Mojang, the mode of transportation does require the use of console commands. If you're in a world by yourself or with some friends, this likely doesn't carry any weight. However, you won't be able to teleport if the admin of a world doesn't allow the use of console commands.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4328769-minecraftscreenshot2024.07.03-15.50.15.72.png" data-ref-id="1300-4328769" data-ratio="0.537890625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4328769-minecraftscreenshot2024.07.03-15.50.15.72.png" data-ref-id="1300-4328769"></a><figcaption>The teleport command offers some presets to help you out</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4328769-minecraftscreenshot2024.07.03-15.50.15.72.png"></figure><p>With that out of the way, you need to enable the use of cheats on whatever world you're trying to play on. This is done by going to the world settings in the main menu and selecting "Allow Cheats: ON." You can do this when setting up a new world, but if you're trying to set up commands on an existing world, you have to follow a different process. In an existing world, press "Esc" or "Options" and then select "Open to LAN." From here, you can enable commands and start a local world.</p><p>Once cheats have been enabled, you can begin teleporting and taking advantage of any other console command in Minecraft. To bring up console commands, press "/" on PC or right D-Pad on controller. From here, type "/tp," which is the basic teleport command. However, you need a physical location to teleport to, which requires coordinates or a specific destination. Just by typing "/tp," the game brings up a list of commands, allowing you to teleport to the nearest player, entity, or recent coordinates.</p><p>If you're on PC, you can hit F3 to show your current coordinates. On console, you can go to Settings and press "Show Coordinates." As long as you have accurate coordinates, you can teleport to anywhere on the Minecraft map. The exact command for teleporting to coordinates is:</p><ul><li>/tp X X X (replace each X with the corresponding coordinate number)</li></ul><p>Another teleport command is "/tp Username," which allows you to teleport to another player's location. All you have to do is replace "Username" with the other player's name and you'll teleport right to them. Here are some other teleport commands to be aware of:</p><ul><li>/tp &lt;location&gt;</li><li>/tp &lt;target&gt; &lt;destination&gt;</li><li>/tp @p (closest player)</li><li>/tp @a (all players)</li></ul>

Nintendo's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> won't be hit by the same component shortages that blighted the launch of other recent consoles and led to months of product scarcity and scalping. 
</p>
<p>
Speaking to investors this week, Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/qa2406e.pdf">said</a> it had now "resolved" the issue which had seen it unable to manufacture enough Switch 1 hardware to meet demand in previous years. Both Sony, with PlayStation, and Microsoft, with Xbox, faced similar shortages for their own parts. 
</p>
<p>
"That situation has now been resolved," Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa said of Switch 1 stock. "As for the
successor to Nintendo Switch, at present we do not think shortages of components will significantly affect production."

<p>
Indeed, Nintendo said it felt positive about its ability to launch and supply Switch 2 consoles overall, as it was taking steps to ensure its expected release next year went as smoothly as possible.
</p>
<p>
"We believe that the most important countermeasure against reselling is to produce enough units to meet demand," Furukawa continued. "This thinking has not changed since last year. In addition, we are taking into account circumstances in each region and considering what measures can be taken within
the limits permitted by law."
</p>
<p>
Nintendo is yet to formally announce Switch 2 or detail when it will likely arrive, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-now-q1-2025-report">Eurogamer understands the console is now due in 2025</a>, following earlier plans to launch it in time for Christmas 2024.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, don't expect Switch 1 to get any cheaper, either.
</p>
<p>
"Currently, we cannot provide any information about the launch timing or pricing strategy for the successor system," Furukawa concluded. "In addition, we are not currently considering a price change for Nintendo Switch." 
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-makes-first-switch-2-announcement">Nintendo has said it will make the announcement of Switch 2</a> before the end of "this fiscal year" - so before 31st March 2025.

            <p>It looks like we won’t get a remake of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-space-2">Dead Space 2</a> in the style of last year’s excellent do-over of the original limb-shooting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror game</a>, but it turns out that Dead Space isn’t completely, uh, dead just yet. Though to what degree you could consider it alive and well - reanimated in a twisted form of its previous glory, perhaps - is another question entirely.</p>

<p>EA’s space-horror series is finding its way into the next season of Battlefield 2042, inspiring a new horde-extraction mode called Outbreak that will run from July 9th to 16th as part of the shooter’s seventh - and final - season Turning Point. (The game is also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1517290/Battlefield_2042/">90% off over on Steam</a> at the moment ahead of its swan song season.)</p>
<p>The time-limited event doesn’t quite star the The Thing-like necromorphs found aboard Dead Space’s Ishimura space station, opting instead for decidedly more human-like zombies-slash-infected-slash-whatever (presumably to make it easier to shoot them in the head, instead of wondering where their head even is) that will try and overwhelm the players’ squad as they attempt to defeat waves of enemies, buy new gear as they advance and extract from each level without losing their single life.</p>

<p>Don’t expect to find the limb-slicing plasma cutter in your armoury, either, although the teaser trailer for the crossover does show a character decked out in Isaac’s glowing engineer suit and helmet. That’ll join the usual selection of weapon skins, charms, player cards and other cosmetics able to be unlocked through the event itself and bought from the in-game store.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-space-remake">Dead Space remake</a> developers Motive <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dead-space-remake-devs-ea-motive-are-building-a-team-to-work-on-future-battlefield-projects">now split between working on Battlefield and developing their Iron Man game</a>, it seems like - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dead-space-2-remake-reportedly-shelved-due-to-poor-sales-of-the-first-game">for whatever reason</a> - we won’t be getting a remake of Dead Space 2 anytime soon. Whether a one-week crossover event with Battlefield is really the brightest sign for the series’ future, I’m not convinced - but I suppose it’s at least acknowledgement that someone, somewhere in EA is thinking about Dead Space, if nothing else.</p>
