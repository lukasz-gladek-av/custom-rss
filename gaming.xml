		<p>Imagine the world 10,000 years from now. Depending on your own perspective it could range from a place filled with futuristic cities with space travel being the norm, while for others you may imagine that humanity has been wiped out. Well, Kentum is for those of you who thought the latter as this is a world where you play as Kent, the last human alive.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kentum - Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IUalylbx8PQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In Kentum, Kent wakes up from a 7000 year nap to discover that he is in the year 10,000 and that he is alone aside from his robot companion. Kent is not one to sit around and mope though, as he goes out to gather resources and build a base to live in. The world is a dangerous place filled with creatures and dangers within the environment. Scanning and collecting resources including from animals, plants, and minerals is key to survival to create items that helps Kent survive. Or not. Luckily, Kent gets cloned every time he dies so death is a bit of a nuisance and nothing more. The full features include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Survive… or Not! You’ll Be Cloned Anyways:&nbsp;</strong>Even though Kent will be revived endlessly, that doesn’t change the fact that dying is a major drag. You’ll need to gather and hunt for food, find new recipes, and polish your cooking skills. Building your own farms and vivariums is your ticket to a steady source of nourishment.</li>
<li><strong>Explore, Scan, and Catalogue:&nbsp;</strong>Discover the wonders and the oddities of a vast, ever-changing world filled to the brim with fascinating flora, fauna, and climate events. Classify every animal, plant, and mineral in order to help you survive the passing seasons.</li>
<li><strong>Craft it to the Limit:&nbsp;</strong>Use every material at your disposal to build your base. Start small by turning bone and wood into coal, machine scraps into sheets of metal, and slowly but surely grow your base into a full-blown resource-generating machine that can rival any factory in the world.</li>
<li><strong>Build the Home Base of Your Dreams:&nbsp;</strong>Expand your home base and create an automated system to allow you to streamline and optimize your productions while you are off exploring.</li>
<li><strong>Traverse Exotic Locales in Style:&nbsp;</strong>From vibrant jungles to desolate ruins, traverse post-apocalyptic Earth with your hoverboard, hang glider, grappling hook and more. It is up to you to maneuver with equal parts adventure and efficiency.</li>
</ul>
<p>Kentum launches on November 6th for PC, Xbox Series XS, PS5 and Switch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Mario Galaxy Movie" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0ac7586943680/mario-galaxy-movie.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The first <strong>Super Mario Bros. Movie</strong> from Illumination was… well, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/04/movie-review-the-super-mario-bros-movie-a-fun-ride-that-substitutes-story-for-spectacle"><em>okay</em> at best</a>.</p>
<p>It got a fair bit right, like the excellent visual presentation and delightful Easter Eggs throughout its 92-minute runtime. But a weak script, baffling casting decisions, and reliance on licensed music over iconic tracks from Koji Kondo resulted in a middling experience that I wasn’t too keen to watch again.</p>
<p>Alas, I did watch it again – many, <em>many</em> times. And the reason why is simple: I have a three-year-old daughter. Need I say more?</p>
<p>Well, I will. Y’see, my family and I were fortunate enough to go on a cruise toward the end of last year, stopping off at Hamburg, Bruges, Rotterdam, and Le Havre. Our cabin’s TV included a range of on-demand movies, one of which was — you guessed it — <del>Terrifier 3</del> the Mario Movie.</p>
<p>So whenever we had a bit of downtime, which normally came toward the end of the day when we were getting ready to hit the hay, we’d stick the Mario Movie on for my daughter after much begging on her part. And I have to admit, watching her eyes light up whenever Princess Peach came on the screen, or when she giggled in delight when Bowser trapped Kamek’s fingers in a piano, my opinion of the film began to shift.</p>
<figure><a title="Mario &amp; Luigi" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a15ab7e93eefe/mario-and-luigi.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Universal Pictures</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I still don't think it's a great film or anything, but my daughter's enthusiasm became infectious. It is, after all, a movie primarily aimed toward kids, and so I started to view it through that exact lens. All of its faults — everything that I, as a self-proclaimed movie connoisseur, saw as blights upon a game series I'd adored since the mid-'90s — faded into the background.</p>
<p>Soon enough, we bought our daughter plushies of Mario, Luigi, and Peach, and we'd begin to act out scenes from the film together (with my wife begrudgingly playing the role of Bowser – heh!). This not only strengthened her love for the film, but also the bond that she and I had begun to foster.</p>
<p>Truth be told, the first couple of years of fatherhood were quite difficult for me; family and friends warn you that young children like to pick favourites and play parents off against one another, but I'm quite sure my daughter took this concept to its absolute limits, and it honestly pushed me to breaking point. So when she fell in love with the Mario Movie, it opened up a crucial opportunity for me to finally break down that barrier, and for nearly a year, we've enjoyed a wonderful relationship together that's only gotten better with time.</p>
<figure><a title="Mario Toys" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2e548a373d4e2/mario-toys.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Needless to say, when I showed her the first trailer for <strong>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong> (which officially releases on 3rd April 2026, by the way), she was thrilled beyond words. And so was I, for that matter. I love the Galaxy games so much, and I genuinely can't think of a more appropriate direction for the upcoming sequel.</p>
<p>What's even better is that, thanks to the aforementioned cruise ship also containing a small cinema, my daughter has proven that she's capable of sitting through a movie and staying reasonably engaged from beginning to end. So you can bet we'll be right there at our local Vue on day one for the sequel. This has the potential to be a memory that will last until my dying days, and that is far more precious to me than any criticism I might have against Nintendo and Illumination's work on the adaptations so far.</p>
<p>I'll never try to convince those who don't want children that they're making the wrong choice; parenting is <em>really</em> hard, man. But it's also full of magical moments that I wouldn't change for the world – or the galaxy, for that matter. The Super Mario Bros. Movie might not be anywhere close to being a masterpiece, but my goodness, am I glad it exists.</p>
<p>Bring on the sequel.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/is-od-connected-to-pt-hideo-kojimas-new-horror-game-explained</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-od-connected-to-p-t-hideo-kojima%E2%80%99s-new-horror-game-explained.1307394/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Kojima Productions’ recent Beyond the Strand livestream <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hideo-kojima-reveals-first-trailer-for-xbox-game-studios-title-od">gave us our first proper look at OD</a>, the developer’s horror game that’s being produced in collaboration with Xbox Game Studios. While the project’s first trailer features barely more than a couple of minutes of gameplay and is set entirely in a single room, it’s already creating quite a buzz. That’s because it’s distinctly reminiscent of P.T., Hideo Kojima’s famous 2014 “playable teaser” for a Silent Hill game that never was. P.T. went on to influence an entire wave of dread-fuelled horror games, but it seems like Kojima is finally returning to those ideas himself for OD. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While there’s no suggestion that OD and P.T. are directly related, it’s already clear that this new Xbox exclusive horror is reusing and reinterpreting many of the themes, motifs, and designs that were established in the Silent Hills teaser. From ominous knocking to terrifying babies, let’s explore the significant connecting threads between these two projects.   </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Suburban Terror</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps the most clear link between OD and P.T. is their perspectives and settings. P.T. is played from the first-person perspective and takes place in what (at least initially) seems to be a mundane and unremarkable suburban home. OD appears to be following that approach, at least with the sequence we see in the trailer. The area in which the terror unfolds could be a room in anyone’s house – the dull walls, herringbone flooring, and miserable weather outside suggest another boring day in suburbia. But, like P.T., there are unnerving elements that pierce through the mundanity. For one, why is the room only furnished with two armchairs, both of which are oddly positioned? Secondly, and most importantly, why is there a shrine of burning candles?</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Cryptic Puzzles</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/24/od-knock-teaser-trailer-esrb-4k-0-36-screenshot-1758730286834.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">P.T. earned widespread acclaim because it approached horror in a way largely unseen in video games prior. While its first-person perspective and complete lack of combat may well have been influenced by 2010’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/amnesia-the-dark-descent">Amnesia: The Dark Descent</a>, P.T. went several steps further and avoided any sense of traditional video game enemies. Instead, your foe was the environment itself: an endlessly looping corridor that holds you hostage until you can solve its many mysteries. With no tools provided aside from a simple flashlight, these puzzles were cracked through the use of simple observation. Find the right clues, and the house would morph on your next loop, slowly revealing the disturbing components that pieced together to tell the story of a murdered family. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While there’s no suggestion that OD will feature any kind of looping hallway, it does appear to take a similar approach when it comes to puzzles. The trailer opens with the protagonist, played by Sophia Lillis of It and Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves, being told to “Light the fires to celebrate their [redacted]”. She then proceeds to light a number of candles using a box of matches, with each new flame causing changes in the environment. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Hush, Little Baby</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/24/od-knock-teaser-trailer-esrb-4k-1-39-screenshot-1758730302010.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps the most obvious and immediately scary element of this puzzle is its use of crying infants. As Lillis lights a baby-shaped candle, the shrieks of a crying newborn immediately fill the room, causing her to flinch and drop the match. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kojima, of course, has a famous connection to babies via <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a>, in which “Bridge Babies” are used to detect spirits. However, P.T. also prominently featured crying babies, as well as the more horrifying image of a mutated, bloody fetus lying in a bathroom washbasin. The trailer does nothing to explain how babies are related to OD’s story, but it’s clear that Kojima is once again turning to the chilling sound of a distressed infant to give you goosebumps.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Who’s There?</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/23/od-blogroll-1758604340335.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">While the baby’s cries are certainly disturbing, the more ominous noise is the constant knocking that becomes increasingly louder and more frantic as the trailer progresses. This will clearly be a significant element – as revealed as part of the Beyond the Strand livestream, OD is subtitled “Knock”. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I really am afraid of big knock sounds," explained Kojima. And, once again, we can see that expressed in P.T.. Since the entire game takes place in a corridor, the environment is naturally filled with doors, and creepy knocking echoes through the hallway as you complete loop after loop.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, it’s not the knocking itself that’s frightening, but what it signifies: someone (or something) that wants to get inside. It’s a warning that your safety is about to be breached. And considering that you have no weapons in P.T., that’s a terrifying prospect. The same seems to be true of OD – Sophia Lillis’ character has no ability to defend herself from whatever is trying to get through that door. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Don't Look Back </h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/24/od-knock-teaser-trailer-esrb-4k-2-22-screenshot-1758730321595.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">If it wasn’t already obvious from the oppressive atmosphere and screaming babies, it’s generally considered a bad idea to conduct a ritual about which you know nothing. Sophia’s candle lighting seems to summon something – we never see it, but after all that knocking, we hear that it opens the door and slowly, dramatically approaches. While neither we nor Sophia can see this foe, something else does: an image of an eye stuck to the window. As the man (or monster?) closes in, we see the image change – the eye opening wide in horror at what it observes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once again, there’s a link to P.T. here. During one of the loops, all the pictures mounted on the corridor’s walls are replaced with images of eyes that move and change as you walk through the house, as if they are observing you.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">P.T. also preyed on the idea of a malevolent figure lurking behind you. The house is haunted by a spectral woman known as Lisa, who appears in a variety of frightening sequences. But beyond those scripted moments, there’s always the unsettling feeling that Lisa is close by – flickering shadows and eerie sound effects make it seem as if she’s just beyond your peripheral vision. And that’s because she quite literally is: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/09/09/pt-camera-hack-reveals-lisa-is-always-right-behind-you">her character model is tethered to you</a>, constantly following behind you as you explore the house. While we have essentially no information on how OD will play, the final moments of the trailer do suggest that the fear of someone being right behind you will be explored, just as it was in P.T..   </p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Hills are Silent</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As the unseen enemy approaches Lillis, you can hear the increasingly erratic sound of a Geiger counter. It seems to act as some kind of proximity sensor, akin to the motion detector used in Aliens. Or, perhaps more appropriately, the screeching static of Silent Hill’s radio. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">P.T., of course, was both a “playable teaser” and reveal for Silent Hills, a collaboration between Hideo Kojima and Guillermo del Toro that would have been the next, potentially revolutionary chapter in Konami’s Silent Hill series. And while there’s absolutely no chance that OD is a secret Silent Hill game – Konami is not involved at all – there do appear to be a few nods to the series throughout this trailer. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Aside from the Geiger counter replicating the function of Silent Hill’s enemy-alerting radio static, there’s also the fact that the message that begins the trailer’s ordeal is delivered on a card through a gap in the door. This is reminiscent of Silent Hill 4: The Room, in which cryptic messages are slipped under the locked door of protagonist Henry Townshend’s apartment. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The door through which OD’s mysterious message is delivered may also be hiding a small nod to Silent Hill – the design features nine red panels arranged in a three-by-three grid. This resembles the same three-by-three grid of red squares seen in Silent Hill 2, which featured on the game’s <a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/silent/images/4/44/Silent_Hill_2_Japanese_Dust_Jacket.jpeg.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20200927215818" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Japanese box art</a> and can be found in-game as the story’s final save point. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It wouldn’t be surprising to see a number of other subtle references to Silent Hill in OD, but once again, this certainly isn’t Kojima finally making Silent Hills. And so while there are clear parallels between OD and P.T., the two are not canonically connected. It seems more likely that OD will relate to P.T. in the same way that Death Stranding – particularly its sequel, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">On The Beach</a> – relates to Metal Gear Solid. DS2 features a refreshed approach to combat that echoes the stealth sandbox of MGS 5, and one of its central characters, Neil Vana, is a clear nod to Kojima’s most enduring hero, Solid Snake. While Kojima no longer has any official ties to his former workplace at Konami, it’s clear that he still enjoys making connections with his past projects, and so it’s only logical that OD – his first horror project since Silent Hills – will echo P.T. in a number of ways. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it’s not how OD replicates P.T. that’s the interesting thing – the more exciting prospect is how it will build on P.T.’s successes. And so now we look forward to learning much more about this project. After all, we know so little about it. We do know that Get Out and Nope director Jordan Peele is involved, but that he’s working on a separate OD experience, one that will replace the “Knock” subtitle with a different kind of fear. So is this an anthology of games, each one exploring unique phobias? Or will OD be a collection of different media, breaking boundaries between games and films? P.T. reimagined the shape of horror over a decade ago, of course, so we’re more than ready to see Kojima do it all over again. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Executive Editor of Features. </em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/is-od-connected-to-pt-hideo-kojimas-new-horror-game-explained]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/meet-the-first-person-to-own-over-40-000-paid-steam-games.1307385/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>With those games excluded, SonixLegend's collection actually encompasses the vast majority of the 45,000 or so "full profile" paid games <a href="https://steamdb.info/stats/releases/">tracked by SteamDB</a>. But with <a href="https://steamspy.com/year/">thousands of new games being released on Steam every year</a>, it might not be long until a badge for 50,000 owned games becomes a real possibility.</p>
<h2>So what’s good?</h2>
<p>It's hard to gauge just how much of SonixLegend's massive Steam collection officially counts as a "backlog" since their private account doesn't offer a public breakdown of playtime for most individual titles. That said, there are only 261 games for which SonixLegend has earned at least one achievement and only <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/SonixLegend/recommended/">16 that were good enough to merit a user review</a> (they all ended up as "Recommended").</p>
<p>The implications of SonixLegend trying to actually work through their Steam backlog can be more than a little intimidating, though. <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/steam?userName=SonixLegend">HowLongToBeat data</a> suggests that finishing just the "top 2,500" games in SonixLegend's Steam collection would take over 2,463 days, or nearly seven years of 24/7 gameplay.</p>
<p>Ironically, SonixLegend's favorite game isn't even one that counts toward their record-setting badge. The user's Steam profile page lists 551 hours spent playing Valve's 2010 free-to-play overhead shooter <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/630"><em>Alien Swarm</em></a>. In a way, it's nice to know that, even with access to nearly every paid modern PC game in existence, the one game this user keeps coming back to is a 15-year-old title that doesn't cost a penny.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/krafton-accuses-unknown-worlds-founders-of-stealing-subnautica-blueprint/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/krafton-accuses-unknown-worlds-founders-of-stealing-what-they-say-is-%E2%80%9Ceffectively-a-blueprint%E2%80%9D-for-subnautica.1307361/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The latest update in the Krafton versus Unknown Worlds founders saga that circles Subnautica 2 comes from two filings that Krafton has publicized. The core of these motions are allegations that Charlie Cleveland and Max McGuire, two of the three co-founders who are all currently in a legal battle with their former parent company, "<em>stole hundreds of thousands of Unknown Worlds and Krafton confidential documents</em>" prior to being fired.</p>



<p>Krafton then goes a step further to speculate that the theft was to further a plan to release Subnautica 2 on their own, without Krafton, and take the earnings from that to the bank, in so many words. Krafton also claims that what Cleveland specifically stole was "<em>hundreds of Sunaturica Maya (.ma) files, which are used in 3D animation modelling and contain proprietary embedded data, providing,</em> <em>effectively, a blueprint for a game</em>."</p>



<p>If you've not been following what's happened in what is an increasingly long timeline between the co-founders of Unknown Worlds, and the original creatives behind Subnautica and their former parent company, Krafton, then there's a bullet-point list at the bottom of this article to catch you up.</p>



<p>For now, we'll stick to what's new. One of the two filings is an affidavit from Kevin Negangard, a forensics technology expert who, per the affidavit, specializes in "<em>the preservation and investigation of electronic evidence from digital devices, the interrogation of complex data sets, and leading large-scale electronic discovery projects,</em>" and is where the key allegations of theft come from.</p>



<p>The other is a motion from Krafton to compel the court to allow for a forensic examination of Cleveland, McGuire, and Ted Gill's devices to further determine what was allegedly stolen, and asking the court to issue a protective order against Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire's side from obtaining all the documents it has asked for. Essentially, Krafton is asking to block the co-founders' requests for information from Krafton, while also asking to get more information from the co-founders to further its investigation and claims of theft.</p>



<p>While furthering its claims that the co-founders stole confidential files from Krafton and Unknown Worlds, Krafton also furthered its allegations regarding the co-founders having "<em>abandoned</em>" their roles, and puts that as at the center of why they were fired, alongside their alleged theft. "<em>The Key Employees were fired for Cause because they covertly abandoned their posts, deceived Krafton about it, and stole condifential information on their way out the door,</em>" the combined protective order and compel motion reads.</p>



<p>"<em>When Krafton discovered their ruse, Krafton asked them to do the jobs they promised they would and finish developing Subnautica 2. Krafton even offered to extend the earnout period if the Key Employees would come back to work. The Key Employees refused, threatened to self-publish Subnautica 2, and - anticipating their termination - stole hundreds of thousands of Unknown Worlds and Krafton confidential documents before they were fired, presumably in furtherance of their plan to unilaterally self-publish Subnautica 2 and capitalize on the earnout</em>."</p>



<p>Besides the filings, there's also a new statement from Krafton, which reads, "<em>Krafton's latest filings continue to highlight the former executives' misconduct. Despite offering to extend the former executives' earnout period if they returned to their positions, the former leaders refused to return to work, threatened to prematurely self-publish Subnautica 2, and stole hundreds of thousands of Unknown Worlds and Krafton confidential documents on their way out the door.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Krafton will continue to present the evidence showing how the former executives violated their obligations and misused company resources, as the legal proceedings move forward. As Krafton has continued to make clear, at the heart of every decision Krafton makes are the fans, who deserve the best possible experience. Through this process, Krafton remains focused on what matters: delivering the best possible game to Subnautica's fans</em>."</p>



<p>These filings follow a recent update from the legal battle, where two requests made by Krafton were denied by the court, and where Krafton <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-unknown-worlds-founders-lawsuit-krafton-u-turn/">seemed to make a major U-turn on one of its key arguments</a> around why the co-founders were fired.</p>



<p>Ultimately, these allegations from Krafton, and from the co-founders around Krafton's own alleged shady tactics, are just that, allegations. We likely won't know the full truth of the matter even after it's all sorted out in the courts. </p>



<p>But it's clear that both sides are not backing down in their language and in their attempts to make their narrative the one that's widely known, even when some of the allegations, like how the co-founders allege Krafton's chief executive officer said the company would be "<em>embarrassed</em>" by having to pay Unknown Worlds its $250 million bonus, or Krafton's much-repeated claim that the co-founders flat-out refused to do their jobs, feel unbelievable at face value.</p>



<p>If you need a recap on this whole saga, here's a timeline with everything save for today's news to catch you up:</p>



<ul>
<li>On July 2, it was reported that the founders of Unknown Worlds, Ted Gill, Max McGuire, and Charlie Cleveland, <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-developer-unknown-worlds-changes-leadership-krafton/">were fired</a> and replaced by former Striking Distance Studios head Steve Papoutsis. No concrete explanation for their dismissal was offered at the time, with Krafton instead emphasizing its commitment to delivering a game that players deserved.</li>



<li>On July 3, a <a href="https://unknownworlds.com/en/news/subnautica-community-letter">statement from the Unknown Worlds website</a> did its best to calm concerns from fans about the fact that the three original core creatives behind Subnautica were suddenly not at the studio.</li>



<li>The next day, on July 4, the situation began to grow even more confusing, as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lryw9o/what_is_a_wave_but_a_thousand_drops/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Cleveland claims</a> Subnautica 2 was "<em>ready for early access release</em>" and that his and his fellow co-founders' dismissals were "<em>quite a shock</em>."</li>



<li>Five days later, on July 9, a <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-delayed-subnautica-2-2026-reportedly-to-avoid-250-million-bonus-pay/">report from Bloomberg</a> adds a shocking allegation to the mix: that Krafton was delaying Subnautica 2 to avoid paying Unknown Worlds a $250 million bonus the studio would have been owed if they hit particular sales goals, which they would have done with Subnautica 2's launch. The delay was <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-delay-confirmed-krafton-claims-delay-decision-was-not-influenced-by-any-contractual-or-financial-considerations/">confirmed</a> hours after the report went live, and Krafton held that the delay was due to Subnautica 2 not being ready, citing feedback from internal playtesting.</li>



<li>On July 10, Krafton <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-blames-founders-subnautica-2-delay/">went on the offensive</a>, blaming co-founders Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire, claiming they had "<em>abandoned</em>" their roles to pursue personal interests. Krafton also clarified that 90% of the aforementioned $250 million bonus would go directly to the co-founders, with the rest to be split among the employees. Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire held that they always intended to distribute the bonus to other employees.</li>



<li>Also on July 10, Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/889109175/Fortis-Advisors-v-Krafton-via-Aftermath">filed a lawsuit</a> against Krafton.</li>



<li>On July 11, an<a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-leaked-document-shows-krafton-delay/"> internal document from a milestone review of Subnautica 2's progress leaked</a> on Reddit, seemingly showing further support to Krafton's claims that the game wasn't ready, citing a lack of content on top of previously mentioned internal playtest feedback.</li>



<li>Over the following weekend on July 13, Krafton <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-confirms-subnautica-2-leaked-documents-are-real/">confirmed the documents to be real</a>.</li>



<li>A few days later, on July 17, when the co-founders' suit against Krafton became publicly available, we discovered allegations that Krafton had <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-allegedly-sabotaged-subnautica-2-to-delay-avoid-paying-250-million-bonus/">been sabotaging</a> Subnautica 2 to ensure it would be delayed. There was even a claim that the CEO of Krafton met with the co-founders and admitted that having to pay out the $250 million bonus "<em>could be disastrous financially and hugely embarrassing for Krafton</em>." It also attacks every other claim Krafton had made up to this point, and that the feedback received on Subnautica 2 playtesting "<em>unequivocally proved</em>" the game was ready for an early access launch.</li>



<li>Jumping ahead to August 12, Krafton<a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-fires-back-unknown-worlds-founders-lawsuit-subnautica-2/"> shoots back</a> at Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire's lawsuit, again arguing that the co-founders were absentee leaders who abandoned their roles, and continued to hold that the game wasn't ready for an early access launch.</li>



<li>Eight days later, Unknown Worlds <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-legal-battle-unknown-worlds-files-lawsuit-against-co-founders-krafton/">files its own separate lawsuit</a> against its co-founders, telling Wccftech in an email that this suit "<em>is a direct response to their misconduct, including the theft of confidential information and attempts to pursue personal financial gain to the detriment of the company's interest</em>s<em>."</em></li>



<li>On September 19, a report revealed that the court denied two of Krafton's motions, and Krafton <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-unknown-worlds-founders-lawsuit-krafton-u-turn/">seemingly U-turned on one of its key arguments</a> regarding why the co-founders were fired in the first place.</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We're now only a week away from the first episode of Critical Role Campaign 4, where <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="55a80c6c-ea7c-4151-9523-d332db6f6cd5" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/how-brennan-lee-mulligan-created-never-stop-blowing-up-love-letter-to-80s" rel="nofollow">Brennan Lee Mulligan</a> will lead a table of 13 different players into the world of Araman, where mortals turned on the Gods and won. Ahead of the release, I had the chance to sit down with half of the cast to discuss character creation, what it has been like seeing the public's reaction to their characters, how Critical Role has evolved, and what fans can expect.</p>

<p>For this interview, I sat down with <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a9a9913f-42e9-4189-bbde-08061c01a7e8" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/matthew-mercer-interview" rel="nofollow">Matthew Mercer,</a> Marisha Ray, Laura Bailey, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fed64e82-f78a-4671-979b-0de0f235fb5e" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/sam-riegel-talks-wildmount-wildlings-beau-and-yashas-adoption-plans-and-campers" rel="nofollow">Sam Riegel,</a> Robbie Daymond, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a77a65bf-2dda-4081-be3d-d54808255109" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/aabria-iyengar-discusses-burrows-end-finale-dice-telling-story-and-what-happens" rel="nofollow">Aabria Iyengar,</a> and Alexander Ward. This cast includes co-founders who have been a core part of Critical Role since it was a home game and those who have been embraced by the Critical Role family, whether it be as DMs and players for additional stories in the world of Exandria, or those taking part in other Critical Role productions like <em>Narrative Telephone</em> or <em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="87e91e8c-1acc-45e4-bc46-a5f9ce0adeac" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/candela-obscura-core-rulebook-review-comprehensive-guide-to-newfaire-and-horror" rel="nofollow">Candela Obscura.</a></em></p>

<p>To set my own understanding of just how much of Campaign 4's track has been laid down, the first question I asked was to know just how much of the Araman campaign had been played so far.</p>


<p>There was an immediate pause around the room, eyes darted around, no one wanting to say too much. Marisha Ray, who will play Murray the Dwarf, was the first to break the silence, "A nice skosh," not wanting to give much away. Riegel confidently added, "More than an episode, less than 10."</p>

<p>This likely puts their filming past the four-episode "Overture" that GM Brennan Lee Mulligan previously revealed would introduce us to the cast and set each character on their journey.</p>

<h2>Building A Character For West Marches</h2>

<p>For Campaign 4, a West Marches approach is being adopted, where the story will shift between a few active casts whose tales intersect around a core narrative. Knowing that each character was crafted to be part of a tighter group, but ultimately a smaller cog in the machine, I was interested to hear what the difference in approach was and if plans had been made among the cast to ensure certain players were seated at tables with each other.</p>

<p>Daymond threw up his first, joking and complaining that "they don't let us pick our own seats… isn't that mean? It's like the first day of third grade!"</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/crokas-critical-role-artwork.jpg?itok=DiLsnOp5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/crokas-critical-role-artwork.jpg?itok=K0LEEGpY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Alexander Ward, who gave an incredible performance as Crokas in EXU: Divergence, added, "You won't be able to tell, but I'm always seated in the corner."</p>

<p>"A bunch of us did get together and brainstormed character backstories that were together, or even goals that would intersect with other characters," Riegel said, offering up a serious answer on the character creation process. "But I don't think anyone requested or required to be sitting at a particular table in order to be with another cast member."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"We developed our characters kinda like we always do, figuring out their backstories and their goals and their features and then threw them together in a big pot and stirred it up."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I penned this question, I thought about how each table might have felt like it's own smaller party to build around, but Riegel explained that it was quite the opposite. "The style of the campaign changed a little bit how we developed our characters just because there's so many of us we all needed to be more specific on what our short-term character goals were."</p>

<p>Not knowing how long they'll have the focus of the story before it wheels off to a different group also made the players feel like they needed to make sure their time counted.</p>

<p>"You kinda have to get your story out more quickly than in prior campaigns, and I think it made us all focus more specifically."</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cr-campaign-4-table-action.jpg?itok=HhR2pFzZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cr-campaign-4-table-action.jpg?itok=hWV4tYau 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>To not let the mood get too serious, Ward detailed the process between Taliesin Jaffe and himself had to "do a lot of rock, paper, scissors to figure out who could be more spooky. It was a long day of us both doing paper over and over again."</p>

<p>Mercer piped up to add, "The big difference for me is that I got to do this process finally."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Various cheers rang out through the Zoom call as Matthew Mercer, DM of the previous Critical Role campaigns, reflected on getting to be a player for a full campaign.</p>

<h2>Who Plays The Soldier, Seeker, and Schemer in the Group</h2>

<p>When the party was introduced, the themes of the different smaller tables were Soldiers, Schemers, and Seekers. I wanted to hear how those groups were built and understand just how focused they were on their goals.</p>

<p>Jokingly, Bailey called me out, "Secrets, secrets, secrets!" while Ray defended me that I "had to at least try asking." We all mused how difficult it is to interview about something that is to come, and not something that is readily available.</p>

<p>For those on social media who have been concocting ideas of who will be present at what table, Riegel did reassure that "We've seen collages that people have made speculating about who is at which table… and not a single one is correct." The entire cast burst into a united laugh.</p>

<p>To talk more about the theme of "Soldiers, Schemers, and Seekers," Ray warned not to get too invested in the archetype. Just because a character is big and burly, swinging their sword around doesn't mean that they're going to end up at the soldiers' table. "Those are more encompassing of the current goals with the character and how they're aligned."</p>

<p>Knowing that Brennan Lee Mulligan has cited <em>Lord of the Rings</em> as inspiration, I asked just how set those tables were or if we could expect to see characters drifting from one group to another.</p>

<p>"We've talked about the possibility of tables cross-pollinating as the overall campaign progresses," Mercer explained. "We haven't explicitly planned for it because the story guides what happens, but that's definitely a possibility that we've all been ready for if it ever comes around."</p>

<p>Ray mused on the benefits of these smaller groups within the grander narrative. "It gives us the freedom to let the characters' individual goals guide their paths and not really be bogged down by one singular mission that another character may have that you don't necessarily share."</p>

<h2>Character Reveals and Reactions</h2>

<p>With a massive cast, I was excited to learn what they thought of fans' reactions to these mysterious characters that we'll be meeting on October 2. I made sure to bring up how much praise and excitement I've seen for Mercer to be playing a cunty character.</p>

<p>"I've been excited to see all of the reactions and so excited to see people's guesses about characters. Many incorrect, some very interesting. That's part of the fun of the pure speculation." Speaking to those assumptions, Mercer added, "A lot of people were expecting a dwarf and I thought 'eh, I've done dwarf twice, for the time being I've filled that personal scope.'"</p>

<p>"As long as one person plays a dwarf I'm happy, literally that came up in our character creation meeting." Mercer added a stern tone as he comically re-enacted, "As long as ONE of you plays a dwarf, that's my only requirement."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"We nose goes'd and Marisha lost" - Iyengar</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Speaking to the speculative nature of the fans, Iyengar explained, "I think there's something really fun, because we've only done a tasteful skosh we're still living in the 'what could be' as much as the fans are so there's a shared sense of 'I don't know either, I cannot wait to find out.'"</p>

<p>Bailey and Iyengar praised all of the shipping art that they've already seen for characters and how crazy it is to see when no one outside of the company has seen a single character interact with one another. Thankfully, "everybody's hot," Bailey reassured me.</p>

<h2>Who Is Aabria's Campaign Ex?</h2>

<p>My next question, I turned directly to Iyengar for as I asked, "Which character in this campaign was your character previously married to?"</p>

<p>Layering on a polite dose of sarcasm, Iyengar told me, "Oh my gosh, could you imagine doing that bit even more? That would be crazy."</p>

<p>Knowing that Ward is coming into a full campaign of Critical Role as a relative newcomer, I was interested to learn if there was any advice that other members of the cast had imparted upon him.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Don't fuck this up" - Iyengar</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ward shared that he was told to, "'Do your thing' and that 'we brought you in because we trust you,' and that was all the encouragement I needed."</p>

<h2>The Evolution Of Critical Role</h2>

<p>Critical Role Campaign 4 is one of evolution; New faces, a new set, and a new storytelling style. I posed to the cast members who have been around since the beginning what they're most excited about in Campaign 4 to show off to the longtime fans.</p>

<p>"To jump in here with a quick little anecdote," Mercer began, "When we started playing at home, we already had a lot of players at the table. Doing this for 10 years, it's been so wonderful being us just playing as our friend group, but we've all tried our best every chance we've had to bring more of our friends in."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"It was the right timing, and it's been very exciting to not just have guests but have our core cast expand with all of these wonderful people."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Riegel added, "and if this goes well. Campaign five: 25 people, Campaign six: 100 people, Campaign Seven: everyone in California."</p>

<p>To add a serious answer, Riegel also said he was looking forward to people getting to see Matthew Mercer play a character and "for everyone to realize he doesn't know how to do it… He's been DMing for so long, he actually doesn't know how to play, so we're teaching him a lot of rules along the way."</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sonys-september-state-of-play-new-rumors-and-where-to-watch-2000628219</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The latest PlayStation Showcase <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-state-of-play-date-time-where-to-watch-2000627924">is later today</a>. Will it deliver or are Sony fans destined to wander the PS5 generation with big first-party announcements remaining few and far between? The Tokyo Game Show 2025-adjacent State of Play could deliver major updates on any number of highly anticipated games, including what’s next on Sony’s first-party docket for 2026. Is it finally time to see what Insomniac Games has been cooking with <em>Marvel’s Wolverine</em>?</p> <p>The September State of Play livestream begins at 5:00 p.m. ET and will stream, per usual, on YouTube and Twitch. It has a “mercifully” concise runtime of just 35 minutes, with at least some of that devoted to Housemarque’s upcoming sci-fi shooter roguelike <em>Saros</em>. That suggests it could be on deck for the first half of next year, exactly five years after the launch of<em> Returnal</em>, a development cadence that a lot of PlayStation studios are hitting this generation.</p>  <p>But what about the rest of the 2026 release slate for the PS5? Leaks <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-showcase-state-play-tgs-2025-ff7-remake-part-3-2000626000">earlier this month</a> suggested that a new trailer for <em>Wolverine</em>, first seen back at a September 2021 Sony showcase, was ready for primetime and likely to air during the company’s next event. A build was leaked in the malicious hack back in 2023 and the game’s creative director left the studio last year. Outside of that, we still know hardly anything about how it will play or what <em>X-Men</em> stories it will weave into its campaign.</p>

 <p>On the third-party front, there’s a rumor that our next look at<em> Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</em> could be at the showcase to confirm a potential 2026 release window. We also know that Square Enix doesn’t have its own livestream booked for TGS, suggesting updates on <em>Kingdom Hearts 4</em>, <em>Dragon Quest 12</em>, or <em>Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part III</em> could come during Sony’s showcase. It would be great to finally be able to put the rumors about the<em> Final Fantasy 9</em> remake to bed one way or the other as well.</p>

 <p>One game that seemingly won’t be at the showcase is Bungie’s <em>Marathon</em>. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2025/09/23/bungies-marathon-not-at-sonys-new-state-of-play-next-look-months-away/"><em>Forbes</em>‘ Paul Tassi reports</a> that an expected update on when the extraction shooter will launch won’t be part of the event. “The earliest we will see something more from <em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>is November. And that’s a ‘maybe,’ right now,” he writes. The game has been going through some last-minute reworks after feedback from an alpha earlier this year and a scandal over plagiarized art soon after.</p> <p>Sony previously said it was still expecting the extraction loot shooter to hit before the end of March 2026. Given the wretched state of <em>Destiny 2</em> this summer, there couldn’t be more riding on it for the company’s live-service legacy and, more importantly, Bungie’s future.</p>

                <p>EA's Battlefield 6 is ditching PS4 and Xbox, but Activision's Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is still releasing on those aging consoles. Why? There is a pretty straightforward explanation.</p><p>Treyarch senior director of production Yale Miller told <a data-target="true" href="///">Dexerto</a> that "a shocking number of people play" Call of Duty on last-gen systems, and that supporting those consoles helps matchmaking efforts.</p>

<p>"It made sense for us to do it, and we could," Miller said.</p><p>Black Ops 7's graphics and performance on PS4 and Xbox One won't be on par with the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions, Miller said. He added that the developer's mindset when mapping out new features is that "you should never be thinking about old-gen for the features that you're designing."</p><p>Also in the interview, Treyarch associate director Lawrence Metten said the team knew it wanted to bring back the Theater mode--which allows players to rewatch matches--even though it won't be supported on last-gen. "We can't support it on old-gen. That's not a reason not to do the feature. We're gonna bite the bullet and disable it on old-gen," he said.</p><p>In other Black Ops 7 news, the developer recently said it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7-dev-rejected-some-big-brand-collab-skin-deals-apparently/1100-6534981/" data-ref-id="1100-6534981">rejected a partnership with a "big brand" for collab skins </a>in the wake of criticisms that Call of Duty skins have become too wacky.</p><p>Black Ops 7 launches on November 14, but you can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-start-time-how-to-get-in-and-everything-else-to-know/1100-6534073/" data-ref-id="1100-6534073">play the game's multiplayer beta in October</a>.

		<p>Green Flamingo Games has announced a brand new 3D rhythm platformer called Spanky’s Battle Swing, and it takes inspiration from the cartoons of the 1930’s blending them with a soundtrack filled with electro swing jazz. The teaser trailer gives a glimpse at the platforming action, as well as a taster of the soundtrack.</p>
<p><iframe title="Spanky's Battle Swing | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PN3kuYjpYB4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In Spanky’s Battle Swing you play as Spanky The Bat as he navigates around the city of Metronopolis, a place where everything moves to the music. Spanky is not a fan of the constant noise and the way the city functions because of the music, so he is on a quest to shut it all up by getting to Mayor Metrognome. There are different districts in Metronopolis which each have their own music beats, tricks and guardians to take down. The key features include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rhythm-Driven Platforming:</strong>&nbsp;Every foe, platform, and hazard moves to the beat—learn the pattern, bend the pattern,&nbsp;<strong>own</strong>&nbsp;the pattern.</li>
<li><strong>Electro-Swing Soundtrack:</strong>&nbsp;A punchy, dynamic score that keeps the city buzzing and your feet tapping.</li>
<li><strong>Vintage Cartoon Flair:</strong>&nbsp;A lively, personality-packed world with expressive characters and a 1930s-inspired look.</li>
<li><strong>Rebel Against the Beat:</strong>&nbsp;As Spanky, you can sync up… or go off-grid. Break timing rules to create your own openings and shut the city up—your way.</li>
</ul>
<p>A release date is yet to be confirmed for Spanky’s Battle Swing, but it will be coming out in 2026 for PC.</p>

<p>HOLD IT!</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>In a surprise announcement during its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2rD0i4pOTk">TGS 2025 Online Program</a>, Capcom has announced a big free update for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/phoenix_wright_ace_attorney_trilogy">Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy</a> on Switch (and other platforms) coming on <strong>19th November 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Of course, fans are probably disappointed that it's not a brand new game, <em>but</em> this update does bring the trilogy up-to-snuff with other Ace Attorney compilations.</p>
<p>The biggest addition for some will be the addition of two new languages: Latin American Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese. Now more people than ever will be able to enjoy these classic games in their native language.</p>
<p>Other new features coming to the original trilogy include an art gallery, the ability to select any episode at any time from each game, a story mode that automatically solves puzzles for you, a music player, and a scene creator.</p>

<p>Some of these features are already available in other games like Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney Trilogy, so it's good to see Capcom going back and making tweaks.</p>
<p>If you somehow <em>still</em> haven't picked this up on Switch, then let us sway you <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/phoenix_wright_ace_attorney_trilogy">with our review</a>. Then you'll realise that you have a new franchise to be obsessed with and a lot of games to get through!</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/fallout-royal-flush-ttrpg-adventure-set-in-new-vegas-is-now-available-for-pre-order</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fallout-royal-flush-the-ttrpg-adventure-set-in-new-vegas-is-now-available-for-pre-order.1307316/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Pre-orders for the newest adventure for the <em>Fallout</em> TTRPG have gone live. Modiphius Entertainment's <em>Fallout: Royal Flush</em> will bring players to the Mojave Wasteland, a location home to fan-favorite entries in Bethesda's post-apocalyptic series, and home to season 2 of the TV show.</p>

<h2>The Fallout: Royal Flush Pre-Order Announcement</h2>

<p>In an official press release, Modiphius Entertainment announced that Fallout: Royal Flush is available for pre-order now on their webstore. This is a prewritten adventure for <em>Fallout: The Roleplaying Game</em>, which utilizes Modiphius' distinct 2d20 RPG system.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fallout-royal-flush-rad-storm-artwork.jpg?itok=xfcL3eZS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fallout-royal-flush-rad-storm-artwork.jpg?itok=mKA2o_aU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The adventure will take players on a road trip through the Sierras, the Mojave Wasteland, and the city of casinos and conspiracy itself: New Vegas. In the adventure, players will handle regional tensions and fight against numerous gangs. These conflicts eventually tie to an accelerationist conspiracy to bring war back to the West.</p>

<p>Complicating matters further is that the adventure is set before the Second Battle of the Hoover Dam. For dedicated fans, this means the events of the game are before the events of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/fallout-new-vegas" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Fallout: New Vegas</em></a>, where the New California Republic managed to repel Caesar's Legion and bring some semblance of law to the Mojave.</p>

<p>For especially dedicated players, one of the locations in this adventure is New Reno. This is an area from <em>Fallout 2</em>. It is also a key location for the upcoming second season of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/fallout-season-one-review-welcome-to-apocalypse" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Fallout</em> TV</a> show. If you've only seen the show and want a glimpse of what awaits those characters, this is an adventure to seek out.</p>

It contains the main quest and side quests designed to take characters from levels 1-21. In addition, it will have new NPCs and three new player origins: Enclave Remnant, Follower of the Apocalypse, Viper Initiate. For GMs, the book has new rules for harsh environmental effects, gambling, encounter generation, and vehicles.</p>

<p>The book is available now at an MSRP of $47.99, not including shipping. It is expected to be released in late November.</p>

              <p>On Monday, the Department of Homeland Security posted a <a href="https://kotaku.com/department-homeland-security-ice-pokemon-song-video-2000627900">gross video of ICE making multiple arrests</a> set to the original <em>Poké</em><em>mon&nbsp;</em>anime’s theme song, as well as using interstitial cuts of the show and displaying mock-ups of trading cards for several of the individuals arrested. After millions of people saw the video and called on Nintendo or The Pokémon Company to pursue legal action, the company has issued a statement to <em>Kotaku.</em></p> <p>“We are aware of a recent video posted by the Department of Homeland Security that includes imagery and language associated with our brand,” the statement reads. “Our company was not involved in the creation or distribution of this content, and permission was not granted for the use of our intellectual property.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Gotta Catch ‘Em All. <a href="https://t.co/qCvflkJGmB">pic.twitter.com/qCvflkJGmB</a></p> <p>— Homeland Security (@DHSgov) <a href="https://twitter.com/DHSgov/status/1970251208322621530?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The statement stops short of mentioning whether the company plans to take any further action. Doug McGowan, <em>Pokemon</em>‘s ex-legal chief, told&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fans-want-pokmon-to-sue-after-department-of-homeland-security-video-uses-ash-ketchum-to-promote-ice-but-the-companys-former-legal-boss-says-he-wouldnt-touch-this">IGN</a>&nbsp;</em>that if he were still working with the company, he “wouldn’t touch this” case for a few reasons.</p> <p data-cy="paragraph">“I don’t see them doing anything about this for a few reasons,” McGowan told <em>IGN</em>. “First, think of how little you see [The Pokémon Company International]’s name in the press,” McGowan told <em>IGN</em>. “They are INSANELY publicity-shy and prefer to let the brand be the brand.</p> <p data-cy="paragraph">“Second, many of their execs in the USA are on green cards.

This will blow over in a couple of days and they’ll be happy to let it.”</p> <p data-cy="paragraph">It’s probably the safer course of action, but it’s certainly not the more principled one considering The Pokémon Company has pursued legal action for <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-red-blue-mobile-lawsuit-pocket-monster-remake-1851765825">far less egregious offenses</a>. But hey, at least it’s putting all its legal team to good use by <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-pokemon-palworld-lawsuit-patent-summon-digimon-2000624724">patenting mechanics</a> and suing <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-nintendo-palworld-pocketpair-lawsuit-patent-1851652489">knock-off monster-catching franchises</a>, right?</p>

              <p>How many cables do you have running across your desk right now? The more smart devices we have the more clutter we accumulate as each needs its own cable and adapter to keep it’s battery charged up. My nightstand is a nightmare. Having to plug in my phone, earbuds, and smartwatch at the end of the day leaves barely any room for eave a glass of water. And when I reach to check a notification on my phone, the cables get tangled, pulling stuff off the stand. At least that was the case before I got myself a dedicated charging station. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4287/">Take a look at this 3-in-1 wireless charger from Acer. It’s normally selling for $70, but Amazon has it in a limited time deal, bringing the price down by 32%.</a> That equates to a savings of $22 having you only need to pay $48.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4287/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The Acer MagSafe charging station is designed with Apple in mind, making use of Qi2 wireless charging. Modern Apple devices all are equipped with wireless charging capability. If you have an iPhone 12 or later, your phone will be compatible. The 3-in-1 charger’s three dedicated charging platforms are each made for you iPhone, AirPods, and Apple Watch, magnetically adhering to your devices. This keeps clutter down and you’re devices still easily accessible while charging. No more knocking things off the nightstand when you get a late night text.</p>
<p>The cylindrical base is made for stability, keeping it always upright even when you phone is providing some extra weight on top while charging. The anti-slip pads along the bottom keep it firmly planted in place. The charger also doubles as a stand. If you choose to keep the Acer charger on your desktop, you phone when mounted is set at an ideal viewing angle so you can scroll with it in place or just keep it there next to you in view in case a notification pops up.</p>



<h2>Portability in Mind</h2>
<p>The charging stand is made to be portable. The iPhone charging platform can rotate around to for a cylinder while the AirPod and Apple Watch platforms can retract into the base. This leaves you with a little capsule about the size and shape of a soda can which you can easily fit into your bag while traveling.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4287/">Get the Acer 3-in-1 charger and eliminated clutter on your desk for a hefty discount for a limited time</a>. Right now, you’ll save 32% while the sale is still active.</p>

                <p>Extraction shooters normally feature a grim and serious art direction, but Escape from Dukov is aiming to be a cute alternative to this genre when it officially launches on October 16. Waddling its way onto PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store, the duck-themed single-player game has been fairly popular on Steam once a demo for it went live.</p><p>Billed as an extraction shooter that also features base-building gameplay mechanics, Escape from Dukov isn't a hardcore entry in the genre like Escape from Tarkov. The game has cartoonish enemies, fog-of-war mechanics, and randomly dropped loot, while the gameplay is flexible enough to allow you to fight enemies head-on or use stealth to your advantage.</p><p>When you're not planning for a run, you can also build up your base and store the resources you'll need to construct a spaceship that can be used to escape the doomed planet you're stuck on.</p><p>Like other shooter games, Escape from Duckov is all about the sweet allure of taking on enemies and scavenging for rare loot. If you're knocked out, you'll lose everything in this high-risk and high-reward game. Escape from Dukov also has weapon customization and a crafting system to add a level of replayability to the game.</p><p>If you're interested, Escape from Duckov has an early-adopter discount dropping the price down to $15.83 for the first two weeks post-launch, after which it will cost $18.</p>

</section></header><section>

<p>Rejoice, Gods and Goddesses! <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades II</a> launches on Switch and Switch 2 tomorrow, 25th September 2025. Gosh, can time slow down a little bit? There are <em>so many</em> games coming out at the moment.</p>
<p>You'll see reviews have gone live at a number of sites today and might be thinking "wait, where are NL's impressions?" Well, they're coming very soon! So keep an eye out in the coming days.</p>
<p>For those of you who can't quite wait, however, Felix has put together some early impressions of Supergiant Games' first-ever sequel. And, don't worry, if you've never dipped into the Early Access version of the game on Steam, there's no need to fear spoilers, as we're keeping things contained to the early hours.</p>
<p>We've also got some comparisons between the Switch 1 and Switch 2 versions — longer load times and less-crisp visuals, and only 60fps in docked and handheld, while on Switch 2, docked performance is 120fps.</p>

<p>So if you're not sure whether to dive in tomorrow or just want to get a little bit more excited for Hades II, have a look at Felix's video up top. And then check back very soon for our full review.</p>
<p>Oh, and don't forget, Hades II is getting a full physical edition, and it will have the Switch 1 and Switch 2 versions on the cart! If you can't wait, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/heres-when-hades-2-releases-in-your-time-zone">we've got a rundown of when the game drops in your region digitally</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Activision has debuted the first gameplay trailer for the Zombies mode in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, and published a <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hades-2-supergiant-guide-us/">new blog on the Call of Duty website</a> along with it that delves further into the loose narrative that ties the zombie killing together and the new and returning gameplay features in this year's iteration. What's most exciting for players who can't wait to jump into the Zombies mode is that the upcoming Open Beta will feature the zombies survival gameplay mode on top of its other multiplayer modes.</p>



<p>The new trailer kicks off with a short recap of <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-debuts-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-zombies-trailer/">what we saw in the cinematic trailer that debuted last week</a>, when we were first introduced to the cast of characters in the zombies mode, before showing off some snippets of gameplay to the tune of AC/DC's Highway to Hell.</p>



<p>It's all appropriately action-packed and what you'd expect from a trailer showing off some gruesome zombie killing, while the blog post that appeared alongside it has more of the juicier details about what the mode will actually play and look like.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 | Zombies Gameplay Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/07SF99EeZ1M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Regarding the narrative in this year's Zombies mode, Black Ops 7 Zombies picks up where Black Ops 6 left off, and sends players "<em>to the beating heart of the Dark Aether</em>," with multiple timelines colliding in one place.</p>



<p>The eight-character crew you'll play as throughout the Zombies mode are fighting their way through the Dark Aether, and the narrative bits that connect all this fighting will be dolled out as they usually are, through seasonal post-launch updates for players to dig through. Of course, though, no one really plays Zombies for the story.</p>



<p>It's the creatures, the killing, intricate maps, and fun gameplay loop that continues to keep players hooked. The maps included in this year's Zombies mode include Janus Towers Plaza, Vandorn Farm, Blackwater Lake, Ashwood, Exit 115, Zarya Cosmodrome, and The Fog. </p>



<p>Each map includes different points of interest and variations that make sessions on them feel different, like the thick fog that blurs your vision, the deteriorating and decrepit highway diner and gas station of Exit 115, the constantly sinking frontier town of Ashwood, and the picturesque resort of Blackwater Lake that's made less eye-catching by the zombies everywhere.</p>



<p>One of the key new features in this year's mode is the addition of a new wonder vehicle called Ol'Tessie, a truck that can be your battering ram through the hordes and get you out of a pinch when you need it, but you'll still need to maintain the truck by reinforcing its frame whenever it takes too much damage.</p>



<p>There's also a new ultimate weapon to tack on to the Ray Gun with the Necrofluid Gauntlet, a glove that lets you punch through zombies' heads like nobody's business. You can also fire spikes through it, and even pull items to you.</p>



<p>Of course, there's much more to come in this year's Zombies mode, and you'll be able to try a lot of them out during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-open-beta-october/">coming beta that kicks off next week</a>. Today's Zombies trailer also isn't the only recent look at gameplay we've gotten for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, as a <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-multiplayer-reveal-trailer-wall-running-activision/">new multiplayer gameplay trailer debuted just two days ago</a>.</p>

            <p>
Capcom and Square Enix announced earlier this year that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> would be collaborating with one another, and the first trailer for the former's collab received a proper look in today. It's coming as part of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> game's third title update, so there's more included than just Final Fantasy bits, but that does seem to be the main thing here. So what's included?
</p>
<p>
Well, for starters there's the cosmetics. A couple of Final Fantasy 14 jobs will be making their way into the game, the first being the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/berserk">Berserk</a> reference that is the Dark Knight job. This one gives you a big ole greatsword, and equipping the armour set lets you perform a special action. Then there's Pictomancer, a more recent addition to Final Fantasy 14 that lets you cast different pictomancy spells. It's kind of like you get to do a little cosplay!

<p>
The new monster for this update isn't technically a monster, instead you'll be getting Omega Planetes, a Final Fantasy 14, Magitek-themed enemy that looks like it'll incorporate some mechanics from the MMO itself. Neat! You'll also be able to ride around on a Chocobo instead of a Seikret, and Cactuar will show up along the way somewhere too (including its signature pose).
</p><p>
Outside of the collab stuff, Arch-tempered Nu Udra is showing up in an event quest starting October 22nd and running until October 29, which nets you some fiery-looking armour. The Grand Hub will also get a Halloweeny overhaul too. At the end of the trailer there was a tease for title update four too, which showed a look at Gogmazios (great name), a volcanic-themed monster.
</p>
<p>
Title update three is scheduled for release later this month on September 29th, and title update four is planned for some time in December.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/annapurna-interactive-stray-alan-wake-tv-control-2-1851647950">Annapurna Interactive</a> kicked of Tokyo Game Show 2025 with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXf5t1MC1k">brief showcase</a> last night that highlighted three new indies joining its <a href="https://kotaku.com/stray-steam-cat-game-god-of-war-powerwash-simulator-1849339513">impressive list of published games</a> which includes <em>Donut County</em>, <em>Stray</em>, and <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em>. The upcoming releases hail from a variety of teams and feature unusual genre mashups. Could one or more of them be a 2026 GOTY contender? Here’s a brief breakdown of each.</p> <h2><em>People of Note</em> is an RPG for theater kids</h2>  <p>I’ll admit, I usually try to stay as far away from theater kids as possible, doubly so if they start singing (which I’m allowed to say as a reformed theater kid myself). But <em>People of Note</em>, a musical RPG, is boasting turn-based battles and some really pretty-looking environments.</p> <p>You travel around to different musically themed cities recruiting new band mates, but the real draw is the rhythm-based combat that evolves over the course of each fight as the music being played shifts. “Did you like <em>Expedition 33</em>? Did you like <em>Kpop Demon Hunters</em>? Well…” is the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sunshineduk.bsky.social/post/3lzkfq2fylc2j">best pitch</a> for it I’ve heard yet. It’s made by Iridium Studios and is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC next year.</p>

 <h2><em>Demi and the Fractured Dream</em> is a <em>Zelda</em>-like for Dungeon nerds</h2>  <p>Okay, we’re getting a little warmer to my personal tastes with <em>Demi and the Fractured Dream</em>, a pretty familiar-looking riff on the classic <em>Zelda</em> puzzle action formula. You play as an antlered “voidsent” trying to lift a mysterious curse who travels to a bunch of different biomes to do that, including one that looks very <em>Journey.</em></p>

 <p>The draw here is the<em> Devil May Cry</em> sword combos and 3D dungeon exploration. There’s even a backwards flip just like in <em>Ocarina of Time</em>. <em>Zelda</em> homages are a dime a dozen at this point, but I’m as hungry as anyone else for clever 3D puzzles. It’s being made by Yarn Owl and it’s coming to Switch 1/2, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC next year.</p>

 <h2><em>D-topia</em> is a cozy puzzle adventure for people terrified of the future</h2>  <p>This is by far the game I came away from the showcase most excited to check out. <em>D-topia</em> takes place in a future where, instead of drowning us in meme-slop and cooking the planet’s atmosphere, highly advanced AI has actually helped to take care of humanity’s every seeming need. If there’s a grim <em>Black Mirror</em>-style lining to this sci-fi story, it’s not apparent from the first trailer.</p> <p>Your job is to help the AI help make people’s lives better, exploring their personal relationships and unique life situations along the way. There’s logic puzzles, branching convos, and a very cute, very thick cat in the mix. It’s being made by Marumittu Games and coming to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, Switch, and PC in 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Maybe it’s just because nothing could possibly live up to the cultural takeover of last year’s </span><i><span>Wicked</span></i><span> that the promotional campaign for </span><i><span>Wicked: For Good</span></i><span>, the second and final part of the </span><i><span>Wizard of Oz</span></i><span> stage musical’s movie adaptation, has felt a bit understated. We’re still two months away from the movie’s premiere in November, but this far out from the release of the first film, I was already being inundated with videos and memes of Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo on a press tour, and nothing like that has happened yet with this one.. So it was surprising to me to see that, this morning, Universal released the final trailer for </span><i><span>For Good</span></i><span>. Maybe I’ve just been in an unintentional media blackout, but what was more surprising to me than the arrival of the trailer itself was that it pretty much spoils some of the biggest twists in the musical’s second act.</span></p>  <p><i><span>Wicked </span></i><span>fans have spent much of the last year trying to obscure some of the major reveals yet to come after Erivo’s showstopping “Defying Gravity” closed out the first movie, but the final trailer for the sequel pretty much gives away some of those details just months before the movie hits theaters. Specifically, the first film</span> <span>sows the seeds for iconic characters from the original </span><i><span>Wizard of Oz </span></i><span>to appear in </span><i><span>For Good</span></i><span>, but you might not catch on if you weren’t already privy to the musical’s second act. The most obvious is the lion cub Elphaba and Fiyero (Jonathan Bailey) rescue, who grows up to be the Cowardly Lion who accompanies Dorothy. But what about the Tin Man and Scarecrow who make up the rest of their crew? Well, viewers are quite familiar with both of these characters, actually. Boq, played by Ethan Slater, is turned into the Tin Man by Elphaba in an attempt to save his life. Fiyero suffers a similar fate, with Elphaba’s magic turning him into a scarecrow after he is tortured by the Wizard’s guards.</span></p>  <p><span>All of that had been mostly kept under wraps, until this new trailer. Boq’s fate is much more spelled out, as we see him turned into the Tin Man and shouting at Elphaba for what she’s done. Fiyero’s fate is more implied, as we see Elphaba stroking his face, but Bailey is facing away from the camera, so people who aren’t paying a ton of attention might miss that one. If you somehow didn’t catch it and are still reading this article anyway, sorry?</span></p> <p><i><span>Wicked: For Good</span></i><span> heads to theaters on November 21, when we will finally get to hear Erivo’s rendition of “No Good Deed,” resulting in world peace and happiness across the land.</span></p>

One of the mods even removes the franchise's signature fog from the Japanese town of Ebisugaoka. And suddenly it's a much nicer day for high school student Hinako Shimizu, at least until something tries to kill her.</p><p>As demonstrated in the post above, the game isn't quite as intimidating if you can see everything clearly. Last year's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hill-2/" data-ref-id="5000-574201">Silent Hill 2</a> remake also had <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/silenthill2/videos/51" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a mod that got rid of the fog</a>. Some of the other notable mods for Silent Hill f include <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/silenthillf/mods/7" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">hardware-based ray tracing</a>, the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/silenthillf/mods/5" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">removal of the HUD</a>, and some <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/silenthillf/mods/9" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">optimization tweaks for the game's engine</a>.</p><p>Silent Hill f is a departure for the series and the first game in the franchise to be set in Japan. The story takes place in the '60s and follows Hinako as she tries to understand why her town has seemingly been swallowed in endless fog and populated by horrific creatures. GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/silent-hill-f-review-spirited-away/1900-6418411/" data-ref-id="1900-6418411">review for Silent Hill f</a> gave it a 9 out of 10.</p><p>This game arrived less than a year after Bloober Team's Silent Hill 2 remake. That title was so well-received that Konami and Bloober Team are joining forces again for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-remake-seemingly-teased-by-bloober-team/1100-6532382/" data-ref-id="1100-6532382">a remake of the original Silent Hill</a>. However, there's no release date set for that game yet.</p><p>Next year, the franchise will return to the big screen with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/return-to-silent-hill-will-hit-theaters-in-early-2026/1100-6532537/" data-ref-id="1100-6532537">Return to Silent Hill</a>, a film that will adapt the story of Silent Hill 2. Original Silent Hill director and screenwriter Christophe Gans returned to helm this sequel, which stars Jeremy Irvine as James Sunderland, Hannah Emily Anderson as Mary, and Evie Templeton as Laura. Return to Silent Hill will hit theaters on January 23, 2026.</p>

<p>Superdeluxe is back with two more <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-castlevania-games-ranked-switch-and-nintendo-consoles">Castlevania</a> releases — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/castlevania_advance_collection">Advance Collection</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/castlevania_dominus_collection">Dominus Collection</a> — and they recently arrived at the Nintendo Life office.</p><div><figure data-videoid="EFjR3Z5CjWQ" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EFjR3Z5CjWQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EFjR3Z5CjWQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EFjR3Z5CjWQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed48884dygnusk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>834k</span></a></p>

<p>The Advance Collection, which includes <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/castlevania_circle_of_the_moon">Castlevania: Circle of the Moon</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/castlevania_harmony_of_dissonance">Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/castlevania_aria_of_sorrow">Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/castlevania_dracula_x">Castlevania: Dracula X / Vampire's Kiss</a>, contains four art cards, three maps, three soundtrack CDs, a special trading card and a full-colour instruction manual.</p>
<p>The maps are a particular highlight; they're hand-drawn and feature game data on the reverse side.</p>

<p>The Dominus Collection, which includes <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/castlevania_dawn_of_sorrow">Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/castlevania_portrait_of_ruin">Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/castlevania_order_of_ecclesia">Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/haunted_castle_revisited">Haunted Castle Revisited</a>, contains three art cards, three maps, five (count 'em) soundtrack CDs, a special trading card and a full-colour instruction manual.</p>




<p>While it's possible to get these two collections in their standard physical format, these deluxe versions are really quite special, and I imagine most Castlevania fans will want them on their shelves.</p>

There is perhaps no better thing for a game to have than other, inconsequential things that have no real relation to the main thing for you to do that are entirely focused on mucking about. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/peak">Peak</a> is ostensibly about reaching the top of a mountain all for the sake of a sweet chance of escape, but really it is about doing silly things with, to, or around your friends. A <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3527290/view/520850995978175752?l=english">new update</a> has arrived in the game that is, to use the word ostensibly again because I couldn't think of another one, ostensibly about rebindable controls, but here too it's really about doing silly things with friends, things that don't even involve any climbing.
</p>
<p>
Basketball! This is one such way you can pass your time before heading out on your next misadventure. The devs say they "even made it dribble," which I do believe is quite important in this particular sport, I can't be sure, America hasn't successfully forced this pastime onto the UK like it has every other aspect of its culture. There's also chess, a game which I feel in my gut is somehow the spiritual inverse of Peak, but don't have the words to accurately describe this just yet.
</p>
<p>
On the cuter end of things, there's a photobooth in the airport now too, complete with non-functional, prop versions of the game's various items to take pictures with. Oh, and Bing Bong - you've met Bing Bong, right? Great guy, great guy - will now give you a yes-or-no answer after giving him a good squeeze, say for example if you were to ask him if it's a good idea to leap to your death or not. Love ya Bing Bong!
</p>
<p>
There is another big biome update on the way, this was mostly an update to get rebindable controls in (which are exactly what they sound like) with a few extras thrown on top.
</p>
<p>
You can pick up Peak with its new update on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527290/PEAK/">Steam</a>.
