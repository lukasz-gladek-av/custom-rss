            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced two brand new features for its SNES Classics catalog on the Nintendo Switch Online service, and if you're a connoisseur of strategy and puzzle games, this one's for you.</p>

<p>First up, select SNES games now support mouse controls on Switch Online. Naturally, this includes&nbsp;<em>Mario Paint</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-paint-nintendo-switch-online" rel="nofollow">released on the service last month</a>; in fact, Nintendo says some games "can only be played using mouse controls", seemingly including&nbsp;<em>Mario Paint</em>.</p>

<p>Other games support mouse controls as well, though; the trailer demonstrating the new mouse control feature shows not only&nbsp;<em>Mario Paint&nbsp;</em>being played, but also&nbsp;<em>Mario's Super Picross&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Nobunaga's Ambition</em>, both of which are probably a lot more satisfying with a mouse.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-online-snes-classics-mouse-controls.jpg?itok=lH5X3M39 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-online-snes-classics-mouse-controls.jpg?itok=1FWa5CpH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You can now play some SNES Classics on Nintendo Switch Online with mouse controls.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're playing on Switch 2, then the SNES games that support mouse controls will be playable with the Joy-Con 2's mouse mode, but if you're on the original Switch, you'll need to hook up a USB mouse to take advantage of this new feature.</p>

<p>As well as mouse controls, the new update also brings the ability to both view and change the controls for the SNES game you're playing. If there are button mappings that don't quite suit your play style, you can change them around to suit you.</p>

<p>Naturally, you'll also be able to save different mappings and configurations for each game, so you won't have to stick with the mappings you set up for&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Kart&nbsp;</em>in&nbsp;<em>Super Metroid</em>. Nintendo isn't that heartless.</p>

<p>You can check out a trailer showing off the new features being added to Nintendo Switch Online right here.</p>




<p>Both mouse controls and the ability to remap your buttons are available right now if you're a Nintendo Switch Online subscriber. Of course, if you're not, you'll need to sign up to get access to the SNES catalog.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Loose lips sink voidships.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">During my 30 minute interview with Saber Interactive development chief Tim Willits at gamescom 2025, he wouldn’t say much at all about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-iii">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 3</a>, despite my repeated efforts. I’m not surprised, really. With Games Workshop and publisher Focus Entertainment watching his every word like the Inquisition on the hunt for heresy, Willits must be careful to keep his cards close to his chest or else risk being declared a heretic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But I was able to get <em>something</em> out of him on the hotly anticipated sequel, namely that Games Workshop is throwing all sorts of ideas at Saber right now, and some of them are apparently "amazing."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I began my foray into Space Marine 3 territory by asking Willits why <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-3-announced-development-officially-begins-at-saber-interactive">the game was announced relatively soon after the release of Space Marine 2</a>. Willits dodged the question, saying: “It's just how we work with Focus… Again, it was massively successful for us, Space Marine 2, and Focus.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That it was indeed. Space Marine 2 may well be the most successful Warhammer 40,000 video game ever made. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-sells-7-million-in-less-than-a-year-and-you-can-see-why-space-marine-3-was-confirmed-so-soon">It sold over 7 million copies less than a year after going on sale</a>, and, by Willits’ own admission, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/success-of-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-changes-everything-dev-says-and-yes-there-are-ideas-for-space-marine-3">changed everything for Saber Interactive</a>. Even <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/space-marine-2-made-millions-for-games-workshop-now-its-on-the-hunt-for-the-next-big-warhammer-video-game">Games Workshop itself has talked about the money it’s made from the game</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Space Marine 3 was inevitable, then, but questions remain. Where will Lieutenant Titus and co head next? Will we see new factions? Will Saber expand co-op beyond the three-player limit? Will there be actual meaningful PvP?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alas, Willits wasn’t ready to answer these types of questions, but did tease ideas are coming from Games Workshop itself — and Saber is excited by them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We're working with Games Workshop, they’re the best ever,” he said. “And there’s such a rich universe that we’re pulling stuff [from]. And they've given us some ideas that are amazing. They have given us some really cool ideas. Their brains are just like… wow. So lots of super great ideas from Games Workshop.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Without spoiling the Space Marine 2 campaign, it strongly suggests a continuation of the story, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-fans-have-a-good-idea-which-enemy-faction-theyll-fight-in-space-marine-3"><u>IGN has reported on the enemy faction we’ll probably see in Space Marine 3</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 Siege Mode Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Some Space Marine 2 fans were concerned about the timing of Space Marine 3's announcement, but <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/glahjvsr/space-marine-3-is-officially-in-development/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Games Workshop has said</u></a> Space Marine 3 "is likely years away from release,” and Saber has promised to continue to support Space Marine 2 for some time to come.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Willits pointed to the support Saber's World War Z has enjoyed as the model it’s following for Space Marine 2. A second year of Space Marine 2 content, which Focus has discussed, is already on the way. But will Space Marine 2 get story DLC?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have some plans,” Willits teased, “but we have to work with Focus to get the right announcement. But nothing is off the table.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the shorter term, Space Marine 2 is set for Patch 10 in September to celebrate the game’s first anniversary. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-just-confirmed-the-new-techmarine-class-the-power-axe-a-new-chaos-v-chaos-mode-and-much-more">Check out all the details here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

Joined by an AI companion and his dim-witted robot assistant Ody-6, Alex sets off on a journey where every fight is a desperate battle against the unknown—and doom itself. The ship is a war zone. You may be outnumbered, but you are not outmatched.</p><p><em>Moros Protocol</em> is a relentless, fast-paced shooter where survival means adapting – or being consumed. To thrive against the monstrous hordes, players will need to dynamically adapt their loadout and strategy with each run.</p><p>Looking for a frantic, high-mobility approach to your enemies? Fill up your loadout with SMGs or pistols, augmented for speed and increased damage while moving—perfect for laying down a barrage of bullets on the go. Or for a slower, more methodical approach, put together a sniping build that focuses on powerful, precise shots that can take down enemies in a single hit.</p><p>Whichever you choose, your skills will grow during each run through thanks to <em>Moros Protocol</em>’s evolving combat system. Throughout your run you will find augments tailored to improve your skills in a specific playstyle. Find an augment that boosts your run and gun capabilities? Change up your loadout for a shotgun and let it rip!</p><p>Plot your own route through each run, with every branching path offering different risks. Do you want to play it safe, or face greater danger in pursuit of even greater rewards? Are you looking for a guaranteed new weapon, or a vendor to upgrade your skills? Choose wisely as you make your way towards your goal.</p><p>Beware, as death is around every corner in <em>Moros Protocol</em>—but death is not the end! Upgrade your abilities after each death before rejoining the battle as a better, more fearsome killing machine.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Tactical <a title="Genres > First-Person Shooter [2,763 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/shooter/fps">First-Person Shooter</a> Combat</strong> – Inspired by classic shooters, Moros Protocol combines fast-paced <a title="Genres > Action [2,987 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> with adaptability and customization.

                <p>Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce announced their engagement on August 26, and it was one of the biggest stories on the internet that day.

<figure><a title="Kirby and the Forgotten Land - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158255/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>Recently, I was back reading over my original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/kirby_and_the_forgotten_land">Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a> review to get a quick reminder of how I found the base game when it released in 2022 (what is time?) and, yeah, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land">it seems I fairly enjoyed that one</a>, now that I've rebooted my brain a little bit.</p>
<p>I jest, of course, I fully remember the experience, thank you very much! Usually, Kirby is a little low-stakes for my liking, but Forgotten Land swerved my personal issues with this series by giving us a fantastic 3D adventure that was as creative and exciting with its mechanics as it was beautiful to behold. And remember how excited we all got for Mouthful Mode? Remember Kirby car? Oh, how we laughed!</p>
<p>Anyway, Kirby hath returned, and he's packing a surprising amount of new content to boot in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-star-crossed-world">Kirby And The Forgotten Land - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World</a> (or KATFW - NS2E + SCW for short). Here, Nintendo has given the game a bit of the old "come and look what our fancy new console can do, mate!"</p>
<figure><a title="Kirby and the Forgotten Land - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158261/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>With the Switch 2 Edition, Forgotten Land now looks and runs much better, and there's a fully-earned triumphalism in the re-themed, remixed levels you get in Star-Crossed World, as you bash mysterious crystals and watch old levels magically come alive with frost and ice, sparkling gems and frozen paths carved into the sky. All of this reflecting and glistening in ways the Switch 1 may well have keeled over trying to process.</p>
<p>It's all very fancy. And the reason for all of these icy shifts in tone? Well, I won't ruin the story, for what it's worth, but a big mysterious meteor has crash-landed, and Kirby's services are once again required in order to hoover up crystals, defeat bosses, rescue cute little 'Starries', slap the silliness out of a whole load of diamanté-encrusted poodles, and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>The arrival of said meteor sees two remixed levels opened up on each of the game's six original map regions, for a total of 12 new levels overall. In the game's first region, Natural Plains, you get a new version of the opening beach arrival level, and a further remix in the form of a revisit to the game's mall. These remixes, whilst initially maybe a tad disappointing, in that they're essentially re-using areas, soon prove themselves to be some of the best, flashiest, and most exciting levels in the entire package.</p>
<figure><a title="Kirby and the Forgotten Land - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158262/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>As you progress through your icy return trip to the mall, as an example of this, the game goes out of its way to lift you up, out and above where you've been before, as it does in all the rest of these new offerings, and the platforming action that results is the tightest and most challenging I've played in a Kirby game thus far. My one recurring issue with the series resolved in an icy instant — difficulty. Slippery surfaces create a little more tension in making jumps and landings, new ice-based mini-bosses prove fun to best, and some of the best aspects of the main game, such as the car, make a return in fun ways.</p>
<p>So it's a hefty amount of new game all told, especially considering the reasonable price of upgrading for players who own the base game already. And that's not all, as whilst the number of new remixed regions comes in at a solid amount of new content by itself, Nintendo has gone the whole hog and added new transformations, a whole new collectibles 'EX' directory, and a few other things besides that I won't spoil.</p>
<p>I'd even go so far as to say that the new Gear Mouth transformation, which I'm sure everyone has seen by now, is one of the most engagingly tactile Kirby alterations ever. And this wee guy has turned into a whole lot of things in his life. I love how the cog's teeth stick to walls, and the way the HD Rumble really lets you feel the weight and bumpiness as you trundle up platforms and across gaps. This is top platforming fun, no matter who you are or where your skill level might be with this stuff.</p>
<figure><a title="Kirby and the Forgotten Land - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158256/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Add in a few more transformations such as Spring Mouth (jump really high and then smash through stuff), and Sign Mouth (downhill racing, anyone?) and you've got a perfectly balanced sprinkling of new things to try out across a bunch of levels that look and play amazingly well. Again, I don't feel like you're getting short-changed because these are "just" remixed levels, as the amount of new things to do, see, and collect makes them feel like much more.</p>
<p>For me, all this added goodness makes it impossible not to re-run through the entire game alongside the new levels. Thankfully, Nintendo has made this nice and easy to do here, as you can jump between normal base game stuff and the new additions, all from the same map. Plus, switching to stage lists and collectibles takes nothing more than a quick press of 'X' to cycle between Forgotten Land and Star-Crossed World stats. For two-player co-op, which is also a cinch to jump in and out of, there's a ton of colourful fun to be had, too, and my kids were blazing through it all with no issues.</p>

<p>The base game, with its fantastic campaign, has never looked or felt better to play, either. These are big upgrades, from 30fps (with the odd creak) and a slightly smeared look, to buttery smooth 60fps and crystal clear resolution in both docked and handheld. So mixing things up, jumping back in to retread old ground whilst bashing through new areas for more Starries, it all feels equally fresh and looks fantastic across the board.</p>
<p>One final detail to note is that the hub town's Colosseum also has something new going on, although I can't go into that just now! All in all, though, it rounds out what is a very generous helping of new things on top of a visual and performance touch-up that makes it very hard for me to pick holes.</p>
<p>Honestly, as far as Kirby goes, this really is now his finest platforming hour, with the only thing really holding him back being the repetitiveness of some of the reused bosses in the base game, which is still an issue here. Regardless of this minor issue, though, this is still easily one of the best and most polished 3D platformers on Switch or Switch 2.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Kirby And The Forgotten Land - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World gives you the base Forgotten Land experience at a delicious 60fps with a whole big bunch of new content thrown in for good measure. The 12 remixed areas that make up the DLC are uniformly delightful, the new transformations are excellent, and there's even new challenges for hardcore Kirby fans to get stuck into.</p>
<p>One of the best games on Switch, and one of my favourite 3D platformers in years, polished to a sparkly sheen and packing some meaningful new content? That's a very easy recommendation and a truly excellent addition to the Switch 2's early lineup.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As I’ve been shouting from the rooftops for years now, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land">Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a> is one of the most criminally-underrated Switch exclusives, so I was quite happy when it was revealed it would be one of the first OG Switch titles to get a fancy Switch 2 update. Kirby and the Forgotten Land Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World adds both a new layer of polish to the game's presentation and a significant amount of fresh content for Kirby-hungry fans to devour.</p>



<p>So, is the Switch 2 version of Kirby and the Forgotten Land a well-rounded meal? Or will it leave a bad taste in your mouth? Float onward for the answer...</p>



<p><em>Note: This is an opinion piece and, thus, not as detailed as a full, scored review would be.</em></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As I mentioned following my <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-editions-hands-on-impressions">previous brief hands-on time</a> with the upgraded version of Kirby and the Forgotten Land, the game is the best-looking of the initial batch of Switch 2 updates to my eye. Per Nintendo itself, the game now runs at 1440p, but that resolution seems less dynamic than some other Switch 2 upgrades, as the game simply looks sharper than, say, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-switch-2-hands-on">Switch 2 version of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>. Of course, it could be that the original game’s assets were just more detailed and suited to this kind of upgrade, as it’s one of the most impressive-looking Switch titles. Now, it’s one of the most impressive-looking <em>Switch 2</em> titles – crisp, colorful, and bursting with personality. Oh, and yes, the bump to 60fps is definitely felt. The game was perfectly playable at 30fps, but everything feels just a little nicer at 60fps. I really can't find any fault with this game's technical upgrade.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>But the visual upgrade is just the beginning. The Switch 2 version of Kirby and the Forgotten Land also comes with what’s essentially a whole new DLC mini-campaign, Star-Crossed World, available any time after completing the original game’s first world. A mysterious meteor crashes to earth, causing an imposing volcanic island to rise from the ocean. On this island, our pink hero comes across the heart-shaped “Star of Darkness,” which seems more than a little ominous, so Kirby sets about rescuing "Starries," who have the power to contain the darkness (these little alien guys are basically this DLC’s version of the original game’s Waddle Dees).</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Star-Crossed World campaign tasks players with revisiting several stages from the original game (2 per world, for a total of 12 remixed stages), which are now littered with crystals and “Starryflowers,” which can be broken to reveal new, glowing crystalline pathways. All this crystally stuff also affects the game’s enemies and minibosses, making them a somewhat-stiffer challenge. Additionally, there are a few new “Mouthful Mode” transformations, including a bouncy spring, a wall-climbing gear, and a sign that can be used for fun, slippy-slidy sledding sections. Several classic Mouthful transformations also return and are used in fun and sometimes unique ways.</p>



<p>Now, when I first saw the description and trailers for Star-Crossed World, I would say I was only <em>moderately </em>excited. I figured I'd basically be playing through familiar stages, just a little tougher, a little different. Thankfully, that’s not really the case. For instance, in the Star-Crossed World version of the Abandoned Beach stage things begin as usual, but then, after less than a minute, the sea literally parts, revealing a rainbow-coral-coated ocean floor. What follows is almost an entirely-different level than the one in the original game.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>This is the case for pretty much all of these remixed “Starry Stages.” Level themes and assets may be reused, but these are essentially completely new stage layouts, and they're just as fun, sometimes <em>moreso</em>, than those in the excellent original game. These stages are also packed with all the usual secrets, including hidden Starries and a whole new set of collectible capsule figurines. You can also tackle a new extra-tough Colosseum run, and as you might expect, there's a daunting final challenge waiting for you once you've completed all the Starry Stages.</p>



<p>Granted, there are some things missing from this DLC. There are no new regular copy abilities or Treasure Road challenge stages here, but then again, this isn't a full sequel. For an extra 20 dollars you're getting a solid 4 to 5 hours of additional content, and those who want to 100 percent everything can always go back for second helpings. </p>

<p><strong>An Early Switch 2 Super Star</strong></p>



<p>Kirby and the Forgotten Land + Star-Crossed World is the first Nintendo Switch 2 Edition upgrade I can fully, unequivocally recommend. The game's technical update wows and the new Star-Crossed World content is inventive, fun, and easily worth the $20 premium on its own. Between this Switch 2 update and the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>, fans of Nintendo's pink puffball are eating hearty this year.</p>



<p>Kirby and the Forgotten Land Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World launches on August 28. Those who already own the Switch version of Kirby and the Forgotten Land can upgrade for $20 or you can buy the original game and upgrade together for $80.</p>

            <p>A group of current and former Microsoft employees have staged a sit-in protest in the office of company president Brad Smith over the use of Azure and generative AI technologies by the Israeli military during their on-going bombardment of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/766324/microsoft-building-34-lockdown-protesters-brad-smith-office">The Verge</a>, the protestors belonged to the No Azure for Apartheid activist group, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/on-the-eve-of-gamescom-microsoft-workers-occupy-the-xbox-companys-campus-in-protest-at-dealings-with-the-israeli-military">continues to petition Microsoft</a> to terminate all of their contracts with the Israeli government and military. Microsoft president Brad Smith claimed in a subsequent press briefing that the group of protestors consisted of seven people, with two being current Microsoft staff, and were removed from the office by Redmond police.</p>
<p>No Azure for Apartheid organizer and former Microsoft employee Abdo Mohamed confirmed to The Verge that Microsoft staffers Riki Fameli and Anna Hattle were part of the protest, alongside former staff Vaniya Agrawal, Hossam Nasr, and Joe Lopez.</p>
<p>Following the protest, Smith staged a press briefing in his office, declaring that Microsoft are "committed to ensuring [their] human rights principles and contractual terms of service are upheld in the Middle East." "When seven folks do as they did today, storm a building, occupy an office, lock other people out of the office, plant listening devices — even in crude form, in the form of telephones, cellphones hidden under couches and behind books — that’s not ok. When they’re asked to leave and they refused, that’s not ok," the exec said. Smith complaining about the planting of listening devices seems rather ironic, given that Microsoft stand accused of collaborating with Israeli military efforts to keep Palestinians under surveillance.</p>

<p>When asked whether the two current Microsoft workers who were part of the sit-in, which was livestreamed on Twitch, will face any internal disciplinary measures for doing so, Smith said the following:</p>
<blockquote>We'll take a look. I think one or two of them may have also been arrested last week. So, if somebody's been arrested twice, that's a situation that is not standard employee conduct I think it's fair to say. I don't think it would be regarded as standard employee conduct by any of the places where you [gestures to media present] work, [or] frankly any of the places where anybody works.</blockquote>
<p>Earlier in the briefing, Smith addressed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-equipped-israels-indiscriminate-palestinian-surveillance-operation-with-azure-cloud-tech-claims-report">The Guardian's recent report</a> about Microsoft's Azure cloud platform being used in the surveillance of Palestinians by Israel, saying that Microsoft are investigating the report's allegations. "We are working every day to get to the bottom of what’s going on, and we will," he said.</p><p>He also touched on Microsoft having contacted the FBI in April this year, with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-26/microsoft-asked-fbi-for-help-with-israel-gaza-protests?embedded-checkout=true">Bloomberg</a> (paywalled) reporting that the company had asked the body to provide information on pro-Palestinian protests that might target Microsoft. The exec said he'd first heard about this last week, and subsequently cited "one of our security folks" as having sent the email to the "local FBI office", claiming that it was a more general inquiry about "disruptions" the FBI could see potentially being planned in the Seattle area.</p>
<p>This latest protest comes as groups like the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bds-calls-for-boycott-of-microsoft-and-xbox-gaming-products-over-alleged-israeli-military-connections">Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement</a> continue to call for people to boycott Microsoft and Xbox products over the company's relationship with the Israeli miliary, with unionised staff at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a> developers Arkane Studios recently having <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/arkane-studios-union-publishes-open-letter-to-microsoft-demanding-a-stop-to-israeli-support">voiced their support</a> for both the BDS boycott and No Azure for Apartheid's efforts.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Helldivers 2 has seen a fresh surge in the push to spread democracy around the universe following a long-awaited Xbox launch, which came alongside a boost in players on Steam.</p>



<p>Initially released on PlayStation 5 and PC, Sony made the big move to push the title onto Xbox Series X|S on August 26, marking a historic moment with the first time a Sony first-party exclusive made the jump to Microsoft. As part of the launch, a huge collab was added with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-halo-odst-legendary-warbond-price-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo ODST Legendary Warbond</a>.</p>



<p>Though it was expected that the servers would be flooded with new players on Xbox, the release also led to a huge boost on Steam to secure the highest concurrent totals in over a year.</p>

<figure><figcaption>A big boost. Credit to Arrowhead Game Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>Data from <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/553850/charts/#3y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SteamDB</a> shows the total number of concurrent players on Steam on August 26 hit 167,795, the highest amount since April 2024—which came just before a huge drop following an account-linking controversy.</p>



<p>The numbers are higher than the peaks seen after both the Omens of Tyranny and Heart of Democracy updates, showing that the impact of the Xbox launch spreads beyond just one platform.</p>



<p>Players have seemingly not been put off by the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-helldivers-2-have-cross-progression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lack of cross-progression</a> in the title, with the crossplay support allowing new players on Xbox to join up with friends on PlayStation 5 and PC.</p>



<p>Steam numbers usually peak at the weekend too, so Helldivers 2 could see another boost in the coming days in the first weekend following the launch on Xbox. Following that, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-into-the-unjust-launches-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fresh update lands next week</a>, adding more content to the game.</p>

			<p>Despite having been out for well over a year, players are still making some interesting discoveries in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth highlighting the amazing depth of its combat system which is sadly left unexplored due to the game's generally low difficulty level.</p>



<p>Over the past few days, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@2052brad">Brad Man</a> shared on YouTube two videos highlighting the hidden properties of Tifa's Overpower ability and Red XIII's Crescent Claws and Reaper Touch. The hidden properties of Overpower, in particular, can completely shake up combat, allowing Tifa and the rest of the party to interrupt and launch in the air even heavier enemies, resulting in a more satisfying experience. As such, it's really weird how the game doesn't provide any information on these mechanics, ultimately ending up reinforcing the wrong idea that some have regarding what is, in my opinion, one of the best combat systems seen in modern role-playing games.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>As mentioned above, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth was originally released on PlayStation 5 on February 29 2024, and was ported one year later on PC. Although plenty of mods have been released on PC to improve the experience and introduce <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-new-mod-requested-feature/">features and mechanics</a> not available in the vanilla version of the game, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is a game that's more than worthy experiencing, as Kai highlighted in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">review</a>.</p>



<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide. With Final Fantasy VII Remake hitting the Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X|S soon, there's little doubt the rest of the trilogy will eventually make its way onto every modern gaming platform at some point.</p>

<p>Hell is Us is a brand-new action game headed up by Rogue Factor and supported by Nacon. It’s launching in a busy 2025 period and competing against some real AAA brutes. Nevertheless, if you’re hyped for it, let’s check out the Hell is Us release date and announced start times.</p>



<p>You take the reins of Rémi in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hell-is-us-release-date-confirmed-at-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hell is Us</a>. You fight Hollow Walkers, and the supernatural gameplay and storytelling are a major part of the game’s fabric. It leans into the ‘punishing’ aspect of combat, but from what I’ve seen so far, it looks to be infinitely rewarding. With 2025 building up to a stacked climax, Hell is Us has got its work cut out.</p>



<p>I’ve got everything you need to know about Hell is Us’ release date, and start times for major time zones. </p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-hell-is-us-coming-out">When is Hell is Us Coming Out?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Slice and dice. Credit to Nacon</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Rogue Factor’s Hell is Us is scheduled to release on September 4 across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</strong></p>



<p>As I’ve said, September 2025 is a crazy one for gaming releases. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-release-date-explained-start-times-release-date-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Borderlands 4</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-release-date-and-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dying Light: The Beast</a> are just some of the blockbuster launches on the way.</p>



<p>A new IP like Hell is Us is going to have a tough time competing. But if you’re into your action games, chances are this supersedes other releases anyway!</p>



<h2 id="h-hell-is-us-start-times-amp-early-access-launch-information">Hell is Us Start Times &amp; Early Access Launch Information</h2>



<p><strong>We believe Hell is Us Standard Edition goes live at 1 AM PDT on September 4, and early access starts 72 hours ahead of time on September 1.</strong></p>



<p>There’s an early access incentive for Hell is Us. If you choose to do this, you essentially jump the queue by three days. This does require you to shell out even more cash for the Deluxe Edition, though. It all depends on how keen you are for Hell is Us and its release date.</p>



<p>While you contemplate this, here are the release date and start time details across key US time zones, the United Kingdom, and Australia—thanks to the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/EP6665-PPSA09259_00-HIU0000000000000" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Store</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/imagine-dragons-interview-last-flag/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/interview-imagine-dragons%E2%80%99-dan-mac-reynolds-talk-%E2%80%98last-flag%E2%80%99-their-upcoming-video-game.1281564/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>At one point or another, you’ve probably heard an Imagine Dragons song. From “Believer” to “Thunder” to “Radioactive,” the American pop-rock band’s music has dominated the world since 2008 thanks to its catchy beats and powerful lyrics. Their songs have been featured in movies, TV shows, adverts, and even video games. But now, Imagine Dragons brothers, Mac Reynolds, the band’s manager, and Dan Reynolds, lead singer, are taking their creative minds to create their own video game dubbed “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/last-flag-limited-time-steam-demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Last Flag</a>“.</p>



<p>Development of Last Flag started sometime in 2020 under the brothers’ newly founded development studio Night Street Games.</p>



<p>Speaking with both Dan and Mac Reynolds, I wanted to know more about this newfound venture, what inspired Last Flag, and where they’d like to take Night Street Games in the future. But first, I was curious about why the brothers wanted to develop a game based on the Capture the Flag game mode and the inspiration behind it. </p>



<p>Mac Reynolds tells me, “The game is actually inspired by real-life capture the&nbsp;flag, which we played a lot as kids. Although we loved the CTF game modes in Unreal Tournament, Quake, and a ton of other games – none of them had that core element of “hide your&nbsp;flag&nbsp;anywhere you want.” There’s something freeing about that component that makes every game different and brings in a little more psychology when you’re sneaking around the map trying to put yourself in the enemy team’s shoes. As soon as we started down that path in development, we knew there was something special and different about it. Since then, it’s been all about how we capture that in a game loop that feels super replayable and fun as a team.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><strong>One of the characters is a Boy Scout, which makes sense because of the game’s inspiration. But what’s the story behind the other characters we see?</strong></p>



<p>Dan Reynolds says, “Each of the contestants has their own reason for auditioning for the show. Some of them are more obvious, but others you really have to dig around as a player to discover. Julius, for example, is a bounty hunter turned author who is looking to promote his new book. Alejandro, our soldier, is trying to draw attention to his sister, who went missing when they were younger. He wears her guitar on his back in hopes she’ll see him on TV and keep her hopes alive. Some people may have more nefarious reasons for being there…”</p>

<p><strong>I believe the game started development around 2020? How did you go from an idea to actually making the game, and have there been any unforeseen challenges during development?</strong></p>



<p>Mac says, “Making your first game is a little like making your first album – you spend a lot of time in blue sky territory just thinking and planning and tinkering before things start taking shape.&nbsp; You never get that luxury for your second game or album, so we tried to stay unboxed in our ideas for as long as we could.&nbsp; It started with conversations Dan and I had, and then sketches, and even songs and animations Dan made that started to flesh things out.&nbsp; We tried everything from isometric views to fog of war before we found what felt like the right embodiment of all these ideas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There have been plenty of challenges in the dev process.&nbsp; One of these was figuring out how to take something a little chaotic, though lots of fun (hiding the flag anywhere), and give it enough of an objective framework that it doesn’t just feel like luck if you happen on the other flag.&nbsp; A lot of brainstorms with the team and particularly Matthew Berger (our incredible Game Director) led us to the idea of radar towers and other elements which tamed that chaos JUST enough.”</p>



<p><strong>[For Dan] What’s this entire process for you been like compared to writing music? I’ve heard you’re something of a programmer yourself – have you implemented any of those skills into the game?</strong></p>



<p>“I usually write from a pretty vulnerable and autobiographical place, so it was a nice change to just focus on the world of Last Flag and this whole 70s universe when working on the music. It was a pretty collaborative process with myself, Dave Lowmiller (our audio lead who also is in a metal band and did sound for Battlefield), and Grammy-nominated producer JT Daly. A ton of real instruments and time-period-appropriate recording techniques were used. We’re having a lot of fun.</p>



<p>I started taking programming classes online years ago, and it’s really become my outlet when I’m not on stage. I’ve gotten pretty decent at prototyping ideas in Unity, and when we first started Last Flag, that was really our jumping off point until we were able to grow the incredible team of devs we have today.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><strong>Now that Last Flag is getting nearer to completion, are the creative juices flowing for some other ideas and the next venture for Night Street Games?</strong></p>



<div><p>Mac says, “Our team has already been pitching ideas for game two to each other, as well as exciting places to take Last Flag in the future. But for now, we’re really trying to focus our creative energy on listening to feedback from our players and never allowing ourselves to feel too comfortable in thinking we know exactly what the perfect version of this game will be. We learn something every day from them, and have plenty of ideas to cultivate and incorporate into the game before we can let our foot off the gas.”</p><p>Dan tells me, “We definitely want to be a multi-game studio, but we know that means doing this first one right. This isn’t a side project for us, so we try to keep a long-term perspective on how we make this first game. We want to be doing this for a very long time.”</p></div>

			<p>When Paradox Interactive <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-october-21-lasombra-toreador-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that two of the clans available in Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, Lasombra and Toreador, would be locked behind a day-one DLC, Shadows and Silk (or the purchase of the Premium Edition), it was not hard at all to imagine a community uproar. </p>



<p>That is indeed exactly what happened. After a few days of mulling, it seems like Paradox is willing to make some fixes to that, as reported by Community Manager DebbieElla on the official Discord channel.</p>



<p><em>We are listening to your feedback about the Lasombra and Toreador clan access, and we're making adjustments ahead of Launch to reflect this.<br>We will share more information about what this means as soon as possible. In the meantime, please join us tomorrow on Twitch at 17:00 CEST, where we'll be showing off more of the game!</em></p>



<p>We'll have to wait some more time to learn exactly what Paradox plans to do to allow Bloodlines 2 players to select Lasombra or Toreador as Phyre's vampire clan without having to get the $21.99 Shadows and Silk DLC. </p>



<p>I recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-pre-gamescom-2025-hands-on-a-tasty-morsel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got my hands on a Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 demo</a> before Gamescom 2025, but there's more content coming from Gamescom itself, so stay tuned. Meanwhile, here's a quote that sums up my first impressions of the game:</p>



<p><em>There was much cause to worry about Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, especially after such a highly anticipated RPG sequel was given to a developer with no prior experience crafting roleplaying games. From the little taste I played, though, I think the folks at The Chinese Room have done well in most regards. It may not turn out to be a spectacular masterpiece like The Witcher 3 or Elden Ring, but I reckon it is likely to be a solid and fun action RPG with a great neo-noir story, at least based on the intriguing premise seen in this demo.</em></p>

<p>Marvel Rivals’ next big event is on the horizon, providing a huge boost to Chrono Tokens earned to help you surge through any owned Battle Passes, and we’ve got all the details.</p>



<p>In the Marvel Rivals Chrono-Storm event, weekly missions, challenges, and season missions provide 2x Chrono Tokens when completed, providing up to 2000 extra, a perfect boost to complete the current Battle Pass ahead of the start of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-marvel-rivals-season-4-release-exact-release-date-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 4</a>.</p>



<p>As any owned Battle Passes are permanent though, it’s the perfect opportunity to catch up on previous seasons you might not have finished, but be prepared, as the event is only for a limited time.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-the-marvel-rivals-chrono-storm-event-start">When Does The Marvel Rivals Chrono-Storm Event Start?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Coming soon. Image via NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Marvel Rivals Chrono-Storm Event kicks off at 2am PT on August 28, landing just in time for the weekend.</strong></p>



<p>With the start of the event right around the corner, I highly recommend pausing any grinds you have going to complete challenges and saving them for the event start. This way, you can benefit from the bonus Chrono Tokens that will be distributed.</p>



<p>Of course, if you have a long list of challenges to complete, you may as well crack on, as the amount of bonus tokens you can earn is capped at 2000.</p>



<p>Here’s when the Chrono-Storm event begins in time zones across the world.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Chrono-Storm Event Start Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">02:00 – Aug. 28</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">04:00 – Aug. 28</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">05:00 – Aug. 28</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">British Summer Time (BST)</td><td data-align="center">09:00 – Aug. 28</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Standard Time (AEST)</td><td data-align="center">19:00 – Aug. 28</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-when-does-the-marvel-rivals-chrono-storm-event-end">When Does The Marvel Rivals Chrono-Storm Event End?</h2>



<p><strong>The Chrono-Storm Event in Marvel Rivals is confirmed to end at 1:59am PT on September 12, ahead of the launch of the newest season.</strong></p>



<p>Though details for Season 4 are not confirmed, a <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1960364095133061345" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post on social media</a> announcing the end date for the event drops a huge hint that this is when downtime ahead of the launch will commence.</p>



<p>To make it easier for you to prepare, here’s when the Chrono-Storm event ends in time zones across the world.</p>

<p>All will be made available on "new platforms"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Atari and Ubisoft <a href="https://businesswire.com/news/home/20250826081788/en/Atari-Announces-Strategic-IP-Agreement-With-Ubisoft-To-Revive-Five-Acclaimed-Titles">have announced</a> that Atari has acquired the IP rights to five Ubisoft-published games with a view to make them available on new platforms.</p>
<p>The games in question are <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps2/cold_fear">Cold Fear</a>, <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-360/i_am_alive">I Am Alive</a>, <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-360/child_of_eden">Child of Eden</a>, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/grow_home">Grow Home</a>, and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/grow_up">Grow Up</a>. Notably, none of these have ever seen a release on Nintendo consoles, but with Atari's focus on multi-platform titles in recent years, it's reasonable to assume that some (if not all) may gain new life on the Switch and/or Switch 2.</p>
<p>Not only that, but Atari has expressed its desire to "expand and evolve" all five games, though what this might look like is unclear for the time being.</p>
<p>Child of Eden in particular is a good find for Atari, in our eyes. Originally released in 2011 for the Xbox 360 and PS3, the musical rail-shooter was directed by Tetsuya Mizuguchi, who has since gone on to achieve remarkable success with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tetris_effect_connected">Tetris Effect</a>, and currently serves as the executive producer for <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/lumines_arise">Lumines Arise</a>, due for release on the PS5 later this year.</p>
<p>The game also included optional motion controls via Microsoft's Kinect and the PlayStation Move, so we reckon this would translate quite easily to the Switch Joy-Con. Though it is playable with standard controls, of course.</p>
<p>Aside from that, we're also quite fond of Grow Home and Grow Up; two adorable platform titles with minimal, low poly visuals. We're definitely excited to see what Atari can do with these games, and indeed all five titles, in the months and years ahead.</p>

With the likes of Beavis and Butt-Head and American Dad hitting the game this year shortly after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-dutys-ongoing-420-obsession-sparks-debate-among-fans-some-have-had-enough-others-really-want-that-seth-rogen-skin"><u>weed-obsessed bundles starring Seth Rogen</u></a>, some fans have said they’ve had enough of what they call the 'Fortnite-ification' of their beloved Call of Duty, and have pleaded with publisher Activision to return to its mil-sim roots.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Enter Battlefield 6, a game EA is pitching as having a “gritty realism” aesthetic. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/with-call-of-dutys-obsession-with-goofy-skins-firmly-entrenched-battlefield-6-dev-commits-to-gritty-realism-i-dont-think-it-needs-nicki-minaj">Developer DICE has indicated it has no plans to release crossover skins that would break the aesthetic Battlefield 6 is going for</a>, and promised the developers were listening to fan feedback.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.dbltap.com/news/battlefield-6-will-avoid-goofy-crossover-skins" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DBLTAP</a>, Battlefield 6 design director Shashank Uchil doubled down on EA's commitment to grounded realism, and even pointed to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nicki-minaj-is-call-of-duty-season-5-snoop-dogg"><u>Call of Duty's infamous Nicki Minaj skin</u></a> as something Battlefield 6 doesn't need.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It has to be grounded," he said. "That is what BF3 and BF4 was — it was all soldiers, on the ground. It’s going to be like this,” Uchil said, pointing at the key art featuring soldiers in soldier gear looking out over a wartorn New York City.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He added: “I don’t think it needs Nicki Minaj. Let’s keep it real, keep it grounded.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With Battlefield 6 set to go up against Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 later this year, Activision has now issued a <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/08/call-of-duty-community-update-august-2025" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">community update</a> that indicates it’s ready to make significant changes to the types of bundles it releases for the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But there’s perhaps even more significant news here: Activision confirmed that Operators, Operator Skins, and Weapons from Black Ops 6 will no longer carry forward into Black Ops 7.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes as a big surprise to players who had expected content they’d bought for Black Ops 6 to carry forward, as it has done with previous entries, and given Black Ops 7 directly follows last year’s Black Ops 6. Explaining the decision, Activision said Black Ops 7 “needs to feel authentic to Call of Duty and its setting.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That is why Black Ops 6 Operator and Weapon content will not carry forward to Black Ops 7. Double XP tokens and GobbleGums will still carry forward, because we recognize your time and progression are important.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">(This change applies only to Black Ops 7. Call of Duty: Warzone is not affected, and all your Black Ops 6 content stays usable there.)</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Warzone's Bloke Biter Shark Skin Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What impact will this have on Black Ops 7? It means that at launch, at least, you won’t see all those goofy skins running around Multiplayer. It sounds like Multiplayer will look like Black Ops 7, at least at the start of things.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Where will Activision go from here? Its community post suggests it’s ready to tone down the goofiness for Black Ops 7’s entire lifecycle, although it’s worth pointing out we don’t have specifics here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We know there’s been a lot of conversation recently about the identity of Call of Duty,” Activision said. “Some of you have said we’ve drifted from what made Call of Duty unique in the first place: immersive, intense, visceral and in many ways grounded. That feedback hits home, and we take it seriously. We hear you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Throughout development, Treyarch and Raven’s north star has been to deliver a spiritual successor to Black Ops 2 while taking some big swings. You’ll see it across Black Ops 7’s Multiplayer, Zombies, Co-Op Campaign (including Endgame), and even Dead Ops Arcade 4.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Over the years, we’ve had a variety of games and experiences that fans have enjoyed from the Modern Warfare series to the Black Ops series and beyond. Today, we wanted to share with you some of the ways we’re approaching things with Black Ops 7.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision went on to say that Black Ops 7 bundles and items “will be crafted to fit the Black Ops identity.” “We hear the feedback,” the mega publisher added. “We need to deliver a better balance toward the immersive, core Call of Duty experience.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If Activision truly leaves goofy skins behind, then it’s leaving a lot of money on the table. The company wouldn’t release Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle and Nicki Minaj skins if they didn’t make loads of money. Perhaps, with the release of Battlefield 6, Activision felt it had reached a tipping point, and it needed to take drastic action to respond.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whatever the case, reaction is a mix of shock, excitement, and frustration. There’s shock that Activision actually canceled carry forward for Black Ops 7, excitement about getting back to Call of Duty’s roots, but for some a frustration that the time and in many cases money spent earning cosmetic items in recent months die with Black Ops 6.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also a spot of scepticism from some within the Call of Duty community, who suspect Activision may hold the line for Black Ops 7's first few months of life, but eventually retreat into goofy skin territory once again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision ended its community update by promising more information on all aspects of Black Ops 7 soon. Battlefield 6 comes out October 10, with Black Ops 7 following in November. It’s going to be really interesting to see how this all shakes out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We've got plenty more Black Ops 7 coverage coming out of gamescom 2025, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-dev-responds-to-lazy-accusations-and-battlefield-6-lets-all-have-fun">Treyarch shrugging off "lazy" accusations and the threat of Battlefield 6</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

Gans previously stated the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/return-to-silent-hill-film-will-be-faithful-adaptation-of-silent-hill-2-distributor-promises">film would be a faithful adaptation of Konami's beloved Silent Hill 2</a>. "I am delighted to partner with Cineverse, which has shown a genuine understanding of fanship," said Gans back in May. "Return to Silent Hill is an adaptation created out of deep respect for a true masterpiece of a game, Konami's iconic Silent Hill 2. I hope fans will enjoy and be fulfilled with the experience this new film has to offer."

The trailer, above, is only 40 seconds long, but it does show a suitably foggy environment, that iconic shot of James looking in the mirror, and of course some scary nurses. Best of all, it ends with a first look at Pyramid Head.

<p>
Return to Silent Hill is set for release in January 2026.
</p>
<p>
It's all part of a resurgence of Konami's horror franchise, following the success last year of Bloober's Silent Hill 2 remake. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a> will be released next month - and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-f-producer-insists-it-is-an-action-horror-game-and-any-comparisons-to-a-soulslike-are-disingenuous">no, it's not a Soulslike</a>.

			<p>You would not necessarily think of skiing being a base for a rhythm game, but the team at Buffalo Buffalo have. The studio’s roguelike rhythm game Fresh Tracks takes up to the fictional location Norwyn, where you have been tasked by the Mythic Koda to reunite the rest of the Mythics to defeat Mar, the Mythic of Terror. To do that you need to complete the story songs of the Mythics, and defeat enemies while skiing to the rhythm.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fresh Tracks- Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w0Aud7LV_-k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Fresh Tracks has you skiing to the rhythm of the music, collecting whispers which are notes from the songs and also a currency to buy temporary charms. You also have to avoid the obstacles that crop up, meaning you need to switch from rail to rail, and you have to use your weapon to clear the path of enemies. Along with switching rails, you will also have to lean to avoid objects and hop to clear floor traps and gaps as well.</p>


<p>Each weapon has its own rhythmic power as well, but you start with Vygor which replenishes health when it is charged up. Other weapons are unlocked through completing story songs and getting more lore. Fresh Tracks has a good approach to its lore as it incorporates each of the Mythics into the tale. Mythics will accompany tell you stories of Norwyn, but each of the Mythics has new information for each lore. So, if you want the full picture you need to complete runs with each of the Mythics. Mythics also have their own boons that can help on a run, as well as their own favourite types of song. For example, Koda makes boss battles easier and prefers the more poppy songs. Mythics are only unlocked when you beat them in a boss battle.</p>


<p>As Fresh Tracks is a roguelike, you will be able to choose, the skis, weapon, and Mythic you equip. Skis offer different advantages from granting temporary invulnerability to discounts in the merchants store. Merchants are available during runs to buy temporary charms from, with these adding a bit more life or more charges to your weapon. Charms can also be picked up when you select which track to tackle on your run, but all charms disappear when a run ends. When your run does come to an end you will be sent to the start of the map, but shortcuts do get unlocked after you beat a boss, but these shortcuts are locked to the Mythic you had equipped when you defeated the boss. When you have unlocked a shortcut you will have to decide between taking that or visiting the merchant to get charms, so you may avoid a boss battle but you may also miss out on a charm that could prove to give you an advantage.</p>
<p>Fresh Tracks has original songs composed for it which cover a few genres including pop, dance, rock, rap, and even a bit of theatre. There are some bangers among the 28 tracks with Endlos, Ekkos, and Make Your Mark being my favourites. The first two could be in the charts, they are that catchy. As you go through the story you do not know which songs will be presented to you on the path, apart from the boss battles, and each one of these has a difficulty setting from easy all the way to having to be perfect. Again, on a run you do not know what difficulties you will face, though there are options which will remove either the easy or most difficult track difficulties.</p>

<p>Playing through Fresh Tracks is like playing through a story concept album, as the lyrics to the songs also link to the lore. The visuals of Fresh Tracks are decent with some levels looking fantastic, like Stille Mountain and The Kor. I did enjoy the voice acting too and the way each of the Mythics had their distinct styles while telling the stories that make up the lore, as well as each having their own music preferences.</p>
<p>While I do enjoy the music, some tracks show up a lot and that means the game can feel repetitive as the same levels keep appearing on runs. I’m sorry, but The Blizzard did start to wear out its welcome after a while. There also seemed to be some minor input delay on rare occasions, but it didn’t show up often.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Fresh Tracks gives a fresh take on the rhythm genre and I really the story set up and some of the songs, which are legit great pieces of music that could be released as singles. It is a game that will attract those who want to perfect runs, and the challenge it provides is tough but worth the entertainment.	</p></div>

<figure><a title="Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds - Pac-Man" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2946e1834820f/sonic-racing-crossworlds-pac-man.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: SEGA</em></figcaption></figure><p>We are quickly closing in on 2025' <em>next</em> high-profile arcade racer, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a>, and SEGA keeps adding more and more characters to its rapidly expanding roster. Those loaded up on the game's Season Pass and DLC will see the likes of Steve and Alex from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">Minecraft</a>, SpongeBob SquarePants and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/persona_5_royal">Persona 5</a>'s Joker all heading to the track, but none of them will be able to utter a word. It's a strange omission, but Takashi Iizuka has been on hand to explain why all the wider characters are keeping quiet.</p>
<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/iizuka-explains-how-sonic-racing-crossworlds-dlc-guest-characters-were-chosen-and-why-they-dont-have-voices/">Destructoid</a>, the Sonic Team head explained that there's already a lot of interaction between the racers, so asking the wider studios to <em>also</em> add voice lines for each character would have expanded "the scope of the review that we’ll have to ask the external companies," and potentially made things "difficult" in the process.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067vjxpgw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>On top of that, Iizuka claimed that the development team was keen to focus their attention on the Sonic characters first and foremost, ensuring that the interactions between them were nailed down before worrying about the wider cast. "They really had to focus, put all the effort into Sonic," he explained, "and they had to give up on the non-Sonic characters".</p>
<p>Now sure, we won't be all that torn up about not hearing dialogue from PAC-MAN and a Minecraft Creeper, but don't you think it'll look a <em>little</em> weird to have the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami">Yakuza</a>'s Kasuga Ichiban silent for the whole race? We'll just have to wait and see.</p>
<p>SEGA is kicking off a CrossWorlds <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/psa-sonic-racing-crossworlds-open-network-test-for-switch-announced">Open Network Test</a> on Switch later this week (from 29th August - 1st September), and pre-loads are now live. This'll be your last chance to check the game out before it launches on 25th September, with nine courses and seven different CrossWorlds at your pre-release disposal. Let's hope that our screams of excitement are loud enough to drown out the uncanny silence from select racers.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Helldivers 2 x Halo: ODST - Legendary Warbond Gameplay Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>For now, thankfully the crash is not too difficult to get around. To avoid any possibility of this crash ocurring, Arrowhead recommends equipping the ODST from the loadout instead of the armory.</p><p>The studio has also notified of another issue impacting Warbonds--Helldivers 2's equivalent of a battle pass. Arrowhead has warned that players may be unable to spend Super Credits while they are holding onto a Warbond Token. Until the issue is resolved, players will have to choose between saving their Warbond Token for a future Premium Warbond and holding off on purchases, or using it on a current Warbond they don't own yet and spending Super Credits as usual.</p><p>The Halo: ODST Warbond was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/helldivers-2-odst-crossover-will-add-4-iconic-halo-weapons-and-more/2900-6890/" data-ref-id="2900-6890">Helldivers 2's first "Legendary Warbond,"</a> rewarding players with more items than a standard one--including four weapons, two armor sets, and plenty more. The Halo crossover dropped on the same day as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-xbox-trade-exclusives-today-with-helldivers-on-xbox-and-gears-on-ps5/1100-6534266/" data-ref-id="1100-6534266">Helldivers 2's Xbox launch</a>, a combination that has brought a lot of new and returning players to the game.</p>

                <p> <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/path-of-exile-2/" data-ref-id="5000-504817">Path of Exile 2</a>'s next update The Third Edict is set to add a whole new act, region, and plenty of other new content to the game--but it's the new asynchronous trading system that really has players excited. Grinding Gear Games has shown off the system's new in-game market browser, just days out from the update drop.</p><p>GGG explains in the video that the in-game trade browser wasn't quite ready to be shown off when the studio did its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-path-of-exile-2-huge-third-edict-update-looks-to-deal-with-every-problem-upsetting-fans/1100-6534132/" data-ref-id="1100-6534132">initial content drop</a> for The Third Edict, but it's now ready to go. The in-game market browser works similarly to PoE 2's official trade website, allowing players to search for items they want in the player-to-player trade system. The new asynchronous trade system means the seller no longer has to be online for a trade to take place--buyers can now purchase it directly from the seller's Hideout.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q972GGaOMBM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Q972GGaOMBM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The seemingly simple feature brings a major quality-of-life improvement for PoE 2 players, simplifying what was previously a fairly involved, multi-step process into an easier task. The asynchronous trade system is set to come to the original Path of Exile in future too, provided its integration into PoE 2 goes smoothly.</p><p>As a whole, The Third Edict update is full of quality-of-life changes, with the GGG devs setting out to take "a good crack at solving every problem people are currently unhappy about," as game director Johnathan Rogers <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-path-of-exile-2-huge-third-edict-update-looks-to-deal-with-every-problem-upsetting-fans/1100-6534132/" data-ref-id="1100-6534132">said in a Q&amp;A</a>. The update also includes the addition of Act IV, new endgame content, a sprint ability, PoE 2's first league, and heaps more.</p><p>Despite the massive update, Path of Exile 2 doesn't seem likely to leave early access--or subsequently going free-to-play--anytime soon. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-wont-leave-early-access-in-2025-dont-believe-thats-possible-anymore/1100-6534129/" data-ref-id="1100-6534129">developers have said</a> it doesn't look possible for PoE 2 to get to a full release in 2025, and how long it remains in early access after that it will depend on the state of the game.</p><p>The Third Edict <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2s-next-major-content-update-the-third-edict-gets-release-date-and-twitch-drops/1100-6533991/" data-ref-id="1100-6533991">releases on August 29</a>, and PoE 2 will have a free access weekend from August 29 to September 1 along with the update's launch.</p>

                <p>In case you needed any more confirmation that Criterion is now all in on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield</a>, the Burnout creator and long-time Need For Speed custodian is now officially branded as "A Battlefield Studio"--leaving the future of the Need For Speed franchise in question.</p><p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/burnout-creator-need-for-speed-developer-criterion-renamed-battlefield-studio/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Gamer</a>, a user from the Need For Speed subreddit spotted Criterion's new official subtitle on EA's website, where "A Battlefield Studio" now appears under the usual studio logo. Members of the subreddit are understandably not too optimistic about what the change means for the Need For Speed franchise, which is still ostensibly under Criterion's purview.</p><p>The rebranding is really just confirming what we already knew--in February this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/need-for-speed-isnt-dead-but-criterion-is-focused-on-road-ahead-with-battlefield/1100-6529198/" data-ref-id="1100-6529198">EA announced</a> that Criterion was being moved under the Battlefield Studios banner in order to support the single-player experience for Battlefield 6. At the same time, it was announced that development on the next Need For Speed title was being paused--though EA has promised that the franchise is not dead.</p><p>Criterion has worked on Need for Speed titles since 2010's Hot Pursuit, and has been the main developer on the series since 2020, when control was shifted back from Ghost Games. The studio released Need for Speed Unbound in 2022, but in subsequent years a majority of the staff were assigned to support the Battlefield series following restructuring within EA.</p><p>While EA has said that it plans to bring the Need for Speed franchise back in the future, it's unclear whether future games will still be developed by Criterion, now that it's been designated under Battlefield Studios. It's no surprise that Battlefield 6 is the focus of EA's attention at present, with the much-hyped shooter due to release on October 10, 2025.</p>

"We're here to take the energy and chaos that made Acclaim unforgettable and channel it into something new.

This is about owning our story and moving it into a future that feels bold, energetic, and completely fresh."</p><p>When the new version of Acclaim was announced last March, the company promised to "support indie developers and reignite classic franchises."

            <p>
If you were hoping for more <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> - and wondered why it has such a long name - director Guillaume Broche has said the game is "not the end" of the series.
</p>
<p>
Broche spoke with YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZEP5kjw-w4&amp;t=321s">MrMattyPlays</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-director-teases-potential-sequel-dlc/">TheGamer</a>) about what's next for studio Sandfall Interactive.
</p>
<p>
"Clair Obscur is the franchise name," said Broche. "Expedition 33 is one of the stories that we want to tell in this franchise. Exactly what it will look like and what the concept will be is still too soon to announce, but what is sure is that this is not the end of the Clair Obscur franchise."
</p>

<p>
A new game will be on the way, then, though likely not a direct sequel. Broche stated later in the interview he prefers to forget previous work when he "writes sequels".
</p>
<p>
And, as has been noted in previous interviews, Broche was heavily influenced by the Final Fantasy series. So if Clair Obscur is the franchise name, it's likely whatever is next will be completely different to Expedition 33 - just like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s series. 
</p>
<p>
But will it still feature the fantastic turn-based action combat? It's certainly proven popular, so let's hope so!
</p>
<p>
Previously the studio stated it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-developer-exploring-new-content-accessibility-features-and-all-sorts-of-bits-and-bobs-for-future-game-updates">exploring new content and accessibility features</a>, as well as "all sorts of bits and bobs". Further, Broche noted a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-on-switch-2-could-be-interesting-says-director">Switch 2 version of the game</a> "could be interesting". So there's likely more to come from Sandfall besides a possible sequel.

            <p>Well, there you go. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a> publisher Paradox look like they might be sticking a stake in their rather unpopular plans to sell two of the game's vampire clans as paid day-one DLC. I say "might be" because nothing specific's been committed to yet, beyond some nebulous making of "adjustments ahead of launch" in response to fan feedback on the gating-off of Lasombra and Toreador bloodsuckers.</p>
<p>In case you missed the announcement of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-sticks-two-bloodsucker-clans-including-the-sexy-one-behind-paid-day-one-dlc">these two clans being packed away</a> into the £18.69/€21.99/$21.99 coffin of Bloodlines' Shadows and Silk DLC pack, it came right as the long-in-the-works RPG got a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-finally-has-a-full-release-date-plus-a-bloody-good-new-trailer">fresh trailer and what should hopefully be its final release date</a>. The only ways to get the clans were to buy that pack on top of the base game, or splash out £74.99/€89.99/$89.99 for the premium edition.</p>

<p>On the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/554580174864384001/1115895131573342279/1410005970746347633">Bloodlines 2 Discord</a> last night, World of Darkness community developer DebbieElla emerged from the shadows with what looks like the first inkling of an impending change. "We are listening to your feedback about the Lasombra and Toreador clan access, and we’re making adjustments ahead of launch to reflect this," she wrote. "We will share more information about what this means as soon as possible."</p>
<p>That was it, aside from a line promoting a livestream on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/worldofdarkness">World of Darkness' Twitch channel</a> at 4PM BST / 5PM CEST / 11AM ET today, August 27th, which I only mention here in case it turns out to be the place Paradox share that promised info.</p>

<p>Up to this announcement, Paradox and Bloodlines developers The Chinese Room had been sticking by the call to paywall the two clans. Our James <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-chinese-room-defend-bloodlines-2s-paywalled-vampire-clans-we-have-been-expanding-it-from-where-we-originally-planned-to-land-it">grilled them about it at Gamescom</a>, and the response was along the lines of the Toreador and Lasombra being additional work on top of The Chinese Room's original plans for the game, so therefore fine to charge extra for.</p><p>"We've made a huge amount of changes over that time, based on that cycle, if you like, including a massive amount of story content and features and all the rest of it. So we have been expanding it from where we originally planned to land it, I think, constantly, and Paradox have been really good when we go, or when the clients go, or when Paradox go: 'We should add a bit more here. Let's push the date back.' As you know, the date has pushed back, but that has been to fatten it out into something that we feel does land where the players want it," Bloodlines 2 narrative director Ian Thomas told us.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, project design director Jey Hicks insisted that this 'extra' stuff is "not all, like, just fluff that we're chucking in". We'll have to see what these promised "adjustments" look like, but a complete u-turn would rightly miff folks who've already pre-ordered the premium edition because it includes these extra clans. We'll let you know when Paradox reveal exactly how they're pulling their feet out of all this deathhound doo-doo.</p>
