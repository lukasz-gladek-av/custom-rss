			<p>Leaks suggested that EA Sports FC 25 was around the corner, and they have since been confirmed. EA unveiled the brand new iteration of the franchise shortly after Spain won the Euros Championship. The full announcement for the latest football game will be fully revealed on July 17.</p>
<p>The details for this game are slim, but they will all be announced on July 17. For now, we know of the star-studded cast gracing the front cover of EA Sports FC 25 Ultimate Edition. It includes football legends such as David Beckham, Zinedine Zidane, Gianluigi Buffon, Aitana Bonmati, and Jude Bellingham. You can expect to see Jude Bellingham's face on the front cover for the Standard Edition of the game.</p>
<p>According to the internet leaks, the game will be released sometime in September 2024. It will be on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and PC. This allows football fans to play it across various platforms should they want to get stuck in the game.</p>
<p>These leaks come from <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ea-sports-fc-25-voici-la-date-prevue-de-lannonce-du-jeu-et-les-stars-de-couverture-de-son-edition-ultimate-55459">well-known leakier billbil-kun</a>, after creating a report on Dealabs to announce the release date of EA Sports FC 25. Since the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fifa-series-entirely-removed-from-digtal-storefronts-ahead-of-ea-sports-fc-24/">end of EA's partnership with Fifa</a>, this is the second iteration in the franchise carrying the brand new name of the series.</p>
<p>Within these internet leaks, they have suggested that the Ultimate Edition of EA Sports FC 25 will cost a hefty price tag of $99.99, with the Standard Edition costing a slightly more reasonable $69.99. Considering these games are very similar and don't have many changes between each iteration, it is a shock to see that this game will cost this much.</p>
<p>According to the leaks, the official release date for the game will be September 27, 2024. The owners of the Ultimate Edition will benefit from a 7-day Early Access period before the full release of the Standard Edition.</p>
<p>This is the only information we have on the upcoming EA Sports FC 25, but there will be an update once EA has officially revealed its plans for the game on July 17.</p>

He would later appear in the nature-doc spin-off series <em>Wildboyz </em>alongside Chris Pontius as well as in numerous <em>Jackass </em>films, too. These days, he’s got a popular podcast and YouTube channel and has been sober for over a decade. But back at the height of <em>Jackass</em>-mania—the mid ‘00s—Steve-O was offered a few video game gigs. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamespot.com/videos/steve-o-has-never-played-the-jackass-game-star-players/2300-6464586/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/steve-o-has-never-played-the-jackass-game-star-players/2300-6464586/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In a new video interview with <em>Gamespot</em></a></span>, Steve-O confessed to long thinking games were a waste of time. However, he’s come around on them now, realizing that everyone has their own ways of having fun. In the interview, he also revealed that he doesn’t play many games (though he does enjoy <em>Angry Birds</em>) even though he’s appeared in three different video games. </p><p>First, he appeared in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nfl-2k5-says-new-england-wins-a-super-bowl-shootout-5882210&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nfl-2k5-says-new-england-wins-a-super-bowl-shootout-5882210"><em>NFL 2K5</em></a></span> in 2005, a beloved PS2-era football game that was so good (and cheap) that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://grantland.com/features/tom-bissell-making-madden-nfl/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://grantland.com/features/tom-bissell-making-madden-nfl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it scared EA</a></span> into exclusively locking up the NFL license for its <em>Madden </em>franchise to avoid competition. According to Steve-O, he was paid “exactly $100,000” to appear as one of five celebrity coaches you could challenge to a digital football match. The other celebs? Jamie Kennedy, David Arquette, Funkmaster Flex, and Carmen Electra. </p><p>Next, Steve-O was featured in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/tony-hawk-s-underground-2&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/tony-hawk-s-underground-2"><em>Tony Hawk’s Underground 2</em></a></span>. While he was basically just a voice and a photo in<em> NFL 2K5</em>, in <em>THUG2 </em>he was a secret skater that you could find and unlock, with his own in-game character model, exclusive tricks, and even a unique mechanical bull that he used instead of a skateboard. Funnily enough though, while he was a bigger part of <em>THUG2</em>, Steve-O says Activision only paid him $5,000 to appear in the game. </p><p>Finally, in 2007 <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/jackass-forever-the-game-ps2-review-psp-mtv-knoxville-1848487592&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/jackass-forever-the-game-ps2-review-psp-mtv-knoxville-1848487592">Steve-O appeared as one of the main characters in <em>Jackass: The Game</em></a></span>. According to the stunt performer, he hadn’t played the game until <em>Gamespot </em>set up a PS2 and let him try it out during the interview. As for how much he got paid to appear in <em>Jackass: The Game</em>, Steve-O doesn’t say, but implied it was far less than <em>NFL 2K5. </em></p><p>“Jackass was <em>really </em>good at not paying us that much,” explained Steve-O.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Players can also dive and spin around in a full 360 degrees, and the movement system will be active across the entire game, including campaign, multiplayer, and Zombies.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Campaign Teaser | Xbox Games Showcase 2024</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Call of Duty's podcast includes an interview with Treyarch's associate design director, Matt Scronce, who goes more in-depth about this new movement system. The developer explains that Black Ops 6's movement gives people the opportunity to live out the action hero fantasy, but says that players can still play and "hold their own" against opponents utilizing omnidirectional movement if they choose not to use the advanced movement features and prefer standard Call of Duty movement.</p><p dir="ltr">"We've been very conscious of making sure that we're not widening the skill gap too much," Scronce says. "If you just want to slow down, [the movement] you can and still be successful, you just may not look as cool. And that's fine."</p><p dir="ltr">Players won't be forced to partake in the action-style diving and sliding, but they won't be able to toggle off the new movement feature either. "Omnimovement is a core foundational feature that cannot be disabled by a player," Scronce confirms.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to omnidirectional movement, Black Ops 6 also features Treyarch's new "intelligent movement" system, which aims to reduce how many buttons or keys players need to press to perform movements.</p><p dir="ltr">Scrone says that the intelligent movement feature is optional, so players will be able to toggle this feature on and off as they choose. The developer reveals this feature will be off by default, but players can toggle it on to have access to three settings with tunable options for each, with the goal to reduce key presses for actions like sprinting and mantling cover.</p><p dir="ltr">Activision also used this podcast to reveal the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-beta-dates-revealed/1100-6524972/">beta dates for Black Ops 6</a>, and with such drastic looking changes to Call of Duty's movement, this will be a good opportunity for players to test out the new movement mechanics before launch. Here's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-beta-dates-how-to-get-in/1100-6524124/" data-ref-id="1100-6524124">everything you need to know to access the beta</a>.</p><p>Additional Black Ops 6 details will be provided during Activision's Call of Duty: Next event on August 28.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/huntered-two-player-ttrpg-about-monsters-and-hunters-fully-funded-on-kickstarter-in-3<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new indie TTRPG project has gone live on Kickstarter. It is called <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/meghanlynnftw/hunter-ed"><em>HUNT(er/ed)</em></a>, a TTRPG about monsters and those that hunt them. It has several prolific indie designers attached, and it was fully funded three hours after going live.</p>
<h2>The <em>HUNT(er/ed)</em> Kickstarter Campaign</h2>
<p>According to its campaign page, <em>HUNT(er/ed)</em> is a two-player experience of pursuit, determination, and what it means to be a monster. The game is played with a standard deck of cards and a pair of six-sided dice. The TTRPG will be a 32-page zine printed by Mixam and feature cover art by the Ennie-award-winning illustrator Sonya Henar.</p>

The other is the alienated and hated monster, determined to survive by any means necessary.</p>
<p>Once characters are created, players take turns rolling dice. Rolling doubles causes you to progress one step further to your goal: freedom or capture. When this happens, both players are provided a roleplaying prompt, letting them act out the events and memories of that section of the hunt. Will the hunter slay the monster, or will some common ground be found?.</p>
<p><em>HUNT(er/ed</em>) was written and designed by Meghan Cross and Dillin Apelyan. Apelyan, aka Superdillin on social media, is a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/crit-awards-no-longer-attending-gencon-2024" rel="noopener" target="_blank">CRIT Award</a>-winning designer and AP player. Their work includes the AP <em>The Atomless</em>, Dropout's <em>Adventuring Academy</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-beacon-membership-service-announced" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Critical Role's</a> Critter Hug, and writing contributions to <em>City of Mist: Local Legends</em> and <em>Capers: Cyberpunk</em>.</p>
<p>As for Cross, this is her third tabletop Kickstarter campaign. She specializes in GMless and Solo RPG experiences, such as the post-apocalyptic garden tending game <em>Weeds in the Waste</em> and a game about places of power and guardians, aptly named <em>Sanctuary &amp; Sentinel</em>. She has also been featured on WebDM, Party of One, and Protean City Comics.</p>
<p>The pledge tiers of <em>HUNT(er/ed)</em> are as follows:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Digital Edition for $15:</strong> A PDF copy of the game distributed through itch.io</li>
<li><strong>Physical Edition for $20:</strong> A physical copy of the game</li>
<li><strong>Physical &amp; PDF for $25:</strong> A PDF and physical copy</li>
<li><strong>Deluxe Edition for $125 (Only 10 Available)</strong>: A PDF, physical copy, and a custom engraved hook and loop game</li>
</ul><p>At time of writing, the <em>HUNT(er/ed)</em> Kickstarter campaign has raised <span><span>$3,106, surpassing its initial funding goal of $2,500. It also unlocks a stretch goal: a custom deck of roleplaying prompt cards. The deck of cards will be included in all Deluxe Edition pledges and can be bought as a separate add-on for $12. The campaign concludes August 14.</span></span></p>

            <p>
Tove Jansson's beloved Moomins are heading to Journey developer ThatGameCompany's acclaimed free-to-play "social adventure" Sky: Children of the Light this autumn, and there's more news on its upcoming animated series Sky: The Two Embers, which is now due next year.
</p>
<p>
Sky: Children of the Light, which initially launched for iOS back in 2019 before expanding to PC and consoles, is a sort of leisurely puzzle adventure set among the different realms of a beautiful kingdom in the clouds - and it's all built around a gently collaborative multiplayer core designed to encourage "compassion, friendship, and altruism".
</p>
<p>
It's also a game that follows a live-service-style seasonal model, with those seasons occasionally featuring collaborations with other properties and people. Sky: Children of the Light has, for instance, already run seasons based on The Little Prince, animated movie A Deer of Nine Colours, and even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/journey-devs-sky-children-of-light-launching-musical-experience-with-frozen-2-star">music artist Aurora</a>, and we now know the Moomins are up next.

<figcaption>Sky x Moomin teaser trailer.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEN0OYYjGYM" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
As announced during <a href="https://www.thatskygame.com/news/skyfest-2024-an-anniversary-celebration-like-no-other/">this year's SkyFest</a>, a two-week long community celebration running from 12th-26th July, the Moomins are coming to Sky: Children of the Light in their own "rich, narrative-driven" season this autumn. It'll see players journeying to Moominvalley to experience an adaptation of the 1962 Moomin tale The Invisible Child, with a new story chapter releasing each week throughout the season.
</p>
<p>
"This new season also celebrates the importance of being true to yourself and overcoming obstacles from childhood, ThatGameCompany says in an accompanying press release. "It uses subtle yet reflective storytelling to express the cross-cultural themes of the Moomin stories, such as family, friendship, nature, and introspection." 
</p>
<p>
While ThatGameCompany isn't saying much more about its Moomin collaboration right now, it <em>has</em> offered another look at Sky: Children of the Light's upcoming dialogue-free animated series, Sky: The Two Embers. Initially announced back in 2022, the series is now due to arrive next year, and Sky: The Children of Light will host two seasons based on its twin stories - that of the Dawn and Dusk Ember - in 2025. ThatGameCompany's announcement was accompanied by a new trailer and a  several-minutes-long clip from the first episode, but the only footage of both right now comes from an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVZmYDYK6t0">in-game SkyFest 2024 stream</a>.
</p>
<p>
Expect to hear more on the above as release dates draw nearer, and if you haven't yet dabbled in Sky: Children of the Light, it's available for iOS, Android, Switch, PlayStation, and PC.

Murray is leading a small team of developers to create an RPG where the map is the size of Earth, because why under-promise and over-deliver when you can pitch players the moon, or something even bigger than that? “I’m convinced it’s either <em>Light No Fire</em> or the biggest <em>No Man’s Sky</em> update ever,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/CharOnTwitch/status/1812849903636304196&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/CharOnTwitch/status/1812849903636304196" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a></span> streamer CharOnTwitch. “Never seen Sean hype something this much before.”</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2719590/Light_No_Fire/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2719590/Light_No_Fire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Light No Fire </em>has a Steam page</a></span> but we haven’t heard anything else about it since the announcement. It’s possible Murray is psyching fans out for a new trailer or some other reveal about the game, perhaps with a deeper dive planned for Gamescom next month. August also marks the eighth anniversary of <em>No Man’s Sky</em>’s original launch, the perfect time to completely reinvent the game again with something entirely new. Maybe players are finally going to get those long-requested custom space stations. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Built with Hall Effect sticks to resist drift, a slightly reworked form factor for improved ergonomics, and a built-in Share button that works with Xbox Series X, the controller is a nice blend of retro style and modern convenience.</span></p></div>                      </div><p>The Dutchess also has a 3.5mm jack and bumpers that serve as Black and White buttons from the original Xbox pad (which are still awkwardly placed beneath the face buttons). These controllers aren't wireless, but they do come with a 10-foot detachable braided USB-C cable for a low-latency play experience. The Duchess Wired Controller is available in black or white, both of which are officially licensed by Xbox.</p><p>The Duchess isn't the first retro Xbox controller designed by Hyperkin, as the brand is also responsible for the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hyperkin-Controller-Windows-Anniversary-Limited-x/dp/B09FYJF6XY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Duke Wired Controller</a>. This one is modeled after the original, ultra-bulky Xbox controller that was the predecessor to the Xbox Controller S. If you want to add it to your collection, you'll find it on sale at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hyperkin-Controller-Windows-Anniversary-Limited-x/dp/B09FYJF6XY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon</a> for just $60 (down from $90).</p><p>Hyperkin's Duke was quite popular when it first launched, and we wouldn't be surprised if the Hyperkin Duchess Wired Controller follows in its footsteps. So if you want to ensure you can add it to your collection this summer, be sure to land a preorder while it's in stock.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dualsense-edge-ps5-controller-deal-walmart-prime-day-2024/1100-6524765/">PS5 DualSense Edge Controller Gets First Major Discount Ahead Of Prime Day</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-is-the-best-nintendo-switch-lite-deal-weve-ever-seen/1100-6522718/">This Is The Best Nintendo Switch Lite Deal We've Ever Seen</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/walmart-deals-prime-day-2024/2900-5577/">Huge Walmart Sale Features Incredible Gaming Deals Ahead Of Prime Day</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More Best Early Prime Day Deals to Shop Now Links (4)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/meta-quest-3-vr-headset-is-on-sale-for-its-best-price-yet-at-walmart/1100-6524762/">Meta Quest 3 Deal Restocked At Amazon, No Longer Available At Other Retailers</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/9-nintendo-switch-exclusives-are-35-ahead-of-prime-day/1100-6524715/">Grab Super Mario, Zelda, And More Nintendo Switch Exclusives For $35 While You Can</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-joy-con-super-mario-party-bundle-deal/1100-6518931/">Super Mario Party Joy-Con Bundle Is Cheaper Than The Controllers By Themselves</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grab-a-pair-of-apple-airpods-for-only-69-at-amazon-before-this-very-nice-deal-sells-out/1100-6519008/">Grab A Pair Of Apple AirPods For Only $69 At Amazon Before This Very Nice Deal Sells Out</a></li>   </ul> </div>

However, new players may find themselves wondering what each of the different symbols mean, or how to tell what quests are worth their time. This guide will explain the three main types of quests, as well as how to tell if a quest can or can’t be completed.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196790" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Why Everybody Hates This Dragon's Dogma 2 NPC" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="142" data-playlist="196790,196742,196411" data-current="196790"><div><p>Why Everybody Hates This Dragon's Dogma 2 NPC</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196790/196790_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196790/196790_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196790/196790_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196790/196790_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22347.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h31597"><a id="msq"></a>Main Scenario Quests</h2><figure id="" data-id="ca2e4e255d5044d6db3e007bf30b2da0" data-recommend-id="image://ca2e4e255d5044d6db3e007bf30b2da0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A player character accepts a main story quest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A player character accepts a main story quest." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ca2e4e255d5044d6db3e007bf30b2da0" data-recommend-id="image://ca2e4e255d5044d6db3e007bf30b2da0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A player character accepts a main story quest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As the name implies, Main Scenario Quests (or MSQs) are the primary quests players will undertake. They can be identified by a circle with what appears to be flame or smoke trailing from them (it is actually a meteor, a reference to the meteor which struck Eorzea shortly before the game rebooted as <em>A Realm Reborn</em> in 2013).<strong> </strong><br></p><p><strong>MSQs drive the story forward and completion of them is usually required to gain access to important features such as jobs and new areas</strong>. You should prioritize these if you’re looking for more diverse and exciting gameplay while also providing a larger focus on story than other quests. <br></p><h2 id="h31598"><a id="fq"></a>Feature Quests</h2><figure id="" data-id="dda75f37b2eeeb0cfc1bbdaca2440b27" data-recommend-id="image://dda75f37b2eeeb0cfc1bbdaca2440b27" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A player character cheers as they accept a Feature Quest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A player character cheers as they accept a Feature Quest." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="dda75f37b2eeeb0cfc1bbdaca2440b27" data-recommend-id="image://dda75f37b2eeeb0cfc1bbdaca2440b27" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A player character cheers as they accept a Feature Quest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Feature Quests are quests that unlock content in the game. Their icon features a blue background with a yellow exclamation mark in the center and a plus sign on the left side.. If MSQs are the primary focus of a new player, Feature Quests should be a close second. Not only are these quests required to upgrade your Class to a Job, but <strong>some of them are a great way to learn how to best play your role </strong>and will provide rewards specifically suited to your Job. They also have their own unique storylines which can be just as deep and engrossing as those experienced in the MSQ.</p><p>It is important to remember where your Class’ Guild is early on as once you reach a certain point in the MSQ, you will unlock various Feature Quests from the guilds around your starting area. Before you know it, you’ll have a map full of blue quest markers. Generally, you should focus on your starting Class’ Guild, but it is worth checking in with new Feature Quests that open up to see what they offer At this point in the game, it may be a little early to start focusing on a combat Job different from your main one as you are still early in your starting Class, but some of these Feature Quests may allow you to start leveling a crafting or gathering role, called Disciples of the Hand and Disciples of the Land respectively. There is no harm in picking these up now if you’re interested in them as they can help build your character without stalling progress on your primary Job. It can also be fun to take on a different Job’s Feature Quest to mix up the usual gameplay loop. </p><h2 id="h31599"><a id="sq"></a>Side Quests</h2><figure id="" data-id="434bcd9ec6bc82d6bdadefbd99a06daf" data-recommend-id="image://434bcd9ec6bc82d6bdadefbd99a06daf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A player character accepts a side quest on busy street." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A player character accepts a side quest on busy street." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="434bcd9ec6bc82d6bdadefbd99a06daf" data-recommend-id="image://434bcd9ec6bc82d6bdadefbd99a06daf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A player character accepts a side quest on busy street." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You will see a ridiculous amount of Side Quests while playing <em>FF14</em>. This can be a completionist’s nightmare. Like other games, these quests normally tell their own standalone stories and have little to no impact on the rest of the game. They also tend to provide less valuable rewards for completion. On the flip side, they can be completed fairly quickly and are almost always simple fetch quests, or have you go kill a certain amount of a specific monster. </p><p><strong>Due to their simplicity, new players should not spend too much time on Side Quests as they can easily lead to burnout</strong>. But don’t dismiss them entirely. Some of the first Side Quests you’ll encounter teach basic game mechanics such as emoting or interacting with objects, but you can most likely learn these without picking up the quest to do so. The best method to handle Side Quests is to pick up any you see, but then prioritize your focus on MSQs and Feature Quests. </p><p>If MSQ’s and Feature Quests take you to an area in close proximity to the Side Quest location, it doesn’t hurt to stop in, kill some monsters and continue on your way. Then, next time you are in the area where the sidequest was offered, turn it in and enjoy a small amount of EXP and some clutter removed from your quest log. </p><h2 id="h31600"><a id="gqm"></a>Green Quest Markers</h2><figure id="" data-id="66b16c3e862160448417dfb8f72b1549" data-recommend-id="image://66b16c3e862160448417dfb8f72b1549" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A player character turns in a completed quest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A player character turns in a completed quest." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="66b16c3e862160448417dfb8f72b1549" data-recommend-id="image://66b16c3e862160448417dfb8f72b1549" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A player character turns in a completed quest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Unlike the other Quests listed, Green Quests markers don’t have a specific name. But if you see one, you should go to it immediately as it indicates the final step in a quest you’re currently on. These markers will appear for MSQs, Feature Quests or Side Quests. A Green Marker means it’s time to get ready for some EXP and other rewards.

Alternatively, you might see a Red Quest Marker if you haven’t proceeded far enough into a given quest to unlock it. </p><p>Normally, you’ll first see these for Feature Quests for various guilds that haven’t opened up yet as you haven’t moved the story far enough yet. Of course, there is no harm in interacting with Red Quest Markers as they will simply describe the reason they are preventing progress.In some instances, you might just be missing an item that can be easily obtained. For example, one early quest asks you to turn in a High Potion to complete it. Until you’ve obtained a High Potion, this quest will have a Red Quest Marker. Once you collect a High Potion, you’ll see the Red Quest Marker turn into a shiny Green one, which we just learned are our favorites.</p><hr><p><em>FF14</em>’s many different kinds of quests and markers might seem a little confusing at first, but once you spend enough time with the game, they’ll become second nature. Just remember that MSQs should always be completed since they offer some of the best moments of the game. Feature Quests should be done if they interest the player as they provide some of the better rewards and storylines. Side Quests should be saved for when they can be finished at your leisure, but don’t need to take priority. You can obviously interact with the game in any manner you see fit, but by prioritizing the best content <em>FF14 </em>has to offer, you can prevent burnout and instead sink yourself into the more satisfying content of the riveting world of Eorzea.</p><p>.<br></p><h2 id="h31602"><a id=""></a><br></h2></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Grab a copy of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-review">Overwatch</a> off some dusty GameStop shelf and rub it under the musky armpit of the Guardians of the Galaxy’s Peter Quill and you might have something close to the feeling of Concord. As competitive hero shooters go, this sci-fi contender from Sony plays it quite safe, complete with immediately charming characters immaculately rendered in gobsmackingly beautiful cutscenes and ability-based PvP combat that never addresses why those characters are fighting one another when they’re clearly allies in said cutscenes. But just because it doesn’t offer much in the way of innovation doesn’t mean Concord isn’t extremely fun to play. I still have lots more to see when it launches properly next month, but with 16 characters and four familiar game modes available in its preorder beta this past weekend, the vast majority of the 10+ hours I’ve spent with it so far have been a sweaty, gun-toting good time.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Concord Beta Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>You and your squad will form a five-person team of super-powered characters, each with their own unique strengths, weaknesses, and special abilities, and then bring them to bear against an opposing team in a variety of formulaic game modes. Those include a standard deathmatch mode, a “Kill Confirmed” mode called Trophy Hunt, an attack-and-defend mode called Cargo Run, and a zone control mode called Clash Point – none of which possess even the slightest hint of novelty. But being overly familiar isn’t necessarily a bad thing if you’ve got best-in-class gunplay and awesome characters with compelling powers to back it up, and boy, Concord has got both of those down pat.</p><p>Concord sagely keeps its weapon selection very slim, with just two options given to each character by default and no way to customize that – but the upshot there is that every single weapon feels incredibly responsive and finely tuned, and no two characters have weapons that feel at all similar. The arena-controlling old lady, Duchess, wields a submachine gun that’s devastating at close range, while the sneaky and tactical Vale mostly relies on a long-range sniper rifle to take out enemies from afar. Not everything seems perfectly balanced – I, for one, think most things should probably die when they take a sniper rifle shot to the head, and it’s a bit weird that the character that uses a slow-loading missile launcher as her main weapon doesn’t do more damage with it – but they all feel really good to use, and that means I’ve been having fun even when it feels like something needs tweaking here and there.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Every weapon feels responsive and the abilities are largely fantastic.</p></div><p>Similarly, the abilities that complement those weapons are fantastic, diverse, have very generous cooldowns, completely changing the way combat plays out depending on which character you’re playing as. The floating, fireball-chucking Haymar can blind opponents for a period of time and make them pay for standing in the same spot too long, while the rampaging ogre, Star Child, can close distances quickly with his charging attack and smash the ground to do heavy damage around him. Not all characters feel quite as original, like how Teo is the world’s most generic soldier and comes equipped with a smoke grenade and cluster grenade as his two powers, but those bland options are few and far between. Learning each character, using their abilities to counter the team comp of your opponents, and juggling the madness on the battlefield with top-notch gunplay was just as fun in my first match as it was in my 30th, and I certainly can’t say I’ve felt that way about most hero shooters I spend time with.</p><p>One of the few novel twists Concord brings to the genre is the way its competitive playlist works. Unlike the casual playlist where you can play whichever character you please (so long as someone else hasn’t already selected it), in competitive you cleverly aren’t allowed to select the same character again if you win a round while using them. Since matches go to best of seven rounds, that means winning one will push you to get outside of your comfort zone and use a minimum of four different characters. Not only is this a neat way to force people to master more than just one or two options, it also encourages communication with your team between rounds to ensure you’ve got proper coverage to play out whatever strategy you’re trying to pull off as your options get slimmer.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The other interesting wrinkle Concord adds to the formula is character variants: Slightly different versions of existing characters that come with a unique perk and an altered appearance, and which can be unlocked by completing specific objectives during matches. For example, the gunslinger Lennox can normally reload his weapon by dodging, while the variant you can unlock for him loses that ability, but gets more ammo for all his weapons instead. The five variants available for each character so far offer mostly minor changes like this, but they definitely add a meaningful thing to chase that provides more options in combat. Perhaps more importantly, they also give you the opportunity to fudge the numbers a bit in the competitive playlist, since variants count as separate characters on your crew, and therefore, let you play as the same characters in multiple rounds.</p><p>I also just love that Concord is chock full of goofy terms in its “How To Play” tutorial section, like how it tells you if certain game modes are likely to be sweaty by assigning them a “Sweatstrum” rating, or how it explains you can recharge your abilities with “Sloops,” AKA “Skill Loops.” There might not be much of a story yet, but this game’s got charm coming out of its Martian ears.</p><p>There’s still more I haven’t been able to play in this early beta version, like the two game modes that remain locked for now, but Concord is already shaping up to be a heavyweight hero shooter I could easily see competing with the genre’s giants. It doesn’t seem like it will bring much new to the table, and that’s a bit of a bummer considering we’ve already played great games very similar to this one before, but I’m heartened by what I’ve seen so far and am looking forward to playing a whole lot more when it launches next month.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3>TieGuyTravis' All-Time Sweaty Shooters</h3><p>If you like to push your skill for the kill to the limits, here are Travis Northup's top recommendations.</p></div></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Once Human 5 Things We Wish We Knew</p>
      </div>
<p>As for a paid DLC sharing--encompassing the battle pass as well as cosmetics, furniture, and weapon skins--the studio <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2139460/view/6145807877737890043" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a> it's also working on its implementation. As it stands, the feature "has taken longer to implement than expected." It's now set to become available during the maintenance on the morning of August 1.</p><p>The developers recommend players to "refrain from making purchases for multiple characters" until the feature becomes available. It's worth noting that the battle pass level will not be shared across all characters on a single account. Any cosmetic rewards from the paid tiers of the battle pass, however, can be used by multiple characters.</p><p>If you already purchased the in-game currency Crystgin on multiple characters, the amount will be accumulated. For multiple cosmetic items or battle passes, you'll receive a Crystgin refund for the duplicates.</p><p>Lastly, the team is aware of waiting queues. The server player limit, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2139460/view/6145807877738837219" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">according</a> to Starry Studio, is due to the increase in the number of players exceeding previous expectations. "When too many players are on the same server, we risk losing server data," the developer said, while acknowledging that it's working on improving the limit on each server.</p><p>For now, expect a patch update on July 18 that will improve the queuing experience to "offer compensation for those who spend too long waiting in a queue." All the while, Starry Studio said it has "personnel taking shifts and working 24 hours a day to make new server available," as well as an upcoming invitation code feature slated for August, which will allow you to invite players to join your server even if it's at capacity.</p><p>Once Human launched on July 9 as a free-to-play open-world survival game set in a post-apocalyptic future. It features mechanics such as a sanity meter, which is affected by eating polluted food and drinking dirty water, amongst other conditions. There are around 100 gun blueprints to craft, as well as an in-depth building feature to create your own settlements.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-the-most-complex-fully-realized-companions-weve-ever-crafted-says-bioware/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In a new interview <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive/2024/07/15/a-deep-dive-into-biowares-companion-design-philosophy-in-dragon-age-the" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published today by Game Informer</a>, Dragon Age: The Veilguard Game Director Corinne Busche reckons the upcoming game has the most complex and fully realized companions ever crafted by BioWare.</p>
<p>That's a tall order, given the studio's legendary track of roleplaying games, which includes Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter Nights, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, Mass Effect, and Dragon Age itself. Busche has an explanation, though:</p>
<p><em>They're complicated, they have complicated problems, and that's what's interesting. As much as I adore the companions and the journeys I've been on with them in past Dragon Age titles – previously, it feels like companions are going on an adventure with me, the main character, whether it's the Hero of Ferelden or Hawke, you name it. But in Dragon Age: The Veilguard, in many ways, the companions are so fleshed out that it feels as though I'm going on a journey with them. I'm exploring how they think and feel; I'm helping them through their problems. We're working through their unique character arcs. They feel like my dear friends, and I absolutely adore them.</em></p>
<p><em>We've really moved into a place where you can have the highest of highs, and it can be colorful, it can be optimistic, but also, you can have the lowest of lows where it gets gritty, it gets painful, it gets quite dark. But throughout it all, there is a sense of optimism. And it creates this delightful throughline throughout the game.</em></p>
<p><em>[...] In our base of operations this time, our player hub, the Lighthouse, each of the companions has their own room. And what I love about it is it becomes a reflection of who they are. The more time you spend with them, as the game develops as you work through their arc, their room and their personalities will evolve and flourish and become more complete as they trust you more and you understand them better.</em></p>
<p><em>[...] The companions also develop romantically and I'm not just talking about with the main character Rook; I'm talking about each other. There are moments in the game where two of our companions fell in love with each other and I had to make some pretty challenging choices as it related to the quest we're on. And it broke my heart, it absolutely did. I would say, as you're adventuring with them, as you're returning to the Lighthouse and getting to know them – all these decisions and conversations and things you learn about them – it endears them to you in a way that I honestly haven't experienced before. And sometimes that fills me with joy and sometimes it breaks my heart.</em></p>
<p>As a reminder, Dragon Age: The Veilguard has seven companions (that we know of - BioWare might be hiding something....): the Veil Jumper Elf Mage Bellara Lutara, the Grey Warden Elf Warrior Davrin, the Mourn Watch member Human Mage (Necromancer) Emmrich Volkarin, the Inquisition member Dwarf Rogue Lace Harding, the Antivan Crow Human Rogue Lucanis Dellamorte, the Shadow Dragon Human Mage Neve Gallus, and the Lords of Fortune member Qunari Warrior Taash. All of them <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-features-companions-ability-wheel-for-strategic-combat-romance-has-no-limitations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will be available for romance</a> regardless of your player character's gender and race.</p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard currently has a generic Fall 2024 launch window for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.

It was a prebuild that I used to play <em>Warzone </em>and <em>Overwatch</em> and occasionally stream on Twitch, requiring little from me in terms of setup other than removing some cushioning and plugging the tower in. It’s been nearly two years since I had a gaming PC, though, and my attempts to get back into the swing of things have been frustrating as hell.</p><h2 id="h7332"><a id=""></a><strong>The trials and tribulations of PC gaming</strong></h2><p>A few months ago, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ibuypower.com/?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwkdO0BhDxARIsANkNcrfKsGZ1cssvqVVRej_5dMOTXDK8ykKJvyG56Mij_nkest1BdNzErgkaAq8jEALw_wcB&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ibuypower.com/?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwkdO0BhDxARIsANkNcrfKsGZ1cssvqVVRej_5dMOTXDK8ykKJvyG56Mij_nkest1BdNzErgkaAq8jEALw_wcB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iBUYPOWER</a></span> sent me a prebuilt PC to test/review that required that I install the graphics card in it (a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-budget-4k-ray-tracing-dlss-3-1850327485&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-budget-4k-ray-tracing-dlss-3-1850327485">GeForce RTX 4070)</a></span>. I followed the instructions, lying prone on the floor of my apartment as I unscrewed the brackets that would hold it in place, desperately trying to keep my cat away from all the tiny screws and delicate parts. I watched YouTube tutorials before I even attempted this process, nervous that my clumsy fingers would snap off a delicate (and crucial) plastic tab. When I placed the graphics card in the tower, I heard the telltale click of it slotting into the PCie (peripheral component interconnect express) port, connected the internal power cables, closed everything back up, plugged in all the peripherals and the HDMI cable, and heaved the beast under my desk. </p><figure id="" data-id="ff5de3345ef631e5db00d73acc919066" data-recommend-id="image://ff5de3345ef631e5db00d73acc919066" data-format="jpg" data-width="3024" data-height="4032" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A cat sits on top of a PC tower." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A cat sits on top of a PC tower." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Alyssa Mercante</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ff5de3345ef631e5db00d73acc919066" data-recommend-id="image://ff5de3345ef631e5db00d73acc919066" data-format="jpg" data-width="3024" data-height="4032" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A cat sits on top of a PC tower." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When I turned it on, however, my monitor said there was no signal. I tried other cables. I uninstalled and reinstalled the GPU. Nothing. I figured maybe the monitor, dormant for nearly a year, was the culprit, so I lugged it out into my living room to check if it would display my Xbox Series S. It did, so I lugged it back into my bedroom and tried again. No luck.<br></p><p>To their credit, iBUYPOWER’s rep was kind and responsive, and did their best to help me get the old PC shipped back and send a new one out, though it took a few months to get it all sorted, during which the space I had cleared out for the gaming PC accumulated dust. I assumed the problem was a user error, a reminder that I am woefully inadequate in the world of PC gaming—until the second PC had the same issue. Determined to troubleshoot it, I put out a call for help on social media, and dozens of learned PC gamers came to my aid. One person walked me through every step of installing the card again, with me sending videos and pictures to them to ensure that I had, indeed, done it correctly.<br></p><p>Then, after it <em>still</em> didn’t work, the person helping me noted that this specific rig had a Hyte riser cable connector in, which is just for aesthetics as it allows you to mount your graphics card upright. They suggested that I unplug the Hyte riser cable and slot the GPU on its side in a different PCie port to see if the cable was the issue, not my GPU installation. So I opened the damn thing up again and got to it, my hands shaking as I tried to ensure nothing snapped off in the process. After successfully unplugging the riser cable, I discovered that the “low profile” layout of the case meant the graphics card couldn’t fit in any other slot. Dejected, defeated, and covered in sweat, I boxed the PC up and prepared to send it back again, thanking iBUYPOWER for their time and energy and abandoning my PC gamer dream.</p><figure id="" data-id="94e4815da5f996773b07834f634b80c5" data-recommend-id="image://94e4815da5f996773b07834f634b80c5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The NZXT player three PC." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The NZXT player three PC." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->NZXT</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="94e4815da5f996773b07834f634b80c5" data-recommend-id="image://94e4815da5f996773b07834f634b80c5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The NZXT player three PC." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h7333"><a id=""></a><strong>A PC gaming breakthrough</strong></h2><p>A generous internet friend who lives near me saw me tweeting my PC woes and offered to let me borrow their old tower, informing me when I came to pick it up that all I would need to do was get Windows downloaded onto it. I stood there, sweating on the sidewalk, realizing the new problem I had created for myself: downloading Windows onto a wiped PC required me to get a version of the OS onto a USB drive, which I could then plug into the tower—and the only functioning computer I have at home is a MacBook Air with no USB ports.<br></p><p>Still, I hauled the tower back to my apartment, where I sat on the floor for about half an hour, dissociating, until I had a eureka moment: the iBUYPOWER’s motherboard display port would at least let me use the PC to download Windows onto the flash drive. So, I unboxed the damn thing again, chided my cat for immediately jumping into the box, and set it up in my living room. A few hours and several questions to my PC builder friend later (where do I download Windows, what the hell is Rufus, which boot device do I select), I had Windows running on my friend’s PC.</p><p>Then, after all that work, after all the sweat and frustration, NZXT sent me over their own prebuilt PC, which already had its graphics card installed (I had told them of my installation woes, and how I’d given up on trying any sort of custom work).

Hours upon hours of struggle, months of waiting, and this beautiful thing turned on like a light switch. I think it’s prebuilds or nothing for me, guys. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>There was a chance that Pokemon Ruby and Sapphire could’ve had different names.</p>



<p>According to the latest data, GameFreak considered other Pokemon Ruby and Sapphire color options. Indigo and crimson are the colors that have popped up.</p>



<p>Revealed by Farore.gba and Wobbuu on Twitter, some interesting data regarding Pokemon Ruby and Sapphire has surfaced. The duo were apparently going through the game’s files, where they found mentions of “藍バージョン” and “朱バージョン”, which translate to Indigo Version and Crimson Version. These were the “earlier names” for the Pokemon game before the developers finalized Ruby and Sapphire.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="ja" dir="ltr">Me and <a href="https://twitter.com/Wobbuu?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Wobbuu</a> were looking at some RS files. We found "藍バージョン" and "朱バージョン". Translated as "Indigo Version" and "Crimson Version", they are apparently earlier names for Sapphire Version and Ruby Version. <a href="https://t.co/0nxKRdCcBx">pic.twitter.com/0nxKRdCcBx</a></p>— farore.gba (@KmiE_821) <a href="https://twitter.com/KmiE_821/status/1812286458171908180?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 14, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Farore.gba added that “Indigo” and “Crimson” are unofficial translations by them and not officially assigned by Game Freak. Only 藍 &amp; 朱, shown in the images provided, are definite.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Farore.gba expanded, stating that the first image is from a script file called field_c102.ev (Rustboro’s Grunt flee event), and the second file is cave_d0701s.ev (Mt. Chimney feud between Aqua and Magma). These names were either used as placeholders, or they were genuinely considered as titles for the game.&nbsp;</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Moreover, Farore.gba pointed out that the names Pokemon Ruby and Sapphire were revealed at Festa 2002, which was held in July of that year, and that the final dates were back in October 2002. Whatever the case, Pokemon Indigo and Crimson are still solid options for any of Game Freak’s next instalments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Game Freak released a non-Pokemon RPG <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/game-freak-is-releasing-a-non-pokemon-rpg-this-month/">last month</a>. Also, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gamestop-pokemon-collector-graded-cards/">GameStop was considering </a>getting into the Pokemon Card grading business. Would you have liked Pokemon Ruby and Sapphire to be called Crimson and Indigo, or are you happier with the existing names? Let us know in the comments.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A pre-release dev build of&nbsp;Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2&nbsp;has leaked online and is fully playable.</p>



<p>It’s not entirely clear how the build was leaked, but according to those familiar with the leak, it “was randomly posted on a tracker.” According to those who have been playing the build, it’s around 75GB in size and is fully playable, apart from some missing strings and placeholder assets. The leak also includes server binaries, meaning people can play with friends if they obtain access. </p>



<p><strong><em>We strongly advise you not to download the game due to the risks of hidden malware, etc.</em></strong></p>



<p>Gameplay footage of the game has also started to appear online. You can see some footage below (warning spoilers).</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>







<p>Our research suggests that the build originated on June 20th, 2024, indicating that it is the almost completed version (the game recently was well gold, too).</p>



<p>As for what this means for Focus Entertainment and Saber Interactive is unclear, but we have reached out to both with the opportunity to comment.</p>



<p>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is scheduled to release on September 9, 2024, on the PlayStation, Xbox Series S|X, and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive/2024/07/15/a-deep-dive-into-biowares-companion-design-philosophy-in-dragon-age-the<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>During my visit to BioWare in its Edmonton, Canada, office earlier this year for <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/cover-reveal/2024/06/09/cover-reveal-dragon-age-the-veilguard">the current <em>Game Informer</em> cover story on Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, I heard a sentiment repeated throughout the day from the game's leads: in past Dragon Age games, BioWare stumbled onto great companions, but with Veilguard, it's the first game where the studio feels it purposefully and intentionally created great companions. As such, those companions are key to everything happening in Veilguard.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With such a significant emphasis on these characters, I spoke to some of the game's leads to learn precisely about BioWare's philosophy on companions in Veilguard.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4F3N4Lxw4_Y" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>"No, that is the case," BioWare general manager Gary McKay tells me when I ask if he agrees with the stumbled-onto-greatness sentiment. "I would first start with Dragon Age – each installment in this franchise has been different, so we didn't set out to make a game that was a sequel or the same game as before. We really wanted to do something different and we did push the envelope in a couple of areas, companions being one of them. Once we got knee deep into it, we really realized we had something special with these companions, again, around the motivations, the story arc, and it really started to become the centerpiece for this game."&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The Philosophy Behind Dragon Age: The Veilguard’s Companions</h2>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="9fa5d5a6-68ab-47e1-9360-556c080fef2d" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><p>Game director Corinne Busche agrees, adding that Veilguard's companions are "the most fully realized complex companions we've ever crafted." She also believes they're the Dragon Age series' best. "They're complicated, they have complicated problems, and that's what's interesting," she continues. "As much as I adore the companions and the journeys I've been on with them in past Dragon Age titles – previously, it feels like companions are going on an adventure with me, the main character, whether it's the Hero of Ferelden or Hawke, you name it. But in [Veilguard], in many ways, the companions are so fleshed out that it feels as though I'm going on a journey with them. I'm exploring how they think and feel; I'm helping them through their problems. We're working through their unique character arcs. They feel like my dear friends, and I absolutely adore them."</p>

<p>Busche says these companions participate in the game's darker and more optimistic parts. "We've really moved into a place where you can have the highest of highs, and it can be colorful, it can be optimistic, but also, you can have the lowest of lows where it gets gritty, it gets painful, it gets quite dark. But throughout it all, there is a sense of optimism. And it creates this delightful throughline throughout the game."&nbsp;</p>

<p>When I ask creative director John Epler about BioWare's philosophy behind Veilguard's companions, he reveals a phrase the studio uses: Dragon Age is about characters, not causes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"What that means for us is [...] let's take the Grey Wardens, for example – the Grey Wardens are an interesting faction but by themselves, they don't tell a story, but there are characters within that faction that do," he tells me. "And the same thing with other characters in the story. They represent these factions, they show the face of the other parts of Thedas and of the storytelling we really want to do, which, again, shows Thedas as this large, diverse living world that has things going on when you're not there."</p>

</article><p>Epler says one of BioWare's principles when creating Veilguard was that the world exists even when you – Rook – are not around. There are things, ancient conflicts, grudges, and more, that happen even when Rook isn't participating in them, he says.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"You kind of come in 'in media res' in some of these, so that's where we wanted to go with the companions," he says. "They have stories of their own. Where can Rook come into these stories, and what interesting ways can those stories develop not just based on themselves but also based on Rook's presence within them?"</p>

<p>Dragon Age series art director Matt Rhodes adds that companions are the load-bearing pillars for everything in Veilguard, so "when you're designing them, it's not just designing a character; they're the face for their faction, the face for, in [some cases like Bellara Lutara], an entire area of the world." From his aesthetic-forward part of developing companions in Veilguard as the game's art director, he tells me Veilguard's characters are (hopefully) going to give cosplayers a challenge.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The previous art director had the mindset we should make things easier for [cosplayers], which I think is a misunderstanding of cosplayers," Rhodes says. "We've seen the kind of challenges they're willing to take on, and so we've gone for, in some cases, a level of complexity and detail that I hope a lot of them are excited to rise to the challenge for."&nbsp;</p>

</article><h2>Companions, In And Out Of Combat&nbsp;</h2>

</article><p>Rook's companions in Veilguard have roles both in and out of combat, but since I only saw a few hours of this game (which is sure to be multiple dozens of hours long), I wanted to ask Busche about these roles and how they play out. Here's what I learned:&nbsp;</p>

<h4>In Combat</h4>

<p><strong>Bushce</strong>: "So companions as realized characters, we have to take that premise when we talk about how they show up in combat. These are their own people. They have their own behaviors; they have their own autonomy on the battlefield; they'll pick their own targets. As their plots progress, they'll learn how to use their abilities more competently, and it really feels like you're fighting alongside these realized characters in battle. So I love that, I love the believability of it. It feels like we're all in it together.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"But then when it comes time for the strategy, and the progression I might add, that's where a sense of teamwork comes into play as the leader of this party as Rook. When I open the ability wheel, I almost feel like we're huddling up. We're coming up with a game plan together. I see all the abilities that Harding has, and I see all that Bellara is capable of, and sometimes I'm using vulnerabilities synergistically. Maybe I'm slowing time with Bellara so that I can unleash devastating attacks with Harding, knocking down the enemy, and then me as Rook, rushing in and capitalizing on this setup they've created for me. It is a game about creating this organic sense of teamwork.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Now, there are more explicit synergies as well. We very much have intentional combos where your companions can play off each other, you can queue up abilities between them, and each of those abilities will go off and have their effect. But it results in this massive detonation where you get enhanced effects, debuff the entire battlefield, all because of planning and teamwork. What makes it really cool is you can introduce Rook into that equation as well. One of my favorite things to do is upgrade some of Harding's abilities so she will automatically use some of these abilities that normally I'd have to instruct her to do. And she'll actually set my character up to execute that combo that, again, has that detonation effect."&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CTNwHShylIg" width="640"></iframe></p>

<h4>Outside Combat</h4>

<p><strong>Busche</strong>: "It's one of my favorite topics. I talked about the idea that these are fully realized characters, that they're very authentic and relatable. So outside of combat, what that means is they're going to have their own concerns, fears, distractions, and indeed, even their own sanctuaries, their own personal spaces. In our base of operations this time, our player hub, the Lighthouse, each of the companions has their own room. And what I love about it is it becomes a reflection of who they are. The more time you spend with them, as the game develops as you work through their arc, their room and their personalities will evolve and flourish and become more complete as they trust you more and you understand them better.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"What's interesting, you mentioned romance, the companions also develop romantically and I'm not just talking about with the main character Rook; I'm talking about each other. There are moments in the game where two of our companions fell in love with each other and I had to make some pretty challenging choices as it related to the quest we're on. And it broke my heart, it absolutely did [<strong>Editor's Note</strong>: I get the sense Busche is talking about a specific playthrough of Veilguard here – not a definitive sequence of events for every playthrough].&nbsp;</p>

<p>"So I would say, as you're adventuring with them, as you're returning to the Lighthouse and getting to know them – all these decisions and conversations and things you learn about them – it endears them to you in a way that I honestly haven't experienced before. And sometimes that fills me with joy and sometimes it breaks my heart."&nbsp;</p>
