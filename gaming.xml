            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>Some of the developers who worked on (and are still working on)<a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-assassins-creed-shadows-no-animal-killing-zoo-1851781328"><em> Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></a> hopped into a Reddit AMA to answer fan questions about Ubisoft’s latest entry in its stabby historical fiction franchise. Not all of the questions and answers were revealing, but buried in the AMA were some interesting pieces of information about the lore of <em>Assassin’s Creed,</em> upcoming games in the series, more updates coming for <em>Shadows</em>, and a confirmation on some features that <em>won’t</em> be added in future updates.</p> <p>Here are 10(ish) things we learned about<em> Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> from the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1mo3rmj/hi_were_simon_andr%C3%A9_and_luc_developers_on/">August 12 AMA on the Assassin’s Creed subreddit</a>.</p> <h2><strong>The war between Assassins and Templars will continue</strong></h2> <p>When a fan asked if players can expect more content about the franchise’s classic conflict between Assassins and Templars, <em>AC Shadows</em> level design director Luc had this to say:</p> <blockquote><p>“The Assassins vs. Templars conflict has always been a core pillar of <em>Assassin’s Creed.</em> With <em>Shadows</em>, we wanted to properly set our protagonist in the setting before expanding on the Assassins vs. Templars. Now that it’s done on the main game, we scratched the surface with <a href="https://youtu.be/FUrqLJdXO7E?si=u7RxcL6GmFSvoomX">the <em>Critical Role</em> story drop</a>, and you can expect more deep dive in this conflict in the near future.”</p></blockquote> <h2><strong>Why Ubisoft Didn’t Include The Modern-Day Storyline</strong></h2> <p>Another user asked where Basim was and if his modern-day storyline, which began in <em>Assassin’s Creed Valhalla</em>, will ever return or if Ubisoft had moved on. Once again, Luc replied to this question and explained why it was missing and teased more to come in the future:</p>

 <blockquote><p>“We have complex new characters that were introduced in <em>Shadows</em> that we didn’t feel there would have been enough spotlight for Basim as well. With <em>AC Shadows</em> we are putting in place the first stone of new means to deliver the Modern Day story line with the Animus HUB. That is not the end of it, and we are listening to your feedback. While Modern Day is not the main focus of the story we tell with <em>Shadows</em>, it remains important for our community, so you can expect it to be expanded at some point, in some fashion…”</p></blockquote> <h2><b>The Team Isn’t Retconning<em> Assassin’s Creed</em> Lore</b></h2> <p>A seeming expert in<em> Assassin’s Creed</em> lore asked a bunch of long questions about the franchise’s universe and how they were worried that parts of it from older games, such as Isu artifacts, were being ignored or even retconned completely. Again, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1mo3rmj/comment/n8bab6m/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Luc swooped in to provide an extended answer you can read here,</a> but this bit is his confirmation that the team isn’t erasing <em>AC</em> lore; they just aren’t always including it in games unless it makes sense.</p> <blockquote><p>“The <em>AC</em> lore is very complex and keeps expanding as we are creating new games. We are not retconning what we have done in the past, but we do not necessarily mention everything in every game if it doesn’t directly support the narrative we are building. In our timeline Japan wasn’t unified yet, and not mentioning Shao Jun and her apprentice doesn’t mean that they couldn’t have co-existed.</p> <p>“Similar to this, the fact that there is no Isu artifact in the main game of <em>Shadows</em> doesn’t mean that it doesn’t exist in the world of <em>Shadows</em>; it just wasn’t a story device that we needed for the story we wanted to tell.”</p></blockquote> <h2><strong>More Story Updates Will Be Added To <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></strong></h2> <p>One last answer about <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-review-is-it-good-xbox-ps5-rpg-1851770647"><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></a> and its narrative. This time, someone asked about whether any new story updates or additional expansions will be forthcoming. Simon, associate game director on <em>Shadows</em>, replied:</p> <blockquote><p>“We are hard at work [on] more free story drops that will come in the future – nothing we can announce yet though! We’ll let you sink your teeth into the<em> Claws of Awaji</em> [expansion] first, and you tell us if you want more!”</p></blockquote> <figure id="attachment_2000001632" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000001632"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000001632">Ubisoft</figcaption></figure> <h2><strong>Making Yasuke Or Naoe Your In-Game Companion</strong></h2> <p>One really interesting question that resulted in an equally interesting response was about Ubisoft adding a feature to <em>Shadows</em> that would let players call the other main character as a companion.<em> AC Shadows</em> live producer André said that the feature would be “cool” but admitted that its unlikely to happen because it would involve a lot of work.</p>

 <blockquote><p>“That would be a cool feature for sure!! We would love to do this also but at the moment it is not in development but I can tell you we have discussed about this internally but a lot of technicalities as to be overcome so we can’t deliver such a feature.”</p> <p>“For example, the quality of our main character is so high we would need to spawn them in a much lower quality to not explode the memory. Another element would be to develop an AI for them that is fitting with our balancing. No technical problems can’t be overcome, but it would require a lot of effort. More than we are willing to spend on this feature without compromising every other features our players are waiting for. In short, it is not planned at the moment. If it changes, we will let you know.”</p></blockquote> <h2><b>Changing Seasons From <em>Shadows</em> Will Likely Show Up In Future <em>AC</em> Games</b></h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-graphics-seasons-screenshots-1851770252">One of the coolest parts of <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></a> is how, over time, the seasons change across the map. This affects not only the look of the world, but also how you explore it. For example, it can make rivers freeze up and offer new paths to the player. It’s a nifty feature, and when asked if it will be included in future <em>AC</em> games, André implied that the tech will be shared with other Ubisoft teams and that he wouldn’t be surprised to see seasons in a future installment.</p> <blockquote><p>“I’m super happy to see you enjoyed that improvement in our world-building. We can’t promise anything for the future <em>Assassin’s Creed,</em> but what I can tell you is that our development team is sharing the tech and knowledge for future installments, so they can decide if they want to integrate the dynamic seasons. Developing those seasons required a lot of effort to put together, so every game will need decide if it’s important enough to invest all the time needed to deliver it compared to other features. I can tell you that internally everyone finds it amazing, also, so I would not be surprised to see it again in the future!”</p></blockquote> <h2><strong>Social Stealth Could Return In The Franchise</strong></h2> <p>Speaking of features that could return, someone asked why social stealth was missing from <em>Shadows</em> after playing such a big role in <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-mirage-review-ps5-steam-pc-valhalla-1850897175">2023’s <em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage</em></a>. And Ubisoft confirmed that hiding in crowds and on benches is still a part of the series.</p>

 <blockquote><p>“For <em>Shadows</em>, our stealth team chose to put 100% of their energy on the moment-to-moment tactical shinobi experience, which left no space for Social Stealth… That does not mean that Social Stealth is gone from the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> franchise, though!”</p></blockquote> <h2><strong><em>Mirage’s</em> Parkour Helped Improve Naoe’s Moves In <em>Shadows</em></strong></h2> <p>When a player asked if <em>Mirage</em> had an impact on <em>Shadows</em>, specifically the game’s parkour, André admitted that due to how buildings are built in Japan and the team’s desire to keep the action grounded, they rebuilt parkour and didn’t reuse <em>Mirage</em> star Basim’s move set. That said, the parkour in <em>Mirage</em> did affect the post-launch updates that improved and expanded Naoe’s move set. Here’s part of André’s answer:</p> <blockquote><p>“The <em>Mirage</em> team’s dedication to parkour is what inspired us to do more post-launch parkour updates, and we use a lot of their work as stepping stones for Naoe’s improvements in post-launch and to involve some experts from the community in those discussions.”</p></blockquote> <h2><strong>No Discovery mode coming&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>Some bad news: There won’t be a non-combat-focused educational mode added to <em>Shadows</em> as we have seen in past games like <em>Valhalla</em> and <em>Origins</em>. With André delivering the disappointing news bluntly: “But to get to the core of your question, we do not currently have a ‘Japan Discovery Tour’ like we had for ‘Viking Age’ in the works.”</p> <h2><strong>Also, No New Hair Options Are Being Added In Any Updates</strong></h2> <p>And some more bad news: Ubisoft doesn’t plan on adding new hair customization options for either of the main characters in <em>Shadows</em>. Here’s André’s transparent answer to someone asking about more hair choices:</p> <blockquote><p>“We will not add more different type of hair for our character because, to be blunt, it is extremely costly. The complexity is to have the physic works appropriately in all scenarios we have.”</p></blockquote>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Dropout.TV is becoming a surprisingly big name in the streaming world as an inexpensive service that <a href="https://variety.com/2023/streaming/news/dropout-subscribers-double-new-shows-sam-reich-1235829675/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">puts its fans and employees</a> above maxing out profits. Game Changers is already an ambitious show, but now host and Dropout CEO Sam Reich is thinking about what it would mean to bring Dropout into the world of video games, according to an interview with <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-changer-dropout-video-game-sam-reich-interview-dimension-20-2000616708" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcPXAf_a4e8" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OcPXAf_a4e8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Reich told Kotaku that if Dropout did release a game, it would be based on either Game Changers or Dimension 20, the service's successful tabletop roleplaying series (which played a <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/dungeons-and-dragons-dimension-20-madison-square-garden-1235258992/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">sold-out show at Madison Square Garden</a> earlier this year).</p><p>"I think that we would be into that, and we've talked about it," Reich said. "At this point, it's honestly, more than anything else, just a bandwidth issue...If we're going to do it, we want it to feel like us."</p><p>Part of that means direct involvement from Dropout and the Game Changer team.</p><p>"We're not going to farm the IP out to some third party," Reich said. "We want it to feel personal. And it needs to be something, therefore, that we're excited enough about and feels differentiated enough from what's out there that it feels worth our time."</p><p>Game Changer is, technically, a game show of sorts, but you won't see random people off the street competing. Instead, Game Changer features a rotating cast of comedians and performers doing a sort of competitive improv game. Each episode is different than the last; episodes begin with host Reich pretending to assume that players know how the game is played, and the players emphatically disagreeing. The show has become increasingly ambitious (and sometimes quite manipulative), and just completed its seventh season. Some more straightforward episode concepts have included players competing for second place, forcing the players to look for increasingly well-hidden buzzers, and having comedians known for crowd work compete to see who does the best crowd work with a crowd hand-picked for the occasion.</p><p>Meanwhile, some of the most ambitious episodes have included an episode that gave players a year to accomplish a number of tasks, a "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" spoof that ended with a fan-favorite player taking home $100,000, and an episode where people competed to make the most viral video to advertise Dropout.TV. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/oO4kgmYivoQ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one such video</a> featured Dimension 20 DM Brennan Lee Mulligan pretending to announce his departure from Dropout.TV to make shoes for American Girl Dolls).</p><p>It's not hard to imagine a Jackbox-style game for Game Changer, where players are asked to perform improv tasks and be judged by their friends and family. Dimension 20, meanwhile, could be a simple RPG or a huge AAA-style RPG based off of one of the Dimension 20 hosts' concepts.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/killing-floor-3/">Killing Floor 3</a> has a bigger emphasis on choosing the best skills for each of the perks. With a few familiar names and new additions, and all classes getting 30 levels' worth of skills each, it can be a daunting task.</p><p>Similarly to Killing Floor 2, after reaching a certain level milestone per perk, you'll gain access to a new row of skills, which ranges from one to three options. The key is that you can also spend points to upgrade them, which makes pivoting a bit hard.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/unionized-workers-at-arkane-a-microsoft-owned-studio-demand-that-microsoft-divest-from-israel%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98sinister-project-for-gaza%E2%80%99.1268496/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Earlier this year, the Palestinian-led Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-bds-games-journalism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added Microsoft to its list of priority targets</a> due to the company’s entanglement with the Israeli military via Azure cloud and AI services. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/06/microsoft-israeli-military-palestinian-phone-calls-cloud" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A recent Guardian report</a> revealed the grisly details of said arrangement, claiming that Microsoft’s “cloud-based storage platform has facilitated the preparation of deadly airstrikes and has shaped military operations in Gaza and the West Bank.” Now game developers at Microsoft-owned studio Arkane, creator of <em>Dishonored </em>and <em>Deathloop</em>, have lent their voices to the chorus demanding that the company stop powering Israel’s assault.</p><p>As part of <a href="https://www.stjv.fr/en/2025/08/open-letter-from-the-arkan-studios-union-section-to-microsofts-and-its-subsidiaries-management/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an open letter</a> to leadership at Arkane, Zenimax, Microsoft Gaming, and Microsoft more broadly, workers unionized under French union STJV did not mince words about Israel’s ongoing genocide of Palestinians, lending their support to BDS and the Microsoft-worker-led <a href="https://noazureforapartheid.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">No Azure For Apartheid campaign</a>.</p><p>“Arkane Studios’ STJV section joins BDS and the No Azure for Apartheid in their demands for Microsoft to stop supporting the Israeli regime,” Arkane workers wrote. “We think that Microsoft has no place being accomplice of a genocide, and as Microsoft employees, we don’t want to be part of this sinister project for Gaza. Moreover, we think it’s our responsibility, as tech workers, to raise the alarm, and to ensure that our technologies are used to make the voices of the oppressed heard, and not facilitate their demise. Finally, in a more direct manner, we think this could very well affect our life directly, by reducing the audience for our games, thus directly compromising the viability of Xbox Games, and, in the long run, our very own jobs.”</p><p>The letter includes a list of specific demands, which echo those of No Azure For Apartheid: an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza, termination of all ongoing or future contracts with Israeli occupation forces, disclosure of all ties to the Israeli military, protection of pro-Palestinian speech within the company, and “a transparent, independent and public audit of Microsoft technologies, contracts, services and investments to make sure they are not used to violate the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols, and Microsoft’s own Human Rights Statement, in Palestine or anywhere else.”</p><p>Ultimately, Arkane workers believe that Microsoft should put its money where its mouth is.</p><p>"Microsoft has a responsibility toward its employees, as we have one toward the company,” Arkane workers wrote. “As stated in the company’s commitment to human rights, and regularly used in the company talk points, ‘Microsoft is committed to protecting fundamental rights.’ But so far, Microsoft has failed both its teams [and] its customers by being actively complicit of the invasion and war crimes happening in Gaza. If those core values are more [than] just talking points to sell more products, it is now more than due time for Microsoft to commit to them."</p><p>Of course, this is just an open letter. As it stands, nothing here is compelling Microsoft to turn over a new leaf that even comes close to matching the intoxicating aroma of ill-gotten cash. But these things have a way of snowballing. When Badru, the creator of open-world tactics RPG <em>Tenderfoot Tactics</em>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/ice-water-games-tenderfoot-tactics-xbox-store-removed-bds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">removed his game from Xbox in solidarity with BDS</a> earlier this year, he told Aftermath: “Whether we're able to make Microsoft change or not directly, part of the point of targeting them is to be able to advocate around this and show these connections. Otherwise, nobody's interested in Azure Cloud. Nobody wants to talk about whatever Microsoft's bullshit AI is doing. These boycotts create opportunities for us to shine a light.”</p><p>Now news organizations <a href="https://www.972mag.com/microsoft-8200-intelligence-surveillance-cloud-azure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are investigating</a> <a href="https://www.mekomit.co.il/%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%95%D7%9F-%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%97%D7%95%D7%AA-%D7%91%D7%A9%D7%A2%D7%94-%D7%94%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%92%D7%A8-%D7%A9%D7%9C-8200-%D7%A2%D7%9C-%D7%A9%D7%A8%D7%AA%D7%99-%D7%9E%D7%99/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Azure Cloud</a>, and mainstream coverage is shifting more and more to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/31/world/middleeast/gaza-starvation-aid-israel-netanyahu.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">critique and decry Israel’s actions</a>, especially its long-term starvation of Gazans.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>An image has appeared on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1mnzovo/steam_paypal_unavailable_update/">Reddit</a> that includes a statement explaining that PayPal is no longer processing Steam purchases in currencies other than the following six: Euros, Canadian Dollars, British Pound Sterling, Japanese Yen, Australian Dollars, or United States Dollars.</p>



<p>The image shows an answer from Steam Support as to why using PayPal in the user's current currency (which is presumably not one of the above six) is unavailable. "<em>In early July 2025</em>," the statement reads, "<em>PayPal notified Valve that their acquiring bank for payment transactions in certain currencies was immediately terminating the processing of any transactions related to Steam. This affects Steam purchases using PayPal in currencies other than EUR, CAD, GBP, JPY, AUD, and USD.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>We hope to offer PayPal as an option for these currencies in the future,</em>" the statement continues, "<em>but the timeline is uncertain. We are also evaluating adding additional payment methods on Steam for the customers affected by this</em>." The statement then concludes by suggesting the user try a different payment method, including adding funds to their Steam wallet.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>This is the first official statement from Valve on the issue, though players have been complaining about the problems on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/discussions/forum/1/595154293314559955/">Steam forums since early July</a>, which lines up with the timeline shared by Valve. One user who commented on the forum linked above claims to have made a purchase on Steam through PayPal, not in one of the aforementioned six currencies just three days prior to July 12, 2025. So we at least have some idea as to when this began.</p>



<p>It's unclear as to why PayPal's acquiring banks are blocking any purchases on Valve's platform not in one of six currencies, but the timeline of everything has many speculating that it has something to do with the current issues around <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-prohibiting-content-violetes-banks-rules/">payment processors seemingly putting pressure on Valve to remove certain kinds of games from its platform</a>.</p>



<p>Beyond the timing, there's no concrete connection between PayPal's affiliated banks no longer processing purchases on Steam due to the campaign to have certain kinds of <a href="https://wccftech.com/ukie-says-payment-processors-should-have-confidence-in-age-rating-systems/">adult and NSFW content removed from videogame platforms like Steam and Itch.io</a>. </p>

<p>Everyone knows that Borderlands is a series famed for insane gun-toting action and explosive sequences. That has become increasingly true with each successive iteration, and 2019’s Borderlands 3, the most recent numbered release in the series, boasted ’87 bazillion guns.’</p>



<p>The number has been refined going into Borderlands 4 by the game’s art director, Adam May. He has claimed that this highly anticipated title will include <strong>30 billion possible guns</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-impossible-numbers">Impossible Numbers</h2>



<p>Borderlands becomes increasingly insane with each new release, but <strong>Borderlands 4 </strong>is heading to new heights with a new band of Vault Hunters, a seamless open world, and <strong>30 billion guns</strong>.</p>



<p>In a new super-sized interview piece <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/borderlands-randy-pitchford-interview-borderlands-4?s=09" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published by Epic Games</a>, the Gearbox team uncovered various elements of Borderlands 4. The game’s art director, Adam May, stated that there are more guns than you’d ever believe possible.</p>



<p>This is achievable through procedural generation and by having a staggering base array of weapons right off the bat. From the various categories to the different ‘manufacturers’ iconic to Borderlands, and from the fire modes to the attachments, it’s easy to see how the list can quickly grow.</p>



<p>It’s worth stressing how it works.</p>



<p>If you get a rifle and that rifle has one attachment different in the next iteration, that’s two weapons. If it then has a different elemental effect, that’s three. Let’s say you find another with a slightly different scope. That’s four weapons, and you’re still nowhere close to the variable potential of that <strong>one </strong>firearm; that’s how Borderlands 4 can tote these types of numbers.</p>



<p>May explained what goes into the creation of Borderlands 4’s weapons from an artistic perspective:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Players have some recognition when they’re picking up a certain manufacturer’s weapon and have a rough idea of how it’s going to function.</p>



<p>It’s a back-and-forth with the design team and art team, making sure that visually things line up with how they’re supposed to work mechanically. If you want a real fast shooting weapon, you shoot for sleeker, more angular, more aggressive-looking shapes. If it’s shooting giant rockets every time, you want something that’s bigger and rounder and more bulbous.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Borderlands 4 will be released on September 12. Do you intend to give it a try and flick through some of those 30 billion guns? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

                <p>Razer just expanded its Wolverine V3 Pro lineup with a PC-only model aimed at competitive players who want the speed and precision of a wired connection in a wireless controller. The <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Wolverine-V3-Pro-8K-PC/dp/B0FC9DTDJ3?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Razer Wolverine V3 Pro 8K PC Controller</a></strong> has a blistering 8,000Hz polling rate in wireless and wired modes--32 times faster than the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Wolverine-Wireless-Gaming-Controller-Desktop/dp/B0DB6S6R89?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">V3 Pro for Xbox</a> in wireless mode and eight times faster in wired mode. The V3 Pro 8K also utilizes new thumbstick technology, has upgraded grips, and greatly improves the battery life. You can purchase the Wolverine V3 Pro 8K PC Controller for $200 at Amazon; it's ready to ship now and is eligible for Prime.</p><p>Outside of those upgrades, the Razer Wolverine V3 Pro 8K has the same core features as the Xbox edition, including four remappable back triggers, two claw bumpers, microswitch buttons, custom profile support, and excellent ergonomics. For this reason, we'd recommend reading the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/razer-wolverine-v3-pro-xbox-pc-controller-review/1100-6526158/" data-ref-id="1100-6526158">Razer Wolverine V3 Pro for Xbox review</a> we published last summer, as the vast majority of our commentary applies to the new 8K edition. The V3 Pro for Xbox was and still is a fantastic high-end controller for Xbox and PC. But if you have no need for Xbox console support, the V3 Pro 8K is the better pick for PC gaming thanks to the tech upgrades.</p><p>Both V3 Pro wireless models retail for $200, and just like the Xbox model, the PC-only <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Wolverine-Tournament-Gaming-Controller-Desktop/dp/B0FH5T25M2?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8K edition is also available in a wired-only Tournament Edition</a>.

The new PC-only model's 8,000Hz polling rate in wireless and wired modes is absurdly high. The original V3 Pro has a 250Hz polling rate when connected wirelessly and 1,000Hz on PC when using the wired Tournament Mode (or the Tournament Edition controller). Generally, 1,000Hz is considered a high polling rate for a wireless controller, making 8,000Hz an absurdly high rate. Would you notice a difference between 1,000Hz and 8,000Hz? Honestly, most players probably wouldn't, but serious competitive players who routinely spend many hours with the same games almost certainly will see and feel the increased speed and precision.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4548823-razerwolverinev3pro8k.png" data-ref-id="1300-4548823" data-ratio="0.569" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4548823-razerwolverinev3pro8k.png" data-ref-id="1300-4548823"></a><figcaption>Razer Wolverine V3 Pro 8K carrying case</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4548823-razerwolverinev3pro8k.png"></figure><p>Outside of the new Hyperpolling tech, the biggest change--and the one you are more likely to notice--is the new thumbstick sensors. Razer upgraded the 8K model from Hall Effect to TMR electromagnetic sensors. The recently released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/razers-kishi-v3-pro-xl-controller-turns-your-ipad-pro-into-a-giant-handheld/1100-6532399/" data-ref-id="1100-6532399">Kishi V3 mobile controller series</a> also have TMR joysticks. You can consider TMR as the next step beyond Hall Effect. The technology offers higher polling rates and resolution while consuming less power. The tech undoubtedly helped Razer in its quest for an 8,000Hz polling rate. It also contributed to the improved battery life, as the V3 Pro 8K is rated for up to 36 hours compared to the 20-hour battery life of the original.</p><p>Other updates include a redesigned textured grip that offers a better feel than the original, PBT microswitch buttons with a matte finish--the Xbox version has glossy buttons--and a lighter design. The V3 Pro 8K weighs 220 grams, making it noticeably lighter than the 304 gram original. The reason for this largely stems from the removal of rumble motors. If you love haptic feedback, you'll want to go with the original V3 Pro, because the new 8K model doesn't have rumble. This isn't too surprising considering the new model caters to competitive players even more than the original. The 8K also drops the 3.5mm audio jack found on the Xbox edition. This isn't surprising either, as PC players who use wired headsets often connect them to DACs/amps or directly into their PC.</p><p>For more new Razer gear, check out our roundup detailing the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/razer-blackshark-v3-pro-wireless-headset-for-pc-ps5-and-xbox/1100-6533534/" data-ref-id="1100-6533534">BlackShark V3 Gaming Headset series</a>.

Most of the specs are shared across the two different models. Regardless of which you choose, you'll get a sizable 11-inch display with a 1920 x 1200 resolution, a 90Hz refresh rate, and a microSD card slot for expandable storage. It also features a Qualcomm Snapdragon 695, which, although not powerful enough for demanding gaming, is perfectly fine for casual games or retro emulation.</p><p dir="ltr">Where things diverge is RAM--the 128GB model includes 8GB RAM while the 64GB model has just 4GB. If you plan on using the tablet's multitasking feature or running more demanding apps and games, consider snagging the 128GB model. Not only will you get more native storage, but the additional memory will make for a smoother experience.</p><p><strong>64GB:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3Upq2yj" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Graphite</a> - $155.72 (<del>$220</del>)</li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/4mwqIOg" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Silver</a> - $159 (<del>$220</del>)</li></ul><p><strong>128GB:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://amzn.to/4owJ5EL" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Graphite</a> - $209 (<del>$270</del>)</li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3Uq75f4" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Silver</a> - $209 (<del>$270</del>)</li></ul></div>                      </div><p><span>Beyond this Samsung tablet, the </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Display-All-Day/dp/B0DZ77D5HL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Apple iPad (A16 Chip)</a><span> is on sale for $299 (was $349).

Zelnick replied that his “level of conviction is very, very high, obviously.” The host then asked about high expectations for the game and how Rockstar and Take-Two are dealing with that.</p> <p>“We try not to pump expectations, right?” said Zelnick. “I think Rockstar’s whole stock and trade is to have these extraordinary expectations and still to beat them. I know that’s their goal. I know it’s going to be an amazing game. The rest we’ll see in the fullness of time.”</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Take-Two Interactive CEO on Q2 earnings, gamer growth and GTA 6" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XC5BVh0IaOg?start=269&amp;feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Some online took this as gospel that <em>GTA 6</em> won’t be delayed again. But the reality is that while Zelnick is aware of the game’s development status, what he says publicly is never going to be a completely transparent answer. He also isn’t a game developer, and making games is hard. Landing a release date is challenging, even when not working on a massive game like <em>GTA 6</em>. And Zelnick has been wrong before.</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-release-date-delay-borderlands-4-fall-2025-1851757501">In February</a>, he told <em>IGN</em> that while there’s always a “risk” of a game being delayed, he still felt “really good about” it launching as planned in 2025. Less than two months later, <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta6-grand-theft-auto-6-release-date-delay-may-2026-1851778799"><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> was delayed until May 2026</a>.</p> <p>I don’t think Zelnick is lying or trying to deceive. But as the head of a large, publicly traded company, he has to exude confidence about the future. Everything is going great, until it’s not. Personally, I’m convinced<em> GTA 6</em> won’t be delayed again. But I also have no idea. The only people who really might have that information are the folks working on <em>GTA 6</em> right now, and even they probably can’t be sure whether it will or won’t nail its date. Games are messy things to create and often come together at the very end. So don’t put much stock into what the suit-wearing number cruncher at the top thinks will happen.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-trailer-2-everything-spotted-round-up-easter-eggs-1851779329"><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>, set in sunny Vice City</a>, will (probably) launch on May 26, 2026 on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been more than 15 years since League of Legends hit the market, fast becoming the number one MOBA and the world’s leading competitive game. It might seem bizarre to some, but after all this time, Riot Games is preparing to introduce a new WASD-based control scheme, after more than a decade and a half of using a point-and-click operating model.</p>



<p>This news was dropped in a recent update from Riot Games that included information about the future of the game. It was pointed out that this WASD control scheme will be introduced first in <strong>testing</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-all-these-years-later">All These Years Later</h2>



<p>In a recent 13-minute video shared to discuss the most imminent and important updates to League of Legends, Riot Games lifted the lid on a dramatic test that’ll allow players to use WASD to directly control their Champions for the first time.</p>



<p>The team said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’ve found that a lot of new or returning players struggling with League’s controls early on. Click to move just isn’t the sort of control scheme they’re used to and it puts a lot of people off, including many that we believe would otherwise really love the game.</p>



<p>So, we’re introducing WASD as an alternate control scheme to help get new players to the fun parts of League faster and with less friction.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was revealed that WASD for League of Legends has been under development ‘for a while’. It’s all about allowing first-time players to have a more intuitive journey as they try to break into one of the more complex games on the market.</p>



<p>Riot Games endeavours to make both ‘point-and-click’ and WASD movement schemes fully functional across all game modes, including Ranked.</p>

</p></figure>







<p>For ‘the next few patches’, WASD will be introduced to PBE (Public Beta Environment), and it will evolve based on player feedback before drifting to other game modes across the full version of the game.</p>



<p>Do you think you’ll prefer to use WASD in League of Legends? Let me know your thoughts on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

According to the CWA, this makes them the “first in-house cinematic, animation, and narrative studio to form a union in the North American game industry.”</p><p>The new union is made up of 160 workers from Blizzard’s animation, in-house cinematic, and narrative teams, alongside series archivists and historians. “These workers are setting the standard for animation, cinematics, and storytelling across the video game industry, creating the breathtaking cutscenes, trailers, and other narrative content that fans have come to love,” said CWA Local 9510 President Jason Justice in a press release.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“I’m excited that we have joined together in forming a union to protect my colleagues from things like misguided policies and instability as a result of layoffs,” said organizing committee member and cinematic producer John Giarratana, continuing, “I think that organizing gives us an opportunity to make our workplace better and safer.”</p><p>CWA says that Blizzard owner Microsoft has recognized the union, in accordance with the <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/cwa-microsoft-announce-labor-neutrality-agreement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">labor neutrality</a> policy the company agreed to in 2022. In July 2024, <a href="https://aftermath.site/wow-activision-union-microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">500 workers on Blizzard-owned <em>World of Warcraft</em></a> formed a union that they called “the largest wall-to-wall union at a Microsoft-owned studio,” alongside Blizzard QA workers in Austin. Other studios across Microsoft have also unionized in recent years, including at <a href="https://aftermath.site/bethesda-union-unionize-fallout-elder-scrolls-starfield" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bethesda</a>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/zenimax-online-studios-union" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ZeniMax Online Studios</a>, and ZeniMax QA, the latter of which finally <a href="https://aftermath.site/zenimax-union-contract" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reached a contract</a> in May after nearly two years of <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-zenimax-cwa-union-contract-negotiations-strike" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bargaining</a>. Unionized workers at Raven Studios reached a <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/raven-software-workers-secure-first-contract-microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">contract with Microsoft earlier this month</a>.</p><p>In July, Microsoft laid off <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-july" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">9000 workers</a>, with gaming divisions the hardest hit. These layoffs came on the heels of the company axing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659401/microsoft-layoffs-three-percent-workforce" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">6000 jobs</a> in May. ZeniMax QA workers told Aftermath they were <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-layoffs-zenimax-activision-blizzard-cwa-union-statement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">given no warning</a> about the July layoffs, and CWA president Claude Cummings Jr said in a statement that “We are deeply disappointed in Microsoft’s decision to lay off thousands more workers, including union-represented CWA members, at a time when the company is prospering.”</p><p><strong>Update 8/12/25, 4:10pm--</strong>Added the number of members in the new union.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/the-drifter-point-click-adventure-game-lucasarts-king-carpenter-australia"><h3>I Bloody Love The Drifter</h3></a><p>A homage to Lucasarts, John Carpenter and so much more</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/tiny-bookshop-impressions"><h3>Recommending Books Is The Best Part Of Tiny Bookshop</h3></a><p>Forget The Lorax, kid; it's time for classic architecture</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/blizzard-union-story-franchise-cwa]]></content:encoded>

Despite having watched many hours of competitive <em>League</em>, whenever I’ve tried to play it myself, I’ve quickly bounced because of its complexity. WASD controls could lower the barrier to entry, and Riot says that they are “the first of a number of long-term projects we’re working on to help shape <em>League’s</em> future.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/758360/league-of-legends-wasd-keyboard-control-riot-games]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Another union is forming at Blizzard as developers from the company’s story and franchise development (SFD) team have voted in favor of union representation. Announced via the Communication Workers of America (CWA) website, the vote came “either by signing a union authorization card or indicating that they wanted union representation via an online portal.”</p>



<p>All workers will be members of CWA Local 9510 in Orange County, California with Microsoft already recognizing their union.</p>



<p>The union <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/blizzards-story-and-franchise-development-workers-form-latest-video-game-union" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">will cover those who work</a> on Blizzard’s in-house cinematics, animation, and narrative team who create game trailers, promotional videos, in-game cutscenes, and other narrative content for Blizzard franchises. It becomes the first group of its kind to form a union in the North American game industry.</p>



<p><strong>“After more than a decade working at Blizzard, I’ve seen all the highs and lows. For years, Blizzard has been a place where people could build their careers and stay for decades, but that stability’s been fading,”</strong>&nbsp;Bucky Fisk, a principal editor and member of the organizing committee, said via release.&nbsp;<strong>“With a union, we’re able to preserve what makes this place special, secure real transparency in how decisions are made, and make sure policies are applied fairly to everyone.”</strong></p>



<p>The new union joins the <strong>“nearly 3,000 workers at Microsoft-owned studios who have organized with CWA to build better standards across the video game industry.”</strong></p>



<p><strong>“These workers are setting the standard for animation, cinematics, and storytelling across the video game industry, creating the breathtaking cutscenes, trailers, and other narrative content that fans have come to love across all Blizzard franchises. We are excited to have them join our union family,”&nbsp;</strong>CWA Local 9510 president Jason Justice said.</p>



<p>As of publishing, neither Activision-Blizzard nor Microsoft have made an official comment on the union.</p>

<section><p>This hour-long story stands toe-to-toe with the biggest games in the medium.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">From their massive open worlds, unfathomably large download sizes, and seemingly endless checklists of collectibles, missions, and side quests, games are so much nowadays. It's really no fault of the titles themselves that this formula works--it's tried, it's true, and it sells. But it does mean that I appreciate the occasional break from this exact mold of game. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/and-roger/" data-ref-id="5000-654160">And Roger</a>, a narrative game that can be completed within an hour and manages to do so much with so little, offers exactly that kind of break, and I'd love it if it became the standard rather than the exception.</p><p dir="ltr">I'm not too interested in giving away the most explicit details of And Roger right here and now. For just about five dollars on your PC and/or Switch, you can see all it has to say over the course of a slightly long lunch break. I've nothing to gain from telling you what it is, but you've got everything to lose by not just experiencing it firsthand. It covers a lot of ground in a pretty short amount of time, and its gut punches are as hard as they are dizzying.</p><p dir="ltr">And Roger plays like an interactive graphic novel--think 2018's Florence, which depicted the highs and lows of the titular character's romance and journey of self-discovery across comic-like panels and minigames. And Roger appears to take some cues from the award-winning narrative title, communicating its story largely through brief mechanical interludes that break up its often distressing narrative. However, where Florence basked in the glow of new love and the ennui of uncertainty, And Roger drops players into the confusing perspective of its main character and leads them on what can only be described as an expertly crafted emotional rollercoaster that tightly skirts the boundaries between different genres of stories.</p><p dir="ltr">For example, you'd be forgiven for thinking that And Roger was a horror game at first blush. Its opening certainly leaves that impression on the player as a brief examination takes a sharp turn for the bizarre and unsettling. And in truth, many of the events that come to follow--like the protagonist coming to and finding a strange man on her couch--do inspire a bit of terror.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4548821-3zmm608q.png" data-ref-id="1300-4548821" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4548821-3zmm608q.png" data-ref-id="1300-4548821"></a><figcaption>Two men in hats observe a young girl.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4548821-3zmm608q.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">But as you close in on and make your way through the second chapter, And Roger adopts a significantly lighter tone. Without giving too much away, the main character's life changes for the better, and the horrific sequences that make up the first chapter seem to fade from memory as they push forward into this new era. The break in tone almost appears disjointed from the rest of the narrative that preceded it, but it's really all quite intentional how the game keeps pushing the player through sometimes disorienting turns through the character's life.</p><p dir="ltr">You see, And Roger just gets it right. What do I mean by "it"? I mean most everything about the game is finely tuned in a way that bloat often obfuscates. The ambitions of its story are scoped precisely, allowing for gameplay and mechanics that align with it perfectly. Scenes where the player must focus the character's blurry vision on a clock face, smash a button over and over to get out of bed, and even just brush their teeth seem like mundane tasks, but they compound in such a way that the story is able to show more than tell, all the while building narrative tension that eventually explodes. In brief, And Roger doesn't feel like it loses sight of itself in pursuit of some mechanic, feature, or detour that wouldn't otherwise fit this tight experience, and while I'm sure much of that that stems from the precarity of indie development, it is also simply refreshing to play something so clear-cut and precise.</p><p dir="ltr">Because these pillars of And Roger are in such harmony, its pace, which could be misconstrued for brusque at an hour-long runtime, is actually pitch-perfect. And Roger is just more economical about how it tells its story and how it is conveyed to the player, proving that games don't have to look or feel like the standard we've grown used to in order to tell meaningful tales or even evoke a sense of satisfaction from the player.</p><p dir="ltr">And Roger doesn't have as many things for the player to do as, say, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, a game I enjoyed a great deal and completed earlier this year after about 70 hours, nor does it share much in common with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring/">Elden Ring</a>, which I've replayed a good chunk of recently and whose massive expansion I just wrapped up. It also doesn't set itself up to rival a game like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/slay-the-princess/">Slay The Princess</a>, which at least shares a propensity for narrative over mechanics like And Roger does, or a visual novel like Date Everything. It doesn't need to, either, because I was just as satisfied (not to mention, quietly devastated) by And Roger's ambitions and execution as any of the aforementioned games. In some cases, it even worked better for me.</p><p dir="ltr">My point is not that one way is right and the other is wrong. Games making is not binary in this way. But games like And Roger continue to crop up as proof that they don't all need to fit a predetermined, and lets just admit it, generously-sized mold. Games, like art in any other medium, can and should come in all shapes, sizes, and forms. And Roger functions as a near-perfect rebuke of the thinking that games should grow bigger in order to be better and due to that, it gets it just right.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Borderlands 4 - Official Story Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>The game doesn't take any time to provide a "rationalization" for why this is possible. "You're literally in the air, and you hit the jump button again, and you'll get another jump out of it. Does it feel good? Is it fun? Then I don't give a s**t if it makes any sense," Pitchford said.</p><p>Beyond double-jumping, Borderlands 4 adds dashing and gliding movement abilities, while players can also use a grappling hook to move around the world and pull items toward themselves.</p><p>Borderlands 4 takes players to the planet of Kairos, and the game appears to have taken some inspiration from Bungie's Destiny series. Not only will you have a helpful droid called Echo-4 that can assist you in navigating your way across Kairos, but you'll also be able to instantly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-lets-you-glide-ride-and-find-vaults-on-the-side/1100-6531245/">catch a ride with a Sparrow-like vehicle</a>.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6529507/" data-ref-id="1100-6529507">According to Pitchford</a>, Borderlands 4 will give players an expansive playground to explore, but it shouldn't be referred to as a traditional open-world game. "I wouldn't say 'open world' because that [term] will come with baggage. That isn't what we are. But it is seamless, and it is expansive, and it is larger than anything we've ever done, and it is filled like nothing we've ever done," he said.</p><p dir="ltr">Borderlands 4 launches on September 12 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. It's coming to Switch 2 on October 3.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Krafton has issued a response to a recent lawsuit filed by the former leads of Subnautica 2, offering rebuttals to the developers' claims and alleging they "resorted to litigation to demand a multimillion-dollar payout they haven't earned."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes in reply to a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-subnautica-2-leaders-accuse-krafton-of-hindering-games-release-firing-them-to-avoid-paying-250-million-bonus">legal complaint</a> filed by former Unknown Worlds CEO Ted Gill, and fellow co-founders Charlie Cleveland and Max McGuire, last month. In it, the former leads alleged that Krafton went out of its way to hinder Subnautica 2's development, delay the game, and ultimately fire them from their roles all in an effort to stop them and other employees from collecting a $250 million bonus payment that would have kicked in if the game's early access released on time later this year and reached certain sales milestones.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In its <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/900707287/Defendant-s-Answer-to-Verified-Complaint?secret_password=ha0mUjTuK1JQkOU4QaYn" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">response</a>, Krafton says the game was planned for a Q1 2024 release. However, "Cleveland and McGuire abandoned their roles as studio-wide Game Director and Technical Director to focus on their personal passion projects and quit making games for Unknown Worlds entirely. And Gill, who remained, focused on leveraging his operational control to maximize the earnout payment, rather than developing a successful game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Krafton goes on to allege that by 2023, Unknown Worlds' development director had commented on the founders being "checked out," and that Cleveland in particular had stated publicly he had abandoned video games to pursue filmmaking. The release date of Subnautica slipped to 2024 and then 2025. "An internal assessment of the first playable in March of 2024 made clear that the team had failed to deliver on their promise of developing sufficiently new content. But rather than roll up their sleeves and make the game they had promised, the Key Employees blamed others and overhauled the team." Krafton also says that the leads continued reducing the scope of the game over time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The response says that by spring 2025, Krafton was trying to stop them from releasing the game, saying it was not ready. However, Krafton alleges the leads tried to release it anyway in order to get their maximum earnout.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Krafton, fearing how an underbaked EA Subnautica 2 would be received by both existing fans and the broader market, urged Cleveland and McGuire to return to their posts to generate a market-ready product that would not disappoint fans. Cleveland and McGuire declined. In response to Krafton's request for the Key Employees to return to lead the development of Subnautica 2, Gill stated that '[t]here's no coming back to a job they didn't have.'" Krafton further alleges that the leads said they would self-publish the game without Krafton, and that they downloaded "massive amounts of confidential information" from Unknown Worlds.</p><blockquote>The Key Employees' insistence on releasing the game immediately was singularly driven by self-interest in obtaining the earnout. At every turn during development, the Key Employees were laser focused on avoiding "a timeline that doesn't tank the earnout opportunity" and scheduling the release to maximize their payments. Conversations throughout the post-acquisition period make clear the Key Employee's [sic] focus was on their payday, and not on the game. As early as 2022, an employee who was due to receive a portion of the earnout stated that despite the significant delays in the game, he was confident "Ted [Gill] will <em><strong>concoct a scheme to get us that earnout</strong></em>." [emphasis Krafton's]</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">The response goes on to issue answers to every claim in the founders' lawsuit, paragraph by paragraph. Krafton asks the court to rule in its favor, deny the founders' claims for relief, and award Krafton costs, including attorney fees.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This saga began in July, when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/subnautica-2-developers-entire-leadership-team-replaced-in-shock-move-krafton-said-will-bring-renewed-energy-and-momentum">Krafton seemingly out of the blue</a> announced it would replace Unknown Worlds' leads with former Striking Distance CEO Steve Papoutsis. In the weeks that followed, reports emerged surrounding the $250 million bonus promised to staff amid questions as to whether that payout would be honored. While the Subnautica leads claimed in various statements and in their lawsuit that Krafton had tried to delay Subnautica 2 and ultimately fired them to avoid paying them the bonus, Krafton accused them of neglecting their duties, saying Subnautica 2 was not ready to launch. That final claim remains up in the air, with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Subnautica_2/comments/1lwyorm/a_leak_from_a_credible_source_regarding_the/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">leaked documents</a> since <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/subnautica-2-drama-gets-even-messier-as-krafton-confirms-internal-document-leak-is-real">verified by Krafton</a> confirming that Unknown Worlds was receiving feedback from the publisher that the game was not ready for early access launch. However, a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-16/-subnautica-2-leaders-say-krafton-sabotaged-game-over-payout" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">report from Bloomberg</a> suggests this may not have been wholly true.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’d been excited for the return of <a href="https://gizmodo.com/studio-trigger-anime-new-panty-stocking-with-garterbelt-is-a-raunchy-foul-mouthed-riot-2000626852" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>New Panty &amp; Stocking</em> <em>with Garterbelt</em></a> ever since it was first announced at <a href="https://kotaku.com/bleach-trigun-stampede-panty-stocking-anime-expo-1849144771" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Anime Expo 2022</a>. Since Studio Trigger is handling the edgy, cult classic anime instead of <a href="https://gizmodo.com/gainax-bankruptcy-khara-evangelion-hideaki-anno-1851526631" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gainax,</a> I trusted that the show would be in good hands. After all, Trigger is one of my favorite anime studios, and with <a href="https://gizmodo.com/hell-yeah-cyberpunk-edgerunners-ii-is-happening-2000624411" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Cyberpunk:</em> <em>Edgerunners</em></a> and <a href="https://gizmodo.com/delicious-in-dungeon-season-2-studio-trigger-1851542772" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Delicious in Dungeon</em></a> follow-ups in the works, I had faith the show would live up to its thirteen-year cliffhanger. My trust has yet to be misplaced, but I was overwhelmed by the sex-driven show’s unexpectedly wholesome short about adopting a ghost cat, which turned me into a sobbing mess.</p><p><em>New Panty and Stocking</em> has been a nonstop riot. The show follows two angels, one named Panty, whose vice is that she likes to fuck, and the other named Stocking, who loves to eat sweets. They work for a priest named Garterbelt in Daten City, and they spend most of their time slaying demons. Why those names? The show operates under <em>Dragon Ball Z</em> naming conventions, trading produce references for underwear, naming characters Kneesocks and Brief to match its raunchy energy.</p><p>Every Wednesday, as if to make up for lost time since the cult classic premiered 13 years ago, the show has been moving quickly, incorporating plenty of <a href="https://gizmodo.com/new-panty-and-stocking-episode-3-mandalorian-reference-star-wars-2000633241" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pop culture references</a> and sharply targeting Millennial and Gen-Z humor. One of my favorites is a <em>Fast &amp; Furious</em> spoof that reimagines Dom’s family as sperm, and a <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> meets <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> episode where they joked about the rise of weed dispensaries popping up everywhere, doubling as GPS landmarks. They even managed to create that <em>Fantastic Four</em> spoof, combining Jack Kirby and <em>Space Ghost</em> art styles, just days after Marvel’s new movie was released, honoring the late <a href="https://gizmodo.com/george-lowe-star-of-adult-swims-space-ghost-has-died-2000571346" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Space Ghost</em> voice actor, George Lowe</a>, in one fell swoop. All of this is even more commendable considering Prime Video hasn’t been promoting it (or any of its anime, for that matter) at all.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="【New PANTY &amp; STOCKING with GARTERBELT】#01 メイキング" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5GNQdNp2_uc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>A short segment in the third episode of <em>New Panty &amp; Stocking</em>, “Pet Cematary Hills, Panty Anarchy knocks over a tombstone on her walk home. The next morning, she wakes up to a kitten purring so loudly that it vibrates on her lap. It turns out to be the soul of a cat whose tombstone she knocked over. This is where the waterworks begin, but explaining will spoil the episode.</p><p><strong>So spoilers for that.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Because <em>Panty &amp; Stocking</em>’s world involves the Anarchy sisters earning coins like <em>Mario</em> for every demon they slay in the hope of buying their way into heaven, Panty considers murking the cat to get a coin and going about her debaucherous way. Everyone dislikes this, including their former rivals-turned-new roommates, the Daemon sisters, who have all fallen for the cat as their house pet. Plus, the kitten is so small that its death wouldn’t earn Panty a coin anyway.&nbsp;</p><p>Nonetheless, Panty hatches a scheme to get the cat, which she names Vibe (named after a vibrator), nice and fat so that it’ll grow up to be worth a gold coin. Her methods to ensure this include hiding the pet toys her housemates bought for Vibe to limit her exercise and being heavy-handed with portion sizes at dinner time.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Prime Video/Studio Trigger</span></figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote><p>“Good girl, Vibe. Get nice and fat. Nice and fat, and we’ll both be the fattest cats around!”</p></blockquote></figure><p>In the blink of an eye, Vibe goes from being three apples tall to being a full-grown cat. So Panty decides now’s the time to put her pistol to Vibe’s temple. But she doesn’t pull the trigger. Like the Grinch, she acquiesces and remarks about how Vibe hasn’t been her usual energetic self. All the same, she pets Vibe and promises to bring back more of her favorite food.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>She just like me fr.<span></span><span>Prime Video/Studio Trigger</span></figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote><p>“Hey, Vibe, you’re not living up to your name so much these days. All right, all right. I’ll get you a nice, yummy Fish Ghost for when I get back. Be a good baby and look after the house, okay?”</p></blockquote></figure><p>But when Panty returns home, her housemates tell her something about Vibe, causing her to rush outside to see the black ghost cat turn into a transparent hue. Turns out, something was wrong with Vibe, and she’s going to disappear. In another twist, the something wrong wasn’t that she was dying for a bad reason, but that she was able to pass on properly because of the love she received from Panty.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>“That Ghost was abandoned by humans. She had never known love. But you loved her, Panty, and now she’s ready to move on.”</p></blockquote></figure><p>I’m honestly getting misty-eyed while typing this. Which of course doesn’t help, especially since Panty’s following line saying goodbye to Vibe with one last forehead boop obliterated me.</p><figure><blockquote><p>“I had big plans for you, you know? You were gonna give me so many Heaven Coins. Vibe…”</p></blockquote></figure><figure><figcaption>┗( T﹏T )┛<span></span><span>Prime Video/Studio Trigger</span></figcaption></figure><p>And there it is. I’m crying over a cat named after a vibrator passing on because the show’s selfish, bratty lead loved it enough to make up for its misfortunes in life. It also doesn’t help that I didn't cry during the show's memorializing of Vibe in the most <em>Logan</em>-esque final scene possible, by putting up a crucifix made out of pink vibrators outside their house with her name on it.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>I'm in shambles. <span></span><span>Prime Video/Studio Trigger</span></figcaption></figure><p>Like, yo, what the fuck, man?</p><p>As someone who also owns an all-black cat named Majima, whom I adopted from PAWS Chicago—learning he was an alley cat for nine years—seeing this scene hit me hard. Like Vibe, Majima also grew accustomed to being called outside by his name, with me jokingly calling him an asshole or brat whenever we’re at home. Still, like Panty, we formed a bond. He’s my little guy, and Vibe was Panty’s baby girl.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Family portrait<span></span><span>Isaiah Colbert</span></figcaption></figure><p>Watching Panty, a crude, selfish character, have her tsundere walls break down unexpectedly floored me. Quips are kind of the heart of the anime, so seeing the show stick to telling a wholesome story in an episode where they <a href="https://x.com/PSGarchive/status/1954978577637839216" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kill the president</a> and <a href="https://x.com/d0nut2x/status/1950601031001190841" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">become the <em>Fantastic Four</em></a> gave me the kind of tonal whiplash I’m still thinking about weeks later.&nbsp;</p><p>To my delight, the show didn’t just make a one-time reference to Vibe. In the latest episode, which featured Panty and Stocking battling knockoff <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em>, Panty joked about not giving a shit about pets. Panty’s sister, Stocking, promptly called her the fuck out by mentioning Vibe and how Panty loved her.&nbsp;</p><p>The lack of energy from Amazon Prime surrounding one of the most surprising comedy shows of the season—especially since Prime Video is a strong contender with two gems, including the spiritual successor to the best slice-of-life comedy of all time, <em>Nichijou</em>, <a href="https://www.primevideo.com/detail/CITY-THE-ANIMATION/0S1DSDV3YPNM8W8GZQK8FJTZ9H" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>City The Animation</em></a>, which is streaming exclusively on its platform—is not surprising but still disappointing. They did the same with <a href="https://aftermath.site/gundam-gquuuuuux-is-the-sum-of-its-parts-in-the-best-way-possible" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Mobile Suit</em> <em>Gundam GQuuuuuuX</em></a>, so I guess dropping the ball is just what Prime Video does, and promoting itself as a marketplace where people can subscribe to other anime services, such as HIDIVE and Crunchyroll, through its storefront.&nbsp;</p><p>Every week, the official Studio Trigger account posts behind-the-scenes materials for its episodes, like <a href="https://aftermath.site/dandadan-anime-sakuga-science-saru" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Dan Da Dan</em>’s Science Saru</a>, to generate excitement and increase online engagement with the show. It also uploaded a documentary-style behind-the-scenes video to its official YouTube channel, connecting with fans and giving them a glimpse into the production process behind its premiere episode. Meanwhile, Prime Video has yet to say a word about the show’s new episodes.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="City: The Animation: Official Trailer | Prime Video" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7LsfqDEfmng?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Regardless, Trigger’s efforts to let their younger artists showcase their skills through lively animation that fills in the gaps of <em>New Panty &amp; Stocking</em>’s storyboards, along with sharp jokes, pop culture references, and emotionally resonant scenes—like Vibe and a moment where the girls <a href="https://x.com/AniTrendz/status/1954241269971947789" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">help baby turtles on their arduous pilgrimage to the ocean</a>—not only prove the show’s status as a revival of a cult classic worth watching but also serve as reminders that its bratty leads have a soft, angelic side after all.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/blizzard-union-story-franchise-cwa"><h3>Hell Yeah, Another Blizzard Union</h3></a><p>Members of Blizzard’s Story and Franchise Development team have unionized with the Communications Workers of America</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/the-drifter-point-click-adventure-game-lucasarts-king-carpenter-australia"><h3>I Bloody Love The Drifter</h3></a><p>A homage to Lucasarts, John Carpenter and so much more</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/tiny-bookshop-impressions"><h3>Recommending Books Is The Best Part Of Tiny Bookshop</h3></a><p>Forget The Lorax, kid; it's time for classic architecture</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/panty-stocking-studio-trigger-cat-vibe-amazon-prime]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/krafton-fires-back-unknown-worlds-founders-lawsuit-subnautica-2/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/krafton-fires-back-at-unknown-worlds-founders%E2%80%99-lawsuit-alleges-absentee-founders-%E2%80%9Cimpacted%E2%80%9D-subnautica-2%E2%80%99s-development-team.1268343/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>KRAFTON, owner of Subnautica 2 developer Unknown Worlds, has responded to the lawsuit filed by Unknown Worlds co-founders, doubling-down on allegations that co-founders Charlie Cleveland and Max McGuire had "<em>abandoned</em>" their roles at the studio, and that their absence had been impacting the development team for Subnautica 2 as far back as July 2023.</p>



<p>Backing up slightly, Charlie Cleveland, Max McGuire, and Ted Gill, each co-founder of Unknown Worlds and together creators of the original Subnautica, <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-allegedly-sabotaged-subnautica-2-to-delay-avoid-paying-250-million-bonus/">sued their former employer, KRAFTON</a>, after KRAFTON fired all three of them and delayed Subnautica 2 from its initial 2025 release window into 2026. There's a whole whack of <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-confirms-subnautica-2-leaked-documents-are-real/">events that led up to that lawsuit you can check out in a bullet-point list, here.</a></p>



<p>A key element that KRAFTON has pushed since the public dispute between Cleveland, McGuire, Gill, and KRAFTON began is KRAFTON's allegation that the co-founders<em> </em>weren't actually working on Subnautica 2 at all, and in the company's <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/900707287/Defendant-s-Answer-to-Verified-Complaint?secret_password=ha0mUjTuK1JQkOU4QaYn">response filing published August 12, 2025</a>, KRAFTON tries to drill that point home even further.</p>



<p>KRAFTON claims that once it had successfully acquired Unknown Worlds, Cleveland and McGuire took their earnings from the sale and "<em>quickly lost interest in developing Subnautica 2</em>," the filing reads.</p>



<p>"<em>Cleveland and McGuire abandoned their roles as studio-wide game director and technical director to focus on their personal passion projects and quit making games for Unknown Worlds entirely. And Gill, who remained, focused on leveraging his operational control to maximize the earnout payment, rather than developing a successful game</em>."</p>



<p>The filing continues to allege that Cleveland in particular had left his videogame development career to pursue filmmaking, another point that KRAFTON has brought up before.</p>



<p>KRAFTON goes on to allege that two months prior to Cleveland, McGuire, and Gill claiming the game was ready for an early access launch, the development lead on Subnautica 2 said the first stage of early access for the game would be "<em>about 12% of our intended 1.0 scope</em>," and that the lead joked the game "<em>would be in development for 30 years</em>" at the current pace it was going earlier this year.</p>



<p>To further its point about Cleveland and McGuire leaving their posts, KRAFTON claims the two co-founders declined to return to their roles as game director and technical director, and that Gill had even stated "<em>there's no coming back to a job they didn't have</em>." Following that, KRAFTON includes a statement allegedly from Cleveland, in which Cleveland admits that Subnautica 2's development began with the intention of having a younger generation of development talent at Unknown Worlds take the helm for the sequel, and that he knew that he "<em>wasn't going to be running that team</em>" from the beginning.</p>



<p>All of this will be worked out in the courts over the course of the coming months, potentially even years, and right now the dispute can be boiled down to both sides flinging claims at the other that we can't yet know to be totally true. </p>



<p>Whichever way it goes, it'll be interesting to see how this dispute ends, and which of the claims being flung end up sticking.</p>

              <p><span>Most of us probably moved on from dial-up decades ago, but AOL, or as most people who grew up in the ‘90s and early aughts might remember it, America Online, is </span><a href="https://help.aol.com/articles/dial-up-internet-to-be-discontinued"><span>only just now in 2025 fully discontinuing the service</span></a><span>. For the young’uns among us, dial-up is a wired internet connection that monopolizes your phone line–this dates back to when most people’s primary telephone service was over landline–in exchange for pretty slow internet speeds by today’s standards. Nowadays most people use broadband internet, so dial-up has become less and less common, but somehow, AOL has kept its service going for decades. It’s finally officially shutting down on September 30.</span></p> <p><span>For most people, this is a moment of “oh, I didn’t realize people were still using dial-up,” but according to the </span><a href="https://data.census.gov/table/ACSDT1Y2023.B28011?q=B28011"><span>Census Bureau</span></a><span>, an estimated 163,401 households were operating on dial-up as of 2023. I wouldn’t be surprised if most of those homes are older people who only use the internet for things like email and the occasional Google search.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Whatever the case, if you were alive and alert in the ‘90s, you were likely very aware of AOL and its internet services. And even if you </span><i><span>weren’t </span></i><span>alive then, you’ve probably heard the “</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjnyY85-gp0"><span>You’ve got mail</span></a><span>’ sound effect AOL played out of your speakers when you got a new email. Good lord, imagining that clip playing with the frequency at which the average 2025 inbox receives email sounds miserable. I suppose it’s just an example of how far the internet has come since AOL’s heyday.</span></p>

 <p><span>My family couldn’t afford dial-up until I was near the end of elementary school, so a lot of my early dial-up memories are of getting online at a family friend’s house or my uncle’s place to print out pictures of Shadow the Hedgehog for my school binder and watch music videos that took so long to buffer they looked like slideshows. A lot of people who are a bit older than me probably have memories of playing online games on dial-up, but its unreliability is also part of why </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/15-years-later-heres-why-a-gamer-was-duct-taped-to-a-c-1796679499"><span>in-person LAN parties</span></a><span> were so prominent back then. Nowadays, the internet has gotten good enough that we create virtual facsimiles of what used to be our workarounds for poor internet. Discord calls and online lobbies are another part of the average gamer’s life, so somehow we’ve come full circle. But while the internet has long since outpaced dial-up’s capabilities, it’s hard to overstate just how prominent AOL and its services were.</span></p> <p><span>AOL’s folksy “You’ve got mail” voice clip, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/a-nostalgic-game-that-spills-out-into-your-internet-bro-1795666514"><span>its Instant Messenger app</span></a><span>, and the sound of a modem screaming to establish a dial-up connection are nearly as synonymous with ‘90s nostalgia as boy bands, the original 151 Pokemon, and the Internet Explorer logo. AOL’s dial-up, and the assortment of chatrooms and services it offered, were so embedded in the public image of the internet that our cultural perception of it as a kind of ISP/online hub has outlasted its actual providing of internet service.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Once it seemed poised to take over the world, buying Time Warner in 2001 in what was then the largest corporate merger in history. But those days are long gone. Did you know AOL merged with news website and search engine </span><i><span>Yahoo! </span></i><span>in 2015, and is now </span><a href="https://www.aol.com/"><span>mostly an aggregate site</span></a><span>? It’s a bit sad that something that was once so unifying as a cultural artifact is now unrecognizable. AOL’s shift is the result of decades of changing hands, </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/03/media/verizon-yahoo-sold-apollo/index.html"><span>private equity fuckery</span></a><span>, and massive changes in the market. It turns out even the biggest businesses can crater. If you live long enough, you, too, can outlive corporate gods as they topple into the abyss.</span></p>

<p>Resident Evil fans get ready because the next look at Resident Evil Requiem will be coming during Gamescom Opening Night Live.</p>



<p>First claimed by regular Resident Evil leaker <a href="https://xcancel.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1955312103188992041" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dusk Golem</a>, there will be a “new showing” of the game during the show with a media embargo with more details on August 20.</p>



<p><strong>“[Then] it’ll be at Tokyo Game Show next month, too,”</strong> he said.</p>



<p>The Gamescom Opening Night Live appearance was then <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1955252938232021272" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">confirmed by Geoff Keighley</a>.</p>



<p>Aside from the appearance at Gamescom, Dusk Golem also gave a bit more details on what players can expect from the game. Specifically, the role that Leon will have.</p>



<p><strong>“As far as I know, part of RE9’s whole “Long Awaited Endings &amp; New Beginnings” stuff is supposed be Leon’s last major role in the timeline (sure he’ll still pop up in CG movies &amp; earlier timeline stuff), so you got that to look forward to with Resident Evil Requiem then,”</strong> <a href="https://xcancel.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1955309595418890576" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">he said.</a></p>



<p>Gamescom Opening Night Live takes place on <strong>August 19 at 11am PT / 2pm ET / 7pm BST / 8pm CEST</strong>. Insider Gaming will have full coverage of everything Gamescom LIVE from Cologne, Germany.</p>



<p>During his <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-returns-to-survival-horror/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-off preview of the game</a> back in June, Insider Gaming’s Albert Perkins said that, <strong>“I could feel my shoulders tensing up as she peeked around the corner of each room and made her way down the dark, narrow hallway. And I mean – DARK to the point that the darkness nearly swallowed her into the abyss. Capcom does survival horror right, and this game will do its job of scaring the hell out of you early and often, I guarantee it.”</strong></p>



<p>Resident Evil Requiem is scheduled to release on February 27, 2026 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. </p>



<p>What do you think the story holds in Resident Evil Requiem for Leon, and what are you hoping to see at Opening Night Live from the game? Let us know down below, and take the discussion further in the official Insider Gaming forums.</p>
