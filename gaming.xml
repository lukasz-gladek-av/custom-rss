<figure><a title="FF TACTICS REMASTER CUT CONTENT" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d36bc87bfa3d6/ff-tactics-remaster-cut-content.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>The team behind the upcoming <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/final_fantasy_tactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a> remaster, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles">Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles</a>, has been talking shop in an interview over at the official <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/final-fantasy-tactics-interview">Square Enix website</a> (spotted via <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-had-to-be-brute-forc-1851784636">Kotaku</a>). But this interview reveals that not all content from previous releases of the game will be present.</p>
<p>During the in-depth chat, the remaster’s director, Square Enix and Creative Unit III's Kazutoyo Maehiro, when asked about the biggest challenges involved, was quick to point out how the creation of this new version of the game was an arduous procedure.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067owxipj&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>The process saw the team faced with cobbling the remaster together from numerous versions and sources - mostly due to the fact a game's source code back from the PS1 version could so quickly be augmented or deleted in part, or even entirely. Maehiro says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We analyzed a number of existing versions of the game and reconstructed the programming of the original, but there were also times where we played the original game and worked it out by feel alone...</p>
<p>The entire process was the result of cumulative hard work - on the one hand working to implement new features, while behind the scenes our work was similar to porting an old arcade game to the NES."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While The Ivalice Chronicles enhances the original game with a host of improvements, which include updated UI, new difficulty options, all-new voice acting and conversations, and modern quality-of-life features like autosave, battle speed changes and so on, the PSP content won't be included in this rerelease.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/psp/final_fantasy_tactics_the_war_of_the_lions">Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions</a>, which launched in 2007 on Sony's portable handheld, is probably the most beloved version. It added in a Shakespeare-styled script, additional cutscenes, extra job classes in Dark Knight and Onion Knight, and a multiplayer mode. All of this has been dropped for 2025's version.</p>
<p>When asked about this, Maehiro explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We did of course consider the addition of new jobs, abilities, and characters—including the jobs featured in War of the Lions. However, the original version of Final Fantasy Tactics is a very complete game both from a game design and story perspective. If we were to make major changes, it would only be a loss for not only fans of the original game, but also those new to the title.</p>
<p>With this in mind, our first step in reviving Final Fantasy Tactics in the present was to adhere to the original and put a spotlight on the original game’s characters and jobs, as well as the original gameplay experience.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whilst this is understandable, and the PSP version did also have some big performance issues, it's definitely a disappointment that we aren't seeing a big push for a fully inclusive final edition of sorts here. That also means the iOS version has been sidelined here, too.</p>
<p>The full interview is worth checking out via the link above, as Maehiro is full of lovely little tidbits of information about the process of putting the game together thus far!</p>

The show seems to be making multiple stops in several states, so if you can’t make it to one show, look and see if they’ve got another nearby you can swing. Alongside the aforementioned games which are headlining the concerts, they’ll also feature some selections from <em>Astro Bot</em>, <em>Journey</em>, <em>Uncharted</em>, <em>Helldivers II</em>, and <em>Bloodborne</em>. All good picks if you were wanting to host a tribute to modern PlayStation, but I gotta say, I’m bummed we’ve got nothing that debuted on the original PlayStation or even the PS2. Yeah, <em>God of War </em>started on the second console, but the only games featured in the trailer for the show are from the Norse-themed reboot on the PS4.</p><p>Where’s my <em>Parappa the Rapper</em> medley? What about the sultry tones of a <em>Sly Cooper </em>song? You just put out a <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank </em>game on the PS5. Why are we forgetting the games that helped pave the way for the big prestige blockbusters? The show’s three months away, so there’s probably not a ton of time to shift the setlist around to spotlight older games.

            <title><![CDATA[Young Democrats Are Running Very Online Campaigns In 2025]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/kat-abughazaleh-congress-online</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/young-democrats-are-running-very-online-campaigns-in-2025.1220961/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/kat-abughazaleh-congress-online<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There was a specific moment that made Kat Abughazaleh realize the Democrats needed a new approach, and that maybe she could have a role to play. After years of warning politicians and the media about the right’s online tactics as a journalist, she watched everything she was afraid of play out during Trump’s 2025 inauguration.</p><p>“Everyone was sitting behind Trump [tech industry leaders like Musk, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and Apple CEO Tim Cook], and I was like, ‘Okay, maybe, maybe this is an exception.’ Maybe [Democrats will] do something. And then they just didn't,” she says. “I just wrote in my planner that day: ‘I'm gonna run for Congress. Fuck it’.”</p><p>The 26-year-old blonde-haired, blue-eyed Palestinian journalist first built a career dispelling disinformation and exposing the alt-right for publications like Media Matters and <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/07/jd-vance-trump-vice-president-tucker-carlson-fox-news-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mother Jones,</a> using TikTok to share her research because she saw the <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/02/27/legacy-news-media-future/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">writing on legacy media’s wall years ago. N</a>ow she’s running for Congress on a platform that feels ripped from a progressive Reddit thread or lefty Discord chat logs, with the hope that she’ll be a blueprint for other young folks to run for office.</p><p>Her run for Chicago’s 9th District began just this past March and will continue through 2026, with the primary in March ahead of the election in November. Her campaign has faced criticism from both the right and the left: Some have suggested that her recent move to Chicago (personal, not political), along with her not living in the confines of the 9th District, makes her a potential politician unaware of what the district needs. (Abughazaleh began her run against incumbent Democrat <a href="https://rollcall.com/2025/05/05/jan-schakowski-illinois-democrat-retires/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jan Schakowsky, who announced her retirement in early May.)</a> Others have suggested her internet fame means nothing in the Congressional arena.</p><p>Her campaign appears, at a glance, to be Very Online—with clapbacks, clever videos, and a keen eye for what can be meme-ed or mocked. But can that translate to the real world, especially for someone so young, and with so little tangible political experience?</p><figure><figcaption>Kat Abughazaleh</figcaption></figure><p>Abughazaleh routinely calls out establishment Democrats, dresses down detractors who rely on misogynistic tropes, has <a href="https://x.com/MattGertz/status/1653410599030738947" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scared the shit out of Tucker Carlson</a>, been blocked by rabid anti-LGBTQ+ poster Chaya Raichik (Libs of TikTok) for years, and recently spent a lengthy deposition (“seven hours of the funniest transcript and video and I’ve never looked hotter,” she says) systematically tearing down the right-wing talking points of Elon Musk’s lawyers. Her required Congressional <a href="https://x.com/KatAbughazaleh/status/1923074366415221013/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">financial disclosures show</a> just how little journalists make (she was salaried at $40,775 dollars with Media Matters), while her social media feeds show just how much shit they take. The results of her campaign are a long ways away, but her positions and how she communicates them are already speaking to a generation of young voters who feel disenfranchised and frustrated by the way the American government has operated in the post-Obama era.</p><p>Abughazaleh and I talk over FaceTime in early May, just a few days after an indistinguishable rightwing content creator <a href="https://x.com/KatAbughazaleh/status/1919071706888405018" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wondered in a video if she was “just an e-thot flexing her Zoomer clout for votes”</a> while showing a picture of her in a bar, wearing a black crop top, black denim shorts, and black fishnets.&nbsp;</p><p>Abughazaleh’s fashion preferences are regularly trotted out to try to discredit her, with a recent, <a href="https://www.chicagocontrarian.com/blog/chicago-social-media-influencer-congressional-candidate-kat-abughazaleh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pervy essay from the Chicago Contrarian</a> calling her a “social contagion” and referencing an old Instagram post in which she wears black lingerie and fishnet stockings.“Conservative men be normal about me once challenge,” she <a href="https://x.com/KatAbughazaleh/status/1923477996742094908/photo/3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted on Twitter</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>“A lot of campaigns, especially establishment campaigns, would be like, ‘delete your social media,’” Abughazaleh says. “I kept it up very purposely—pictures of me bartending, that video of me taking a shot of Malort, or me in a Charizard onesie. Because first off, politicians are just people, and I think it's fine to have someone in an office who has fun and a personality, but also they just latch on to that…And you can just turn it around and be like, ‘Oh no, don't show everyone that I'm hot and fun and worked a service industry job.’ Nooo, don't do that.”</p><p>White House counselor <a href="https://ca.news.yahoo.com/trumps-adviser-made-shameful-dig-222036975.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alina Habba recently did this to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a>, showcasing the right’s tendency to use service work to denigrate women they’re afraid of. But Abughazaleh, unlike so many establishment Dems seemingly determined to play nice and safe in the face of rampant fascism (Tim Walz, who reinvigorated a young Democratic base by calling the GOP weird before he was muzzled by his own party, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/08/tim-walz-2024-campaign-critiques-00219718" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently told Politico</a> his presidential campaign with Kamala Harris should have “rolled the dice more”), can and will clap back.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Why Conservatives Hate Being Called &quot;Weird&quot;" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kNwXK4iEfWw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>While people desperately <a href="https://aftermath.site/twitch-youtube-tiktok-politics-election-hasan-piker-donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">search for “left-wing Joe Rogan</a>” who can successfully blend culture with politics so that the former affects the latter, Abughazaleh brings a combination of a shit-poster’s biting wit and the research-backed expertise of a journalist to actual politics with her Congressional run. She <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7OhclGO3CY&amp;t=23s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">declares</a> it’s time for establishment Democrats to “drop the excuses and grow a fucking spine.” As the far right subsumes more of the internet, her website lists Musk, Raichik, and Carlson as “anti-endorsements,” and she turned the aforementioned Chicago Contrarian smear article into a nine-and-a-half-minute <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RUt6TX0Hmc&amp;ab_channel=KatAbughazaleh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube video.&nbsp;</a></p><p>“I’ve been called a slut, a whore, DEI Barbie, and every other name you could think of. Basically, I’m a woman who should keep her mouth shut and her legs spread, but instead, I ran for Congress. And the ‘facts don’t care about your feelings crowd’ seems to have a lot of feelings about it,” she says in the video.&nbsp;</p><p>Abughazaleh knows the online right’s tactics because she researched them for years. She’s well-versed in how the hateful ideologies they spread can bleed into our real world with relative ease.</p><p>“The Twitter main character of the day might not matter in the electorate, but the way the internet shapes politics now is very different from 2005…GamerGate and shit like that fed into Trump, Tucker Carlson used to farm stories from 4Chan to talk about on Fox…these things are very real, and the ways they affect us are very real,” she says.</p><figure><figcaption>Kat Abughazaleh</figcaption></figure><p>This <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2022/09/january-6-insurrection-meme-wars/671397/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“wires to the weeds”</a> method, where things that happen online spread to the real world, has worked for right-wingers: After the first iteration of GamerGate in 2014, Trump’s former <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/talkingtech/2017/07/18/steve-bannon-learned-harness-troll-army-world-warcraft/489713001/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon admitted to utilizing angry gamers</a> to help boost the then-candidate’s reach and commandeer the 2016 election by flooding the playing field with shit. The establishment left has harnessed it with less success; Democrats have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/20/us/politics/democrats-influencers-trump.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plans to pay influencers</a> to try to take a slice of that digital pie in an attempt to build an influencer army like the one that helped push Trump into a second presidency. But it’s difficult to inorganically grow an ecosystem of rabid supporters, especially when popular sites like YouTube and now Twitter are <a href="https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/youtube-conspiracy-radicalization.php%5C" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">funneling users towards more reactionary content.</a></p><p>The right’s hateful ideologies used to remain on the margins of the internet, in spaces like 8Chan and KiwiFarms. Now, they’re taking over mainstream platforms like Twitter and YouTube. Streaming sites like Twitch have spawned numerous high-profile, reactionary content creators like Zack “Asmongold” Hoyt, who recently signed with the considerably more right-leaning platform Kick, just seven months after he was<a href="https://aftermath.site/asmongold-apology-palestine-hasan-piker-twitch-youtube" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> temporarily banned from Twitch for a racist rant against Palestinians</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The right has claimed a huge chunk of digital real estate, and now major social platforms are only <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/06/14/trump-white-house-dhs-memes-deportation/?pwapi_token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJyZWFzb24iOiJnaWZ0IiwibmJmIjoxNzQ5ODczNjAwLCJpc3MiOiJzdWJzY3JpcHRpb25zIiwiZXhwIjoxNzUxMjU1OTk5LCJpYXQiOjE3NDk4NzM2MDAsImp0aSI6ImRlNWMwYWE1LWRlMzYtNDNkNC04MDMwLTVjZGZhOGExNWIyMyIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5LzIwMjUvMDYvMTQvdHJ1bXAtd2hpdGUtaG91c2UtZGhzLW1lbWVzLWRlcG9ydGF0aW9uLyJ9.12eK1j0nznkORxi6dIDNJGuf6shNUGn06krFSKCytDk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">increasing</a> their square footage. This all happened, at least somewhat, organically, as <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/trust-and-safety-startups-big-tech/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">widespread tech industry layoffs</a> kneecapped trust and safety teams and <a href="https://www.freepress.net/big-tech-backslide-how-social-media-rollbacks-endanger-democracy-ahead-2024-elections" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">platforms rolled back hate speech protections</a> after leaders cozied up to Trump and his lackeys. Instead of dying after being exposed to sunlight, these reactionary beliefs survived, evolving ever so slightly to be somewhat more palatable to the general public. Today, most of the popular conservative content creators are savvy enough to avoid spewing outright slurs, but pepper their social media accounts with dog whistles.&nbsp;</p><p>The left may not be able to create a similarly successful network of influencers, or take back internet spaces covered in reactionary slime, but it <em>can</em> lean into its more internet-savvy, progressive candidates and let them loose. It’s unclear if Democrats will shift away from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mu_hCThhzWU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Michelle Obama’s 2016 imploration to “go high”</a> when conservatives go low and more towards what we briefly got a taste of when Tim Walz first stepped onto the campaign stage. Will Dems embrace the “dark woke,” an ideology that, according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/21/style/dark-woke-democrats-jasmine-crockett-trump.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The New York Times</a>, is “an attempt to step outside the bounds of the political correctness that Republicans have accused Democrats of establishing…being crass but discerning, rude but only to a point”? Or will they continue to try to “play nice” with a party increasingly overrun with zealots?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="&quot;What Should Democratic Resistance Look Like?&quot;: Kat Abughazaleh Talks Elon + Democrats w/ Jen Psaki" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1SdLdm15rCc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Abughazaleh’s Congressional campaign could bridge this gap. However, that campaign faces challenges on the ground. She’s new to Chicago, having moved there last summer with her partner Ben Collins, who <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/04/the-onion-sold-g-o-media-global-tetrahedron-1235895683/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">purchased the Chicago-based satire publication The Onion<em> </em>from my former employer, G/O Media, in April of last year.</a> She doesn’t live in the 9th District where she’s running, though she told the <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/05/12/9th-congressional-race-schakowsky-replacement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chicago Tribune</a> she intends to move there. “There are plenty of districts that would be easier to carpetbag,” she told the outlet, referring to criticisms of her campaign. “I want to live where I want to live and run because it’s something I believe.”</p><p>But more than which district she lives in, there’s also the question of where she spends her time (online) and how (or if) that will translate to real-world action or appeal to real-world voters. Political strategist and Chicagoan Kitty Kurth recently suggested that Abughazaleh’s ability to get TikTok views won’t translate to votes at the polls, telling the Chicago Tribune<em> </em>in the aforementioned article that “it’s about knowing how to organize volunteers…you need someone who knows how to recruit volunteers and what to do with volunteers once you get them, and how to run a field operation. I don’t know that [Abughazaleh] has worked in a political organization, volunteered on a campaign, or knows what it’s like to run a petition drive.”&nbsp;</p><p>Abughazaleh recently <a href="https://x.com/KatAbughazaleh/status/1923083746284113962" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced the creation of a volunteer Discord server</a>, asking for people to join who have “ideas or skills” that could help her campaign. She began holding daily office hours from 12-6, and <a href="https://x.com/KatAbughazaleh/status/1924511819541991609" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wants her campaign office to become “a community space where people can pick up resources</a>,” asking for donations of canned food, period products, Narcan, and nail clippers. She ran a food drive for Evanston Community Fridge, picketed with Northwestern University’s dining hall workers, walked in the recent anti-ICE protests, and hopes to teach potential constituents how to knit at her rather spacious campaign office. There is a concerted effort to make a local difference, to focus efforts and funds raised on mutual aid, to “materially improve as many lives as [she] can,” she tells me.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="How My Congressional Campaign Is Feeding People Right Now | Kat Abughazaleh For Illinois" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mMPmvoUaJa8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Part of that mutual aid has involved helping people run against her: She tells me she has a hard out during our chat because “someone is coming in today that wants to run against me, so I’m going to show her how to go through the FEC [Federal Election Commission] paperwork. Primaries should be competitive.”&nbsp;</p><p>This commitment to helping her ostensible opponents was recently taken up by another progressive candidate who’s proven popular online (and in the polls, something Abughazaleh has not faced yet); in mid-May, <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/zohran-mamdani?srsltid=AfmBOoqNixqeaSAc-Pw-7-xVa6GekXV5LWoZNEteFLZR0b7Yf0WTd5EYk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani</a> <a href="https://x.com/ZohranKMamdani/status/1924256260557361365" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">asked potential donors</a> to instead send their money to New York City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, who is also running for mayor, in an attempt to block former governor and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/01/26/cuomo-sexual-harassment-doj-00138140" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">noted sex pest Andrew Cuomo</a> from winning the Democratic primary in June. While Mamdani differs from Abughazaleh in that he’s been an elected politician since 2021 and is running for an entirely different office, the <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2025/01/21/zohran-mamdani-instagram-tiktok-social-media/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">online reach of his campaign</a> echoes hers, as does his demand that Democrats stop toeing the libertarian line and adopt more leftist ideologies.&nbsp;</p><p>These campaigns that blend the local and online are fairly new conceits (though they might remind New Yorkers of City Councilperson Chi Ossé’s 2021-2022 campaign), and they may not be successful–while <a href="https://pix11.com/news/politics/cuomos-lead-narrows-as-mamdani-gains-ground-in-nyc-mayor-race/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mamdani leads other Democrat mayoral candidates, and a recent (albeit small) poll has him ahead of Cuomo</a>, he still faces a challenge–but they mark the left’s first real and consistent attempt to harness the power of shitposting and online organizing in a post-Trump landscape.&nbsp;</p><p>Both their campaigns draw on the enthusiasm of an audience tired of how the United States is a gerontocracy, run by desiccated Boomers who leave behind empty seats during one of the most crucial times in modern politics, with tight majorities and charged rhetoric edging us closer to the precipice of fascism. But by harnessing the power of the internet to get young folks out not just to the polls, but also to file their FEC forms, Abughazaleh hopes to take everything she’s learned about modern politics and political tactics and do something tangible.&nbsp;</p><p>“I want to give a permission structure to people—you don’t have to wait, no one is going to come and save us. We have to save ourselves,” Abughazaleh says. “If you want to run, do it, and this is how you do it.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/relooted-game-africa-museum-visa-nyamakop-interview"><h3>How Relooted, A Game About Reclaiming African Artifacts From Western Museums, Ended Up Being Shown By A White Guy At Summer Game Fest</h3></a><p>"Fucked up to be making a game about reclaiming African artifacts that are in Western countries, and Africans can't even visit those artifacts"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/mindseye-rocket-boy-impressions-review-pc"><h3>MindsEye Fuckin’ Sucks, Man</h3></a><p>'It looks like a parody Game Awards trailer.

Many reviews have less than an hour of playtime, meaning they either didn't spend much time in the game, they bounced off of the gameplay quickly, or some combination of both. Other reviews give positive feedback while calling other reviews disingenuous. In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/control-spin-off-fbc-firebreak-is-a-defiant-punk-rock-take-on-co-op-shooters/1100-6531475/">FBC: Firebreak preview</a>, Mark Delaney called the FPS "a defiant, punk rock take on co-op shooters."</p><p>FBC: Firebreak is the first multiplayer game from the studio behind Control and Alan Wake. It features teams of three--each person has their own distinct kit--taking on hordes of enemies while trying to accomplish a variety of objectives. There are three jobs available at launch, each with a number of difficulty settings that expand the length of the job and number of enemies.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4516001-ksof528n8b6f1.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4516001" data-ratio="0.56884057971014" data-width="828" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4516001-ksof528n8b6f1.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4516001"></a><figcaption>FBC: Firebreak post-launch roadmap</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4516001-ksof528n8b6f1.jpeg"></figure><p>Many reviews cite a lack of content as a reason for their disappointment.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/savage-raven-edc-switch-2-carry-case-a-sleek-alternative-to-nintendos-official-offering<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="skull and co case review" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/917cb4575b1ca/skull-and-co-case-review.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>We've already had a look at Nintendo's official Switch 2 carry case and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2-carry-case-the-official-option-is-a-solid-one">scored it a super solid 8/10</a>, commenting that it had too few cart spaces (at just six), but was nevertheless a compact and good-looking case for the money.</p>
<p>Now it's the turn of Skull &amp; Co., or 'Savage Raven' as the company has now rebranded, with the Switch 2 EDC Carry Case. I'll be honest, it makes me feel a little bit like I should really be dressing up as <strong>The Crow</strong> when I'm out and about with my console rocking a name like that on its little protective jacket, but hey, this is actually a very strong alternative to Nintendo's rather less street-wise offering. It also has two more cart spaces than that case. Upgrade unlocked!</p>
<p>You'll likely already be familiar with Skull &amp; Co. as they've become quite a big player on the accessory scene over the past few years. Indeed, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/hardware-skull-and-co-neogrip-for-switch-oled-review">we've previously reviewed the Switch OLED NeoGrip</a>, and I own a few other bits and pieces besides this case (which, for transparency, I bought with my own money in the run-up to the Switch 2 launch. Yes, I got a little excited. What of it?) So, as an owner of a few other items from the accessory-maker-formerly-known-as-Skull &amp; Co., I can tell you that this outfit makes some quality gear, and the story is no different here.</p>
<p>From the moment you pull this case from its packaging, you can feel the quality. This is a rugged offering in comparison to Nintendo's choice of smooth finish, and the black colour I've plumped for is understated (there are also 'multi-camo' and denim versions, if you prefer), which suits the impressively slim profile. Before I'd even gotten my Switch 2, this was actually the first time I realised just how slim the new console was going to be. It's ridiculous, and it helps the case tuck very easily into my rather small laptop bag, so it's good to go in terms of portability.</p>


<p>The case has two sturdy zips replete with nice little rubber logos, and a useful handle for when I want to carry it like I'm heading to a video gamer power meeting in the 1980s. The shell is composed of a tough 'Hardshell' material and the cover is water-resistant, too, something Nintendo's case does not have in its favour.</p>
<p>As I've already mentioned, it's wonderfully slim in profile, following the contours of the console closely, and making for a snug fit that <em>importantly</em> still has room enough for a console with its protective casing on. Nice work, folks! There is nothing more gutting than realising your shell has to come off every time. I've been in that war. I've felt that pain.</p>
<p>Inside, you're treated to a delightful velvet finish. Now, I'm not usually one for velvet at all, certainly not in its crushed variant, but here it's made for a surprisingly nice interior. It's soft, it feels luxurious, and your new console will undoubtedly love you forever, having been given such a comfortable and well-protected place to sleep.</p>
<p>More importantly, and perhaps of even more interest to you, dear reader, than how soft I find velvet in general, is the jazzy yellow strap which makes it nice and easy to lift the console out of its resting spot without resorting to pulling on the Joy-Con. You should note, too, that this case has got two extra spaces for game carts over the six found on the official Nintendo case alongside a nice little stretchy pocket, which could easily hold a further two carts if you don't mind pushing them in there.</p>
<p>Price-wise, in the UK you're looking at a <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Savage-Raven-Carrying-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0F473TTRC/ref=sr_1_5?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.4Cy1mbnYb4oYSGCL_wZzleSM_ZIil1EJWfALj3BaraQbq4FBXJdMyhbFHmJiG2l-CqUdO4Y_X8_NMIVZHqnxPKobgmdvfPn6G9-RE-MRLCzaWr83JcJ_oBxfK27c7oPeujBNJKchn8LXcGD6xo8Ykn2kIA0sIbTksUONeDhLniAXilYs9qg2ZxrkM258GU-93wfUvQ88knTfilQ3o1foFQ.fTH3Y5XxXurb3LgzdC2NVUdWiABSFnGoC9u47YBtwHw&amp;dib_tag=nlife-21&amp;keywords=savage%2Braven%2Bswitch%2B2&amp;qid=1750088201&amp;sr=8-5&amp;th=1" rel="sponsored noopener">£22.99 price tag</a> (in the US it's <a href="https://www.savage-raven.com/collections/nintendo-switch-2/products/savage-raven-by-skull-co-edc-carrying-case-for-nintendo-switch-2?variant=50452960280868">$29.99</a> but varying from $19.99 to around the $23 mark at the time of writing), which means it's just £2 more expensive than Nintendo's offering over here. Easily worth the extra, in my humble opinion, considering you get those two extra cart spaces.</p>

<p>Now, you do get a free screen protector bundled in with the Nintendo case, but to even things up Savage Raven has included a very nice cloth emblazoned with the Savage Raven logo, which I vastly prefer to a free screen-protector as I use these types of cloths to clean my glasses when I'm playing, so bonus brownie points to whoever made that decision as I've never had cleaner specta...I mean Switch 2 screens.</p>
<p>There is a bigger version of this particular case available, too, just as Nintendo has provided a bigger version of their own, and that <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Savage-Raven-Maxcarry-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0F47VD3KG/ref=sr_1_8?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.4Cy1mbnYb4oYSGCL_wZzleSM_ZIil1EJWfALj3BaraQbq4FBXJdMyhbFHmJiG2l-CqUdO4Y_X8_NMIVZHqnxPKobgmdvfPn6G9-RE-MRLCzaWr83JcJ_oBxfK27c7oPeujBNJKchn8LXcGD6xo8Ykn2kIA0sIbTksUONeDhLniAXilYs9qg2ZxrkM258GU-93wfUvQ88knTfilQ3o1foFQ.fTH3Y5XxXurb3LgzdC2NVUdWiABSFnGoC9u47YBtwHw&amp;dib_tag=nlife-21&amp;keywords=savage%2Braven%2Bswitch%2B2&amp;qid=1750088046&amp;sr=8-8&amp;th=1" rel="sponsored noopener">'MaxCarry' variant includes a further four slots for game carts</a>, up to a total of 12, plus a pouch for cables and accessories, pushing the price up to a still-fairly-reasonable £27.99 (or whatever that translates to where you are).</p>
<p>Overall, I'm more than happy with what I've got for just a few quid extra over Nintendo's case here. I prefer the duller/smarter finish over the shininess of the Big N's effort, and it helps that we've got a useful strap, extra spaces for carts. This case is water-resistant and can fit a Switch 2 console with a protective case or grip on. I'm also a fan of the use of colour inside this case as, alongside the velvet finish, it gives it a real premium look and feel when you crack it open for game time.</p>

			<p>Xbox president Sarah Bond has just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOCtRanwXrA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a multi-year deal with AMD to power multiple gaming devices, including the successor of the Xbox Series X. Here's her complete statement from the brief video announcement:</p>
<p><em>At Xbox, our vision is for you to play the games you want, with the people you want, anywhere you want. That's why we're investing in our next-generation hardware lineup, across console, handheld, PC, cloud, and accessories. I am thrilled to share we've established a strategic multi-year partnership with AMD to co-engineer silicon across a portfolio of devices including our next generation Xbox consoles, in your living room, and in your hands.</em></p>
<p><em>Together with AMD, we're advancing the state of art in gaming silicon to deliver the next generation of graphics innovation to unlock a deeper level of visual quality and immersive gameplay and player experiences enhanced with the power of AI, all while maintaining compatibility with your existing library of Xbox games.</em></p>
<p><em>This is all about building you a gaming platform that's always with you, so you can play the games you want across devices anywhere you want, delivering you an Xbox experience not locked to a single store or tied to one device. That's why we're working closely with the Windows team, to ensure that Windows is the number one platform for gaming. The next generation of Xbox is coming to life, and this is just the beginning.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Xbox + AMD: Powering the Next Generation of Xbox" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VOCtRanwXrA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It seems like Microsoft wanted to confirm in an official capacity what insiders had <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-rumored-to-support-backward-compatibility-at-hardware-level/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already mentioned</a>, such as the fact that the next-generation Xbox will still be compatible with previous-generation games through backward compatibility. Interestingly, Sarah Bond did not reiterate <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-generation-largest-technical-leap-ever-seen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">her previous remark</a> about the next generation Xbox console delivering the 'largest technical leap ever' for consoles, though it's hard to say whether that means fans should lower their performance expectations.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, Microsoft has bypassed the mid-generation refresh (unlike Sony with its PlayStation 5 Pro) and seems ready to get a headstart on the next generation. According to the latest rumors, the Series X successor might <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-release-2027-premium-handheld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch</a> in a couple of years.</p>

Fishing, I think, is the truest of all video game power fantasies. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">Action</a> hero combat, romance wish fulfilment, god like abilities, all of that sort of thing pales in comparison to the act of fishing in a game. Just you, your rod, and a whole load of open water. I love to fish in video games, despite not being someone that has a strong desire to 100% genres like collectathons, I do love getting as many fish as I can, and I love a twist on the format. Enter Out Fishing, a mysterious sounding horror fishing game.

Where <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dredge">Dredge</a> sees you setting out into the open ocean on a boat to get the eldritch catch of the day, Out Fishing almost takes a calmer, more laid back approach. You have your own little camp near a lake, you can improve things like your rod strength and your reeling speed. Classic gamey kind of things, things you'd expect from a cosier game than this one, but then there's the fact that if you stay past sunset, you're greeted with… something, in the forest. Don't know what, but I hate the woods at night, so I'm already just a little bit anxious thinking about it.

I also really like one of the key features listed over on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3660260/Out_Fishing/">game's Steam page</a>: "A single, horrifying goal: reel in the one thing that was never meant to be found." That could literally mean anything. A dead body? A really weird fish? Repressed memories of a traumatic event? That last one sounds likely given that the devs cited Silent Hill as an influence (alongside <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake">Alan Wake</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mundaun">Mundaun</a>).
</p>
<p>
What I am curious about is how connected the horror elements will actually feel to the fishing side of things. I'm hoping the two will tie into each other rather than feeling like separate games. I won't find out for a while though, as there's no release date. I'll stick to the slightly less scary Sega Bass Fishing in the meantime.

Here are six things you can do while you’re driving all over the <em>Mario Kart World</em> map.</p><h2 id="h944805"><a id="1"></a>Collect and unlock new outfits</h2><figure id="" data-id="aca62b32579d5747c64415cfc5db3950" data-recommend-id="image://aca62b32579d5747c64415cfc5db3950" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Yoshi sits on a bike outside of a restaraunt.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There are outfits littered around every race track in <em>Mario Kart World</em>, allowing you to build wardrobes for every character.. Each outfit is tied to certain foods packed into smiling lunch bags called Dash Food sitting outside of Yoshi’s restaurants. Sometimes, Dash Food can also be found on top of pickup trucks with ramps. Dash Food works similarly to Mushrooms, too: In addition to changing your appearance, you’ll get a speed boost.</p><p>However, not everyone who eats the same food item will unlock the same outfit. For example, if you’re racing as Mario, Luigi, Peach, Daisy or Yoshi and you pick up a burger, you’ll get the Touring outfit. If you’re playing as Bowser, Wario or Waluigi, the burger will trigger the Biker outfit. Eat cake while you’re playing as any of the eight aforementioned characters plus Toad and Koopa and you’ll be wearing the Pro Racer outfit, but do so with Donkey Kong and you’ll get the All-Terrain outfit.</p><h2 id="h944806"><a id="2"></a>Complete challenges</h2><figure id="" data-id="390eba98d1d5f1e1e16aa23ac410b225" data-recommend-id="image://390eba98d1d5f1e1e16aa23ac410b225" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Yoshi sits on a bike in a snowy environment." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Yoshi sits on a bike in a snowy environment." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Cristina Alexander / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="390eba98d1d5f1e1e16aa23ac410b225" data-recommend-id="image://390eba98d1d5f1e1e16aa23ac410b225" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Yoshi sits on a bike in a snowy environment." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While driving around the world map, you’ll come across the giant blue P-Switches that are found either on the side of the road or are lying somewhere off-road.

Others will test your timing on using certain items, like the Feather, which allows you to jump up to five feet in the air to reach high places and avoid incoming projectiles. You can replay the challenges as many times as you want to beat your record if you so desire. </p><h2 id="h944807"><a id="3"></a>Rack up coins</h2><figure id="" data-id="c016355b09436a39efc73de957baa3a5" data-recommend-id="image://c016355b09436a39efc73de957baa3a5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Pricness Peach sits in a kart in a snowy environment." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Pricness Peach sits in a kart in a snowy environment." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Cristina Alexander / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c016355b09436a39efc73de957baa3a5" data-recommend-id="image://c016355b09436a39efc73de957baa3a5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Pricness Peach sits in a kart in a snowy environment." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>For the hustlers out there, you can find piles of coins hidden in every nook and cranny of the tracks. Keep your eyes peeled behind Yoshi’s restaurants, on top of billboards, in bushes, atop hilltops, and on boardwalks, just to name a few places. </p><p>Coin piles vary in size, from a stack of five coins to a money bag’s worth of 100 coins (or more). Don’t be surprised if you see a small stack of coins every once in a while. No matter what the size of the coin pile, they all add up to unlocking more new karts and other sweet rewards, like stickers.</p><h2 id="h944808"><a id="4"></a>Find Question Mark panels</h2><figure id="" data-id="d2a89377941b2fa7128b18eabdea2a29" data-recommend-id="image://d2a89377941b2fa7128b18eabdea2a29" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Princess Peach stands near a question-mark panel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Princess Peach stands near a question-mark panel." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Cristina Alexander / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d2a89377941b2fa7128b18eabdea2a29" data-recommend-id="image://d2a89377941b2fa7128b18eabdea2a29" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Princess Peach stands near a question-mark panel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Each track has five Question Mark (“?”) panels hidden in various places. The panels don’t exactly do much when you run over them except give you new stickers to put on your karts. These are fun to collect. </p><p>And if you want an extra challenge: Activating 10 ? panels, is one of the ways to unlock Mirror Mode, which lets you race a track backwards.</p><h2 id="h944809"><a id="5"></a>Collect Peach medallions</h2><figure id="" data-id="7a33a53245b650ba87b7daf54fdd114f" data-recommend-id="image://7a33a53245b650ba87b7daf54fdd114f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Princess Peach rides a motorcycle near the shore." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Princess Peach rides a motorcycle near the shore." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Cristina Alexander / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7a33a53245b650ba87b7daf54fdd114f" data-recommend-id="image://7a33a53245b650ba87b7daf54fdd114f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Princess Peach rides a motorcycle near the shore." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you love collecting foreign coins in the real world, you’ll love collecting Peach Medallions. They’re basically giant coins that have a beautiful silhouette of Princess Peach’s profile engraved on them. They’re mostly found in high-rise places, like construction rails, musical blocks, thin columns, and aerial loops that you need to fly through. You can also find them in places you least expect, like a little islet beside the raging sea.</p><p>Peach Medallions are more like talismans than medallions because they lack a chain, but they’re medallions nonetheless. Unlike stocking up on rare coins IRL, collecting 10 of Peach’s coins will also unlock Mirror Mode.</p><h2 id="h944810"><a id="6"></a>Just take a relaxing drive!</h2><figure id="" data-id="8020eaf2c2c35b063096676f18c6ee5d" data-recommend-id="image://8020eaf2c2c35b063096676f18c6ee5d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Princess Peach goes for a drive in the desert." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Princess Peach goes for a drive in the desert." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Cristina Alexander / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8020eaf2c2c35b063096676f18c6ee5d" data-recommend-id="image://8020eaf2c2c35b063096676f18c6ee5d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Princess Peach goes for a drive in the desert." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Free Roam is perfect if you want to take a break from races and party battles with other players. Go for a relaxing road trip around the world and forget about the worries of the world. No races, no battles, no challenges–just you, your vehicle of choice, and the wide open road to help you take in the sights and sounds of every track you visit and the people you meet along the way–just like a real-life road trip would do.</p><p>You can also park somewhere to take a picture of yourself with Photo Mode. Like many other games, this feature lets you customize your character’s expressions and poses as they sit by the sunset, the mountains, the beach, or any breathtaking locale you take them. Those pictures will make great wallpapers for your PC or phone later on. Just make sure you remove the control guides before you snap any pics.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

At first, the rat struggles and panics because it thinks it’s drowning. But eventually it calms and starts breathing the liquid, which contains oxygen. Five rats were used, and they all lived. However, many found the scene disturbing, and in the UK, this scene was banned and removed from all versions of <em>The Abyss </em>at the request of the RSPCA. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rspca.org.uk/-/fears-of-streaming-loophole-as-disney-plus-airs-prohibited-rat-abuse-scene&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rspca.org.uk/-/fears-of-streaming-loophole-as-disney-plus-airs-prohibited-rat-abuse-scene" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">But this scene was later included in the Disney+ version of the movie</a></span>, which <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://filmstories.co.uk/news/the-abyss-rspca-expresses-concern-over-uncut-rat-scenes-appearance-on-disney/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://filmstories.co.uk/news/the-abyss-rspca-expresses-concern-over-uncut-rat-scenes-appearance-on-disney/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">was added to the service in April</a></span>.</p><p>Here’s the scene, but be warned that this is a real rat struggling to breathe and some might find it hard to watch. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/sci-fi-movies/disney-plus-removes-a-classic-james-cameron-sci-fi-movie-after-featuring-a-troubling-scene-that-was-cut-from-previous-releases/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/sci-fi-movies/disney-plus-removes-a-classic-james-cameron-sci-fi-movie-after-featuring-a-troubling-scene-that-was-cut-from-previous-releases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On June 17, GamesRadar</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/disney-removes-hollywood-film-controversial-31873734&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/disney-removes-hollywood-film-controversial-31873734" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">other outlets</a></span> reported that <em>The Abyss</em> had been removed from Disney+ after the RSPCA called out the media giant for including the scene and taking advantage of a “loophole” that allows streamers to ignore some local film and TV regulations. </p><p>“This isn’t about cancel culture—we’d welcome Disney Plus reinstating the film to their platform, just with this troubling scene removed—as is already the case in cinemas, on TV, and on DVD,” the RSPCA’s Head of Public Affairs said in a statement.</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>This was instead about highlighting a loophole that currently exists, allowing animal abuse scenes deemed unacceptable elsewhere to be streamed freely and legally into our homes—and protecting the public from having to see this animal abuse content.</p></blockquote><p> For many years, the film was difficult to watch, as it wasn’t available on streaming platforms and physical copies were out of print. But last year, a 4K version of the movie was finally released. Like some of Cameron’s other 4K releases, it makes some visual changes that people aren’t happy with, but overall, it is a fine way to watch <em>The Abyss</em>. However, in the UK, you can no longer watch this version on Disney+ because of that single, short scene involving a rodent. Hopefully, Disney adds the movie back with that scene removed so folks in the UK can enjoy this underrated Cameron classic once more. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-sues-fortnite-cheat-maker/">Epic</a> has officially <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/squad-up-and-save-the-day-in-lego-fortnite-expeditions">announced</a> LEGO Fortnite Expeditions, a new PvE mode that is launching tomorrow, on&nbsp;<strong>June 18, 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Expeditions is a mission-based mode where you jump into various missions with three other players as a four-player co-op mode all with the aim of taking down a mysteriously masked villain, Mask Maker Daigo, who will destroy the world if you and your friends don't put a stop to his antics first.</p>
<p>You'll head out on these missions from your home base, the Supernova Academy, where you and the newly introduced heroes you'll play as, Shadow Caller, The Hunter, and Rift Ripper, are all training to become the next class of world-saving superheroes.</p>
<p>Epic also unveiled a gameplay trailer showing off each of the three hero classes in action, with Rift Ripper being extremely mobile and capable of reaching high areas with their Rift Jump and a Rift Dodge that works like a short-distance teleport.</p>
<p>Shadow Caller is very mobile in a different way, as they're able to hover above the ground while using magical projectiles to dispatch enemies. While The Hunter is a fast-moving ranged-focused class with a Bull's-eye Blade that can multiply the damage you do and make your attacks more accurate in battle.</p>
<p><iframe title="LEGO Fortnite Expeditions - Super Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hMOPVQSHIic?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Beyond the core powers each class has, you'll also be able to increase your damage output with what Epic is calling the 'Tools in the Toolbox,' which gives you the choice between Dual Daggers, a War Hammer, or Plasma Pistols, to add an extra punch to combat.</p>
<p>LEGO Fortnite Expeditions will be available tomorrow and will be found in Discover in LEGO Fortnite, or it can be accessed from Odyssey and Brick Life using the Battle Bus Station.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/zenless-zone-zero">Zenless Zone Zero</a> publishers HoYoverse are suing a player for $150,000 over a pre-release stream of a new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/honkai-star-rail">Honkai: Star Rail</a> character.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/honkai-star-rail-castorice-leak-lawsuit-hoyoverse">reported</a> by Nicole Carpenter over on the Gamefile newsletter (paywall), the Singapore-based publishers are taking one Alfredo Lopez to court after he broadcast an early look at Castorice, a melancholy floral dragon summoner, to a Discord channel with around 12,000 members. The lawsuit was filed on June 6th in the United States District Court's Central District of California.</p>
<p>According to HoYoverse's copyright claim, Lopez has "unfairly or unlawfully obtained a game update before its release date", but the suit appears more vexed by Lopez sharing footage of the character, than how he obtained the game build in question. </p>
<p>They argue that a leak such as this "dampens the excitement and anticipation that many players feel when they obtain the update legitimately upon its official release." It's worth noting that Castorice had already been revealed as an upcoming addition to the game - <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/esports/news-honkai-star-rail-amphoreus-trailer-featuring-castorice-revealed-the-game-awards-2024">during last December's Game Awards, no less</a>. </p>
<p>Honkai: Star Rail is a live service gacha game, with around 70 characters at the time of writing. Jason Coles thought it was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/honkai-star-rail-review">good fun</a> back in April 2023. I can see how the publisher of a game which thrives on the lure of randomly served or microtransacted anime fancy-dans might be extra prickly about having the goods screened ahead of schedule. On the other hand, I'm not particularly keen on billion-dollar publishers suing Discord streamers into the scorched earth over footage of a character we already know about.</p>
<p>As Carpenter comments in the newsletter, HoYoverse have proven <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-gaming-43885b83-8690-4687-9574-a8029abd586f.html?stream=top">pretty militant about going after leakers in the past</a>, though they're hardly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/epic-sue-over-fortnite-superhero-leak">alone in this</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/switch-2-users-report-online-console-bans-after-running-personal-game-%E2%80%9Cbackups%E2%80%9D.1220871/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/playing-personal-game-backups-could-get-your-switch-2-banned-by-nintendo/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>Earlier this week, the makers of the popular Mig Flash cartridge, which allows users to play Switch games loaded via an SD card without modifying the console itself, <a href="https://x.com/SwitchTools/status/1933967207840514159">issued a firmware update</a> enabling the cards to run original Switch games on the Switch 2. Since then, though, multiple Mig Flash users are reporting that they've seen their Switch 2 consoles banned from Nintendo's online servers, even in cases where the devices were only used to run backups of legitimate games the users purchased themselves.</p>
<p>"My Switch 2 test has been banned after using the Mig [Flash] with perfectly legal dumps of my own cartridges, so it would seem that Nintendo can detect something," popular hacking news account Switch Tools <a href="https://x.com/SwitchTools">posted on social media Monday</a> (along with <a href="https://x.com/SwitchTools/status/1934723908676338036">a follow-up showing a stack of legitimate Switch games</a> they said they had backed up using the device). "I strongly recommend that you do not use the Mig [Flash], it was already very risky to use but it is even more so on Switch 2."</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">My Switch 2 test has been banned, after using the mig switch with perfectly legal dumps of my own cartridges, so it would seem that Nintendo can detect something<br>
Similar reports on reddit are starting to come in.<a href="https://t.co/nbPMlRWSaP">https://t.co/nbPMlRWSaP</a><a href="https://t.co/3eq6dkbFMi">https://t.co/3eq6dkbFMi</a><br>
I strongly… <a href="https://t.co/btzjQYJzE4">pic.twitter.com/btzjQYJzE4</a></p>
<p>— SwitchTools (@SwitchTools) <a href="https://twitter.com/SwitchTools/status/1934637497985769875?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The insistence that the ban came while using "perfectly legal dumps of my own cartridges" is important here. Nintendo has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/06/inside-nintendos-perfect-method-for-detecting-online-switch-piracy/">long used certificates with robust cryptographic signatures</a> to identify when individual copies of Switch games are being shared for the purposes of piracy. If Nintendo notices the same cryptographic signature on security certificates being used by hundreds of different consoles and accounts, for instance, the company can be relatively sure that all those users are engaging in piracy.</p>
<p>But the Mig Flash can also be used for backup and play of an individual's legal Switch game purchases on a personal console, which shouldn't lead to any such signature conflicts. On <a href="https://migflash.com/#/:~:text=08/01/2024,held%20responsible%20for.">the Mig Flash website</a>, the developers of the device say they "only support and guarantee your gaming with your own games backups. This applies to online, too. If you want to play online with the full Mig Flash warranty, you need to use your own dumped backups... Failure to respect this rule might end up in bans from Nintendo online service, which we won't be held responsible for."</p>

                <p>After everyone spent the last couple weeks believing the headlining artist for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> Festival Season 9 would be Deadmau5, the reality ended up being something completely different: Bruno Mars will be the <em>actual</em> <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/bruno-mars-is-home-in-fortnite-festival-season-9" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">new Festival Icon</a> when Season 9 launches on Wednesday.</p><p>Bruno Mars is an interesting choice because he's already in Fortnite. The Silk Sonic set, which included skins for both Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak, was released way back in 2022. None of the eight previous Festival season headliners had been added to the game as skins prior to their respective seasons.</p><p>The new Fortnite Festival Season will come with a new Music Pass, which will be available for 1400 V-Bucks or via Fortnite Crew. The highlight is the Die With a Smile Bruno skin, which is based on the singer's look in the video for his and Lady Gaga's track Die With a Smile. That skin unlocks instantly when you purchase the pass, and you can gain XP across any Fortnite experience to progress the pass from there. Also included with the paid pass is a guitar, a drum kit, and jam tracks for Bruno-San's Theme Song, Silk Sonic's Leave the Door Open, ABC by tThe Jackson 5, and Mun Ra by Sabotage. There are free rewards as well for those who don't buy the pass, including instruments, auras, and four jam tracks.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4515832-fortnitebrunomarsshopstuff.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4515832" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4515832-fortnitebrunomarsshopstuff.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4515832"></a><figcaption>This new Bruno Mars skin will be available in the Fortnite item shop throughout Festival Season 9.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4515832-fortnitebrunomarsshopstuff.jpg"></figure><p>Naturally, Bruno Mars will also have a set of cosmetics in the shop throughout the season, starting with the Bruno-San skin, which has two distinctive styles. Alongside the skin will be a back bling, a contrail, a keytar, a bass, and both an emote and jam track for his song Bonde do Brunão--all of these will be included in one big bundle. Outside the bundle, the shop will also have jam tracks for Die With a Smile by Bruno Mars and Lady Gaga, and APT by Rose and Bruno Mars.</p><p>For longtime Fortnite players, this update will also come with a feature that's been heavily requested for years and years: If you set your lobby music to random, it will actually play a different song when the one you're listening to finishes. Since lobby music was first introduced to Fortnite in Chapter 1 Season 6--that was seven years ago!--the random feature would simply pick one song and play it on a loop until you left the lobby.</p>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Owning these new business fronts allows access to unique Money-Laundering missions. Earnings from these laundering operations are stored inside the player's duffle bag found in the car wash bedroom. To celebrate the launch of Money Fronts, Rockstar says that missions launched from the Hands On Car Wash will pay out 2X GTA$ and RP this week.</p><p dir="ltr">Getting into the laundering business also benefits other operations in GTA Online. Owning the car wash boosts all Counterfeit Cash Factory sales from a player's MC business, while owning the dispensary provides a bump to all Weed Farm sales. Additionally, Operating Higgins Helitours as a front results in a lift for all Air Freight Cargo.</p><p dir="ltr">While money laundering is great for building a cash empire, there are some risks that come with cleaning all that dirty money. Money-Laundering missions raise suspicion from the authorities in the form of Heat on the various business fronts. Businesses with Heat will be flagged with caution signals on the map, and it requires players to cool things back down by completing legal activity. This means activities such as cleaning customer cars at the car wash and delivering legal weed for the dispensary.</p><p dir="ltr">Mr. Faber, the head of the money-laundering network, also gives unique missions for additional extra cash and RP rewards. These Mr. Faber Work missions include various tasks, such as recovering stolen assets, escorting valuable cargo, and dealing with rival outfits. These raise the Heat level on a player's money-laundering businesses, and more of the legal activities will need to be completed to reduce this.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4515896-overflodsuzume.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4515896" data-ratio="0.56235997012696" data-width="1339" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4515896-overflodsuzume.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4515896"></a><figcaption>The new Överflöd Suzume supercar.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4515896-overflodsuzume.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Additionally, the Money Fronts expansion includes six new vehicles for purchase, including the Överflöd Suzume supercar. This supercar is available early to GTA+ Members through June 25 and free for members to claim at The Vinewood Car Club until July 16.</p><p dir="ltr">Rockstar teases even more content planned for GTA Online.

<p>Should have stapled some photo credit on there</p>

<figure><a title="Switch 2 Sad DK" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/30f78c9fe1a1d/switch-2-sad-dk.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Jim Norman / Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>A couple of weeks ago, we <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/random-one-gamestop-apparently-stapled-receipts-to-brand-new-switch-2-boxes-and-guess-what-happened">reported</a> on a handful of unlucky Switch 2 customers who rocked up to their local GameStop on launch day only to find their console screens punctured by a poorly-placed staple. Keen to escape the hot water that such a fiasco (rightfully) landed the company in, GameStop attempted to make light of the situation with a new advertisement announcing console restocks in its stores, but the joke has only ended up pinning more trouble on the company. <em>Tut, tut</em>.</p>
<p>We'll start with the self-deprecating promo itself. GameStop proudly announced its Switch 2 restocks with the new tagline, "Staples not included". The accompanying picture in the company's <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1934729633393725468">announcement tweet</a> shows a Switch 2 unit suspended in mid-air, with a red stapler brandishing a "Do Not Use On Box" message in the foreground.</p>
<p>While perhaps a bit insensitive to those unlucky enough to land a punctured unit, it's just about self-critical enough that we cracked a little smile when we first saw it. "Fair play, GameStop," we thought to ourselves, "you might just bounce back from this"...</p>
<p><em>Whoops</em>, spoke too soon! As it turns out, GameStop forgot to staple some photo credit to its funny little promo. That cool image of the floating Switch 2? It ain't GameStop's to use.</p>
<p>As pointed out on Twitter by Bloomberg's <a href="https://x.com/chriswelch/status/1934750202478711084">Chris Welch</a>, the snap was originally taken by photographer Janelle Jones <em>for</em> Bloomberg. It even takes centre stage on the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-06-16/nintendo-switch-review-hardware-performance-game-selection-battery-life">outlet's console review</a>, for crying out loud! All GameStop did was crudely edit a picture of a stapler over the OG's dock without credit or mention. You can see it for yourself in Welch's tweet below — <em>spoiler</em>: it's not a good look for ol' GS.</p>

<p>As it stands, the GameStop promo is still live on the store's social media accounts, but we imagine it will only be a matter of time before that quietly disappears from our feeds. <em>Sigh</em>, only GameStop could manage to land itself in more hot water while attempting to make light of a previous slip-up.</p>

			<p>Blizzard has announced that Season 17 is set to begin next Tuesday in Overwatch 2. The developers also shared what players can expect to find in the upcoming season of the free-to-play team-based hero shooter game.</p>
<p>The team previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/overwatch-2-team-says-stadium-mode-is-very-popular-outlines-future-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that Stadium continues to be very popular among Overwatch 2 players, so it is no surprise that much of this season is dedicated to the mode. Three heroes (Zenyatta, Sigma, and Junkrat) will be available in Stadium, and two new maps are being added: Esperança and Samoa. Moreover, thanks to expanded build tools and the debut of Stadium Forge, match strategy will run deeper. Stadium Forge is a create/save/share system that will allow players to test and refine team compositions. It will even include early and late game example loadouts for every hero.</p>
<p>Season 17 will also see the first-ever Stadium rank reset, giving everyone a fresh start to prove their skill. Drives will reward consistent performance, Custom Games will let users create their own rules, and fresh All-Star rewards will incentivize players to partake in the mode.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>At long last, map voting is being added to Overwatch 2 in Quick Play and Competitive. After the role queue locks, players will see three randomized map options to choose from. Every vote adds a 1-in-10 chance to that map's odds, and the winner is selected using a roulette-style roll. Team chat, battle tags, and individual votes are hidden to minimize pressure. Leaver penalties kick in as soon as voting begins, by the way.</p>

Official Trailer | Overwatch 2" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7p5K_d1qgfQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Blizzard is also introducing three new maps. In Core mode, Aatlis is a vibrant new Flashpoint map showcasing the beauty and culture of Morocco. With lush gardens and luxury resort spaces, this map is built for tighter fights, cleaner rotations, and fast-paced momentum. As mentioned before, in Stadium mode, the streets of Esperança return in a round-based format with new elevation layers, allowing teams to switch tactics between rounds. It's kind of a Push map designed specifically for Stadium's unique format. Finally, the volcanic control point from Samoa joins the Stadium pool, bringing lava and loadouts together. Expect open arenas, intense vertical action, and ample space for high-mobility competitions.</p>
<p>Blizzard is launching two Mythics on day one for the first time in Overwatch 2. These are D.Va's Mythic Horang Hero Skin and Reaper's Mythic Steel Death Weapon Skin, both of which evolve through four tiers.</p>
<p>In about a month, the game will get a limited-time 6v6 mode called Hacks &amp; Hijinks in which match modifiers change every round. Players might float in low gravity, chase down health packs that charge your Ultimate, or react to brand-new mechanics that shake things up. Hacks &amp; Hijinx is only going to be available on Control maps between July 15 and 28.</p>

            <p>
I find Fortnite's desperation to be the everything game both fascinating and overwhelming. There's always something new for you to do around the corner, some new game mode that's attempting to tap into current trends of whatever it is that kids are into at any given moment. Currently, on the younger audience side of things with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lego-fortnite">Lego Fortnite</a>, Epic Games are launching Expeditions, a new wave-based mode that looks like a bit of a blend between a hero <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/left-4-dead">Left 4 Dead</a>.
</p>
<p>
I'll be honest, the framing of the whole thing is very much not for me, because I am not a child. A place called the Supernova Academy acts as your base before you head out on PvE missions all in the hopes of stopping "the evil Mask Maker Daigo from destroying the world". It's as generic a setup as can be, which I feel is a shame because kids do deserve quality storytelling, something which Fortnite itself isn't awful at (I don't love the FOMO nature of its events, but it's certainly Doing Something at the very least).

Missions see you facing down hordes of enemies as is typical of the wave-based format, there's a map to explore with Lego people to rescue and resources, money, and gear to gather up. You also have different hero classes to choose from, like one that can fly around to get a lay of the land, another can use rifts and summon crystals to deal damage to a bunch of enemies, you get how this all works.
</p>
<p>
The whole thing very much feels like it was made for kids who think the big boy shooters their siblings or teenagers are playing online look really cool, but obviously are far from old enough to play. This is a Fortnite mode though, as cynical as I might feel about this thing, I'm sure it'll do well enough.
</p>
<p>
Lego Fortnite Expeditions is launching tomorrow, June 18th.
