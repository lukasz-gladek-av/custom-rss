            <p>
Supermassive Games' narrative-focused single-player Dead by Daylight spin-off, The Casting of Frank Stone, launches for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on 3rd September.
</p>
<p>
Announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-by-daylight-narrative-game-the-casting-of-frank-stone-revealed">last December</a>, The Casting of Frank Stone's story begins in Cedar Hills, Oregon, in the summer of 1980, when a group of young filmmakers travels to an abandoned steel mill in order to shoot their horror movie, Murder Mill. Unbeknown to the teenagers, however, a dormant evil lies waiting, and the group ends up capturing far more on camera than it bargained for, creating a "soon-to-be cult classic with an insidious influence."
</p>
<p>
In gameplay terms, The Casting of Frank Stone follows the interactive horror movie template Supermassive has been steadily refining across the likes of Until Dawn, The Dark Pictures Anthology, and 2022's The Quarry. By making choices as the branching cinematic story unfolds, players can shift the narrative, influencing the direction of the shoot, affecting characters' relationships, and even their fates.

"Change reality with your choices, unlock new paths with your actions, and discover what horrors your final cut may hold," explains publisher (and Dead by Daylight developer) Behaviour Interactive. "In a story where every move matters, actions can speak louder than words. Explore a cinematic nightmare, testing your wits as you solve environmental puzzles and react to Quick Time Events. Guide your cast of characters through eerie locations and search for clues that hide the bigger picture."
</p>
<p>
The Casting of Frank Stone's 3rd September release date is just one of several announcements made during Behaviour Interative's Dead by Daylight 8th anniversary livestream. As well as highlighting the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raiders-lara-croft-coming-to-dead-by-daylight">arrival of Lara Croft</a> in its asymmetrical multiplayer horror game, the studio has also confirmed it's releasing a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCumCxtPTew">new 2v8 game mode</a> on 25th July, enabling eight survivors to face off against two killers across five classic maps.
</p>
<p>
Maps have been expanded to accommodate the increased player count, and the number of generators has also doubled, with survivors (who'll now be sent directly to cages if downed) needing to repair eight out of 13 to escape. Other changes include a new survivor class system, which ditches Perks in favour of clearer player "roles", and Power alterations for killers, including a new team-based ability that can be unleashed as a duo.
</p>
<p>
And finally, Behaviour Interactive has confirmed cross-progression is coming to Dead by Daylight on 22nd July, enabling players to share their progress, inventory (excluding platform-exclusive items), paid currency, and DLC between owned versions of the game on PlayStation, Xbox, Steam, the Epic Games Store, and Windows Store  using a Behaviour Account. On Switch, however, things are little more convoluted.
</p>
<p>
Progression and inventory can still be shared between platforms via Switch but paid currency and DLC bought on Nintendo's console can't be shared elsewhere. However, paid currency and DLC bought on a different platform <em>can</em> be used on Switch, and if that sounds excessively confusing, Behaviour Interactive has <a href="https://support.deadbydaylight.com/hc/en-us/sections/6714025818260-Behaviour-Account-Cross-Progression">released an FAQ</a> to clarify some details.

Effectively, beginning with the upcoming 22nd season, battle passes will be split into halves and players have to pay the price of a regular season for half of one now. The justification from EA and Respawn was that players would receive more content by paying for each of the splits, but it seems that the publisher—which has <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/did-these-horrible-deeds-clinch-eas-spot-as-americas-wo-452564685&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/did-these-horrible-deeds-clinch-eas-spot-as-americas-wo-452564685">repeatedly</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2013/04/09/ea-voted-worst-company-in-america-again/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2013/04/09/ea-voted-worst-company-in-america-again/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ranked</a></span> at the top of the world’s worst companies—is just trying to squeeze its community for more money. The community notes on the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/PlayApex/status/1810330029265420515&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/PlayApex/status/1810330029265420515" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X (formerly known as Twitter) post</a></span> announcing the change angrily insist that this move “is only profitable for EA Shareholders.”</p><p>In short, the news has hardly gone over well, and if you check out <em>Apex Legends</em>’<em> </em>Steam page right now, its <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172470/Apex_Legends/#app_reviews_hash&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172470/Apex_Legends/#app_reviews_hash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent reviews</a></span> have fallen to “Overwhelmingly Negative,” a distinction reserved for either the absolute worst games or the targets of Steam <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-steam-reviews-1851557175&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-steam-reviews-1851557175">review</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-steam-reviews-apology-psn-login-1851455150&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-steam-reviews-apology-psn-login-1851455150">bombings</a></span>. The latter happens to be the case here.</p><p>As you can imagine, most of the criticisms being levied at <em>Apex</em> <em>Legends</em> in its Steam reviews chiefly take issue with the battle pass changes, not the gameplay itself. One review reads, “Now with the new battle pass system, I’m deleting the game, as well as most players, bye!” Another cuts right to the point, reading, “Ea as usual destroying a fun game with a ridiculous amount of over monetization. Classic greedy EA.”</p><p>Per the last comment, a lot of folks don’t seem all that surprised that EA, a company known for its numerous microtransaction-riddled titles, might try a move like this. “EA EA EA why do u have to destroy every game u create at some point,” reads one disgruntled review whose writer seems to have been in this position before. The review that cuts the deepest simply says, “2 10 dollar battle passes per season. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/titanfall-3-never-giving-up-respawn-ea-1851499213&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/titanfall-3-never-giving-up-respawn-ea-1851499213"><em>Titanfall</em></a></span> died for this slop.”</p><p>The game’s overall rating is still holding at “Mostly Positive.” Folks on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/1e4imlk/apex_legends_reviews_are_overwhelmingly_negative/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/1e4imlk/apex_legends_reviews_are_overwhelmingly_negative/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Apex Legends</em>’ subreddit</a></span> think that as well-intentioned a move as it is to review bomb, and subsequently ward players away from what they perceive to be a money pit, they’d be “shocked if this made any difference at all.” Some are a bit more optimistic, but only if they’re able to realistically hurt the publisher’s wallet by the end of the next season, which begins next month. In the meantime, a whole slew of players are giving up on <em>Apex Legends</em>, while others wonder if they’re really ready to throw in the towel on a game they’ve loved for years.</p><p>Despite the backlash, Respawn and EA <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/1e4nkn7/is_there_any_dev_response_in_light_of_recent/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/1e4nkn7/is_there_any_dev_response_in_light_of_recent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">haven’t said a thing in response</a></span> to the <em>Apex Legends</em> community.

                <p>EA Sports College Football 25 is the ultimate way to immerse yourself in the world of the NCAA, all from the comfort of your couch. Dynasty mode is the pinnacle of that glory, allowing you to take the role of a coach and build the school of your choice. Choosing your coach backstory is a key decision when entering the mode, and we've got the rundown on how to pick the best coach type for you in CFB 25.</p><h2>Choosing Coach Role</h2><p>The first decision you'll need to make when selecting your coach for dynasty mode in EA Sports College Football 25 is what your role is going to be. You can choose Head Coach, Offensive Coordinator, and Defensive Coordinator.</p><p>The Offensive Coordinator and Defensive Coordinator are in charge of their respective sides, meaning you'll only recruit and play in the game as one or the other. Head Coach means you're responsible for both sides of the ball, both on and off the field.</p><p>It is also worth noting that you'll have specific goals presented to you throughout the year based on the role you chose. Meeting those goals and your overall position/stats relevant to the side you manage affects how well you're graded at the end of the year.</p><h2>Existing Or Custom Coach</h2><p>The next choice is to decide whether you want to use a pre-existing coach or create your own. Existing coaches come with their own preset skills, schemes, and strategies, giving you an advantage in that they are already leveled up.</p><p>Creating a new coach lets you customize your own, though you'll have to grow them each game. The benefit of this is that you'll be able to customize your strengths and weaknesses as you go, instead of being locked into pre-made archetypes and skills.</p><h2>Which Coach Backstory Is Best?</h2><p>The final and arguably most impactful decision is choosing which of the three backstories you want to go with:</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1841/18416792/4335480-coachtypebackstory.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4335480" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1841/18416792/4335480-coachtypebackstory.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4335480"></a><figcaption>College Football 25 coach backstories</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1841/18416792/4335480-coachtypebackstory.jpg"></figure><ul><li><strong>Motivator</strong> - Get your players to play their best by boosting their rating and composure. Nobody has it better than us.</li><li><strong>Recruiter</strong> - Jimmys and joes, not Xs and Os. You scout faster and recruit better than any other type of coach.</li><li><strong>Tactician</strong> - Boost your player's rating on gameday. Scheme up the big plays and let the visor fly.</li></ul><p>While there is no wrong option, a <strong>Recruiter seems to be the best option across the board</strong>, as it'll help you build your school in the long term thanks to the ability to scout faster and recruit better. Regardless of what you select, you'll earn coach points in each game that go towards buying skills that impact both on and off-the-field actions.</p><p>Once you sign your contract, you'll need to live up to the hype. Contracts and expectations are based on the school's historical records. The bigger the school, the more chance you may get fired and have to find another down the line.</p><p>College Football 25 is one of the biggest releases of the year.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-the-adventure-game-is-on-sale-for-prime-day<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Amazon <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/prime-day-2024">Prime Day</a> is happening now, which means you can save a bunch on all sorts of things. One category of said things is board games. And one of the better <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-prime-day-board-game-deals-2024">Prime Day board game deals</a> available right now is on The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim – The Adventure Game, a game that captures the essence of Bethesda's massive open-world RPG, but whittles it down to tabletop form. It's just one of the many <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-elder-scrolls-5-skyrim-editions-in-order">versions of Skyrim you can play</a> in 2024.</p><h2>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim – The Adventure Game for $84.99</h2><div catalogid="d902efb2-d32c-46f0-b3bf-6e89fce85ba7" id="175868"><div id="175868" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim – The Adventure Game</h3></p></div><p>And while $78.99 might not seem like a cheap investment, it's quite a bit less than the $140 MSRP the game maker typically charges.</p><p>At its core, Skyrim – The Adventure Game faithfully recreates the vast and richly detailed world of Tamriel, inviting players to take on epic quests, explore dungeons, and encounter iconic creatures from the Elder Scrolls universe. Whether you're a seasoned Dragonborn or a newcomer to the realm, the game's thematic fidelity makes sure you'll tap in to a sense of fantasy adventure.</p><p>One of the standout features is the narrative depth. Much like its video game counterpart, Skyrim – The Adventure Game places a strong emphasis on storytelling and player choice. Players can forge their own path through the land of Skyrim, encountering diverse characters and making decisions that impact the outcome of their quests. This narrative flexibility not only adds replayability but also allows players to immerse themselves fully in the game's lore.</p><p>But don't take my word for it. Here's what <a href="https://www.ign.com/person/ctheel">Charlie Theel</a>, our critic, had to say about it in his <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-adventure-board-game-review">review</a>:</p><p>Maybe not a full-throated endorsement, but it certainly ought to please fans of the video game.

Despite the early access review period underway, EA Sports's long-awaited return to College Football video games is pulling some solid early numbers. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Now there’s over 700,000 people online on College Football 25 <a href="https://t.co/r1q5XRtd8E" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/r1q5XRtd8E</a></p>— Bordeaux (@bordeauxyoutube) <a href="https://twitter.com/bordeauxyoutube/status/1813028634359439629?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 16, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Several users on X/Twitter were reporting how many players were online right now playing College Football 25. YouTuber and X/Twitter user Bordeaux <a href="https://x.com/bordeauxyoutube/status/1813028634359439629" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted an image</a> on his official account that over 700,000 people were currently playing College Football 25, an impressive number considering that only accounts for people who bought the Deluxe Edition and MVP due to the three days early access pre-order incentives. </p><p>Of course, this number only accounts for players connected to their Xbox Live or PSN account and does not include offline players. This uptick in player count days before its worldwide release also caused <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/college-football-25s-servers-are-getting-crushed-before-its-even-fully-released">College Football 25 servers to struggle</a> to keep up with the high player count last night. </p><p>More interestingly, X/Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/Welfare_JBP/status/1813045727578272096" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Welfare_JBP posted a screenshot</a> from Walmart that over 1,000 Xbox Series S consoles were bought at Walmart yesterday.

The Xbox Series S is one of three platforms College Football 25 is available on as EA Sports opted not to release it on either PC or the eighth-generation consoles. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Yeeeah EA College Football is absolutely for sure, positively a console mover.</p><p>Xbox Series S is never touching +1000 today at Walmart otherwise, outside a price cut.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> remains one of the most popular and influential games out there, and it's no longer just a game, but instead a platform of sorts for all manner of different types of games and experiences. Epic's Tim Sweeney believes Fortnite is basically an early version of the metaverse, and he recently spoke about this belief and how he sees the game growing and evolving over time.</p><p>"It's going to evolve a lot," Sweeney said. He <a href="https://www.matthewball.co/all/sweeneystephenson" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">spoke to researcher Matthew Ball about this recently</a>, ahead of Fortnite's seventh anniversary in August.</p><p>Fortnite as it exists today is limited by the available technology with which to build it. For example, Sweeney said the game's battle royale mode is limited to 100 people because "computers in the data center were just too slow" when the game released. And Fortnite is divided into a number of different islands for a similar reason: The technology stack required to create one seamless experience is not there.</p><p>"So a lot of the things you see in there are not the permanent end state of what we see this medium being, but are just current crutches that we're using to hobble by as we work towards the ultimate capabilities of the thing," he said.</p><p>Sweeney said players can look forward to "really significant changes" to come, one of which is an "interoperable economy" that spans games beyond Fortnite. This will be "really freeing for people," Sweeney said, though he didn't elaborate on any potential partnerships or how this would work.</p><p>He went on to say that the Fortnite networking model today is "extremely limited," saying the model from Unreal Engine 5 today is "remarkably similar" to what it was for Unreal Engine 1 in 1997. It has been improved over time, of course, but it still has tons of room to grow, Sweeney said.</p><p>"A Fortnite battle royale session is 100 players. There might be at peak hundreds of thousands of these servers running and there might be at peak over 10 million concurrent players online all at once, but they're each in their own separate sharded copies of the world and they can't see each other in that space. They can't go anywhere to find each other all at once," he said.</p><p>For Unreal Engine 6, Sweeney said a major aim is to improve the networking model to help support lots of concurrent players and the ability to move players between servers seamlessly. The scale could support a billion concurrent players in the future, Sweeney predicted.</p><p>"That's got to be one of the goals of the technology. Otherwise, many genres of games just can never exist because the technology isn't there to support them," he said.</p><p>The end result for the user could be a "much larger simulation" for players than exists today. This could in turn lead to a combination of Fortnite's existing content into "a seamless world as players want."</p><p>"Some experiences will be better by themselves. If you want to build an awesome bespoke story-driven, single player or a co-op game, you might build it off in its own little corner of the world, no connections to the outside, but an awful lot of what we're doing would be a whole lot better if it were all seamlessly connected," Sweeney said.</p><figure data-align="left" data-size="small" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4335467-screenshot2024-07-16at3.22.15pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4335467" data-ratio="0.59259259259259" data-width="999" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4335467-screenshot2024-07-16at3.22.15pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4335467"></a><figcaption>Fortnite continues to grow and evolve</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4335467-screenshot2024-07-16at3.22.15pm.png"></figure><p>He likened this to Disney's theme parks, which are connected by transport systems but exist in one big world. "You can go anywhere in this connected world and participate in any experience there. And what are creators doing instead of creating their own little isolated islands? They're taking over a portion of space in the world and they're defining the game roles there in different parts of space," Sweeney said. For what it's worth, Epic recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-disney-persistent-universe-tied-to-fortnite-is-in-the-works/1100-6520900/" data-ref-id="1100-6520900">invested $1.5 billion into Epic to create... something in Fortnite</a>, and fans are intrigued to see what that could be.</p><p>What's more, Sweeney said he would like to see Fortnite embrace actual game code written by fans. "Things become really interesting when every creator's code can interoperate with every creator's code," Sweeney said. "Everybody's out creating their own really interesting objects and creating them using protocols that are provided by the system to enable them all to work together. So you might be riding a mount or an animal built by one creator and your friend might be driving a car built by another creator. You might be carrying a weapon built by a third creator, and you might be in a world maintained by dozens of other creators, and you might be moving seamlessly from place to place with all of these interactions happening."</p><p>Sweeney said Epic could have achieved some of its goals already if it adopted Roblox's setup where there are a "bunch of sharded islands deployed as quickly as possible." However, Sweeney said Epic's aim is to "build for the long term," noting that he believes "an awful lot" of his vision for Fortnite will come to fruition by 2030.</p><p>Sweeney also spoke about Epic's aim for Fortnite to contribute to the creation of a bigger and more robust metaverse. Fortnite of course has already done numerous crossovers with characters and people from other franchises, and things will only accelerate further, Sweeney believes.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4335466-screenshot2024-07-16at3.22.34pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4335466" data-ratio="0.53665158371041" data-width="1105" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4335466-screenshot2024-07-16at3.22.34pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4335466"></a><figcaption>The band Metallica recently came to Fortnite</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4335466-screenshot2024-07-16at3.22.34pm.png"></figure><p>"It's going to take on a life of its own and really quickly transcend what it is today. It's become very clear over the past few years that we're in this steep growth curve that's being driven by that," he said. "This medium is emerging at an astonishing rate, and I think people have no idea how awesome it's going to be by the end of this decade. But when you look at all the best capabilities of the top game engines, look at all the work being created for top movies in the film industry, all the work of all the car makers and of all the other storytellers and creators of all different kinds of games, and envision what the world is like when all of that comes together into a socially connected united economy which everybody can participate in, that's going to be a whole new world. And that's what we're very excited about."</p><p>The <a href="https://www.matthewball.co/all/sweeneystephenson" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">full interview</a> is packed with loads of interesting insights from Sweeney, along with Neal Stephenson, the author who coined the term metaverse in his book Snow Crash.</p><p>For more, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-chapter-5-season-4-start-date-leaks-and-rumors/2900-5569/" data-ref-id="2900-5569">rundown of Fortnite Chapter 5, including the start date, leaks, rumors, and more. </a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/07/16/xbox-360-blades-interface-returns-as-dynamic-background-ahead-of-digital-store-closure<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text" typeof="schema:Article"><p>The Xbox 360 digital store <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/08/17/the-xbox-360-store-is-shutting-down">shuts down later this month</a> on July 26. Amid a wave of price reductions and other end-of-life updates, nostalgic fans can relive the console's earliest days via a new dynamic background modeled after the old “Blades” interface.</p>

<p>For those too young to remember or didn’t get an Xbox 360 until years later, the Blades interface was the console's first dashboard design. It was the first thing players saw from the console’s launch in 2005 until it was updated to an entirely different interface in 2008. Navigating it felt smooth as butter, and some diehards still believe it's the best UI of any Xbox console.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Although it's less detailed, and you can’t flip through the Blades of this dynamic background and hear that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZYhri2tsM4">satisfying “whoosh” sound</a>, it’s nice to see Microsoft acknowledge the 360's like this. Here’s how you to make the Blades your Xbox background:</p>

<ul>
	<li aria-level="1">Press the Xbox button on your controller to open the guide.</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Navigate to Profile &amp; system &gt; Settings &gt; General &gt; Personalization &gt; My background &gt; Dynamic backgrounds.</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Choose Xbox 360 Blades under Featured or Xbox dynamic backgrounds</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Select the background art you want using the A button.</li>
</ul>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/focus-entertainment-release-statement-on-space-marine-2-leak.928899/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/focus-entertainment-release-statement-on-space-marine-2-leak/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://wccftech.com/full-dev-build-of-warhammer-40000-space-marines-2-leaks-online/">a dev build</a> of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 appeared online. It was a relatively finished build, with minimal assets missing and just some placeholder assets instead. It was fully playable, and binaries were available to allow for co-op. Since the release of this dev build, Focus Entertainment has come out with <a href="https://x.com/Focus_entmt/status/1813264114988294223/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a statement</a> to speak on the issue.</p>
<p>Focus Entertainment has expressed its gratitude for the love and support from the community eagerly awaiting the release of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2. Additionally, they have requested that anyone who comes across the dev build doesn't engage with it. If they have or do choose to engage with it, they have politely asked that they do not spoil the game for those who want to go into a fully polished version of the game.</p>
<p>The dev build that went live is said to be roughly a year old by the time Space Marine 2 officially releases. While it is tragic that the dev build was released, it spells good news for those waiting for the official launch, as it means that the game will be significantly more polished and have much more content than was in the dev build.</p>
<p>Luckily, for those who are dodging spoilers from the dev build, you won't have to wait much longer. The official release date for Space Marine 2 is September 9, where players will experience the fully polished game and uncover many secrets that Focus Entertainment has been trying to keep concealed.</p>
<p>At the moment, it doesn't seem to be known who leaked the dev build, whether it was someone from Focus Entertainment or an outside source. According to the tracker where the dev build was uploaded, over 500 people downloaded it to play for themselves. Combining this with the footage that has been uploaded of the Space Marines 2 dev build, it gained way more traction than anyone would have thought.</p>
<p>Since the gameplay videos gained traction, they have been removed from YouTube. Several attempts have been made to re-upload the gameplay footage, but they have all been removed quickly.</p>
<p>Focus Entertainment's last message in the statement was to ask people not to look into the dev build nor spoil the game for those excited. "Space Marine 2 will launch on September 9, and the best way to support our teams' hard work is to play the game as they've always intended."</p>

These power-ups increase the overall capacity of weapon and hero modules, making you significantly more potent on the battlefield. The impact of Caliber on your gameplay is undeniable, but still a touchy subject given that it costs real money.</p><p>So let’s take a look at what you get for your money and whether or not Caliber is worth it for what you’re looking to get out of <em>The First Descendant</em>.</p><h2 id="h38757"><a id="two"></a>Two methods to get Caliber</h2><p>There are currently two methods to acquire Caliber in The First Descendant, and they both require real money.</p><figure id="" data-id="7cac67e2e71d97f5cbb0e08ff0b71f4e" data-recommend-id="image://7cac67e2e71d97f5cbb0e08ff0b71f4e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of The First Descendant's store shows different prices for Caliber." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of The First Descendant's store shows different prices for Caliber." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nexon / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7cac67e2e71d97f5cbb0e08ff0b71f4e" data-recommend-id="image://7cac67e2e71d97f5cbb0e08ff0b71f4e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of The First Descendant's store shows different prices for Caliber." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The first method is the most straightforward. You can buy Caliber from the in-game store in packages that range from the lowest of 250 to the highest of 5,750. The more you purchase, the more expensive the package. But like all other free-to-play games with real-money currencies, the more you buy, the more you receive as a “bonus.”</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>$4.99 for 250 Caliber</li><li>$9.99 for 520 Caliber</li><li>$19.99 for 1,060 Caliber</li><li>$49.99 for 2,750 Caliber</li><li>$69.99 for 3,920 Caliber</li><li>$99.99 for 5,750 Caliber</li></ul><p>The second method to acquire Caliber is also the more rewarding of the two options, albeit still costly. To access this method, you must upgrade the free Battle Pass to the Premium Battle Pass, which unlocks additional rewards not included in the free Pass. And one such reward you’l;l unlock every few levels is more Caliber. If you’re going to spend money on Caliber for anything, start by trying out the Premium Battle Pass.</p><figure id="" data-id="0353e48dff5c326458af656e1924ea38" data-recommend-id="image://0353e48dff5c326458af656e1924ea38" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screen shot of the game's store shows the battle pass rewards." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screen shot of the game's store shows the battle pass rewards." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nexon / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0353e48dff5c326458af656e1924ea38" data-recommend-id="image://0353e48dff5c326458af656e1924ea38" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screen shot of the game's store shows the battle pass rewards." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Caliber rewards deal out small denominations of 25 Caliber per reward level, but it adds up if you complete the entire Pass.

<p>On Monday, it came to light that a fully playable development build of Space Marine 2 was posted online in an apparent leak. Now, just some 24 hours later, Focus Entertainment has <a href="https://x.com/Focus_entmt/status/1813264114988294223">released a s</a><a href="https://x.com/Focus_entmt/status/1813264114988294223" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">t</a><a href="https://x.com/Focus_entmt/status/1813264114988294223">atement</a> on the matter.</p>



<p>The studio says it’s saddened by what’s happened, and would hope that players would avoid playing something that should’ve never been made public. What’s more is that the build that was uploaded is nearly a year old and, in no way, reflects the final product that will release on September 9.</p>



<p>“We are deeply touched by the overwhelming support we’ve received from our community following the leak of an old build of our upcoming game, Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2,” Focus said.</p>



<p>“Our teams have poured years of hard work, passion, and dedication into creating a game worthy of your hopes and expectations, and it’s disheartening that many of the surprises we worked to keep secret were spoiled. We’re saddened that this build, which will be almost a year old by the time we launch, is how some of our most eager fans will first experience Space Marine 2.</p>



<p>“Our unwavering commitment has been to deliver the best possible game for our players. This was the driving force behind our decision to spend more time on development and ensure we deliver the best experience we can. </p>



<p>We’re asking everyone to avoid this unfinished build and to not spoil the game for those excited to experience it for the first time at launch. Space Marine 2 will release on September 9, and the best way to support our teams’ hard work is to play the game as they’ve always intended.”</p>

			<p>If you've been eagerly awaiting the collaboration between Behavior Interactive and Supermassive Games (makers of Until Dawn, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-quarry-supermassive-big-screen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Quarry</a>, and The Dark Pictures games), you won't have to wait much longer. The release date for The Casting of Frank Stone has been officially confirmed. For those eagerly wanting to get stuck into this game, you only have to wait until September 3 for the release.</p>
<p>This new game combines the fantastic storytelling skills of Supermassive Games with the excellent survival horror instincts of Behavior Interactive. This game is set in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-by-daylight-d-and-d-castlevania-2v8-project-t-what-the-fog-spinoff-shadow-drop/">Dead by Daylight</a> universe and will give those who want to know more about the world a brand-new insight into the horrors that lurk in the Fog.</p>
<p>Standard and Deluxe Editions are available for pre-order if you want to own The Casting of Frank Stone as soon as possible. Those who play Dead by Daylight will be able to get their hands on some rewards just by purchasing The Casting of Frank Stone.</p>
<p>These rewards include a "Murder Mill" shirt cosmetic for all survivors, a "Murder Mill" badge and banner, and 2 million Bloodpoints! Additionally, players will be given an ability called Plunderer's Instinct, which will allow players to receive hints to find hidden collectibles in The Casting of Frank Stone.</p>
<p>The Casting of Frank Stone has a new trailer for those interested in sinking their teeth into this cosmic mystery. It shows off the "Murder Mill" <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6FODK6lwtM&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noopener">homemade horror movie</a>, which is the core of the narrative for this new horror game. However, something isn't quite right. This movie is covered in a thick cloak of urban legend and cosmic mystery around every corner. Each time the movie was screened, the audience was overcome with horrific murderous impulses.</p>
<p>Whether that story is true remains up to the player to uncover in a twisted tale set in a city called Cedar Hills, where the name of Frank Stone looms forever. A young group of friends goes on a journey to uncover the truth of his story and finds that his legacy has tainted the town they live in, leaving scars and open wounds across multiple generations and even the cosmos itself.</p>

<p>As with every Supermassive Game, there will be hefty choices to make, impacting how your time in the game plays out. Will everyone survive, or will they be picked off individually as you try to uncover the story of Frank Stone? You'll also see some familiar elements from Dead by Daylight sprinkled through the story of this game, reminding you of just how connected the universes are.</p>
<p>It's time to start counting down the days until The Casting of Frank Stone's release.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dead-by-daylight-2v8-game-mode-and-cross-progression-date-reveal/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Dead by Daylight is expecting a massive update with <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-by-daylight-d-and-d-castlevania-2v8-project-t-what-the-fog-spinoff-shadow-drop/">plenty of content</a> and scares planned for July. We are about halfway through the month and have already seen Lara Croft, the ultimate survival queen, be added to Dead by Daylight. The release of Lara Croft comes with three brand new perks to look out for Finesse, Hardened, and Specialist. Unfortunately, she is ill-equipped and won't be able to use any gun or crossbow to help keep her alive, and she has to rely solely on her wits to survive the Fog. Dead by Daylight also introduces cross-progression and a brand-new 2v8 Game Mode.</p>
<p>In addition to Lara Croft being added to Dead by Daylight, survivors and killers enjoy the new game mode coming. On July 25, players will get to experience a 2v8 game mode. In this game mode, you can either team up with a fellow killer or join a group of survivors. Two killers are tasked with finding and killing all eight survivors across five classic maps.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dead by Daylight | Tomb Raider | Official Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JVtkcHfHcNc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Don't expect it to be easy, though. You now have to secure 8 out of 13 generators to escape. There will be no use of Hooks or Perks to keep the game mode fresh. Instead, caught survivors will be taken directly to Cages once downed. In replacement of Perks, survivors will have access to a class system where they can pick a specific "role" within their team.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dead by Daylight | 2v8 Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TCumCxtPTew?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Killers will also experience a shake-up with their Powers, as they have gotten a new look to keep the game mode fresh and exciting. They also have a powerful timed ability to use in conjunction with the other killers to make or break the game. This game mode will be available from July 25 to August 8.</p>
<p>The third central point of the Dead by Daylight update is that Cross-Progression is finally coming. For those who play the game across multiple platforms, you can finally sync up your progress to continue from where you left off across all platforms. All players need to ensure that they can access cross-progression in a <a href="https://support.bhvr.com/hc/en-us/articles/8265968349460-How-to-enable-Cross-Progression-via-a-Behaviour-Account#:~:text=Navigate%20to%20the%20My%20Account,platform%20to%20confirm%20your%20identity." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Behavior account</a> to link their progress to their account.</p>
<p>The only downside of the Dead by Daylight cross-progression is that those who play on platforms and a Nintendo Switch cannot access their paid currency or DLC on Nintendo Switch if they are syncing up with another platform. Cross-progression will be available on July 22 for all players to access.</p>

But thankfully, it’s shaping up to have some gems of its own.

Of course, a lot of new shows are also on this list for you to check out. Here are nine anime you shouldn’t miss this summer 2024. </p></div></div><div><p><strong>Watch it on: MAX, Hulu</strong></p><p>There’s a genius to the simplicity of <em>Suicide Squad ISEKAI</em>: Send the DC universe’s team of villains into a tropey fantasy world, let them run wild, and hilarity will ensue. The Suicide Squad are well known enough now (thanks to two movies and a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/suicide-squad-justice-league-review-is-it-good-batman-1851222047&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/suicide-squad-justice-league-review-is-it-good-batman-1851222047">mediocre game</a></span>) that the anime dosn’t have to work overtime to familiarize the audience with the characters and their whole deal. This iteration of the team keeps it mostly classic, with the likes of Harley Quinn, Peacemaker, King Shark, Deadshot and Clayface, though—as is so often the case with this lot—this has proven to be Harley’s show, and I’m not complaining at all.</p><p>Watching the oddball team of villains deal with the often tongue-in-cheek issues of a fantasy realm at war has proven to be a wonderful combination, and seeing more DC characters pop up in the future will only add to the fun. The show also retains the team’s signature penchant for violence, and it looks fantastic in its energetic and colorful animation style.</p></div><div><p><strong>Watch it on: HIDIVE</strong></p><p>The first season of <em>Oshi no Ko</em> was one of 2023’s best anime, and the second aims to repeat the success in 2024. Based on the first two episodes, it’s going to easily accomplish that. For the uninitiated, <em>Oshi no Ko</em> follows siblings Aqua and Ruby, twin children of the murdered pop idol Ai Hoshino, on their dual missions to gain stardom while solving their mother’s murder. The first season saw the twins push into the world of fame in their own ways, Aqua through acting and Ruby through singing, while Aqua some detective work on the side. </p><p>Season one was an enthralling arc that had a lot to say about the dangers of celebrity and how society builds up these stars, holds them to insane standards, and turns on them in a second. The show’s wonderful writing and gorgeous animation made its expert weaving of comedy, drama, and mystery seem effortless. Season two throws us right into the next phase of Aqua’s investigation, set in the midst of a high-stakes theatrical production.</p></div><div><p><strong>Watch it on: HIDIVE</strong></p><p>If you are looking for something to fill the void left by <em>Delicious in Dungeon</em>, then <em>Dungeon People</em> is your best bet. The new anime follows a thief who gets an unexpected job offer to manage a dungeon full of monsters. It’s a fun twist on the dungeon fantasy formula that offers some more slice-of-life-style storytelling. </p><p>If you like the off-kilter approach to a <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons </em>style campaign that <em>Delicious in Dungeon</em> often had, there is a lot in <em>Dungeon People</em> that can scratch that itch. So far it doesn’t do anything as spectacular in its storytelling and character work as <em>Frieren </em>or <em>Delicious in Dungeon,</em> but it’s a cute show to relax with.</p></div><div><p><strong>Watch it on: Crunchyroll</strong></p><p>Simply put,<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nier-automata-anime-part-2-crunchyroll-adaptation-1851585264&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nier-automata-anime-part-2-crunchyroll-adaptation-1851585264"><em>NieR: Automata Ver1.1a</em></a></span> is the best video game adaptation around right now. The first part of the season (which aired last year) made this abundantly clear by offering new twists for returning fans of the game while also managing to be a succinct and engaging retread of the original story for newcomers. </p><p>Part two of season one looks to dive into the real meat of <em>NieR: Automata</em>, with the game’s endings A and B behind us. Returning viewers can expect even more philosophical conundrums and rugs being pulled out from under them. The first episode alone is a stunning reinterpretation of one of the source material’s most incredible moments. Hopefully this bundle of episodes won’t be plagued by the production issues of the first part.</p></div><div><p><strong>Watch it on: Crunchyroll</strong></p><p>I’m always looking out for the next great rom-com anime whenever a new season drops its lineup. In the past we’ve gotten the likes of <em>Kaguya-sama: Love is War</em> or last years’ <em>Skip and Loafer</em>. <em>Alya Sometimes Hides Her Feelings in Russian</em> isn’t quite on that level yet, but I’m cautiously optimistic that it could be after a few more episodes. </p><p>Alya is a straight-laced student council member constantly berating Kuze for his antics, but she does find him cute and secretly says as much…in Russian. Of course, Kuze understands Russian and can’t find a way to tell Alya that he’s been able to understand her confessions all this time. What ensues in the first couple of episodes is a cute and combative relationship between the two. So far the duo have great chemistry, which is essential to success, but I’m still waiting for the show to be more than the typical genre trappings. There is a fanservice-y moment in the premiere that made me roll my eyes, but Alya and Kuze have unexpectedly serious discussion about it immediately after. If we are lucky this won’t devolve into pure fanservice and instead move past genre tropes to be something special.</p></div><div><p><strong>Watch it on: Crunchyroll</strong></p><p>This might be the best-looking show of the season. The premiere alone has gorgeous animation and stunning use of color, from bright foliage to deep red blood. But <em>The Elusive Samurai </em>is more than a pretty face. It follows Tokiyuki, a carefree kid who just wants to live in peace but is thrust into a violent world after a brutal coup.</p><p>That conflict between peace and war at the heart of Tokiyuki’s journey is reflected in the show’s gorgeous animation. There is a lot of juxtaposing imagery that further visualizes that internal conflict. With such a strong protagonist and animation, I have high hopes that <em>The Elusive Samurai </em>will be able to sustain the standard set by its premiere.</p></div><div><p><strong>Watch it on: Crunchyroll</strong></p><p>I love how heartfelt yet over-the-top sports girl anime always are. That’s why I’m already into <em>Narenare -Cheer for you!-</em>. I appreciate that the show takes cheerleading seriously as a sport. The way each girl talks about cheer is done without joking about it and the animation highlights how beautiful yet difficult it is. The core cast is constantly dedicating time and energy to their sport and their passion endears the audience to them.</p><p>Back to the animation—Wow, this show is gorgeous. It combines an almost pastel color-palette with a slight highlighting effect over everything that gives it an almost pop art feel. Of course, with any show like this I don’t want to get my hopes up about the yuri-potential, so if you are hoping for that just manage your expectations. </p></div><div><p><strong>Watch it on: Crunchyroll</strong></p><p><em>Mayonaka Punch</em> came out of nowhere and dazzled me with its premiere. It begins with our protagonist, Masaki, getting booted from her three- woman YouTuber group for being too violent after punching one of her costars on a livestream. She tries to start a new channel to regain her fanbase, but is disheartened by the constant hate she gets for her violent actions and the fact that her new channel bombs. Masiki’s luck turns around when she meets Live, a vampire who’s been having mysterious dreams of Masaki and is hell bent on drinking her blood. Masaki comes up with the bright idea to make spectacular videos using Live’s powers, and in exchange Live can feed on Masaki once her new channel reaches one million subscribers.</p><p>Masaki is an amazing protagonist whose brashness makes her an enjoyable girl failure, while Live’s overeager thirst for Masaki comes off as an adoring obsession. The first couple of episodes are full of fun hijinx, and there is some potential for Live and Masaki’s relationship to grow into something more than just a means to an end for both of them.</p></div><div><p><strong>Watch it on: Crunchyroll</strong></p><p>I’ll be honest, <em>Tower of God </em>season two doesn’t have the juice in the same way that season one did back in 2020. The animation style has a much less distinct identity, especially with the lack of those bold black lines, yet I am still hooked. While the aesthetics might not be there, the world still is. </p><p>The titular Tower, and the inhabitants inside it fighting to make their way to the top, are still so well fleshed out that I can’t help but be interested in what awaits them all. Even after four years, It’s good to see Bam back and I’m ready to hopefully get some answers on season one’s cliffhanger and what’s really up with Rachel.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<!-- cache hit 44:single/related:9fbcecc4a267a305eb83c5f8a0b76700 --><!-- empty -->
<p>How badly do you want to play the upcoming <a href="https://store.focus-entmt.com/us/warhammer40000spacemarine2"><em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</em></a> ahead of its September 9 launch? Enough to torrent a 75GB package from a Russian site? Enough to not only unpack and play it, but connect to a server and start building up your character?</p>
<p>Me neither, but that hasn't stopped seemingly hundreds of people from doing just that. Publisher Focus Entertainment had announced the third-person action game having "gone gold" (released for manufacturing) <a href="https://x.com/Focus_entmt/status/1810722430144631112">on July 9</a>. The leaked build might date to February 23, 2024, as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/spaice-marine-2-leak-playable/">suggested by site Insider Gaming</a>, which had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240715211516/https://insider-gaming.com/spaice-marine-2-leak-playable/">previously suggested a June 20 date</a>.</p>
<p>Footage from the leaked builds, which has been mostly taken offline by Focus through copyright claims, suggested that it was a mostly complete version of the game, with some placeholder assets in menus. Said footage also suggests that the game's pirates are playing online, and their characters are retaining their levels and items. For now, at least.</p>
<figure><p><iframe type="text/html" width="980" height="550" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5tqDxvpzsKM?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption><p>Gameplay overview trailer for <em>Warhammer 40,000: </em><em>Space Marine 2</em>.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>In some ways, this shouldn't really matter. When the game's servers go officially live, developer Saber Interactive and Focus should be able to flag those accounts that have logged unauthorized time. Getting online to play will likely require authentication from the Steam, Xbox, or PlayStation platform one chooses. And there's a chance that a closer look at the game, or even just news about its leak, might entice more people into buying and playing the game proper.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<figure><figcaption><p>Focus Entertainment</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>In other ways, though, it stinks. Spoilers from the game's campaign and multiplayer offerings will filter out, and firms that should be focusing entirely on release and quality control will have to deal with the security and fairness aspects of such a leak. A planned open beta of the game had <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/space-marine-2-dev-cancels-open-beta-hands-out-bolt-pistol-skin-as-an-apology">already been canceled</a>&nbsp;in favor of the developer's focus on launch readiness.</p>
<p>Game leaks of this scale aren't as common as select images or isolated information, but it does happen. <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> had <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/12/grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-confirms-many-things-including-its-florida-vibes/">nearly an hour of gameplay footage leak in 2022</a>. Discs of <em>Starfield </em>being posted for sale in August 2023, weeks ahead of its September release, resulted in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/08/starfield-leaker-arrested-for-felony-theft-after-attempting-to-sell-early-copies/">felony charges for a Tennessee man</a>. Videos spoiling much of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/05/be-warned-massive-the-last-of-us-part-2-spoilers-have-been-leaked/"><em>The Last of Us Part 2</em> leaked online</a> in 2020, thanks to someone "not affiliated" with its developer and publisher.</p>
<p>And the biggest and most unexpected hack and leak came from a small German town, where Axel Gembe <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/06/what-drove-one-half-life-2-super-fan-to-hack-into-valves-servers/">stole and leaked early source code for <em>Half-Life 2</em></a>. He later tried to apologize to Valve founder Gabe Newell and leverage his break-in to land a job at Valve, which was, to say the least, unsuccessful.
</p><p>Ars has contacted Focus Entertainment for comment and will update this post with new information.</p>
