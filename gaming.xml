            <p>Remedy already has two major updates for its Control multiplayer spin-off FBC: Firebreak planned for this year, with more to hopefully follow.</p>
<p>FBC: Firebreak is set to release later this month, on 17th June. It will throw players back into the halls of Control's mysterious Federal Bureau of Control, letting them revisit a number of familiar locations from that game but with a fresh multiplayer twist.</p>

<p>Following its initial launch, the studio will then release a major update this autumn. This will include a new Job, codenamed Outbreak, and a new Jobsite: the Research Sector. Players will also find new gameplay systems and enemies, new free earnable rewards, and new (paid) Classified Requisitions. These will include unique armor sets, sprays, skins, and character voice packs.</p>
<p>Winter will then bring in a second major update. Again, this will add a new Job to FBC: Firebreak, with this one codenamed Blackout. There will also be a new Jobsite, but for now where that is located is a mystery. Along with the new Job and Jobsite, this update will also add new equipment and enemies, new free earnable rewards and new (paid) Classified Requisitions, including unique armor sets, sprays, skins, and character voice packs.</p>
<p>Writing on social media, <a href="https://x.com/RiotRMD/status/1933057792631259491">Remedy's communications director Thomas Puha</a> said the team also has plans afoot for 2026, but the team wants to "launch the game first, see what the reception is and what the community wants to see, what you might gravitate to before we make more decisions on what kind of content we'll be releasing".</p>

<p>Our Chris went hands-on with FBC: Firebreak earlier this year, when he called it a "frantic, electrifying run-based shooter, with difficulties feeling like gambles".</p>
<p>"Its potential is up there with the games other Remedy staff reference in casual chit-chat around the studio's corridors, from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, yes, to Darktide, Payday, Deep Rock Galactic or even Overcooked," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remedys-control-spin-off-fbc-firebreak-has-only-come-together-at-the-last-minute-and-somehow-feels-better-for-it">Eurogamer's FBC: Firebreak preview</a>. "It might be coming together somewhat at the last, but again, perhaps that's exactly the way these kinds of games need to work."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/13/tainted-grail-fall-of-avalon-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>One of the worst things is when you see potential and promise in something, but it doesn’t reach the heights you know it can. That is probably the best way to describe my experience with Tainted Grail: Fall of Avalon, the dark fantasy open world RPG which uses the King Arthur legend as the basis for the setting and story.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon - Official Release Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3hDQNtPceEQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Tainted Grail: Fall of Avalon begins strongly. You are a no-name character who is suffering from disease and is locked up on Asylum Island. You are freed by a mysterious character, but they do not help guide you to freedom, instead leaving you to figure out the path through the dangers for yourself.</p>


<p>It is only as you are broken out that you actually create your character, answering questions about what you were doing prior to ending up in the cell. Answering these questions feeds into which attributes get a boost at the beginning, and the playstyle you are considering. At the start you are weak, and Tainted Grail does an excellent job of showing just how that works as different enemy types cross your path and you are almost helpless to beat them, requiring quick thinking or running away.</p>
<p>Once you are away from Asylum Island and the first proper area, Horns of the South, things really do open up. There is the main quest to follow, which involves recovering some of King Arthur’s relics to restore his soul. Arthur’s soul just so happens to be in your body as a passenger and allows you to access various powers and abilities. You can also talk to him at bonfires and get his story, which comes in fragments since his memory is tied to the artifacts.</p>

<p>Tainted Grail: Fall of Avalon has a lot of side quests and content within the world too. Many of the quests are pretty well put together and a few have some interesting and fun ways to resolve them, provided you meet the skill checks. You can tell the team have put the effort in to write some entertaining characters too, and the acting is decent too though not quite top tier.</p>

<p>Tainted Grail: Fall of Avalon gives you some decent combat options. You can choose to use a sword and shield, dual wield weapons or spells, and combine them so you have a melee weapon in one hand and magic spells in the other. You can also put a few different combinations together so you can switch between quickly. For my playthrough I regularly used spell and sword, with two different combos. One allowed me to summon creatures while dealing heavy damage, while another featured a sword that had life steal and a spell that also stole health from enemies, which can be unstoppable at times.</p>
<p>The efficiency of your spells, weapons, armour are all linked to your attributes. As you level up you will get points to upgrade your attributes, be it physical, perception, spirituality, dexterity, and more, providing a baseline of stats to go alongside skills that you unlock in relation to these categories. Early on you can experiment, but as time goes on you should start focusing on a playstyle to really take full advantage. However, if you get bored of a particular style you can use an Origin potion to reset your points.</p>

<p>There’s something distinctly Oblivion to the visual style of Tainted Grail: Fall of Avalon – the original, I mean, and not the remake. There is a good amount of things to discover within the world to discover, such as with dungeons that are hidden in plain sight. The Horns of the South is full of ruins showing how it has been ignored by Kamelot, while the second area of Cunacht has the show of somewhere falling apart as Kamelot tries to move everyone while locals want to stay. However, there is a clear quality divide between these regions, where Horns of the South just feels far more detailed in comparison to Cunacht.&nbsp;It gives a sense that Tainted Grail: Fall of Avalon is quite front loaded.</p>
<p>Tainted Grail: Fall of Avalon’s technical issues cannot be ignored, despite the regular patches that are being released. The game crashes multiple times, which can be triggered by moving from one place to another, or for some non-obvious reason. There is flickering in the environment that is distracting. There is also a bit of a weird issue when swimming where even if it looks like you are underwater, the oxygen bar doesn’t appear. On occasion, my summons did not engage with enemies or got stuck. Luckily, you can resummon so that is not a big deal, but you would still want it to be better.</p>

<article id="article">

<p>How does it hold up?</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Given the improved specs in the recently released Switch 2, it's not entirely surprising that the system's battery can't quite keep up with its predecessor's (though with the increased size, one has to imagine that Nintendo could stuff a bigger one in there). But just how good / bad is it?</p>
<p>Well, our lovely video producer Alex has put it through its paces to see exactly how long it's likely to last with a variety of different games. To start, he sat down and played <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> until the battery died completely, going from 100% right down to 0%. This lasted for just over 2 hours and 10 minutes, though it's important to note that Mario Kart World is a flagship title for the console.</p>
<p>When testing other games such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/sonic_mania">Sonic Mania</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_dread">Metroid Dread</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_world">Super Mario World</a>, the battery ranges from just over 2 hours to around 5 and a half (though these are rough estimates based on how much battery percentage is lost over a 20-minute session).</p>
<p>So all in all, the Switch 2's battery is about what you'd expect from a console of this calibre, putting it in line with other powerful handhelds like the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally.</p>
<p>We're hopeful Nintendo might provide updated models later down the line with improved battery life, but for now, this is about as good as we're going to get.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e250613.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a>, Capcom reveals that&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry 5&nbsp;</em>sales have hit the 10 million mark. As usual when it comes to sales figures, these numbers apply across all platforms on which the game is available, and they apply to both physical and digital sales as well.</p>

<p>As for the reason behind the game's strong sales performance, Capcom cites its "exceptional gameplay experience", as well as "efforts to enhance brand awareness by leveraging the title beyond the scope of video games".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/devil-may-cry-5-sales-10m-nero.jpg?itok=Ye_Twk9K 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/devil-may-cry-5-sales-10m-nero.jpg?itok=_4R-fP3_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Capcom says&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry 5</em>'s "exhilarating" gameplay is part of the reason for its success.</figcaption></figure><p>Capcom is referring here to the&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>animated series, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/devil-may-cry-animated-series-april-2025" rel="nofollow">debuted on Netflix in April</a>. According to the studio,&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>attracted over 5.3 million views in its first week, as well as garnering critical acclaim worldwide. The show has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-devil-may-cry-renewed-second-season" rel="nofollow">already been renewed for a second season</a>.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry 5</em>, it is, as the name suggests, the fifth mainline installment in the&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>series, which began on the PlayStation 2 in 2001.</p>

<p>At time of writing, it's the latest mainline entry in the franchise, and it features three core playable characters across its campaign: series mainstay Dante,&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry 4&nbsp;</em>newcomer Nero, and V, a mysterious individual with the ability to command monsters.</p>

<p>In a post-launch update, Capcom also added Dante's brother Vergil to the mix as another playable character; it's possible to play as him throughout&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry 5</em>'s campaign, as well as its Bloody Palace and The Void modes.</p>




<p>If you've yet to check out&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry 5</em>, you can pick the game up right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/601150/Devil_May_Cry_5/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/devil-may-cry-5/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/devil-may-cry-5/BNLG5J5KDVJ3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and you can remind yourself what our very own Sam <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/devil-may-cry-5-review-devil-trigger-crybaby" rel="nofollow">thought of it here</a>.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Right, put your hands on the table. Please. I won't ask again. Thank you. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stellar-blade-pc-will-release-on-11th-june-according-to-leaked-trailer-montage-of-technical-improvements">arrived on PC</a> as of June 11th, and naturally that's brought a new lease of life the the modding community who'd only had a demo to play with up until that point. Around 40% of the game's mods over on the Nexus right now are a bit risqué, so we've done you a favour and picked out the three filthiest on offer.</p>
<p>Don't feel you have to thank us. Well, me. This is all part of the job description, alongside all of the holding power to account and providing a service to the consumer stuff. Odds are my Pulitzer's already in the post.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Okay, you ready? Having searched through the 220 Stellar Blade works <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/games/stellarblade/mods?sort=downloads&amp;adultContent=false">on Nexus Mods</a> as of writing, I isolated the 90 tagged as 'adult', and calculated that those numbers meant the racy, lecherous, and bawdy stuff made up exactly 40.54% of the total. Then, my instincts kicked in. I began a search for the naughtiest of the naughty, the hardcore horniness-inducers. I found three things.</p>
<p>First of all, and promise me you'll remain calm, I found the work of modder WTails358. I present to you, dear reader, their <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stellarblade/mods/11">Casual Wear</a>. As you'll see if you click that link after making sure there are no kids or people with pacemakers nearby, this utterly smutty mod clothes Eve in an incredibly chic autumnal turtleneck-style jumper with a dragon design on it.</p>
<p>That sumptuous garment, which tastefully bares her midriff, is paired with delightfully retro chunky trousers that form the perfect constrast via their bright porcelain hue. Completing the look are a striking aquatically-themed belt buckle in gold, and a pair of understated boots that combine practicality with high fashion. Reader, just breathe, I know your temperature's rising with every word, but you must maintain control.</p>
<p>If you're alright to continue, I'll introduce you to this <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stellarblade/mods/60">Formal Wear</a>. Steady now. Take deep breaths. I know, it's an elegant suit and tie combo that allows Eve to cut an equally striking and refined figure that'd look at home on any of the catwalks in Milan or Paris. C'est magnifique, especially twinned with the rounded spectacles that cast Eve as a shrewd, sharp individual who knows what good vintage burgundy tastes like. Phwoar indeed.
</p>
<p>However, you mustn't get carried away, because I have one more totally pornographic mod to show you. It's modder Tenshiken1's <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stellarblade/mods/90?tab=description">Thomas the Tank Engine replacer</a> for the stalker boss. Oh no. You've blown your whistle. You'vre chugged along the tracks and let out a deep, lustful choo-choo. I hope you're proud of yourself. What would Sir Topham Hat think?</p>
<p>Well, at least you've got time to ruminate on your failings and appreciate the non-jiggly things in life while you wait for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shift-up-essentially-confirm-stellar-blade-2-is-in-the-works-havent-revealed-how-revealing-it-will-be">more info from Shift Up</a> about Stellar Blade 2.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

After two good films, the then-up-and-coming director Christopher Nolan was chosen to helm Batman’s return to the movies. Along with David S. Goyer and Jonathan Nolan, these Batman films would take the influences of Michael Mann’s crime films and political thrillers to move the superhero into the post-9/11 world we were living in at the time.</p><p> Christian Bale portrayed this new version of Bruce Wayne, which showed his transformation into Batman from start to finish, including the classic characters he encounters during his missions to protect Gotham. It’s been twenty years since <em>Batman Begins’</em> broad gothic epic of an origin story ushered in a new era of gritty and grounded superhero movies. From that beginning to <em>The Dark Knight</em> ending with real-life-inspired class conflict cataclysm, these ten unforgettable characters had the most profound impact on Bruce Wayne, Batman, and Gotham City itself. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="04f447bf4e0629d27c993768007aa6b1" data-recommend-id="image://04f447bf4e0629d27c993768007aa6b1" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="1598" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Prisoner looking disconcerted " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Prisoner looking disconcerted " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.

In <em>Dark Knight’s</em> epic ferry scene, the Joker (Heath Ledger) rigs two separate ferries with explosives, one holding citizens and one holding prisoners, and places each ferry’s detonator on the opposite boat. He wanted to show Batman that the citizens of Gotham aren’t worth saving because they’d kill each other to save themselves.</p><p> No one saw that ingenious plan being shattered not by a good, upright, working citizen but by this criminal who took it upon himself to do what the police and the citizens on the boats couldn’t. He was the one who knew the only choice was to choose life over the false choice of “survival.” Batman’s speech to the Joker after the boats in Gotham Harbor fail to explode is due to someone who could be on the opposing side of the Dark Knight. Did Batman inspire this person to make this choice, or did even the lowest in Gotham have enough moral and ethical standards and community with everyone in Gotham to inspire Batman from falling to the Joker’s nihilistic outlook and continuing to protect the city? </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e55c46ad0443ecf638a97caf5c15d2fe" data-recommend-id="image://e55c46ad0443ecf638a97caf5c15d2fe" data-format="webp" data-width="1200" data-height="680" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Scarecrow flicking a lighter" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Scarecrow flicking a lighter" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.

Besides <em>Batman Begins</em>, each appearance was a surprise to the audience. Jonathan Crane exploits the many factions in the city to see people overcome with fear because he gets off on it. He even joins Bane’s (Tom Hardy) autocratic government judging the wealthy and the state in <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em>. You see early on how Batman utilizes his own fears as a tool and engine for his crusade for justice and protection of the people. That head-on conflict with Scarecrow embodies this internal triumph, illustrating how it’s an ongoing battle for all of us to overcome our fears.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0bfa247d380222c28ee06bc002a68da2" data-recommend-id="image://0bfa247d380222c28ee06bc002a68da2" data-format="webp" data-width="1405" data-height="695" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Bane standing proudly" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Bane standing proudly" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.

His whole purpose in <em>The Dark Knight Rises </em>is to show Bruce that he’s washed, he doesn’t have it like he used to, and that he can’t just come back from retirement. Even Alfred’s (Michael Caine) plea for Bruce to not face him early in the film feels like Mickey pleading with Rocky not to fight Lang at a similar point in that film. Rocky jokes aside, Bane’s false class savior is an excellent foil for Bruce (and Gotham) to overcome in order to finally save the city from the mistakes he and Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) made after the events of Joker’s (Health Ledger) reign of terror and Harvey Dent’s (Aaron Eckhart) fall from grace.</p><p>Bane is the manifestation of those lies coming home to roost, inspired by the Occupy Wall Street protests in real life; it plays with the idea of a rich billionaire taking it upon himself to decide the best for the city while others have less. Should Bruce have become a costumed adventurer? Was stopping that crusade the right path for everyone in Gotham? Hardy’s performance also sold the transition from the monster-heel luchador look of the comics to a captivating European populist terrorist, which has become iconic in its own right.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fbdd215fa7378b598abe0173ef565753" data-recommend-id="image://fbdd215fa7378b598abe0173ef565753" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Catwoman being sneaky" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Catwoman being sneaky" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.

This Selina, more inspired by Frank Miller’s retooling of <em>Batman: Year One</em>, has shed the mystical cat powers from Tim Burton’s film adaptation and evolved into a more grounded, lower-class Robin Hood-style figure from modern comics. Another character bringing class disparity and a different inspiration for Bruce to suit back up after retirement, Selina opens his eyes to the world in a much different way than his usual allies have.</p><p> Through her, he gains an actual voice from the poor and lower-class citizens of the city, as well as from individuals who commit crimes out of necessity due to a lack of options rather than grand plots or a desire to exploit the Gotham citizenry. She comes into his life and reignites his drive to help Gotham, which had been dormant since the loss of Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes and Maggie Gyllenhaal). Her perspective, much like Dawes’s, forces Bruce to come to terms with the fact that he’s not doing enough for the people of the city, even if he thinks his boogeyman persona is enough to let the police, politicians, and his fellow rich folks decide, at the cost of so many under them. There is, of course, attraction and the usual cat-and-mouse chase we want and expect from Batman and Catwoman, with Anne Hathaway and Christian Bale having the right chemistry to pull off this duo.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="67e910127767b71d1545b618faca5c29" data-recommend-id="image://67e910127767b71d1545b618faca5c29" data-format="jpg" data-width="1400" data-height="700" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Two women looking " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Two women looking " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.

She’s a character who knows Bruce the best, outside of Alfred, and possesses the moral center and dedication to not only justice but also to Gotham. She’s an inspiration for Bruce’s journey, just as much as seeing those bats in the cave. Rachel is a person Bruce loves and trusts so much that he trusts her with his identity from the moment he creates it.</p><p> This love for Rachel is one thing that separates Nolan’s Batman from other interpretations; as much as he wants to protect the city and make it better, he also doesn’t want to be the Caped Crusader forever because he wishes to be with her and have a life beyond being the city’s protector. Her desire to also fight crime as a prosecutor, and her relationship with Dent, beautifully complicates the story of <em>The Dark Knight</em>. With Joker targeting both Rachel and Dent, it threatens Bruce’s hopes and, in turn, destroys his goals. His only choice is to sacrifice Batman’s reputation to save the city. She was his north star, and her loss caused our gritty hero to cease being Gotham’s savior.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d2ba3ef36ef3cb47fb8ea4651d65af32" data-recommend-id="image://d2ba3ef36ef3cb47fb8ea4651d65af32" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Lucius Fox looking suspicious" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Lucius Fox looking suspicious" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.

This version of Fox is much of a mentor-like character, someone who can call Bruce on his mess and also show him some things he might not know. As a man who knew Bruce’s father, he’s one of the three father figures in the orphan hero’s heroic journey to save an embodiment of the 21st-century American city. While not similar to the comics, having Lucius Fox work with Bruce to create the physical persona of Batman by utilizing unused Wayne Enterprises technology also gives the billionaire vigilante a James Bond-esque relationship. By the end, the student becomes the master as Bruce finally fixes something that Fox couldn’t, giving their mentor/mentee dynamic a fulfilling closing.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f7285224a3e7187bb021e2879bde66e0" data-recommend-id="image://f7285224a3e7187bb021e2879bde66e0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1400" data-height="700" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Harvey Dent speaking" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Harvey Dent speaking" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.

That was a campaign slogan that meant more than just running for District Attorney; it was the heart of <em>The Dark Knight</em>. Harvey Dent is more of a damsel than Rachel Dawes. He loved her, and she loves him, but her goal is to protect him. She introduced him to Bruce because of her belief in what Dent could do for Gotham and its people. He fought corrupt police; he went after organized crime; he went out and inspired Gotham. Bruce thinks&nbsp;he can stop being Batman, and can pass the responsibility of looking after Gotham to someone like Dent.</p><p> Just as Bruce sees what he sees, Joker sees it as well and that little bit of darkness there. With just one bad day, Joker can destroy that hope, and he cunningly got just what he wanted – to make Harvey like him and not Batman. From that point, Dent’s submission to his darkest side puts the reluctant hero in a despair that he doesn’t escape until his back is broken by Bane halfway through <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em>. While Gotham survived, that hope it had at the beginning of <em>The Dark Knight</em> is gone, and so is eventually Bruce. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3cd5120fc0ccbfe080bfe5ac9cad56e5" data-recommend-id="image://3cd5120fc0ccbfe080bfe5ac9cad56e5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Joker being devious" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Joker being devious" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.

It is an interpretation that, when first seen in a picture, initially received negative feedback. But now, all that has essentially been erased from reality, as if no one had ever had a negative thing to say about it. Heath Ledger’s Joker reinterpreted this character for a new era in our culture, and this Joker, not much different than other versions at its core, was perfect for this Michael Mann crime film-inspired world of <em>The Dark Knight</em>. It was an interpretation that changed the way the Oscars work. This take on the Joker is one of the first times I recall a superhero movie where people argue that the Joker is right.</p><p> From his messy makeup to his dark jokes about his scars he uses to scare people, the Joker is something Bruce just doesn’t understand, even with constant advice from Alfred. The Joker’s terrorism in Gotham shakes everyone to their core, from citizens and the government to even the criminals, as he attacks the soul of Gotham to prove his nihilistic views of the world.</p><p> The Joker attacks what is in this film the heart of the city—Harvey Dent—and shatters Batman’s hope. Batman loses in this film; while the Joker is stopped, he ultimately achieves his goals in the end. It wasn’t Batman who proved the Joker wrong – it was a convict. Batman and Gordon had lied to everyone so that the city wouldn’t fall apart, and in the end, Batman had to become the villain to the public. It’s rare to see Batman lose, but with the Joker, it’s the only time it ever makes sense. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5681d8d6f465d6cc4f3970722d8b975a" data-recommend-id="image://5681d8d6f465d6cc4f3970722d8b975a" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Commissioner Gordon looking sly" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Commissioner Gordon looking sly" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.

He’s the only police officer Batman ever truly trusts. Gordon, at times, works almost like a point-of-view character for the audience as he navigates being an honest cop in a corrupt city, where he must deal with some of his own people he can’t trust. Yet he trusts Batman through each major event that befalls the city, from poisoned water to the Joker and then losing control of the city to a madman while being left for dead by the federal government. Yet it’s the trust that Bruce has in him, as the policeman who was there for him on the night his parents were murdered and helped keep alive that small flame of faith in the goodness of people and justice, that helps lead Bruce to become Batman. His loyalty to Batman remains even through the flawed plan of the Dent Act. The climax of <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em> makes their connection apparent to Gordon as he finally discovers who Batman is and just how his simple act of being there for a child helped save the city and many lives.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="175325980bd9bc474643c12539987017" data-recommend-id="image://175325980bd9bc474643c12539987017" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Alfred looking concerned" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Alfred looking concerned" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.

First, having Michael Caine play the classic character completely changed how you viewed Alfred. He wasn’t the stereotypical image of the English butler with the tuxedo and the little mustache and bald head that brings Bruce soup and can also perform an oil change on the Batmobile. Changing his backstory to that of a former soldier changed how this character has been adapted ever since. Also, Caine is just cool, and he brings that coolness to Alfred as he advises Bruce on his new journey to protect Gotham through his own means. He has stories and experiences to call upon that inform each film. From the soldier who threw away jewels and wanted to see the world burn to his pitch-perfect read on Bane, he is there to tell Bruce the truth no matter what.</p><p> He reminds Bruce of his father’s lesson in the first film: “Why do we fall, Master Bruce? So we can learn to pick ourselves back up.” He’s constantly there in many ways to remind Bruce and the audience of that lesson, as it’s not just for Bruce but for all of Gotham. Their falling out in <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em> is literally heartbreaking, featuring some of the most emotionally resonant performances in the entire trilogy. With the end of the trilogy focused on Alfred seeing Bruce living out the future he wanted for him, Nolan’s Batman canon achieves an ending that no other version of Batman gets to have – happiness. </p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>During an <a href="https://www.irwebmeeting.com/sony/vod/20250613/x8R5srwN/bsm_02_en/1_GNS/movie/index.html">annual Sony business presentation</a>, CEO Hermen Hulst stated the company remains committed to building "a diverse and resilient" portfolio of live service games, which includes the unreleased <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marathon">Marathon</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fairgames">Fairgames</a>. That's despite high profile live service failures, in addition to controversy with these two forthcoming games.</p>
<p>Hulst stated that Sony is building on the successes of games such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> for future projects, adding: "We look forward to showcasing our progress with Marathon", a game that has seen no shortage of controversy recently.</p>
<p>Helldivers 2, the large jewel in Sony's live service crown, was dubbed a "resounding critical and commercial success" by Hulst, who highlighted both its ability to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-heart-of-democracy-update-sees-super-earth-itself-invaded">retain a passionate community</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-2024-winners-list-who-won-what-this-year">win industry awards</a>.</p>

<p>Hulst called Marathon "innovative and bold". No other compliments were offered to Bungie's upcoming extraction shooter, though the accompanying slide noted "strong early engagement" as its prime achievement so far.</p>
<p>An interesting perspective to be sure, at least as far as Marathon is concerned. While much of what Hulst said about Helldivers 2 is true - the game has managed to remain a fantastic success story for the industry giant - Marathon has found itself on the receiving end of some exceptional problems.</p>
<p>The "strong early engagement" noted in the presentation doesn't reflect the available player figures for the games' closed alpha. During this short-lived test, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Marathon/comments/1k9fob3/marathon_has_lost_roughly_80_of_its_playerbase/">Marathon shed roughly 80 percent of its initial alpha playerbase</a>. As far as engagement via discussion, Marathon's many problems dominated the conversation, such as <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2025/05/04/it-may-be-too-late-to-fix-marathons-core-problem/">its locked three-player format and lack of feasible solo mode</a>, repetitive nature, lack of crucial extraction shooter features such as proximity voice, and more.</p>
<p>One of the biggest merits of Marathon was its aesthetic, which soon soured due to an art plagiarism scandal. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-admits-marathon-includes-artwork-used-without-permission">Bungie admitted to the use of external art in the games development process</a>, blaming it on a former employee and committing to a full audit of in-game assets in order to remove any stolen work. This situation would reportedly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-morale-reportedly-in-free-fall-as-it-grapples-with-stolen-marathon-assets-fallout">send morale at Bungie into "free fall"</a>.</p>
<p>Then we have Fairgames, which hasn't been shown off much since its initial reveal. A co-operative heist game, it was recently delayed due to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fairgames-reportedly-delayed-into-next-year-as-haven-founder-jade-raymond-exits">studio founder Jade Raymond departing for greener pastures</a>. This came following worrying external tests, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-15/playstation-executive-jade-raymond-leaves-studio-she-founded?embedded-checkout=true">according to a report from Bloomberg</a>.</p>
<p>According to Raymond in a 2022 <a href="http://gamesindustry.biz/">Gamesindustry.biz</a> article, "more than 30 percent of the studio is currently working on machine learning, artificial intelligence, and cloud-based dev tools", technology that has proven divisive in recent years. Not to mention what could possibly be the most devastating hit to Fairgames yet: the removal of the dollar sign from its title.</p>
<p>It is clear that, despite uncertainty surrounding Sony's upcoming live service releases, the company wishes to remain entrenched in the space. Or, at the very least, to appear confident in its continued presence in the world of live service. It's worth noting the full record of Sony's venture into live service, which includes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-reflects-on-concords-failed-launch-and-removal-after-two-weeks">the legendary blunder Concord</a>, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">cancelled live service God of War project</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-online-was-great-former-playstation-exec-says-but-naughty-dog-couldnt-make-it-alongside-new-ip">The Last of Us Online</a>, and more. Sony, which initially wanted to release 12 live service games by March 2026, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-is-halving-the-number-of-playstation-live-service-games-that-it-aims-to-launch-by-march-2026/1100-6519039/">has cut that figure down to six</a>.</p>
<p>Sony's single-player output however has proven a far better offering for PlayStation fans. Earlier in this presentation, Hulst highlighted releases such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War: Ragnarok</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marvels-spider-man-2">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a>. Describing such releases as "a core strength" for Sony, it appears as though this style of game has proven more successful overall for the company.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>As <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-will-soon-let-you-filter-games-by-accessibility-feature">promised earlier this year</a>, Valve have given Steam developers the power to tag their games as having certain accessibility features, including narrated game menus, ways of differentiating visual elements that don't rely on colour, and touch-only interaction. You'll now be able to search for games with these tags, and view the full list of accessibility features on each game's Steam page.</p><!--more-->
<p>The update is based on feedback from developers as well as players with disabilities, according to Valve. Participating devs can make use of the system by means of a software wizard - ah, I find it vaguely comforting that people still call this kind of program a "wizard" - which walks them through each accessibility category. Valve say that "over 5000 applications" have already made use of the new tags.</p>
<p>"It's not required, but highly recommended because of how much easier it will be for players with accessibility needs to find these games," they note <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/500575275933763410">in a blog post</a>. "We've worked to make it as easy as possible for developers to indicate these features are available by using feedback to standardize these options as much as possible."</p>
<p>The new accessibility tags are broadly divided into "visual", "audio", "gameplay" and "input". The "gameplay" bracket includes "adjustable difficulty" and "save anytime", while under "visual" we find options like "camera comfort", which lets players "adjust or disable uncomfortable camera movement such as screen shaking, camera bob, or motion blur".</p>
<p>You can read a <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/accessibility_features">full breakdown on Steamworks</a>, including Valve's notes on why each option is important to players.</p>
<p>The selection of taggable features could probably do with some expansion, and the FAQ descriptions themselves are rather brief and broad. When the accessibility tags were announced in April, accessibility-focussed website Can I Play That <a href="https://caniplaythat.com/2025/04/23/valve-announces-accessibility-tags-for-steam/">suggested</a> that Valve should base their system on the existing <a href="https://caniplaythat.com/2025/03/20/accessible-games-initiative-announced-by-esa-and-industry-partners/">Accessible Games Initiative</a>, which aims to standardise accessibility tagging across every game store, to avoid confusing players.</p>
<p>"According to the list in the documentation there is a lot of overlap, and it's mostly Steam that is missing a few tags," Can I Play That wrote. "Steam's version also uses some different names and descriptions. Perhaps most importantly, there also seem to be differences in the criteria."</p>
<p>Still, I'm glad to see this kind of thing from Valve. There's certainly a business case for it, inasmuch as options for players with impaired vision need to be justified in terms of the balance sheet. According to the <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/disability-and-health">World Health Organisation</a>, 1.3 billion people worldwide "experience a significant disability". Back in 2023, our James wrote a feature on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/they-dont-care-inside-the-triumphs-and-failures-of-accessible-gaming-hardware">custom and adaptive controllers in particular</a>, discussing how corporate profit motives inevitably limit the options, together with the lingering problem of ableist players perceiving accessibility features as 'cheating'.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mindseye-review.1217577/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">MindsEye may look like an exciting, GTA-adjacent action-adventure in short clips and GIFs, but actually playing it through to the end of its story has revealed an unfinished, overly ambitious project that’s plagued with performance problems, makes precious little use of its open world, and is crippled by unconvincing combat and dull mission design.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While it’s natural to draw comparisons with GTA, in basic terms MindsEye is more akin to the Mafia series. That is, it’s a tightly linear, single-player story where the open world largely exists as a backdrop for you to drive from mission to mission. That doesn’t end up serving it very well. Mafia is great. MindsEye is not.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You are Jacob Diaz, a former soldier and drone operator who has been railroaded out of the military after a botched mission, albeit with an extremely rare piece of tech still embedded in his neck. He’s a pretty thinly drawn amnesiac hero overall, with no especially memorable characteristics beyond his ability to follow instructions. After securing a security job at mega-company Silva Corp in the Las Vegas-inspired city of Redrock, Diaz is quickly embroiled in an AI-gone-bad, robots-gone-wild adventure that starts slow, gets a little more intriguing a few hours in, and then ends like someone’s yanked the plug out of the wall.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>MindsEye does have style, and its near-future setting is accomplished and credible. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Credit where it’s due, MindsEye <em>does </em>have style, and its near-future setting is accomplished and credible. It fuses locations like normal homes and strip malls that wouldn’t look out of place in the present day with the proliferation of high-tech robotics and drones. The result is a world that appears appropriately futuristic, but doesn’t feel alien or unrecognisable. From an aesthetic perspective, it really does appear a few years from now in a well-executed way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also includes a genuinely impressive fleet of vehicles – and there’s a practicality to them that makes them look like real cars from, say, five to 10 years in the future. It basically takes modern trends – like today’s massive, chunkily-accented pick-up trucks, teardrop-shaped electric sedans, and battery-powered retromods – and successfully projects a decade of tweaks onto them. More importantly, the handling is actually genuinely good in a way open-world action games rarely manage. The cars you actually get to drive are weighty and really love to be whipped into high-speed handbrake turns through the realistically thick traffic. There’s none of that stickiness that’s typical of GTA clones like Sleeping Dogs (which I love regardless) or Saints Row (which I do not). You know, the kind of superficial handling that feels like you’re turning the world under the car, rather than the car itself. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, this is largely where the praise stops.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Mind Over Matter</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The very first mission is a short drive into the desert to shoot four robots who barely have the vigour to fire back, and the second requires you to track a slow-moving thief by monitoring a security console and… switching cameras. It’s not exactly an explosive opening stanza, but things don’t get that much better when the bullets really start flying. It’s around 10 hours of the most boringly straightforward missions from the past decades of open-world action games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat against the handful of bot types and human soldiers is mostly just plain, and dud enemy AI doesn’t make for particularly satisfying shootouts. Humans are the least sensible. Sometimes they take cover; sometimes they just walk towards you waiting to get shot. Run out to meet them and they’re confusingly slow to react (not that this is a particularly strong tactic, as there is no melee attack). </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Dud enemy AI doesn’t make for particularly satisfying shootouts.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s just janky. On the one hand, you can actually shoot individual pieces – including weapons – off the bots. That’s nice. On the other, put a round into a human standing behind some scenery and they’ll often blink back into cover with no linking animation whatsoever. That’s shoddy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not due to a lack of firepower, because MindsEye does feature plenty of guns, although it mostly just chucks them into your arsenal with so little fanfare I usually didn’t notice. I’d just spot something new in my weapon wheel, like another assault rifle, or some kind of energy blaster. It’s rarely clear about what you should be using at any given moment, and it doesn’t seem to matter much. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">MindsEye Screenshots May 2025</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The action does improve towards the back end of the story, as Diaz gets access to all his partner drone’s special perks. The ability to zap an enemy robot and turn it into an instant ally gives the action some zest that it absolutely lacks out of the gate. Your drone’s grenade ability is also neat for a while, but it’s probably a bit <em>too </em>effective at clearing out enemies ahead. I spent most of the late game missions as my drone, dropping endless grenades on soldiers and robots from high above. It made what turned out to be the penultimate battle into one of the easiest because the bad guys just have no defense against this.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The primary problem I had with MindsEye, though, was its drastically uneven performance on my high-end PC (RTX 4080, Intel Core Ultra 9 185H). While the auto settings placed the bulk of the configurable options at ‘High’ – and capped the frame rate at 60fps – my playthrough was rife with issues. It’s regularly blurry and choppy when panning, and the frame rate would flutter and sometimes hang. During one car chase performance chugged to a crawl and was only barely playable. Sometimes even the cutscenes would stutter and display ghosting. Experimenting with lowering the settings hasn’t yielded much in the way of positive results. It’s in really rough shape technically.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To be fair, there <em>are </em>definitely moments in MindsEye when it looks quite stunning. Explosions are excellent. The sunlight piercing through Redrock’s glitzy hotels is seriously snazzy. I liked the sheer scale and complexity of the Silva factory’s rocket loader, and at one point the metallic sheen of a parked jet in the desert glare stopped me in my tracks. When it runs well and looks good, it looks very good. But six months ago I played through Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on this machine and it performed fabulously. MindsEye does not. It’s like Steven Seagal circa 1990: Looks cool – just doesn’t know how to run properly.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s like Steven Seagal circa 1990: Looks cool – just doesn’t know how to run properly.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Performance optimisation won’t solve MindsEye’s myriad other issues, though. A lot of these are really just baked into how it’s designed. Too often, the missions are simply restrictive and <em>dull</em>. All you can do is drive a pre-assigned vehicle to a marker. That triggers a cutscene. Then you shoot everything. Then drive somewhere else. It’s all so rigid and leaves no room for the kind of goofing around or antics you can get into in comparable games, and there’s certainly none of the emergent fun you constantly get in something like GTA. MindsEye rarely trusts us to even park at a mission marker; it generally just splutters into a cutscene when you get close enough.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It doesn’t help that there are no radio stations or songs to listen to as you’re commuting between missions. Travel time from A to B mostly seems to exist to feed you phone calls to prod the story along a little further. Exploration is actively disencouraged, and you’ll be constantly scolded for not heading directly to your destination, or failed out. There’s no reason to explore anyhow, as it isn’t the sort of living world you might have expected. Police don’t even respond to Diaz’s crimes, so what’s even the point?</p><div id="rank-these-non-gta-open-world-actiondriving-games" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Rank these non-GTA open world action/driving games</h3><h3>Rank these non-GTA open world action/driving games</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">And there’s not really anything out there to find. Hunting for a cool vehicle to use? Don’t bother. Other vehicles are off-limits. Wreck the car you were assigned? That’s a mission fail. You won’t even be able to get out of it if it's burning. It’s a baffling choice for a game like this – the entire genre is built around stealing cars.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">MindsEye has <em>some </em>good ideas. An effective stealth mission mid-way is a positive change of pace, and there are some unexpected puzzles late in the piece that gave me a break from blasting. But it relegates the rest of them to its roughly two hours of cutscenes and wastes their potential. At one point a squad of robots are set sprinting after my car at highway speeds. While I was preparing myself for a potentially thrilling chase, the robots caught the car and destroyed it before the cinematic finished. This kind of thing is a real rug pull in a game that, a few hours earlier, made me play through a frustrating, one-off CPR minigame that could’ve just been a cutscene.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/13/vlcsnap-2025-06-13-16h59m26s447-1749799399148.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive...</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Even apparent bosses die in cutscenes. And in an unforgivable transgression, if there’s a way to skip them (even when replaying missions and watching them a second time), I couldn’t find it.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Bots on Your Mind</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The kicker is, even if you get swept up in the sunk-cost fallacy of finishing this 10-hour campaign just to see how the story pans out, the ending itself is a colossal anticlimax. I’ll obviously refrain from spilling the specifics of the final moment, but it’s impossible to complete any assessment of MindsEye’s defects without explaining how deeply and desperately unsatisfying I found it. Story threads are left dangling and reams of questions remain unanswered. It’s not an artistic cliffhanger; it’s just vague and unearned. It’s an ending that feels like the writer was out of fresh paper and this was the only thing that would fit on the last line of the script’s final page. Picture Ghostbusters crashing to credits a few seconds after they cross the streams and you’re about there. There’s a PS after the unskippable credits, but it only makes things worse.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Well, until what happens <em>after </em>the finale, that is. After the story wrapped I was simply tossed back into the open world as… some random weirdo in a crop top. He has some kind of… base? With things in it I can interact with that do… nothing? There’s no explanation of how anything works, no direction, and no purpose. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/13/vlcsnap-2025-06-13-17h27m22s024-1749799775735.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">What.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Confused, I left the building in search of a vehicle, but even here you can’t carjack civilians, and you can’t steal parked cars. I got in the only one that would allow me to enter and drove to an icon that looked like the Hamburglar stealing a car. There was another car there, glowing, but I couldn’t enter it. I shot at the bystanders, and I shot at the soldiers. The soldiers popped out of their 4X4s like waffles from an overzealous toaster. Nothing else happened. No armed response. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I got back in the small hatchback I arrived in, which remained the only vehicle I could interact with. I drove to an icon that looked like a chess piece. The performance took another significant nosedive as I arrived. There were some soldiers there, spread throughout a multi-story parking lot. I shot at them until I got bored, which happened almost instantly because the action is restricted to basic third-person blasting. Chubby crop top man has none of the entertaining drone attacks that Diaz has.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This, it appears, is MindsEye’s free-roaming mode. It’s separate from the main campaign, but I have no idea what we’re intended to <em>do </em>in it. It’s pointless, scrappy, and a complete waste of time in this state. It just isn’t <em>remotely </em>close to finished.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But I am. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Amid disastrously low player numbers, Sony pulled Concord offline just two weeks after launch, with one estimate suggesting it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-estimated-to-have-sold-only-25000-units-heres-why-analysts-think-its-failing"><u>sold just 25,000 copies</u></a>. It has proved a costly failure for Sony, with hundreds of millions of dollars wasted amid the closure of its developer, Firewalk Studios.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What has Sony learned from the Concord disaster, and how does that relate to Marathon, Bungie’s in-development extraction live service shooter? Hermen Hulst, CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment’s Studio Business Group, was asked that question during an investor focused interview. Responding, Hulst admitted that feedback to Marathon’s recent alpha test had been “varied,” but insisted the game will be released during Sony’s current fiscal year ending March 31, 2026, and promised that the mistakes it made with Concord would not be repeated.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Live service, we really see that as a great opportunity for us,” Hulst said. “But with this great opportunity are some unique challenges associated. We talked about some early success as with Helldivers 2. We’ve also faced some challenges, as with the release of Concord.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think some really good work, actually, went into that title, some really big effort. But ultimately that title entered into a hyper competitive segment of the market. I think it was insufficiently differentiated to be able to resonate with players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And so we have reviewed our processes in light of this to deeply understand how and why that title failed to meet expectations and to ensure we’re not going to make the same mistakes again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“As I said earlier, we’ve introduced much more rigorous processes for validating, for re-validating, our creative, our commercial, our development assumptions and hypotheses, and we now do that on a much more ongoing basis. That’s the plan that will ensure we are investing in the right opportunities at the right time, all while maintaining much more predictable timelines.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“For Marathon, it’s our goal to release a very bold, very innovative, and deeply engaging title. It’s going to be the first new Bungie title in over a decade. So we’re really excited for that release. We’re monitoring, we’re going through the test cycles. We’re monitoring the closed alpha cycle the team has just gone through. We’re taking all the lessons learned, we’re using the capabilities we’ve built and analytics and user testing to understand how audiences are engaging with the title.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Some of that feedback, frankly, has been varied. But it’s super useful. That’s why you do this testing. The constant testing, the constant re-validation of assumptions that we just talked about, to me is just so valuable to iterate and to constantly improve the title, so when launch comes, we’re going to give the title the optimal chance of success.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This cycle of test, of iterate, test again, that is such a key component of the live service success, both leading up to launch but also throughout the life of the game. And we’re committed to continuing to leverage our learnings, to maximise engagement and player satisfaction throughout the lifecycle of the title.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Marathon - Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Hulst failed to address <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fans-discuss-marathon-developer-bungies-future-after-yet-another-plagiarism-row-rocks-studio-make-no-mistake-this-is-an-existential-struggle-for-bungie-at-this-point">the recent art plagiarism scandal that embroiled Bungie and Marathon</a>, however.

The Concord flop came after Sony had already canceled Naughty Dog’s The Last of Us multiplayer game. And earlier this year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-unannounced-live-service-games"><u>Sony reportedly canceled two unannounced live service games</u></a>, one a God of War title in development at Bluepoint, the other in the works at Days Gone developer Bend, which recently suffered mass layoffs as a result.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony announced plans in February 2022 to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-playstation-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-by-2026"><u>launch more than 10 live service games by March 2026</u></a>, later saying <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstations-10-live-service-games-will-be-from-different-genres-and-for-different-audiences"><u>the push would bring games of different genres to different audiences</u></a>.

Totoki said Sony was still working on when the other six live service games would come out, adding: "It's not that we stick to certain titles, but for the gamers quality should be the most important.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-teamlfg-a-new-playstation-studio-spun-out-of-bungie-thats-making-a-team-based-action-game-inspired-by-fighting-games-mobas-and-frog-type-games"><u>Sony announced a new PlayStation studio called teamLFG and teased its debut game</u></a>, which is a live service incubation project. Guerrilla’s Horizon multiplayer game is also in development, as is Haven's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fairgame">Fairgames</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking more generally about Sony’s live service ambition, Hulst said the company remains “very, very committed to building a diverse and a resilient live service portfolio.” He pointed to MLB The Show, Destiny 2, and Helldivers 2 as “really good examples of the type of titles we’re looking to develop.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“These titles have already established an enduring set of player experiences and communities across quite a wide range of different genres,” he said. “Together that provides a really good foundation for our ambitions in this category.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I would say additionally we are continuing to invest in new live services, with Helldivers 2 providing such a great example of the level of success we can achieve — if we get everything right.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That game has been a true breakout success, it’s been attracting and retaining significant community and very engaged players since we launched that back in February 2024. And its ongoing success I think is further evidence in how we deal with the monetization. Microtransactions now in that game make up more than half of the revenue.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then, the kicker: a commitment to releasing Marathon by the end of March 2026: “We’re also very excited about Marathon’s anticipated launch in this fiscal year,” Hulst confirmed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/devil-may-cry-5">Devil May Cry 5</a> is the latest Capcom game to surpass the 10m units sold milestone.</p>
<p>The studio shared the news today, crediting the game's "advanced story and action elements" for its ongoing popularity, as well as the addition of a new playable character.</p>
<p>There is one other thing that has given Devil May Cry a bit of a sales boost in more recent months - the arrival of Netflix's Devil May Cry anime series back in April. Based on <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/business/million.html#tab2">previous sales data</a>, Devil May Cry 5 has shifted approximately 9k units since the show's debut.</p>

<p>Celebrating Devil May Cry's latest sales milestone, Capcom said the anime had been met with critical acclaim and boasts more than 5.3m views.</p>
<p>"As a result of the game's exhilarating action, and due to efforts to enhance brand awareness by leveraging the title beyond the scope of videogames, including television adaptations, the title has now exceeded 10m units in cumulative sales worldwide," Capcom wrote.</p>
<p>The Devil May Cry video game series as a whole has now sold more than 33m units since the first title was released all the way back in 2001. "Capcom remains firmly committed to satisfying the expectations of all stakeholders by leveraging its industry-leading game development capabilities in order to create highly entertaining gameplay experiences," the company closed.</p>
<p>As for the Netflix adaptation, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-devil-may-cry-animated-series-gets-positive-update-one-week-after-debut">Devil May Cry has been renewed for a second season</a>. The first season followed demon hunter Dante as he was pitted against the powerful White Rabbit who had ideas to unleash hell on earth, because things just aren't bad enough already.</p>
<p>Along with Johnny Yong Bosch as Dante, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/batman-voice-actor-kevin-conroy-posthumously-stars-in-netflixs-devil-may-cry-anime">first series of Devil May Cry included legendary Batman voice actor Kevin Conroy as VP Baines</a>.</p>

            <p>PlayStation will remain "thoughtful" with which of its games it brings to other platforms.</p>
<p>During a recent fireside chat, Sony Interactive Entertainment president Hideaki Nishino and Studio Business Group head Hermen Hulst were asked about how they would "protect the value" of the PlayStation console, when there is a move towards multiplatform gaming.</p>

<p>Nishino noted that for over 30 years PlayStation has been "committed to being the best place to play and publish", adding the PlayStation console experience is designed for "immediate gameplay in an immersive and accessible way". That said, the team is always looking for "new and innovative ways to broaden [its] reach".</p>
<p>Hulst then affirmed that PlayStation is "continuously exploring new ways for players to interact with their franchises", before adding: "It's important to realise that we're really thoughtful about bringing our franchises off console to reach new audiences and that we're taking a very measured, a very deliberate approach in doing that.</p>
<p>"Particularly on the single-player side, our tentpole titles, they're such a point of differentiation for the PlayStation console. They are real showcases of the performance, of the quality of the hardware, so we want to ensure that players get the best experience from these titles."</p>
<p>Continuing, Hulst said PlayStation is very "thoughtful" about the "how and if we bring these titles to other platforms".</p>
<p>"We need to constantly understand the players' patterns and behaviours," Nishino further explained. "We need to be sure we serve them appropriately. [Hulst] and myself are very, very focused on this, and investing as needed to evolve the PlayStation experience."</p>
<p>When further asked about Microsoft's multiplatform push, which has seen games such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a> and more arrive on non-Xbox consoles, Nishino said "competition in the business is healthy" and helps drive innovation.</p>
<p>"There are multiple participants who together drive the overall gaming industry, and while there are new engagement models being explored, we ultimately think this is a good thing," he said.</p>
<p>"However, as I mentioned earlier, we are confident and committed on our current strategy. There isn't an urgent need for us to pivot, but we will continue to monitor play patterns appropriately as required."</p>

<p>PlayStation has been steadily adding many of its titles to PC over the past few years, with the likes of Uncharted, The Last of Us and Spider-Man now all available on that additional platform. In February of this year, former PlayStation exec Shuhei Yoshida said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-games-on-pc-is-almost-like-printing-money-says-former-exec-shuhei-yoshida">porting PlayStation-exclusive games to PC was "almost like printing money"</a>, and provides an opportunity to invest in further games.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the PlayStation published <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a> released on PC, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-pc-debut-welcomes-record-numbers-for-a-playstation-published-single-player-release">becoming the company's first single player game to pass 100,000 concurrent players on Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Stellar Blade shattered expectations when it arrived as a PlayStation 5 exclusive last year. Despite being the debut console title from Korean gacha game developer Shift-up, the game was knocking it out of the park with striking gameplay, incredible music, and gorgeous high-definition visuals that stood confidently alongside Sony’s first-party heavy hitters like God of War and Spider-man. The fervor around an eventual PC port of this game has been bustling since it released. As someone who only ever played a demo of the original PlayStation 5 release, this PC port combined with it’s bundled assortment of crossover DLC served as my wake-up call to finally dive in. And across my desktop PC and my Steam Deck OLED, Stellar Blade has impressed me on every level.</p>
<p><iframe title="Stellar Blade PC - Launch Trailer | PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_VyeH5uteVk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The graphics and display options on offer here are comparable to other Sony PC ports in how exhaustive and detailed the list of settings to tweak are. Resolution scaling will be set to either NVIDIA DLSS 4, and AMD’s <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/resources/support-articles/release-notes/RN-RAD-WIN-FSR-TECH-PREVIEW.html">FSR 4</a> or FSR 3, depending on the GPU you use. FSR 3 is the universal option, comparable to the upscaling used on PS5, while FSR 4 is closer to DLSS in how it works and exclusive to the new Radeon RX 9000 GPUs.</p>


<p>With upscaling enabled, the game raced to an average 90-100 FPS when played at 1440P with max graphics settings on my GeForce RTX 3080. A couple cutscenes full of lots of monsters would cause minor dips, but they were rare and I never felt like the resolution scaling was a distraction. This can even be combined with DLSS frame generation, the game easily hit smooth framerates without major graphical downgrades.</p>


<p>What blew me away, though, was that even with resolution scaling turned completely off, the game was able to maintain a locked 60FPS at 1440P nearly the entire time. As is typicaly, the RTX 3080 easily outperforms every base PlayStation 5 graphics mode, which relied on scaling solutions to hit those targets. Playing any new games at 4K and a steady FPS feels like a pipe dream unless you’ve got a beefy rig or generate half your frames, but Stellar Blade shows a level of optimisation that so few AAA games nowadays do.</p>
<p>Even better, this all means the game is great on Steam Deck. So many recent Sony PC ports require a lot of visual compromise to just barely run on the Valve’s handheld PC, but Stellar Blade feels like it was made for this form factor. The game stays at a steady framerate and maintains a shocking amount of it’s original visual detail and quality.</p>

<p>Packed in alongside the base game content is a duology of crossover DLC with other games that carry a similar thematic through-line of “if android, why hot?” – Square Enix’s&nbsp;Nier Automata&nbsp;an Shift-up’s own title&nbsp;Nikke: Goddess of Victory.&nbsp;Both DLC are more a collection of easter eggs and bonus activities than they are a massive expansion or story continuation. If you’re a fan of either property though, the amount of references and call-backs and familiar costumes tossed in from each game are a delight. The&nbsp;Nikke: Goddess of Victory&nbsp;DLC in particular, which launched alongside this port, includes a new fishing mini-game, a cover-shooter mission series replicating the gameplay from the fanservice-filled gacha game, and an entire new boss fight against a major character from that title. My only complaint? No love for my favorite&nbsp;Nikke&nbsp;character, Elegg. BOOM is life.</p>
<p>Stellar Blade&nbsp;is incredible on PC, and doesn’t compromise at all on any of the quality from the original PlayStation 5 release. For existing fans, the upgrades in resolution and framerate potential are a revelation and the new&nbsp;Nikke&nbsp;dlc is a blast. For those who haven’t played the game yet, this is easily the most accessible and versatile way to check it out.</p>

<figure><a title="MARIO KART WORLD REWIND LAP TIMES" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/aea2877ec2b85/mario-kart-world-rewind-lap-times.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Leave it to Nintendo to put a mechanic into a game that can be used in lots of 'unintended' ways. Then leave it to the typical Nintendo fan to figure out how to mess with it almost immediately.</p>
<p>Yes, just as we are routinely amazed by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/09/random-game-dev-builds-baffling-contraptions-to-solve-zelda-totk-addison-puzzles">what players come up with in the likes of Tears of the Kingdom</a>, it's taken very little time for them to start <em>doing things</em> to Mario's fancy new rewind feature in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> - which, when playing offline, allows you to cycle back through a race by holding down on your D-pad, then resume from where you paused.</p>
<p>For your average player (or just me) this will be deployed with zero imagination, used to correct course when we've crashed or fix things when we've taken a big blue shell to the bonce. That sort of caper. Of course, if you're a real gamer<strong>™</strong>, you'll do much smarter things.</p>
<p>Take, for example, YouTube creator <a href="https://youtu.be/TF3KYsz9ZLY?si=O23AHBjUV3M8D9bG">Jopes</a>, who (<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/super-mario/mario-kart-worlds-new-rewind-feature-can-be-used-in-time-trials-to-set-wild-records-like-this-13-second-lap/">and as spotted by GamesRadar</a>) uploaded a video showing how you can take a course that's nice and small (he uses a few, such as Koopa troopa Beach), and then rewind all the way back through an entire lap from the finish line.</p>
<p>What does this mean? Well, it means that, because the rewind feature is sped-up, you reap the benefits of how quickly you move:</p>

<p>Once he'd honed his technique down (and you should check out the video above as it's really neat and packed full of detail), he's managed to get his lap time down to <em>12.856 seconds</em>!</p>
<p>Now, to get to that lap time, he's done some clever driving, too, taking shortcuts and going off-road, so do give the eight-minute video a watch as there's way too much nuance to detail here. Also, you can then try to best his time.</p>
<p>Of course, the new Mario Kart is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/youll-want-to-learn-these-new-mario-kart-world-tricks-if-you-hope-to-win">packed full of new ways to gain speed boosts and get better times</a> without resorting to rewind feature shenanigans, therefore we're sure we'll be seeing some more eye-opening stuff in fairly short order. Stay tuned.</p>

			<p>PlayStation is fully committed to exploring a new and enhanced way for players to engage with their content and services, but this new method will hardly be limited to cloud gaming.</p>
<p>Speaking during an <a href="https://www.irwebmeeting.com/sony/vod/20250613/x8R5srwN/bsm_02_en/1_GNS/fireside_chat/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investor-focused interview</a>, Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO and president Hideaki Nishino was asked directly about the future of the company, starting with cloud gaming, which has seen an increase in popularity in the past few years. While PlayStation has been in the cloud gaming business for the last 11 years, deploying cloud gaming services since the PlayStation 3 generation, Nishino-san highlighted how the cloud gaming business model has to be sustainable for the long-term growth, and despite the technological advancements of the past few years, the SIE CEO believes that the vast majority of players will continue to want a traditional experience based on local hardware, without depending on the network conditions, which are an unpredictable variable. From this statement, it's clear how the next PlayStation will be a traditional console, but interestingly enough, Nishino-san highlighted how they are committed to exploring a new and enhanced way for players to engage with the company's content and services, a statement that seems to hint at the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-handheld-ai-upscaling-16gb-lpddr5x-16mb-mall/">unannounced handheld</a> that is reportedly in the works.</p>
<p>Elaborating on the new and enhanced way for players to engage with content and services, Sony Interactive Studio Business Group CEO Hermen Hulst touched upon the company's multiplatform strategy, saying that they're being thoughtful about bringing their franchises off consoles to reach a new audience, especially regarding single player games, which are considered as the point of differentiation for the PlayStation console. They are the real showcase of the performance and quality of the hardware, so the company is constantly thinking hard about how and if these titles are brought to other platforms. As such, it seems like the current strategy of late PC ports for single-player games will remain in place for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>While ports of PlayStation Studios' developed games are likely to continue releasing on PC years after their console debut, that doesn't seem to be the case with games that are only published by the company. Shift Up's Stellar Blade launched on PC only a year after its console debut, and Lost Soul Aside will be launching simultaneously on PC and console this August. Hopefully, the recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-more-than-doubles-sonys-previous-steam-ccu-record-for-single-player-games/">success of Stellar Blade on PC</a> will compel PlayStation to focus more on the PC market in the future.</p>

		<p>It’s been a long and busy week, with last weekend being a mad juggle of trying to play as much Switch 2 as possible while also covering Summer Game Fest streams and showcases. The Switch 2 gaming has continued through to this week, as Dom and I led the charge on doing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/11/how-the-switch-2-fixed-bad-switch-1-frame-rates-even-without-patches/">a broad look at backward compatibility games</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/12/cyberpunk-2077-switch-2-review-ps4-xbox-comparison/">Cyberpunk 2077’s impressive port</a>, and I published our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/12/mario-kart-world-review/">Mario Kart World</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/12/nintendo-switch-2-review-one-week-with-the-new-generation-handheld/">hardware review</a> after gathering my thoughts from the first week.</p>
<p>There’s still plenty more Switch 2 stuff to do, though. I’ll soon be telling you about how the Hogwarts Legacy on Switch 2 is a “transfigurational” port. Can you tell that I’m happy with this reference?</p>

<p>For some reason, I asked everyone to tell me relay their week’s gaming while making it rhyme. Not everyone was up to the task, but we did get some nice poems.</p>
<p>Here’s <strong>Ade</strong>:</p>

<p><em>For review I played Alter, and I didn’t falter. It was very hard, like frozen lard, but I saw it through to the end, and confirm that money on it people should spend.</em></p>

<p><strong>Dom’s</strong> was more of a limerick:</p>
<p><em>I played Switch 2 with my wife</em><br>
<em>I thought to myself ‘what a life!’</em><br>
<em>But I didn’t let her win</em><br>
<em>My Switch 2 is in the bin</em><br>
<em>Who knew Mario Kart causes such strife?</em></p>
<p>And here’s <strong>Gamoc’s</strong> effort:</p>
<p><em>I start by playing Balatro,</em><br>
<em>Then Warhammer, I’m sure you know,</em><br>
<em>But then I remembered a review,</em><br>
<em>That is what I should do,</em><br>
<em>So I looked at Baldur’s Gate and said no!</em></p>
<p><em>Instead I played Zombie Army,</em><br>
<em>And after that the Atomfall DLC,</em><br>
<em>The reviews will come soon,</em><br>
<em>Before the full moon,</em><br>
<em>Because then a werewolf I’ll be.</em></p>
<p><em>Also, I’m a werewolf.</em></p>
<p>Sadly nobody else was willing to take on this task, <strong>Steve</strong> even said that these efforts caused him “significant discomfort as a lecturer in English Lit and Creative Writing.” So we’re back to the boring land of basic prose, and he played “<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/10/ten-horror-game-demos-to-chill-and-thrill-you-in-steam-next-fest-this-week/">a whole bunch of Steam demos</a> and put a few hours into Mario Kart World.”</p>
<p>Speaking of Mario Kart World, <strong>Nic’s</strong> son decided to add a little bit of “4D haptics” to his gaming by whacking him in the Mushroom Kingdom’s crown jewels. Ouch! He also played Split Fiction, Survival Kids and Bravely Default’s remake on Switch 2, with reviews for them all still in the pipe.</p>

<p><strong>Aran</strong> tired of playing games where he wasn’t the named protagonist, so went back to Blades of Fire to fight some things. He’s also reviewed Tainted Grail Fall of Avalon, which is a good game marred by so many technical issues.</p>
<p>After checking out Nioh 3’s demo some more, and revisiting Dynasty Warriors: Origins for a Shu playthrough, <strong>Jim</strong> moved on to the Cairn demo. “It’s a truly unique game about climbing a mountain, from the devs who created the fantastic Furi, that somehow manages to be zen and infuriating at the same time. I’m looking forward to playing the full release though I’m hoping the performance improves drastically on PS5 (the demo was super choppy).”</p>
<p>And finally, <strong>Tuffcub’s</strong> got to keep quiet about Death Stranding 2 a little longer.</p>
<p>Now then, what have you played this week?</p>

<figure><a title="Switch 2 / PS5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a208dca657808/switch-2-ps5.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The Switch 2 has been out for a little over a week now, and it's already breaking records in multiple regions. Nintendo has confirmed that the console <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/its-official-switch-2-has-sold-over-3-5-million-units-globally-in-its-first-four-days">sold 3.5 million units in the first four days of sale</a>, but it's also become the fastest-selling Nintendo console in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/switch-2-is-officially-the-fastest-selling-nintendo-hardware-ever-in-the-us">US</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/switch-2-is-nintendos-biggest-uk-console-launch-of-all-time">UK</a>, and Japan. In the latter region specifically, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/japanese-charts-switch-2-crushes-ps2-to-become-fastest-selling-console-ever">Switch 2 also beat the PlayStation 2</a> to become the fast-selling console <em>of all time</em>. Crikey.</p>
<p>Naturally, thoughts are inevitably turning toward Nintendo's direct competition, and whether the likes of Sony and Microsoft might be concerned about the Switch 2's monumental success. Well, <a href="https://www.irwebmeeting.com/sony/vod/20250613/x8R5srwN/bsm_02_en/1_GNS/fireside_chat/index.html">according to SIE's new president and CEO, Hideaki Nishino</a> during a Business Segment fireside chat, the company isn't particularly bothered (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/switch-2-sony-says-ps5-performance-required-for-great-experience-on-a-big-screen/">VGC</a>).</p>
<p>When asked if the Switch 2's improved specs and Nintendo's relationships with third-party publishers caused any concern, Nishino was keen to reiterate the appeal of the PS5 against its competitors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We closely monitor the overall gaming industry, including the actions of other market participants. Additionally, catalysts in the market are great for the industry as a whole, as they invigorate the excitement and demand more broadly. So it’s great to have people launching new things.</p>
<p>“However, as I mentioned previously, we have a differentiated strategy. PlayStation 5 is designed for an immersive gaming experience, and this includes the innovative DualSense controller features as well. We believe PS5-level performance is required to achieve a great experience on big screens. And in this way, we have provided a unique offering for players and creators in this current console generation.</p>
<p>“However, publisher strategies are increasingly shifting towards being multi-platform, so more platforms can run the same game, which is great from a creator’s perspective. Among those platforms, our mission is that we will continue to be the best place to play and publish.</p>
<p>“As such, we have empowered our creators to leverage our offering and services to create amazing, unique experiences for players with high engagement and great monetisation opportunities. We have done this consistently as the industry and competitive dynamics have evolved. And of course, PlayStation Studios, our franchises, have a special role in showcasing the PlayStation experience and then strengthening the player’s vision with us.”</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>To be fair to Sony, the PS5 is a great system, though we'd be lying if we said that its first-party offering was thriving at the moment. Sony has struggled recently with its ill-conceived focus on live-service games, resulting in the highly-publicised failure of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/concord">Concord</a>, the cancellation of <strong>The Last of Us Online</strong>, and ongoing concerns around Bungie's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/marathon">Marathon</a>.</p>
<p>That said, PS5 will have pretty tempting exclusives this year in the form of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/death_stranding_2_on_the_beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/ghost_of_yotei">Ghost of Yotei</a>, with the likes of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/marvel_tokon_fighting_souls">Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls</a>, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/saros">Saros</a>, and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/intergalactic_the_heretic_prophet">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a> following later.</p>
<p>There's room for all, is what we're saying. But it's going to be interesting to see how the dynamic between the Big Three changes with the Switch 2. Chances are there are a few publishers who regret not supporting the Switch enough in recent years, so we suspect that will no doubt change going forward.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-may-allow-music-artists-to-upload-their-music-directly-in-the-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Grand Theft Auto VI is set to revolutionize music handling in open-world games, if a well-known music producer's recent revelations are true.</p>
<p>Speaking during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@newrorynmal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Rory and Mal</a> show, Grammy-winning music producer Jermaine Dupri surprisingly revealed that artists will be able to upload their music directly to an unspecified Grand Theft Auto game. While the music producer did not specifically mention Grand Theft Auto VI, there's no way this feature would get added to the fifth entry in the series so late after its release, so there's little doubt that this will be a feature in the game launching next year on consoles. Jermain Dupri also added that the rapper Drake will have his own radio station, and from his understanding, the rapper himself could upload music to the game that is not available anywhere, something that would turn Grand Theft Auto VI into a music streaming service like Spotify and the like.</p>
<p><iframe title="Jermaine Dupri, Ray Vaughn, Claressa Shields &amp; More Join us at the BET Awards Pt. 1 | NEW RORY &amp; MAL" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/le8zt-XrrNg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While we have to take all the above with a huge grain of salt, it would definitely make sense for Rockstar Games to do something like this for Grand Theft Auto VI, considering how music has always been important in every entry in the series, and how the game is setting out to be the most successful game release of all time. I personally hope the option, if real, will be available to a wide variety of artists, as nothing would beat going around the game's beautiful world with some pumping rock and metal tunes, bringing back to mind the days of roaming about Vice City with Iron Maiden's 2 Minutes to Midnight, Megadeth's Peace Sells and Ozzy Osbourne's Bark at the Moon playing in the background.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto VI launches on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S on <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/">May 26th, 2026</a> worldwide.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/4468">Beast Master</a> is the mod in question, and the latest example of prolific ColdTyrant <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-right-there-oblivion-remastered-modder-imperial-watch-proper-joinable-faction-new-quests-and-a-corruption-system">working to revamp</a> 2025's most 2006 release by giving folks new stuff to try once they've had their fill of shutting spooky doors. </p>
<p>Building on the pretty basic command creature spell from the base game, which Wood Elves have as a racial ability, he's put together a means for you to tame any animal you come across in the wilderness via magic and have it permanently join you on your adventures as a named "combat pet". In addition to being commandable and aiding you in fights like any regular companion, these pets can be fed grub from your inventory and interacted with in order to check on their mood.</p>
<p>That last bit has no impact in gameplay, so the mod's more of the casual pet ownership experience than a full Nintendogs-style furry thing parent simulation that'll leave you feeling even more unnerved than usual about your real life ability to look after actual human children.</p>
<p>Further to that end, you can only have one pet at any given time via the mod, so if you want to replace your tamed Imp named Fatso with a brown bear named Bingus or a troll named Sapphire, you'll have to release the former back into the wild. As of right now, the mod has short lists of pre-defined names and recruitable animals for you to pick from, but ColdTyrant has indicated he's open to adding more options based on suggestions.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the modder says he initially tried letting folks type in their own custom pet names, but had to ditch that option due to it being "literally impossible to rename an actor without clicking on them directly in the console" at the moment.</p>
<p>If you fancy giving this Beast Master mod a go, you’ll need to grab <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/32">UE4SS</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/1272">TesSyncMapInjector</a>. The <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/282">Oblivion Remastered Script Extender</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/1966">MagicLoader 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/473">NL-Tag Remover</a> are optional installs, but not hard requirements.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-more-than-doubles-sonys-previous-steam-ccu-record-for-single-player-games/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PC version of Stellar Blade has finally launched, around thirteen months after the game's or<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iginal debut on Sony's PlayStation 5 console</a>. This version is also published by Sony and as such, it's interesting to compare its early player figures against other recent Sony-published games that made it to the PC platform.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3489700/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SteamDB</a>, Stellar Blade has already more than doubled any previous single player games published by Sony on Valve's store when it comes to concurrent user peak. The action title peaked at 183.8K players around nineteen hours ago, with the potential to go even higher as we head into the weekend, when gamers have more time to play.</p>
<p>Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut <a href="https://steamdb.info/publisher/PlayStation+Publishing+LLC/?sort=peak_desc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set</a> the previous record earlier this year with 77.1K, although it should be clarified that the game also includes a multiplayer coop mode, Legends. As such, it might be more appropriate to consider Sony Santa Monica's God of War, which peaked at 73.5K players, the previous record holder. Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered reached a peak of 66.4K players; Horizon Zero Dawn Complete Edition stopped at 56.5K, while its sequel, Horizon Forbidden West Complete Edition, peaked at 40.4K players. The Last of Us Part I registered 36.4K concurrent players on Steam, narrowly beating God of War Ragnarok (35.6K), The Last of Us Part II Remastered (30.6K), Marvel's Spider-Man 2 (28.1K), and Days Gone (27.4K). All the others are much lower in the chart. Interestingly, all the first installments registered higher peaks than their sequels.</p>
<p>Stellar Blade is certainly an acclaimed title, having sold enough to warrant a <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-pc-port-and-sequel-planned-confirms-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sequel</a>. That said, some of the other games mentioned above have rated even higher, despite reaching lower concurrent players on Steam. This new record might be surpassed soon, though, as the next Sony-published PC game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-soul-aside-gets-delayed-to-august-29/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lost Soul Aside</a>, will release on the same day as on consoles (August 29). It will be the first single-player game published by Sony to launch day and date on PC, and that might be enough to raise interest in the game, provided that it reviews well enough.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-tips-tricks">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> will be updated sometime this month with "enhanced fights against existing Nightlords", but as is often the way of updates, some of the relevant boss files are already in the current version of the game, and yes, there's a mod if you want an early crack at them.</p><!--more-->
<p>From Software teased the coming of spruced-up boss battles in <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1929780349380223096">a social media post</a> on 3rd June, offering no clue as to what "enhanced" means in this context. Enhanced movesets? Enhanced haircuts? An inflated sense of self-esteem?</p>
<p>Subsequently, owl-eared, eagle-eyed players noticed that there were unused sections in every boss soundtrack theme that implied the addition of a third combat phase, together with unused boss relics that look like a reward for besting them in hard mode. Now, via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/fromsoftware-left-hints-for-elden-ring-nightreigns-enhanced-bosses-update-in-the-files-and-modders-have-already-dug-them-up/">PCGamer</a>, NexusMods user TerraMag has dug up the files that let you fight the "enhanced" Nightlords and released them as the obliquely named <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenringnightreign/mods/92">Enhanced Nightlord Fights mod</a>.</p>
<p>If you lack the fortitude to face these maxed-out titans yourself, or you just want to chill to footage of an apoplectic gigaroach, TerraMag has kindly released some videos of the enhanced fights. Bear in mind, of course, that these aren't the final, From-sanctioned versions of each enhanced boss, so they might appear rough and unfinished. </p>

<p>TerraMag has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY_1VCfCjWg">harsh words for Adel, Baron of Night in one video description</a>, complaining that "this fucker REFUSED to do any normal bite moves to let me show off the new effect on it". Well, perhaps that's because you woke Adel's phase 3 incarnation up before the appointed time, guy. I'm not much of a morning person myself. Don't ask me to bite anybody before I've had my second coffee.</p>
<p>Enhanced Nightlord scuffles aside, From <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-now-confirmed-to-be-getting-those-duo-expeditions-plus-enhanced-fights-against-its-current-nightlord-crop">plan to add duo expeditions to Elden Ring Nightreign</a> in the near future - though naturally, there's already a mod for that as well - in addition to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreigns-latest-update-is-here-to-save-you-from-frame-drops-buggy-bosses-and-more">more routine balancing and technical updates</a>.

It's about walking and talking—and therein lies the charm. Players are forced to cooperate to navigate a lush open world, solve puzzles, and embark upon hijinks. Proximity-based communication is the core mechanic in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Big Walk</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">—whether that takes the form of voice chat, written text, hand signals, blazing flares, or pictograms—and it looks like it'll lead to all sorts of weird and wonderful antics.

I'm looking forward to this one.</span><br></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/microsoft-made-xbox-handheld-reportedly-dead-oem-might-make-next-gen-xbox-consoles/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A couple of weeks ago, Microsoft centric website Windows Central <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-plans-reportedly-on-standby/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that the company had paused its work on the Xbox handheld project. This did not affect the partnership with ASUS to make the ROG X Ally and ROG X Ally X, which were <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-powered-by-amd-ryzen-revealed-for-a-holiday-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at the Xbox Games Showcase 2025 for a holiday release window.</p>
<p>Originally, Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-reportedly-consists-of-traditional-console-handheld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planned</a> to use this partnership as a stopgap while it produced its own Xbox handheld that would have been released alongside the next-generation Xbox home console. These plans, however, are more than just paused - they might be practically dead now, according to The Verge's Tom Warren. In his <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/686101/microsoft-xbox-next-gen-console-handheld-hints-notepad" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest paywalled Notepad newsletter</a>, Warren says that Microsoft will focus on the software platform instead. Furthermore, he points out that while there will be an 'official' next-generation hardware from Microsoft, OEM partners like ASUS may also release their own versions of a next-gen Xbox console.</p>
<p>In that regard, Warren believes that the ASUS-made handhelds are a sort of 'market test' for Microsoft's increasingly tight integration of Windows and Xbox, not to mention the ambitious goal of turning every screen into an Xbox. The Verge's journalist adds that, at some point, the emulation project established by Sarah Bond in early 2024 may solve the issue. Until then, Xbox Play Anywhere and Xbox Cloud Gaming streaming are doing most of the work in helping spread the brand across devices.</p>
<p>Last year, Microsoft has made some lofty promises when it comes to the next-generation console, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-generation-largest-technical-leap-ever-seen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claiming</a> that the successor of the Xbox Series X would deliver the 'largest technical leap ever seen' from one generation to another. That's certainly an ambitious goal that could possibly only be achieved through the implementation of machine learning algorithms, although we'll have to wait until Microsoft reveals its hand before assessing the veracity of that statement. The next Xbox is currently thought to be targeting a 2027 launch, presumably near the holiday season.</p>

			<p>After the news that Street Fighter 6 had <a href="https://wccftech.com/capcom-announced-street-fighter-6-has-surpassed-5-million-copies-sold-since-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surpassed</a> 5 million units sold, CAPCOM has another sales milestone to announce this week, this time for Devil May Cry 5. The latest installment in the popular action game franchise has <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e250613.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> 10 million units since its debut on March 8, 2019, for PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.</p>
<p>Devil May Cry 5 had <a href="https://wccftech.com/gdc-2019-devil-may-cry-5-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> 2 million units in less than a month, but then sales slowed down considerably. It wasn't until April 2022 that CAPCOM could <a href="https://wccftech.com/devil-may-cry-5-has-sold-over-5-million-units-globally-says-capcom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announce</a> the five million sales milestone. Notably, sales were at 9.1 million units as of March 31, 2025, meaning the game sold almost a million units in less than three months.</p>
<p>That's a lot for a relatively old game, but it's not impossible. For one thing, there was the acclaimed Netflix Devil May Cry show that certainly helped push game sales, too. CAPCOM says that with more than 5.3 million views, it ranked fourth globally in the 'Shows | English' category during its first week. It also ranked in the top 10 for seven consecutive days in Japan. Moreover, there was a <a href="https://x.com/DevilMayCry/status/1910766029376262605" target="_blank" rel="noopener">franchise sale in April</a>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, CAPCOM is counting Devil May Cry 5 Special Edition separately. On its Platinum Titles chart, that version is listed as having sold 1 million units on its own, which means that DMC 5 as a whole has technically surpassed 11 million units.</p>
<p>DMC 5 earned high praise here on Wccftech from resident fan Francesco De Meo, who <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/devil-may-cry-v-devil-trigger-pulled/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rated</a> the game 9.8 out of 10:</p>
<p>Devil May Cry V is, without a doubt, the best entry in the series so far, taking everything that made Devil May Cry 3 and 4 good and bringing everything up a notch. Those who only wish to play the game through once at regular difficulty will "only" see Devil May Cry V as a very good action game that can keep them engaged from beginning to end, but veterans of the series will see it as the deep, fun and engaging game they have been waiting for over ten years.</p>
