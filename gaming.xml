			<p>CCP Games announced that <a href="https://wccftech.com/ccp-games-announce-new-title-eve-frontier-same-universe-as-eve-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EVE Frontier</a>, its new space survival MMO, has now opened public access with 'Founder Access: New Era' following the previous Closed Alpha stage.</p>
<p>EVE Frontier is set in an enigmatic and hostile galaxy shaped by its players' activities. Players inhabit Riders: awakened clones flung into the Frontier without purpose or memory of the world around them. As they explore the darkness, they must construct shelters, form Tribes, and gather resources to increase their power and survive the ever-present danger of annihilation.</p>
<p>Founder Access: New Era also introduces a brand-new seasonal progression system for EVE Frontier called Cycles. The first cycle, Promised Lands, begins today. Players will earn Grace by completing in-game missions and activities and rise to the top of each Cycle Leaderboard alongside their Tribe. As the New Era progresses, new missions, objectives, and content will be introduced in subsequent Cycles.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bend-studio-layoffs-days-gone</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/days-gone-developer-bend-studio-lays-off-one-third-of-staff.1215543/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bend-studio-layoffs-days-gone<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Days Gone&nbsp;</em>developer Bend Studio has been hit by sweeping layoffs affecting around a third of the company's staff, parent company Sony has confirmed.</p>

<p>In a statement given to <a href="https://kotaku.com/days-gone-sony-bend-canceled-shooter-layoffs-1851784264" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Kotaku</a>, Sony says the layoffs are part of "strategic changes to better position the studio for long-term success", a pretty standard corporate line. The company goes on to say that the "workforce reduction" was a decision that was "not made lightly", and that those being laid off made "meaningful contributions" to Bend Studio.</p>

<p>Sony did not, however, confirm the exact scope of the layoffs. That figure comes from Bloomberg's Jason Schreier, who said on social media platform <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lrbil2zvis2q" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>&nbsp;that "around 40 people", i.e. 30% of Bend Studio's staff, had been laid off.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bend-studio-layoffs-days-gone-gameplay.jpg?itok=-bKvUQga 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bend-studio-layoffs-days-gone-gameplay.jpg?itok=KZQIiDpL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Days Gone&nbsp;</em>developer Bend Studio has been hit by layoffs.</figcaption></figure><p>These layoffs come after Sony canceled two of its in-development live-service projects <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-live-service-games-canceled" rel="nofollow">back in January</a>, one of which was in the works at Bend Studio. In the statement given to Kotaku, Sony said it made the decision not to proceed with Bend's game following "careful consideration".</p>

<p>According to Schreier, Bend Studio is currently working on a new project that it started following the live-service game's cancellation, and Sony says it remains "confident in [Bend Studio's] future and creative direction", so it sounds as though the studio is still working on a game of some sort.</p>

<p>Layoffs at Bend Studio come after a wider wave that has swept across the industry, affecting smaller studios like&nbsp;<em>Yooka-Laylee&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playtonic-layoffs-yooka-laylee" rel="nofollow">Playtonic</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Oxenfree&nbsp;</em>outfit <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/oxenfree-night-school-layoffs" rel="nofollow">Night School</a>, as well as larger companies like EA subsidiary <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/respawn-layoffs-project-cancellations" rel="nofollow">Respawn</a> and tech giant <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-3-percent-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">Microsoft</a>.</p>

<p>Bend Studio's game is also not the only live-service project Sony has canceled in recent months. As well as the other game shut down at the same time as Bend's, live-service shooter&nbsp;<em>Concord&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds" rel="nofollow">shut down mere days after its launch</a> last year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sony-live-service-marathon-bend-studio.jpg?itok=l0ueWu41 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sony-live-service-marathon-bend-studio.jpg?itok=Nn_XyPE2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sony's next upcoming live-service game is Bungie's&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Despite these cancellations and shutdowns, Sony is still putting many of its eggs into the live-service basket. Its next live-service project is Bungie's&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marathon-release-date-gameplay-revealed" rel="nofollow">due to launch in September</a>; as far as we know, that's still the case, despite lukewarm reception to previews and the recent revelation that an artist who previously worked on the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-marathon-art-stolen" rel="nofollow">stole artwork from an online artist</a>.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what kind of game Bend Studio is working on next, but there will be a lot of folks hoping it's a&nbsp;<em>Days Gone&nbsp;</em>sequel. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/video/685229/nintendo-switch-2-gamechat-c-button-mario-kart<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nintendo introduced a new hardware button to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/682661/nintendo-switch-2-early-hands-on-mario-kart-world">the Switch 2</a> specifically for chatting with your friends, and it’s undoubtedly my favorite feature on the console. Instead of using a smartphone app like the original Switch, Switch 2 users can open up a communications channel at any time with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/24343637/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-c-button-controller">the “C” button</a> and chat with friends, whether they’re playing the same game or something else.</p><p>That idea sounds a little outdated with the popularity of Discord, but Nintendo makes the process seamless enough that I can imagine a lot of people will end up using it. Last Friday, a few of my colleagues and I hopped into a GameChat session together and played <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/684518/mario-kart-world-review-nintendo-switch-2">Mario Kart World</a></em> online — all of us communicating through the built-in microphone on our consoles and various USB webcams, with our likeness displayed on the bottom of the screen.</p><p>The noise reduction and compression processing on the Switch 2’s mic was surprisingly impressive: my audio was clear and easy to understand without any background noise, even when sitting 5-10 feet away from the console. The Switch 2’s face detection and background removal with its camera works well, too, and it was hilariously useful when a cutout of our faces showed up over our Mario Kart characters during a race. </p><div><p><figcaption><em>Jay and Sean speeding past me in </em>Mario Kart World <em>while on GameChat. </em></figcaption></p></div><p>GameChat’s screensharing feature, on the other hand, leaves much to be desired. The frame rate for each user’s gameplay feed is very low and compressed, making it choppy and hard to follow. Nintendo seems to be limiting the video feeds for a steadier and more consistent experience, but this didn’t actually prevent dropouts. My colleague Cameron’s video feed was interrupted multiple times, and he had to rejoin the session for his camera stream or gameplay to display again. I later came across this problem myself. Nintendo also limits the amount of users who can share video to four per session; eight more can join the chat but only stream their audio.</p><p>The feature is free right now, but only for a limited time. After March 31st, 2026, Switch 2 users will need to pay for a Nintendo Switch Online membership to use GameChat. Console gamers are used to paying for online play, but having to pay to use <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/684602/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-review">a button on the controller</a> expands just how much of the console experience is locked behind a subscription. </p><p>Despite those limits, I can imagine a world where my best friend calls me on my Switch 2 to make dinner plans or to play a strategic round of Splatoon. This setup also becomes a perfect setup for a Twitch stream. The low-stakes, easy setup voice call is a delightful and useful addition to Nintendo’s updated console, and has the potential to be a central hub for a lot of new ways to play games like <em>Mario Kart</em>, <em>Animal Crossing</em>, and <em>Fortnite</em>.</p><p>Now, I just need to convince my manager to open up a GameChat for our weekly creative meeting. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

To kick things off, players <a href="https://shop.marvelsnap.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">can log into the Web Shop</a> and claim the following free items with the promo code <strong>WEBLAUNCH</strong>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IB6daEk16kI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IB6daEk16kI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><ul><li>1 x Premium Mystery Variant</li><li>1 x Premium Mystery Border</li><li>3 x high-value one-time purchase bundles</li><li>Daily Free Claim Boost: 200 Credits per day</li></ul><p>The freebies available here are pretty good, as these items normally cost quite a bit when using the in-game "Gold" currency. A Premium Mystery variant on its own costs 800 Gold, and that's a sum that typically takes around a month to earn in the game if you don't buy the monthly season pass. Also on the horizon is a weekly promotional event called Web Shop Wednesdays, and players will be able to claim a free Common Mystery Border for one of their cards. A $5 bundle will also be offered, and this includes a Common Mystery Border and 600 Gold.</p><p>Second Dinner has made several big changes to Marvel Snap since it first launched in 2022, with one of the biggest being a complete overhaul of how cards are acquired. Players can now earn Collector's Tokens that can be used to purchase cards, and regular play makes it easy enough to unlock at least one of the older cards every week. The newer cards require more grinding, but earning them is still much easier compared to the older system that was in place.</p><p>Marvel Snap's current season, Masters of the Arcane, also began earlier this month, and it focuses on several of Marvel's mystical characters like Merlin, Morgan Le Fay, and Nicholas Scratch.</p>

<p>"It should have been an OLED screen from the get-go"</p>

<figure><a title="Poll: Are You Happy With Switch 2's Screen? Because Some People Certainly Aren't 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/dc28822f1aab7/poll-are-you-happy-with-switch-2s-screen-because-some-people-certainly-arent-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>One aspect of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-guide-ultimate-resource">Nintendo Switch 2</a> that has generated a <em>lot</em> of interest is its display. While Nintendo released an OLED model of the original Switch, which massively improved over the launch model's LCD screen, for Switch 2, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/the-switch-2s-screen-isnt-oled-but-it-will-support-1080p120fps-gameplay">it has opted to return to LCD technology</a>.</p>
<p>On the whole, it's fair to say that the decision has gone down fairly well; <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/weve-seen-switch-2s-lcd-screen-in-the-flesh-and-it-really-doesnt-feel-like-a-downgrade">as we reported after our first hands-on sessions</a>, the panel used in the Switch 2 is <em>leagues</em> ahead of the one we got back in 2017, with superb brightness and bold colours.</p>
<p>However, due to the way LCD screens work, a little bit of blurriness is inevitable; OLED panels exhibit almost instant pixel response, which cuts down on blur (but, on the downside, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/psa-sensitive-to-pwm-flicker-youll-want-to-keep-the-switch-oleds-screen-nice-and-bright">generates a flicker which can actually give some people headaches</a>). In contrast, LCD screens have slower pixel response, and this can manifest itself as a blurred image when things move fast.</p>
<p>This issue has been flagged by more than one person since the console launched last week:</p>



<p>As noted by Cary Golomb, it is believed that Nintendo is utilising two different screen suppliers for Switch 2: Innolux and Sharp. According to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ninpatentswatch.bsky.social/post/3lpleplmndc2h">Nintendo Patents Watch</a>, the quality gap between these two options isn't as large as many people would have you believe, but the fact that there are two versions has predictably led to some comparing this to the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-nintendo-screen-lottery-its-a-thing-and-it-sucks.57152/">'screen lottery'</a> which occurred when both the Nintendo DS and 3DS were released.</p>
<p>You can see how the Switch 2's LCD panel compares with the Switch OLED in the video below:</p>

<p>As we've already established, there will be some blur on the Switch 2's screen when compared to an OLED panel—that's beyond debate—but is it enough to cause serious complaints?</p>
<p>I'm personally pretty happy with the Switch 2's display, but I have noticed that it's a little blurry when things are moving at high speed. It obviously depends heavily on the game you're playing; I could barely notice it on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, but it was more obvious when playing Switch 1 games with 2D artwork (the overworld map in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/unicorn_overlord">Unicorn Overlord</a> is especially bad, to my eyes).</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Dune: Awakening - 5 Things To Know</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">For context, Dune: Awakening is proving much more popular than Dune: Spice Wars, which is a strategy title. The latter topped out with 8,397 concurrent players on Valve's storefront, according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1605220/charts/" rel="nofollow ">SteamDB</a>. As such, Dune: Awakening appears to be the biggest game ever for the Dune franchise--with four other games based on the sci-fi series coming out between 1992 and 2001.</p><p dir="ltr">Looking ahead, Funcom has confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-awakening-is-coming-to-console-funcom-confirms-as-pc-game-puts-up-huge-numbers/1100-6532326/">Dune: Awakening will arrive on home consoles in 2026</a>. That said, the studio hasn't stated exactly which systems will get the game, though PS5 and Xbox Series X|S would make the most sense. As for Switch 2, that seems more up in the air.</p><p dir="ltr">For more, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-awakening-multiplayer-guide-how-to-party-up-with-friends/1100-6532181/">Dune: Awakening guide for partying up with friends</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-fastest-selling-nintendo-console<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has revealed that the Switch 2 has become the gaming giant's fastest-selling console worldwide, having reached a major milestone in just four days.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1932620051955270127" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Nintendo says the Switch 2 sold 3.5 million copies within the first four days of its release, thus making it the "fastest-selling Nintendo hardware ever" around the world.</p>

<p>The console has also set records for Nintendo in specific regions of the globe; earlier this week, it was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-the-fastest-selling-nintendo-console-in-uk-history-but-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs-launches-were-bigger" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> that the Switch 2 is Nintendo's fastest-selling machine in the UK, although it hasn't pipped the PS5 or the Xbox Series X|S to the post as the country's fastest-selling games console ever.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-fastest-selling-multiple-consoles.jpg?itok=WxQygTUk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-fastest-selling-multiple-consoles.jpg?itok=9C0bqQLP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Nintendo Switch 2 has become the fastest-selling Nintendo console around the world.</figcaption></figure><p>If you've somehow missed out on the Switch 2's launch, it's Nintendo's newest console. Released <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">on June 5th</a>, the console packs more powerful internals than its predecessor, as well as a larger screen, magnetic Joy-Cons, and various other improvements.</p>

<p>The Switch 2 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">launched with&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">Mario Kart World</a>&nbsp;</em>as its main draw, but it also has a number of last-gen and current-gen ports under its belt, and a number of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-upgrades-switch-1" rel="nofollow">original Switch games</a> have received either free or paid upgrades to enhance their performance on the new console.</p>

<p>It's not clear whether the console will go on to fulfil Nintendo's expectations. The company said last month that it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-15m-switch-2-first-year" rel="nofollow">expects to sell 15 million</a> Switch 2 units in its first year, and a Bloomberg report earlier this year suggested that Nintendo is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-20m-shipments-report" rel="nofollow">preparing to manufacture 20 million units</a> for sale in the same time period.</p>

<p>This is a strong start for the Switch 2, though, and even if it hasn't beaten the PS5 or the Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo will be happy that the new machine appears to have outsold the original Switch, at least in terms of the first four days.</p>




<p>You can grab a Switch 2 right now from any number of retailers (assuming the console is in stock at the time you're reading this, of course).</p>

Every expansion in <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket </em>has changed how the game plays so much that very few cards from the base Genetic Apex set see use today. Still, some cards have held their ground despite the power creep, and you’ll undoubtedly sow fear into the eyes of your foes by bringing them into battle. Here are five monsters that are well worth bringing into your deck.</p><h2 id="h281"><a id="1"></a>Rampardos</h2><p><strong>Set</strong>: Space-Time Smackdown: Dialga</p><p><strong>Pros</strong>: Rampardos is so strong that you could be tricked into thinking it’s an ex card. Its damage potential is on par with Giratina, and you only need a <em>single energy </em>for it to attack. Additionally, it packs respectable survivability at 150 HP. 50 damage recoil <em>does </em>admittedly sting, but since this only triggers on a KO, Rampardos can still headbutt way above its weight class against bulky opponents.</p><figure id="" data-id="057011734ce005ecb3c9afe126af97e0" data-recommend-id="image://057011734ce005ecb3c9afe126af97e0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1122" data-height="1548" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the Rampardos card from Pokémon TCG Pocket." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the Rampardos card from Pokémon TCG Pocket." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Timothy Monbleau / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="057011734ce005ecb3c9afe126af97e0" data-recommend-id="image://057011734ce005ecb3c9afe126af97e0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1122" data-height="1548" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the Rampardos card from Pokémon TCG Pocket." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This monster was already good when it debuted in the Space-Time Smackdown expansion, and the introduction of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3/144&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3/144" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rare Candy</a></span> has only made it better. Nearly every Fighting-type deck is built around this monster as of writing, and it’s easy to see why.</p><p><strong>Cons</strong>: Cards that evolve from fossils are always risky, and Rampardos is no exception. You can’t use a Pokéball to get a fossil in your hand, and it’s vulnerable to a quick KO via <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A1/225&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A1/225" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sabrina</a></span> if you have nothing else on your bench.

Given the overwhelming prevalence of Supporter cards in the average <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket </em>deck, boosting that 50 damage to 100 damage is remarkably easy. And since it only needs two colorless energy to attack, it can slot into any deck that needs a secondary attacker. Want to pair the overwhelming power of Rampardos with Sivally? You can, and many players do!</p><figure id="" data-id="4c30a9c5f790c876abe32fe02ad227aa" data-recommend-id="image://4c30a9c5f790c876abe32fe02ad227aa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1122" data-height="1548" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the Silvally card from Pokémon TCG Pocket." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the Silvally card from Pokémon TCG Pocket." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Timothy Monbleau / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4c30a9c5f790c876abe32fe02ad227aa" data-recommend-id="image://4c30a9c5f790c876abe32fe02ad227aa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1122" data-height="1548" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the Silvally card from Pokémon TCG Pocket." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>On top of all these perks, Silvally is only a Stage-1 evolution too.

These two monsters are far from invincible together, especially if your opponent gets their strongest attackers on the front lines early on. But just putting Oricorio on the field will force your opponent to change their playstyle, which can net you wins if they don’t have an established gameplan for dealing with the bird.</p><p><strong>Cons</strong>: Magnezone is the rare Stage-2 monster that does <em>not </em>want to use Rare Candy, so it’s slower to get up and running than other meta-dominant evolutions. Spending an extra turn to evolve might not seem like a big deal, but <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket </em>is so fast-paced now that you want to build momentum in your favor as soon as you can. Further, just placing Magneton on the field may compel your opponent to use cards that make you shuffle your deck, potentially tossing Magnezone out of your hand right as you were counting on playing it.</p><hr><h2 id="h284"><a id="4"></a>Meowscarada</h2><p><strong>Set</strong>: Shining Revelry</p><p><strong>Pros: </strong>One of the best ex-counters in the game so far.

This is fine for picking off basic Pokémon before they can evolve into Stage-2 forms, and two-shotting Pokémon like Oricorio isn’t bad. However, this still leaves room for your opponent to chip away at Meowscarada before finally bringing in an ex Pokémon to blast it away.</p><p>Mewoscarada typically pairs with other grass-type attackers like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3/12&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3/12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Decidueye ex</a></span> who can cover the cat’s weaknesses and greatly benefit from its strengths.

It launched alongside that console in 2020, in direct competition with the PlayStation 5, and this November turns five years old.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If the Switch 2 is similar in power to the Xbox Series S, that suggests it will run most third-party games. Microsoft mandates that any game that launches on the Xbox Series X also launches on the S, so any developer working on a game for the current-gen Xbox must ensure the S is capable of running it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s also worth noting that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-says-its-working-with-nintendo-to-get-call-of-duty-on-switch-but-will-black-ops-7-be-on-switch-2">Microsoft and Activision are still working on bringing Call of Duty to Switch</a>.

Sorry — Barone didn't elaborate. "The world of Haunted Chocolatier is larger than Stardew Valley" is the full extent of his <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1932705089283895458" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">message</a>.

I MEAN- IDK IM SO EXCITED BUT I DONT WANT U TO RUSH TAKE UR SWEET ASS TIME WE LOVE U."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, Barone admitted that he "didn't want to just be the Stardew Valley guy," explaining that was why he's currently working on Haunted Chocolatier. We shouldn't expect a release date anytime soon, though — there's "still a lot to be done," Barone recently admitted, particularly as he feels it's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-creator-says-he-might-eventually-make-a-stardew-valley-2-but-its-so-much-easier-to-add-more-stuff-to-stardew-valley-than-make-a-new-game-from-scratch"><u>"got to be better" than Stardew Valley</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, he also suggested that he may <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-creator-says-he-might-eventually-make-a-stardew-valley-2-but-its-so-much-easier-to-add-more-stuff-to-stardew-valley-than-make-a-new-game-from-scratch"><u>"eventually make a Stardew Valley 2."</u></a> Before you get too excited, however, the developer also said it's "so much easier to just add more stuff to Stardew Valley than to make a whole new game from scratch."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's all the systems — all the major systems — are already all done. That’s the stuff that’s not fun to do. When I make an update [for Stardew Valley now], it’s like, you know, oh, throw in this, throw in that.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-launch-helps-street-fighter-6-hit-5-million-sales-2-years-after-launch<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a> has now sold over 5 million copies, Capcom has announced. That’s up from the 4 million reported in September 2024. The latest sales milestone was helped by the fighting game’s launch on Nintendo Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom said it aimed to “maximize the game’s userbase” by bringing Street Fighter 6, now two years old, to the Switch 2 at launch. The Switch 2 version has exclusive modes designed for the console, and new gameplay features that utilize the gyro functionality of the Joy-Con 2. It’s worth noting the Switch 2 version has crossplay, maximising the pool of players available for matchmaking.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“These initiatives have contributed to Street Fighter 6’s wide appeal, expanded global sales and resulted in the title achieving the milestone of 5 million units sold,” Capcom said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/street-fighter-6-punches-through-3-million-copies-sold"><u>Street Fighter 6 hit 3 million copies sold back in January</u></a> 2024, seven months after launch. Capcom has said Street Fighter 6 is “generally progressing in line with our expectations,” but before launch it revealed it had aimed for the sequel to outsell Street Fighter 5, targeting over 10 million copies sold over the course of its lifetime.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“While we do not communicate specific figures for internal budgets, we look to outperform the title’s predecessor, Street Fighter 5, and are aiming for more than 10 million units over the life of the title,” Capcom said. Street Fighter 6, then, still has a long way to go before it beats Street Fighter 5’s sales total.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To put Street Fighter 6’s sales into context, 1993 SNES hit Street Fighter 2 Turbo sold 4.1 million copies, the seminal Street Fighter 2 sold 6.30 million, and Street Fighter 5 has sold 7.8 million.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another interesting comparison is with fighting game rival <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mortal-kombat-1"><u>Mortal Kombat 1</u></a>, which has also sold 5 million copies since going on sale in September 2023. Mortal Kombat is typically the best-selling fighting game franchise, outselling the likes of Street Fighter and Tekken by some margin. But Mortal Kombat 1 is seen as a sales disappointment, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/confirmed-mortal-kombat-1-wont-get-any-more-dlc-characters-or-story-chapters-as-netherrealm-needs-to-shift-focus-to-the-next-project">developer NetherRealm recently confirmed it had left it behind to work on its next project</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom, meanhwile, continues to support Street Fighter 6 into its third year, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-confirms-year-3-roster-for-street-fighter-6">recently announced a set of four brand new DLC characters</a>: Sagat is out this summer; C. Viper this fall; Alex early spring 2026; and finally, Ingrid late spring 2026. The announcement was made in a trailer starring pro wrestler Kenny Omega, who dressed up as each DLC character.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/street-fighter-6-review">Street Fighter 6 review</a> returned a 9/10. We said: "Street Fighter 6 is the most feature-rich a Street Fighter has ever been at launch, but even beyond that, it's roster of 18 characters is excellent, the new mechanics revitalize the one-on-one fighting formula, and it absolutely nails all of the little things that make for a stellar fighting game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

                <p>MindsEye, the new game from former Rockstar Games boss Leslie Benzies and his new team at Build a Rocket Boy, launched this week, but the release didn't exactly go to plan. The game encountered numerous bugs and other issues, and now the developer has responded.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MindsEyeGame/comments/1l8acbd/update_on_performance/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement on Reddit</a>, Build a Rocket Boy thanked fans for playing the game and submitting their feedback, while acknowledging performance issues on PC and console.</p><p>"We understand that the current minimum spec requirements are very high, but our engineering team are working around the clock to improve performance on mainstream hardware as well as consoles by integrating the performance improvements in Unreal Engine V5.6," the developer said. "We will provide patch 3 update timing, including these improvements, within the next 24 hours."</p><p>This statement was posted on June 10, so more information about the new patch is expected today, June 11. You can see some of the issues players have encountered so far in the videos below.</p><p>Hitman developer IO Interactive published MindsEye, and the company's top executive <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hitman-boss-says-he-doesnt-believe-people-are-being-paid-to-post-negative-comments-about-mindseye" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">does not believe the claims that people were being paid to trash the game prior to launch.</a> Prior to the launch of MindsEye, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-like-mindseyes-developer-loses-top-executives-ahead-of-launch/1100-6532123/" data-ref-id="1100-6532123">multiple senior executive quit Build a Rocket Boy. </a></p><p>In addition to MindsEye itself, the game includes a free user-generated mode on PC called Build.Mindseye that allows players to create whatever they want.</p><p>MindsEye has <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3265250/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">peaked at around 3,300 concurrent players on Steam</a>, and it's <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1091500/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">not inside the top 100 most-played games on Steam.</a></p><p>Benzies was formerly the president of Rockstar North, and he worked on numerous games there, including the top-selling Grand Theft Auto V. He went on sabbatical after GTA V came out and claimed that when he tried to come back, he was locked out. Benzies sued Take-Two for $150 million in unpaid royalties, and the matter was ultimately resolved with a confidential settlement.</p>

<figure><a title="Joy-Con 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/64b5e14804dbd/joy-con-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>A few days back, the online repair community iFixit <a href="https://x.com/iFixit/status/1930781813770727437">posted a brief teardown</a> of the new Switch 2 Joy-Con and confirmed that the sticks are nearly identical to the Switch 1 in terms of how they've been built.</p>
<p>Naturally, then, this has caused a bit of kerfuffle with fans; many of which are understandably concerned that Joy-Con drift will continue to be a major issue for the Switch 2.</p>
<p>So much so, in fact, that GuliKit – a company that specialises in the production of hall effect and TMR joysticks – has confirmed it is hard at work on producing replacement sticks for the Switch 2.</p>

<p>Stick drift had plagued the original Switch during its (ongoing) lifespan, with Nintendo facing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/05/switch-joy-con-drift-class-action-lawsuit-dismissed-after-five-years">numerous lawsuits over the issue</a>. Here at Nintendo Life, we've had staff members burn through several Joy-Con controllers thanks to drifting, so it's definitely a pretty widespread issue.</p>
<p>With the Switch 2 still in its infancy, it's hard to know at this stage whether Joy-Con drift will continue to be a major problem, but it's one we'll be keeping a close eye on in the coming months and years.</p>

            <p>Mindseye, the game from ex-Rockstar president Leslie Benzies-helmed studio Build a Rocket Boy, has arrived. Its launch has gone, er, a bit glitchily, currently landing the game at a mixed reception on Steam. That said, the studio have at least confirmed an update designed to improve Mindseye's performance is on the way.
</p>
<p>If you're out of the loop, the sort of GTA-ish/Cyberpunk-ish game's road to release had been plenty weird prior to it breaking cover. Build a Rocket Boy co-CEO Mark Gerhard had seemingly <a href="https://www.vg247.com/mindseye-co-ceo-claims-concerted-effort-against-it">suggested on the game's Discord server</a> that he believed people were being paid to say negative things about Mindseye, and two other high-profile execs had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-week-before-launch-two-mindseye-studio-executives-have-left-the-company-which-im-sure-is-a-positive-sign">departed the studio</a> not long before release.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>It's now debuted to mixed Steam reviews and plenty of clips on the socials of players <a href="https://x.com/ItsJesseGomez/status/1932524274700480613">running into glitches</a> or citing issues. The one that's caught my eye in particular is <a href="https://x.com/SlashLP89/status/1932517088280957096">multiple</a> <a href="https://x.com/viktorlindn/status/1932508112407445708">folks</a> failing a mission because they've nudged an NPC named Seb with their ATV and he's responded by bursting into a spaghettified mess of elongated limbs.</p>
<p>To be fair, being hit by a vehicle moving at speed is generally known to make your body contort in painful-looking ways that it isn't supposed to, but I've yet to see any real life car accidents result into someone's neck, arms and legs all instantly growing the giraffe length as they roll across the ground.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3265250/MindsEye/#app_reviews_hash">Steam reviews</a> also mention issues getting the game to run at a decent clip, with some citing the likes of stuttering, FPS drops, textures flickering, and also enemy corpses which "twitch like ragdoll puppets".</p>
<p>In response to the day one performance issues, Build a Rocket Boy have said they've got a third patch for the game in the works, with a community manager writing the following in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MindsEyeGame/comments/1l8acbd/update_on_performance/">a post</a> on the game's subreddit:</p>
<blockquote><p>We understand that the current minimum spec requirements are very high, but our engineering team are working around the clock to improve performance on mainstream hardware as well as consoles by integrating the performance improvements in Unreal Engine V5.6. We will provide patch 3 update timing, including these improvements, within the next 24 hours.</p></blockquote>
<p>They also asked for feedback on the game's main campaign, and its map editory "Build.Mindseye" mode. I'll give them a 10/10 solely in the NPC spaghettification department.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And to be abundantly clear, <strong>ex Pokémon are still prevalent in the game’s strongest decks</strong>. The difference now is how you incorporate them into your deck, as many launch-day strategies are virtually obsolete now. Let’s break it down.</p><h2 id="h80427"><a id="1"></a>The ex-killer cards are on the loose</h2><p>In the current meta, ex Pokémon have to contend with several cards that exist <em>specifically </em>to defeat them. In past expansions, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A2a/36&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A2a/36" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sudowoodo</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A2b/71&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A2b/71" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Red</a></span> were common staples in competitive decks. They’ve gone down in usage as of writing, but they’re still threats you need to watch out for.

The safeguard ability nullifies damage from ex Pokémon, which can potentially trap you into an unwinnable state if you aren’t careful. It’s not <em>invincible </em>against ex Pokémon, as Oricorio can still take indirect damage. For example, Darkrai can still inflict chip damage via Nightmare Aura, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3/33&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3/33" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Incineroar ex</a></span> can damage Oricorio by using Fire Fang to inflict burn. Still, <strong>considering ex Pokemon can inflict up to 200 damage in a single turn, cutting their maximum potential damage down to 20 is a serious nerf</strong>. Even if Oricorio isn’t <em>meta </em>at any point, its sheer presence in the game means you have to plan a counter for it in the event it shows up.</p><p>Combine all the above factors with the fact that ex Pokémon award two points upon defeat, and you get an environment where these monsters are way riskier to use than before. Decks consisting solely of ex Pokemon can still work, but they now need to be built with the above threats in mind to avoid completely unwinnable matchups.</p><h2 id="h80428"><a id="2"></a>How to incorporate ex Pokémon into your deck</h2><p>In previous expansions, the most prevalent non-ex Pokémon played supporting roles. For example, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A2/22&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A2/22" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shaymin</a></span> would stay on the bench to heal, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A1a/56&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A1a/56" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Druddigon</a></span> would take the lead on the front line while you stacked Energy on your heavy hitter. Now, it’s much wiser to pair a strong ex-Pokémon with a capable non-ex attacker. For example, players using <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3/122&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3/122" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Solgaleo ex</a></span> will typically bring <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A2/111&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A2/111" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Skarmory</a></span> or <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3a/27&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3a/27" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shiinotic</a></span> to inflict damage in the early game and take out any ex killers that could stop them later. You will find yourself praying for a good starting hand that doesn’t force you to deploy your late-game cards off the bat, but that’s practically unavoidable no matter which deck you run.</p><p>Alternatively, you can run a pure ex-deck as long as you have contingency plans in mind against your toughest matchups. For example, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-darkrai-ex-cyrus-guide-1851766515&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-darkrai-ex-cyrus-guide-1851766515">Darkrai ex</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A2b/35&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A2b/35" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Giratina ex</a></span> are still very strong together despite the shifting meta. Darkrai’s Nightmare Aura ability paired with tools like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3/146&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3/146" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Poison Barb</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A2/148&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A2/148" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rocky Helmet</a></span> can counter Oricorio, and Giratina’s huge burst damage potential can bring down Meowscarada. It’s not a consistently successful strategy, but no deck ever is. You just need a strategy that works at least as often as it doesn’t.</p><h2 id="h80429"><a id="3"></a>In the end, you need luck and skill to win</h2><p>While ex Pokémon have huge obstacles they need to watch out for, many previously reliable Pokémon are also struggling because of how aggressive the game has become. Rare Candy is a huge culprit here: a player can now get a powerful Stage 2 monster on the field as early as turn three or four and begin a sweep that only a perfect hand can counter. Meanwhile, you could face the same deck and get the easiest win of your life just because your opponent’s candies are at the bottom of their deck. Cards like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/P-A/6&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/P-A/6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Red Card</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A2/155&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A2/155" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mars</a></span> have spiked in popularity strictly to keep strong monsters off the field as much as possible.</p><p>The competitive landscape of <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> has seen huge changes with every expansion introduced so far, so all the strategies listed here could become obsolete in a month’s time. However, given the escalation of cards that specifically target ex Pokémon, it’s unlikely we’ll see these otherwise powerful cards become less risky to use in the future. Just <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-free-player-spend-money-1851723336&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-free-player-spend-money-1851723336">do your best with the cards in your collection</a></span>, make sure you <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-grind-thanks-battle-trick-1851769030&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-grind-thanks-battle-trick-1851769030">say thanks even if you lose</a></span>, and if all else fails, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-destined-rivals-price-value-team-rocket-1851779160&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-destined-rivals-price-value-team-rocket-1851779160">maybe you can play the regular tabletop game instead</a></span>.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>In less than a week, the new Switch 2 console has become the "fastest-selling" hardware globally for Nintendo, as the company reported 3.5 million units were sold in just four days.</p><p>"Fans around the world are showing their enthusiasm for Nintendo Switch 2 as an upgraded way to play at home and on the go,” Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser said in a press statement following the announcement of the sales milestone. "We are thankful for their response and happy to see the fun they are already having with Nintendo Switch 2 as they explore new features and games that bring friends and family together in new ways."</p><p>This makes for one of the biggest console launches in history, thanks in part to Nintendo ensuring that it had enough stock available to meet the high demand for the device. In fact, according to industry analyst <a href="https://x.com/zhugeex/status/1932624211878818015?s=46" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Daniel Ahmad</a>, the number would make the Switch 2 launch <em>the </em>biggest in home-console history. </p><p>In comparison, the Switch reached 2.74 million units sold in its first month and Sony reported that it had shipped--not sold--3.4 million PS5 consoles during the first month that it was available to purchase. It is worth noting that stock shortages were a major problem for Sony at the time. due to various issues like the global semiconductor shortage.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-reveals-how-many-switch-2-consoles-it-expects-to-sell-during-its-first-year/1100-6531389/">Nintendo is predicting that it will sell 15 million Switch 2 consoles</a> during its current business year--ending in March 2026--and it has been reported that this figure might increase to 20 million as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-reportedly-using-samsung-chips-as-nintendo-tries-to-meet-demand/1100-6531666/">Samsung is rumored to be manufacturing chips for the device</a>. Overall, it looks like the Switch 2 is off to a strong start, and it'll be interesting to see if it reaches--or surpasses--the current lifetime sales total of the Switch, which stand at 152 million units sold as of February 2025.</p>

                <p>In just under two months since its release, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-light-and-shadow/1900-6418358/" data-ref-id="1900-6418358">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> has emerged as one of the most unexpected hits of 2025, with <a href="https://x.com/expedition33/status/1927364988219383892" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">more than 3.3 million copies</a> sold since late April. Now, developer Sandfall Interactive has shared a new patch for the game that gives players another chance to fight Simon, one of the most difficult bosses in the game.</p><p>Simon is an optional boss who can be found in The Abyss, and he has very few weaknesses.

Assuming they can beat him, of course. It's not an easy fight by any stretch, and this undead warrior is a challenge even for veteran players.</p><p>Sandfall notes that the current patch addresses nearly 300 bugs that were found in the game, although it only lists a handful in the notes. According to the devs, a "general polish" was added across collisions, terrain, and scripting. The cutscenes should also scale properly across non-standard resolutions after this patch.</p><p>There aren't any new features in the current update, but the developers have acknowledged multiple <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-devs-address-potential-photo-mode-and-more/1100-6531932/" data-ref-id="1100-6531932">requests for a photo mode</a>, even from other members of the team.

Nintendo now reports that it was even more popular than bad been expected, selling 3.5 million consoles in the first four days. For context, the original Switch took a month to sell 2.75 million units.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197567" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Price Is Set at $450 for Now, But Could Go Higher" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="104" data-playlist="197567,197565,195670" data-current="197567"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Price Is Set at $450 for Now, But Could Go Higher</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197567/197567_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197567/197567_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197567/197567_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23091.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>While numbers of consoles sold is a tricky statistic to accurately track—muddled by the confusion of analyst predictions and companies only putting out positive numbers—we do occasionally get useful glimpses. For instance, we know that the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-shipped-45-million-units-in-2020-matches-ps4s-launch&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-shipped-45-million-units-in-2020-matches-ps4s-launch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PS5 sold 4.5 million units</a></span> in total by the end of 2020, which works out to across about seven weeks, and rather importantly included the holidays. (Despite being a launch beset by nightmares, from covid to supply chain disasters, it still pretty much matched sales for the PS4 in 2013.) Even more usefully, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ps5-is-biggest-console-launch-in-history&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ps5-is-biggest-console-launch-in-history" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we also know that the PS5 had outsold the PS4's 2.1 million units in its first two weeks</a></span>, although without a specific number. That was described at the time as the “biggest console launch in history,” and given the Switch 2 massively beat that figure in less than a week, it’s safe to say the mantle has been passed on.</p><p>Nintendo stops short of the full boast, but observes this makes the Switch 2 it’s own fastest-selling device. The original Switch was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/2017/4/27/15449380/nintendo-switch-worldwide-sales-march&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/4/27/15449380/nintendo-switch-worldwide-sales-march" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported by Nintendo</a></span> as having sold 2.74 million units in its first month, which it then described as it’s fastest seller, meaning the Switch 2 has absolutely walloped it so far.  (It’s fun to note that the Wii U sold a total of 3.5 million units over its first six months.)</p><p>Of course, initial sales are not a guaranteed predictor of long-term forecasts, but they do tend to bode well. Nintendo has rather modestly set its predicted sales for the year at 15 million, presumably trying to keep investors within reasonable expectations against <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-trump-tariffs-vietnam-china-trade-war-1851774438&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-trump-tariffs-vietnam-china-trade-war-1851774438">a bemusing market</a></span> that could be flipped upside-down at any point with the latest of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.404media.co/sea-of-idiocy-economists-say-trump-tariffs-will-raise-price-of-switch-2-and-everything-else/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.404media.co/sea-of-idiocy-economists-say-trump-tariffs-will-raise-price-of-switch-2-and-everything-else/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trump’s mercurial tariff idiocy</a></span>.</p><p>Either way, it’s good times for Nintendo, and a good sign for a gaming industry that is having the shit beaten out of it of late. While the prices <em>aren’t</em> the same around the world, at the U.S.’s $450, that would mean sales of over $1.5 billion in less than a week. Now if only there was a new <em>Super Mario</em> game to play on it.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The changes detailed include "another set of changes to further improve the game server and client stability," and "more localization." The patch also fixes a handful of minor, but annoying, bugs.</p>

And what that does is it allows us to continue to invest in Xbox for our community of players and creators and that we're doing. It does mean we have to make tradeoffs through the year on things that we're going to invest more in. [And] things that we're not going to invest as much in, because we are the business that we are. But the business is having really good success."</p><p>Spencer touted Game Pass as "having an amazing year" and praised Xbox's first-party games for their performance in 2025. It's worth noting that Spencer has used similar language about running "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-defends-xbox-studio-closures-layoffs-i-have-to-run-a-sustainable-business/1100-6524121/" data-ref-id="1100-6524121">a sustainable business</a>" to explain the closures of studios like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-is-shutting-down-four-studios-including-arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks/1100-6523227/" data-ref-id="1100-6523227">Arkane Austin and Tango Gameworks.</a> The latter was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tango-gameworks-saved-by-pubg-publisher-krafton-hi-fi-rush-rights-also-acquired/1100-6525702/" data-ref-id="1100-6525702">successfully revived by its new owner</a>, Krafton, but other studios weren't as lucky and numerous devs lost their jobs.</p><p>Additionally, Spencer has explained repeatedly that the decision to bring <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review-im-making-this-up-as-i-go/1900-6418322/" data-ref-id="1900-6418322">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> and other former Xbox-exclusive titles to PlayStation was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-discusses-bringing-indiana-jones-to-ps5-we-run-a-business/1100-6526011/" data-ref-id="1100-6526011">a business call</a>. That proved to be a fortuitous choice for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-review/1900-6418359/" data-ref-id="1900-6418359">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/forza-horizon-5-on-ps5-releases-in-april/1100-6529770/" data-ref-id="1100-6529770">Forza Horizon 5</a>, both of which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/microsoft-titles-top-the-charts-for-best-selling-games-on-psn-in-april-2025/2900-6532/" data-ref-id="2900-6532">topped PSN charts in April</a>.</p><p>During his podcast appearance, Spencer said that watching <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/keeper-is-the-new-double-fine-adventure-and-it-looks-wild/1100-6532262/" data-ref-id="1100-6532262">Keeper</a> come together for the Xbox Games Showcase "reignited my Double Fine love." That inspired him to revisit the studio's previous games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-cave-review/1900-6402687/" data-ref-id="1900-6402687">The Cave</a> and Iron Brigade, before reiterating his excitement for players to get their hands on it later this year.</p>

                <p>Gamers may have noticed a recent email about instructions for getting their share of a legal settlement with GameStop. While people are right to be suspicious about emails promising money, this settlement is legitimate. And if you've purchased something online from GameStop in the last five years, then the company may owe you some money.</p><p>Following <a href="https://www.gamestopvppasettlement.com/Content/Documents/Settlement%20Agreement.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a class-action settlement</a> filed earlier this year, GameStop <a href="https://www.gamestopvppasettlement.com/Content/Documents/Notice.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">has put forth $4.5 million</a> to resolve the issue of whether the company improperly disclosed customers' personal information to Facebook via the Facebook Tracking Pixel (now Meta Pixel) without their permission.</p><h3>Who can file a claim for their share of the settlement?</h3><p>There are two primary criteria for getting a share this settlement. Recipients are only eligible if they purchased a video game from GameStop's site between August 18, 2020 and April 17, 2025. Players also need to have maintained a public Facebook profile with their real names at the time the purchase was made.</p><h3>What's the settlement amount per person?</h3><p>GameStop customers who qualify for the settlement can choose between a cash payment of up to $5 in cash or up to $10 as a voucher that can be used on GameStop's site. Players who opt for the former can receive payments through Paypal, Venmo, and Zelle. Those who opt for the voucher will receive the credit through their GameStop account. The voucher will expire one year after it is received.</p><h3>How can a claim be filed?</h3><p>There are two options to file a claim. Customers can either <a href="https://www.gamestopvppasettlement.com/Home/SubmitClaim" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">fill out this online form</a> or print out <a href="https://www.gamestopvppasettlement.com/Content/Documents/Claim%20Form.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">this PDF form</a>, complete the requested information, and mail it to the following address:</p><p>GameStop VPPA Settlement Administrator</p><p>P.O. Box 4129</p><p>Portland, OR 97208-4129</p><h3>What's the deadline to file a claim?</h3><p>The deadline to file a claim or to object to the class settlement is August 15, 2025. The date of the final approval hearing is September 18, 2025. All payments and vouchers are expected to be distributed 55 days after the final approval of the deal and the conclusion of any appeals.</p>

			<p>I’ve been a huge fan of Keita Takahashi’s work for years. As a kid,&nbsp;Katamari Damacy&nbsp;was a weird and wacky sandbox that was so much fun to pick up and play. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/12/17/katamari-damacy-reroll-review/">Returning to it years later</a> helped me appreciate not only the touching story of togetherness that the game culminates in, but the effort that was put into making the simple act of play so perfectly satisfying.The blending of lofty themes with intertwined gameplay didn’t just elevate the themes, but is still fun as heck to play in it’s own way. I had high hopes that To a T would take this further. The game does have a poignant and heartwarming message behind it, but the lack of any kind of satisfying or consistent gameplay to go along with it makes this more of a mixed bag than gaming bliss.</p>
<p><iframe title="TO A T | Coming to PC, PS5 &amp; Xbox Series X|S May 28" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E-QlrrC4vFk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In To a T, you play as a young child who’s inexplicably stuck in a permanent T-pose. It isn’t clear why, but you’re used to it – it’s a part of your everyday life at this point. Despite some low moments like dealing with bullies who make fun of your predicament, you’ve got a loving dog companion and a bunch of anthropomorphic animal townsfolk who support and cheer you on each day. Before the game has barely even gotten started, its message was already clear, yet the game wastes no time driving it home with a repeating theme song sung by the characters every chapter about how “you are the perfect shape.”</p>


<p>It’s beautiful, but it’s simple, and it also never goes much further from there through the games eight chapters. As you spend each day visiting a talking giraffe who makes you sandwiches, heading to your quaint Japanese middle school, and exploring your bustling suburban town, there’s little in the way of conflict and nothing new layered onto the initial message of the game by the time you reach that final act. I feel like a young child or someone struggling with their own self-conscious worries will connect with the game and learn a lot from it, I just wish there were more going on with the subtext, or the characters, or the story as a whole to make the destination as worthwhile as the journey.</p>


<p>My bigger issue is that you aren’t really doing anything specific or particular throughout To a T. There is no consistent or focused gameplay besides the act of running around town and, sometimes, collecting floating pink coins you can exchange for new outfits. Every story scene you trigger in the game leads to a bespoke minigame where the thesis is always “do a very normal thing, except it’s really hard because you’re T-posing!” It’s charming at first, but not forever. And since each of these scene’s are different from the last and over before you know it, there’s no evolving of gameplay concepts or increasing difficulty. These minigames never reach the rage-bait level of Getting Over It with Bennet Foddy, but they also never reach the endless trance mode of Katamari Damacy.</p>
<p>I wanted to love To a T a lot more than I do, but between the basic story and the unfocused gameplay, by the time my four hours with the game were over, I just felt like, “Huh, okay then.” It isn’t a bad game by any means, and I think a certain audience will absolutely connect with it in a really impactful way, but after so many years, it just isn’t what I was hoping for as the next game from Keita Takahashi.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		To a T is a cute game about acceptance and community, but it doesn't do enough to keep it's concept fresh or engaging for the duration of the game, and there's a major lack of enjoyable gameplay to pair with it.	</p></div>
