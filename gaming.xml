			<p>Cloudheim is a brand-new multiplayer action RPG from the independent studio Noodle Cat Games. This game comes from a studio comprised of veteran developers from Epic Games, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-lays-off-5-of-its-employees-cancels-star-wars-respawn-fps-and-seeks-to-move-away-from-licensed-ips/">EA</a>, Codemasters, Disney, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-director-leaving/">Bioware</a>. To celebrate the reveal of Cloudheim, the developers have released a gameplay trailer that you can see down below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cloudheim - Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bHnpo84ybmM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This debut title will be set to launch in Q3 2025 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. You'll be in for a fun and chaotic time, as there is physics-based combat, as well as plenty of exploration, looting, and base creation in a Norse-inspired world.</p>
<p>"Cloudheim blends the exceptional talent of a veteran team with an experimental, iterative development process informed by science and modern psychology. Every member of the team has a meaningful creative impact, allowing us to push exceptional gameplay quality for our team size, budget, and development time. I'm proud of what we've built, and how the team has proven this process is ultimately better for the ones who matter most - our players," said David Hunt, CEO and Founder of Noodle Cat games.</p>
<p>Cloudheim is set to stand out from the crowd, with a ton of chaos to unleash on the world, as it's a fully breakable world where players can chain together their abilities with other teammates to defeat enemies. Whether this means pulling down pillars to crush enemies, lassoing enemies into tornadoes, or shooting monsters out of cannons, there's plenty of chaos to be had around every corner.</p>
<p>You are given the option to play solo, or you can join forces with up to three of your friends in online co-op, where you will share every weapon and ability unlocked and can work together to explore, uncover secrets, and discover new playable characters as a team.</p>
<p>"Our core gameplay began with a simple question - what if we take the juggling from fighting games and make it the combat foundation in a co-op action RPG?" said David Hunt. "Mix in a hauntingly beautiful world, a chaotic symphony of physics combos, and base customization - that's Cloudheim."</p>
<p>While you will be defeating monstrous foes and goblins, there will also be opportunities to team up with creatures such as a Swordcupine, Blins, and a Gnasher to help you through tough conquests when you need them.</p>
<p>As stated above, this title is set to release later this year. If you want to be kept up to date on this title, the Cloudheim <a href="https://cloudheimgame.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website</a> will provide all the info you could need on this upcoming ARPG.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/chernobylite-2-exclusion-zone-to-launch-on-steam-early-access-on-march-6/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Polish developer The Farm 51 announced the early access release date of their upcoming title, <a href="https://wccftech.com/chernobylite-2-exclusion-zone-open-world-sequel-announced-for-2025-pc-requirements-already-available/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone</a>. The game, which is currently <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/thefarm51/chernobylite-2-exclusion-zone-an-open-world-sci-fi-rpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Kickstarter to gather funds</a>, will be available on Steam starting on March 6. They also shared a CGI story trailer where we can first glimpse the game's narrative.</p>
<p>Cole Grey, a former military and security guard, lives in a reality where the economy and industry are entirely based on a substance called Chernobylite. With its help, humans have made a real leap forward in civilization. However, the construction of this utopia has been paid for by massive unemployment, pushing people like Cole to the margins of society.</p>
<p>Faced with severe financial problems, he joins the mysterious 'Planewalker' initiative to provide for his family. It soon becomes apparent that there is a shortage of Chernobylite in Cole's universe, and the solution is the morally questionable initiative, which involves traveling to parallel worlds in search of the mineral and obtaining it by any means necessary.</p>
<p>The Planewalker service also requires genetic modifications. Cole must, therefore, physically absorb the essence of the Chernobylite and lose part of his humanity to enhance his physical and intellectual abilities. Seeing no other option for himself, he agrees to the bloody and dangerous service, which results in him being trapped in the most sinister place in the world: the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone. There, he meets a Black Stalker, the Zone's dark leader and silent ruler. Cole's ultimate goal is, of course, to escape the sinister Exclusion Zone and return home.</p>
<p><iframe title="Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone Early Access Announcement CGI Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lEoeb1g88e0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Kickstarter campaign for Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone is going well so far. With a week left, the game has already surpassed the minimum funding goal while unlocking a few stretch goals, such as the optional first-person combat mode, the return of all guns from the first Chernobylite, weapon customizations, and new locations for both solo play and cooperative missions, one of the sequel's new features. The next stretch goals would unlock a customizable interface for both first-person and third-person views, and a customizable dialogue camera.</p>
<p>The system requirements are also available on the Steam page, so we've embedded them below for those interested.

For example, if you want to save your game in <em>Deliverance 2</em>, you have to either find a bed and sleep in it or brew a special potion that lets you save anywhere. Another example is that you get dirty as you explore and fight, and people react to that, which can cause problems if you’re covered in mud and stink. And while the studio behind the RPG deliberately designed the game to have all this friction and realism, many fans on PC have quickly responded: No, thanks! </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/that-was-fast-a-modder-already-added-an-unlimited-save-game-feature-to-kingdom-come-deliverance-2/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/that-was-fast-a-modder-already-added-an-unlimited-save-game-feature-to-kingdom-come-deliverance-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As spotted by <em>PC Gamer</em></a></span>, over on <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>'s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nexus Mods page</a></span>, you can see that two of the most popular mods—with over 50,000 downloads combined—<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/14&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/14" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">simply let you save wherever you want</a></span>, no potion or bed needed. </p><p>Another popular mod with nearly 12,000 installs makes your character <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/59&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/59" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stay cleaner for longer</a></span>.

<p>The Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) may be gone, but the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) isn’t done putting on events centered around the games industry. The ESA announced on Thursday the creation of the Interactive Innovation Conference, or iicon.</p>



<p>Billed as an “essential convening for changemakers across industries”, <a href="https://www.theesa.com/entertainment-software-association-unveils-iicon-game-changing-thought-leader-summit-to-harness-the-power-of-interactive-entertainment-and-shape-the-future-of-business-and-culture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the inaugural event</a> will take place in Las Vegas from April 27-30, 2026. </p>



<p>“For decades, video games have been at the forefront of technological and cultural innovation,” ESA president and CEO Stanley Pierre-Louis said. “With iicon, we are creating a space for visionaries across industries to come together, connect and reimagine what’s possible through interactive entertainment.”</p>



<p>“The Entertainment Software Association and its member companies are among the innovators and leaders shaping the future of culture, business and human connection,” ESA’s Chairman of the Board Doug Bowser said. “It’s a natural role for ESA to host and support an event that fosters an open exchange of new ideas with our peer industry leaders. Iicon is bringing together changemakers from across industries to envision how the strengths of the interactive entertainment industry can break entirely new ground.”</p>



<p>As far as what organizations will take part in the event, the ESA revealed that Amazon Games, Disney, Electronic Arts, Epic Games, Microsoft, Nintendo of America, Sony Interactive Entertainment, Square Enix, Take-Two Interactive, Ubisoft and Warner Bros. Games. will  all have a presence.</p>



<p>“Iicon will bring together some of the brightest minds from the games industry to navigate present challenges and harness the opportunities ahead,” Christoph Hartmann, vice president of Amazon Games, said.</p>



<p>Despite being run by the same organization, this event isn’t being touted as a replacement for E3, which was often filled with large presentations  and, in its later years, thousands of gamers. The ESA says that iicon is “tailored to visionaries, thought leaders and innovators across industries that intersect with interactive entertainment.”</p>



<p>More details on the event such as speakers, general access, and more will be announced at a later date. Attendance will be invite only.</p>

        <p><em>Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone</em> is a story of people who try to accomplish an impossible mission and survive in the sinister Chornobyl Zone.</p><p>Cole Grey, a former military and security guard, lives in a reality where the economy and industry are based entirely on a substance called Chernobylite. With its help, people have made a real leap in civilization. However, the construction of the utopia has been paid for by massive unemployment, pushing people like Cole to the margins of society. Due to severe financial problems, he joins the mysterious “Planewalker” initiative to provide for his family.</p><p>It quickly becomes apparent that there is a shortage of Chernobylite in Cole’s universe, and the solution is the morally questionable initiative that involves traveling to parallel worlds in search of the mineral and obtaining it by any means possible. In addition, the Planewalker service requires appropriate genetic modifications. Cole must, therefore, physically absorb the essence of chernobylite and, to increase his physical and intellectual capabilities, lose a part of his humanity. However, seeing no other options for himself, he agrees to the bloody and dangerous service, which results in him ending up trapped in the most sinister place in the world: the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone. There, he meets a Black Stalker, the Zone’s dark guide and silent ruler.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Open World Exploration</strong> – Explore the big and realistic open world of the real Chornobyl Exclusion Zone. Chernobylite has taken over the zone, transforming many of its elements, and people are trying to defend themselves against it using prototype technology.</li><li><strong>Character Development</strong> – Create and develop your hero. Attributes and skills will affect the effectiveness of combat, as well as the style of conversation. An arrogant muscle man with a big sword trying to intimidate everyone? Or a smart sniper who always finds the right arguments?

magic, Dungeons of Hinterberg casts you as Luisa, an office worker looking for an escape from reality. Imagine Tintin meets The Legend of Zelda, and you'll have a good idea of what to expect from the game. Combat and dungeon exploration form a key part of the experience, as players have to use their accumulated skills to progress through these puzzling locations.</p><p>While that's the main draw of the game during its daylight hours, nighttime allows you to walk around town, meet new people, and forge relationships that can help Luisa overcome new challenges in future runs, like dangerous monsters and a bad case of burnout. Dungeons of Hinterberg currently has a "generally favorable" <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/dungeons-of-hinterberg/">metascore of 80</a> on GameSpot's sister site Metacritic, as a number of outlets praised the game for its charming design, relatable story, and fun gameplay.</p><p>Meanwhile, another big game from Xbox Game Studios is also on its way to PS5 as part of Microsoft's multiplatform strategy. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/forza-horizon-5-is-the-next-xbox-game-to-speed-onto-playstation-5/1100-6529156/">Forza Horizon 5 races onto the Sony console in spring</a>, and this year will also see the release of the strategy games <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-longtime-microsoft-exclusive-franchise-makes-its-playstation-debut-in-march/1100-6529235/">Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition and Age of Mythology: Retold on PS5</a>.</p>

                <p>The big game is almost here, and for most of us, that means disappointment, as your team probably didn't make the cut. (Unless you're a dirty Chiefs bandwagoner). Fortunately for those of us who aren't interested in playing yet another season of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/madden-nfl-25/" data-ref-id="5000-629476">Madden NFL 25</a> to celebrate, there are other football games on the market that'll scratch that itch. And of them, Mutant Football League 2 is certainly the bloodiest, and it's coming to Xbox Series X|S's Xbox Game Preview program on February 6.</p><p dir="ltr">As part of the Super Bowl proceedings, Mutant Football League 2 is available for a discounted price of $25 on <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/mutant-football-league-2-game-preview/9p72ljj5srx0" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Game Preview</a>. It's coming to the console for the first time in Fall 2025, but this preview will give you a chance to try out the mayhem for yourself ahead of its release. As shown in the below trailer, the sequel allows you to create your own Mutant Dream Team, so you can make sure to always beat your friends, as well as the Doom Field Designer, which allows you to create the perfect home field advantage for your motley crew of misfits. Note that Mutant Football League 2 has no NFL license, so don't expect real teams or players here.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BTOLCesx7I" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1BTOLCesx7I" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">First released in early access on PC in May 2024, Mutant Football League 2 is a return to the heady arcade days of games like NFL Blitz. With plenty of blood and gore, a focus on local multiplayer, and special "dirty tricks" plays that allow you to literally injure and kill your opponents, this is your chance to get your revenge on that annoying Chiefs fan in your life. Then again, it's just a good time, particularly if you're willing to customize your own orc to look as twisted as possible. It also supports online multiplayer and features a robust dynasty mode.</p><p dir="ltr">For those of you who prefer a more realistic football experience, there's always the PC game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1106340/Legend_Bowl/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Legend Bowl</a>, which hits a level of complexity somewhere between Madden and classics like Tecmo Super Bowl. The latest Madden is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/new-xbox-game-pass-titles-revealed-for-february-2025-including-starfield-for-standard-tier/2900-6219/" data-ref-id="2900-6219">also on Game Pass</a>, so it's easier to jump in than ever before.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/i-went-into-eternal-strands-expecting-indie-dragon-age-but-i-got-indie-dragons-dogma<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hot on the heels of an unsuccessful 25-hour attempt to enjoy <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, my first couple hours with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1491410/Eternal_Strands/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Eternal Strands</em></a>, the new action-adventure game from a studio co-founded by <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-first-anniversary-you-are-all-way-too-kind-thank-you" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">noted Aftermath reader</a> and <em>Dragon Age</em> creative director Mike Laidlaw, did not inspire confidence. In both games, I encountered dialogue that was a hair too quippy, a cast of characters that felt so kind and considerate as to be inoffensive, and ample talk of dragons and veils. But then I got kicked by a giant, and everything changed.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Eternal Strands</em> starts out feeling like a modern-day BioWare game, but moment to moment, it’s really nothing like that at all. You play as Brynn, basically a wizard in a world where wizards are regarded with suspicion, and after you and your crew get stuck inside the walls of a magic mega-city that sealed itself off following a mysterious cataclysm, you realize the only way out is through. This means expeditions to various maps – a lush forest, a swamp, a gilded city that’s been partially reclaimed by nature – whose scale makes you seem like an ant in comparison.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Yellow Brick</figcaption></figure><p>There, you fight enemies and collect resources that, in a unique twist, alter the makeup and appearance of your weapons and armor on a per-item basis. Slot in some animal fur that raises cold resistance, for example, and your garment will also gain a blue hue. It’s neat! The changes aren’t just cosmetic, though. Depending on the in-game day and time, <em>Eternal Strands</em>’ maps can take on entirely new complexions, blazing hot one moment, freezing cold the next, or pocketed with concentrations of magic known as “tangles” that’ll swallow you whole if you’re not careful. Crafting sets of armor that meet the moment is key.</p><p>Even so, these hazards would be easily navigable if not for <em>Eternal Strands</em>’ centerpiece: In addition to regular-sized enemies who irritate more than they challenge, each map contains some manner of colossus who seeks, with determination that sometimes borders on comical, to absolutely wreck your shit. The first of these, basically just a really big guy, got my heartbeat up by forcing me to climb him and attack weak points while he shook and scratched like a fleabitten dog, but I never felt like I was in any real danger during our knock-(him)-down, drag-(me)-out fight.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Yellow Brick</figcaption></figure><p>It was only once I took on my second towering goliath that everything clicked. What made this one special is that, prior to our throwdown, I was just minding my own business, climbing a sky-scraping tower in the center of a swamp and picking it clean. Then I saw a particularly large silhouette out of the corner of my eye. Initially, I figured “Oh, that’s a Later Me problem,” but Later happened just a few seconds after that, when I realized that the floorboards of the level of the tower I’d climbed to were on fire. I frantically rounded a corner as a dragon narrowly missed me with a gout of angry flame. “What the fuck!” I yelled in my dark apartment, jolted out of a pre-bedtime haze. A lengthy health bar appeared at the top of my screen. “Ashpeak Drake,” it read.</p><p>While I managed to deal some meager damage with my bow and arrow, I ultimately decided to beat a hasty retreat to a portal back to camp; I’d collected quite a few resources and didn’t want to risk losing them by dying. After upgrading my gear a bit, I returned to the same map – which, keep in mind, was large, open, and multifaceted – with the intention of completing a portion of the main quest. I’d been tasked with investigating a conspicuously frozen village in the middle of the swamp, so I chugged a cold-protection potion and prepared to comply. But then, as I poked and prodded and, at one point, knocked down houses in search of information, I heard the flap of house-sized wings overhead. Fireballs soon followed. The first time, I chalked it up to coincidence. This time, it was personal.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Yellow Brick</figcaption></figure><p>What ensued was a 25-or-so-minute brawl that called to mind the best moments from <em>Dragon’s Dogma 2</em>. I got swatted around like a fly, such that there were natural points when we disengaged and I could scurry away and recover, or other enemies decided to attack me, the dragon, or both of us. I ended up kiting the dragon around the base of the tower from before, which went from looking like a relic from an older, better time to a smoking ruin. It felt vaguely poetic, given where all of this had begun.&nbsp;</p><p>Eventually, after I got tired of dodging fireballs, I charged straight at the dragon and climbed onto the back of its neck. As I hacked away at its armor-like scales in furious desperation, it stood up on its hind legs and began to immolate <em>itself</em>. Then it flew, with me on its back, to the frozen village, causing us both to take ice damage. We were both, it seemed, so sick of each other that we’d simultaneously decided mutually assured destruction was worth it.</p><figure></figure><p>I won the fight, emerging from the fray so exhilarated that I couldn’t sleep for hours. That’s pretty much the highest praise I can give a systems-driven game: Everything came together just right to create an unforgettable moment that will always be mine. This is not undercut by the fact that I later learned how to bring down the dragon with greater ease – or that, in one of the game’s cooler twists, I had to fight it again in a more specific, puzzle-like way to upgrade my magic powers. Those subsequent chapters only add to the larger narrative of that terrifying first time.</p><p>I guess the real<em> Eternal Strands</em> were the hulking, unforgettable enemies we made along the way.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/death-howl-soulslike-dark-souls-deckbuilder"><h3>Death Howl Nails The Dark Souls Vibes</h3></a><p>More than just bonfires and difficult combat, Death Howl's world is ominous and evocative.</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-esa-announces-iicon-an-event-that-sure-doesnt-sound-like-e3.1102170/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/esa-announces-iicon-not-e3<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The ESA, the driving force behind E3, has announced a new event by the name of iicon, but don't get your hopes up; it really doesn't sound a heck of a lot like E3 at all.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.theesa.com/entertainment-software-association-unveils-iicon-game-changing-thought-leader-summit-to-harness-the-power-of-interactive-entertainment-and-shape-the-future-of-business-and-culture/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on its website, the ESA (which stands for Entertainment Software Association) describes iicon as an event aiming to "connect visionaries, thought leaders and innovators from across industries to harness the power of interactive entertainment".</p>

<p>In short, it sounds like iicon is much more corporate-minded than E3; it's more for business executives and industry figures than the general public, so don't expect to see any jaw-dropping game or console reveals.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/iicon-stanley-pierre-louis-esa-head.jpg?itok=Wb8qOeuy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/iicon-stanley-pierre-louis-esa-head.jpg?itok=ohqdHDQe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>ESA head Stanley Pierre-Louis says iicon will create "a space for visionaries" to "come together, connect, and reimagine what's possible through interactive entertainment".</figcaption></figure><p>The new event's <a href="https://www.iicon.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official website</a>&nbsp;has lots of copy aimed primarily at brands, offering them the chance to "align" with a "rapidly growing industry" and to "harness video game technology, innovations, and communities to elevate your brand".</p>

<p>According to the site, iicon promises "visionary keynotes, engaging discussions and workshops, and elite networking opportunities" with execs "shaping the future of entertainment, business, and technology".</p>

<p>The event won't just be about gaming, either; it also promises to incorporate other industries adjacent to gaming and interactive media, like film, TV, and music, as well as "sports, healthcare, education, finance, and more".</p>

<p>The ESA says that attendance will be "by invitation only", so it doesn't sound like you'll just be able to buy a ticket and rock up as a member of the public, which seems like it's in keeping with iicon's more exclusive approach.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/e3-2019-esa.jpg?itok=_bGvK2N_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/e3-2019-esa.jpg?itok=7r0mPMqU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The ESA's new iicon event does not sound much like E3.</figcaption></figure><p>Companies like Take-Two, Ubisoft, and Xbox have already signed up for iicon, which should provide another clue that the event won't be anything like E3; after all, some of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-wont-actually-be-at-e3-2023-but-will-still-host-live-event-in-los-angeles" rel="nofollow">companies</a> confirming their attendance publicly <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-nintendo-sony-skipping-e3-2023" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">shunned</a> E3 in the years before its demise.</p>

<p>In case you need a reminder, the ESA officially killed E3 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/e3-is-officially-dead" rel="nofollow">in December 2023</a>&nbsp;following a chaotic couple of years that included show cancellations and studios turning down appearances at the convention.</p>

<p>That's another reason iicon will almost certainly be nothing like E3; it would be a very unusual (and arguably foolish) business move to create an event exactly like one that was canned not even a year and a half ago.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in ESA news, meanwhile, the trade body recently took President Trump to task over his <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/esa-trump-tariffs-comments" rel="nofollow">newly-introduced tariffs</a>, which the organization says could cause "significant harm to everyday Americans". Trump has paused tariffs on Canada and Mexico, but has gone ahead with a 10% tariff on China-imported goods.</p>

<p>In any case, the inaugural iicon event will take place between April 27th and 30th next year at the Las Vegas Fontainebleau Resort. Stay tuned for more.</p>

<p>The game has always had mods on PC; however, the latest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hogwarts-legacy-mods-support-arrives-with-new-pc-enhancements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">update</a> has added official support from the developers. <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/hogwarts-legacy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Cursed Forge</a> is managing and publishing the official mods for Hogwarts Legacy, and you can find these mods in-game mod manager. If you are unaware of how to install Hogwarts Legacy mods, check out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-install-hogwarts-legacy-mods-a-step-by-step-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming’s guide</a>. </p>



<p>If you have finished all that Hogwarts Legacy has to offer, then mods will be the best way to jump back in. As official mod support is pretty new, we will go through some of the top mods for Hogwarts Legacy across various categories, such as Brooms, Wands, Clothing, Gameplay and more. </p>

<h2 id="h-hogwarts-legacy-broom-mods">Hogwarts Legacy Broom Mods</h2>



<p>If you have grown tired of all the stock Brooms in the game, here are some unique ones that can be accessed in Hogwarts Legacy through mods. Various choices are available, and we will go through some of the best ones. </p>



<h3 id="h-giant-cat-broom">Giant Cat Broom</h3>



<p>You guessed it; this mod switches out your Broom for Giant Cat in Hogwarts Legacy. However, it can only be used as a variant of the Moon Trimmer broom. The Cat also has an animation, and it moves its legs when flying in the air. </p>

<h3 id="h-magic-carpet-broom-and-vacuum-broom">Magic Carpet Broom and Vacuum Broom </h3>



<p>There are some silly Hogwarts Legacy Broom mods, too. The first one, Magic Carpet Broom Mods, lets you get into the shoes of Alladin and fly on a magic carpet across the open world. However, it looks silly as the character’s legs pop out of the rug, as they are designed to sit on a broom. Vacuum Broom replaces the Moon Trimmer with a Vacuum cleaner. </p>



<h3 id="h-dementor-s-broom">Dementor’s Broom</h3>



<p>If you have missed Dementors in Hogwarts Legacy, this mod will allow players to hang out with one almost perpetually. The Dementor’s Broom mod will tether a spectral Dementor to the Ember Dash broom. </p>



<h3 id="h-dragon-brooms-and-dragon-spine">Dragon Brooms and Dragon Spine</h3>



<p>Fans of Harry Potter would love to ride around on some Dragons in Hogwarts Legacy, and this mod allows you to live your dream. Dragon Broom adds three Dragons: the Moon Trimmer turns into a Green Welsh, the Ember Dash turns into Hebridean Black, and the Yew Weaver turns into the Hungarian Horntail. On the other hand, Dragon Spine replaces the Moon Trimmer with a dragon’s skeleton. </p>

<h3 id="h-broom-trails">Broom Trails </h3>



<p>If you don’t wish to change how your broom looks, then you can go for a different trail. Players will find Trail Blazers for all brooms: Emberdash, Yew Weaver, Moon Trimmer, Aeromancer and more. </p>



<h2 id="h-hogwarts-legacy-wand-mods">Hogwarts Legacy Wand Mods</h2>



<p>In a game about Harry Potter, you need access to as many wands as possible. As Hogwarts Legacy sticks you with one wand for the entire game, players can use mods to add a plethora of new choices. </p>



<h3 id="h-character-wands">Character Wands </h3>



<p>This mod will allow players to swap their wand for a wand used by other characters in the game. Players will be able to shuffle between mods by using Shift + Page Down / GPad Left Shoulder + GPad DPad Right for ‘Next Wand’ and Shift + Page Up / GPad Left Shoulder + GPad DPad Left for ‘Previous Wand’. </p>



<h3 id="h-wacky-wands">Wacky Wands </h3>



<p>Players can swap their authentic wands for some of the most goofy objects out there with Wacky Wands mod. This mod will allow players to choose from options like a Baguette, Inflatable Sword, Chainsaw, Rubber Chicken, Electric Guitar, and more. </p>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-default-wand-shop">Default Wand Shop </h3>



<p>This mod will allow players to change their wand style, wood type, and wand core from any stock wands on the fly. Players will find a new ‘Wand Shop’ button on the bottom right of the Save Settings menu. </p>



<h3 id="h-elder-wand">Elder Wand </h3>



<p>If you are using different types of wands in Hogwarts Legacy through mods, you might as well use the most iconic wand in the franchise’s history, the Elder Wand. </p>



<h2 id="h-hogwarts-legacy-clothes-and-accessories-mods">Hogwarts Legacy Clothes and Accessories&nbsp;Mods</h2>



<p>Hogwarts Legacy already provides tons of customisation options in the game’s character creator and the loot you find throughout the game. However, with the help of mods, the level of customisation options is taken to the next level. </p>



<h3 id="h-cliffans-outfits-and-accessories">Cliffans Outfits and Accessories</h3>



<p>Cliffans Outfits and Accessories is one of the best Hogwarts Legacy mods right now, thanks to all the options it provides. Players get to wear high-quality clothing and accessories like rings and bags. The new clothes have physics, and players can also wear their broom on their shoulders. The mods’ items are available through Galdrags Wizardwear. However, players must wait three in-game days for the items to be visible in the shop. </p>

<h3 id="h-beard-appearance-mods">Beard Appearance Mods</h3>



<p>In Hogwarts Legacy, the player character is a school-going kid, so it’s bizarre to see kids walking around with long beards in the school. But if that is how you want your character to be, you can do so either through the Dark Brown Beard Gear Appearance mod or the Wizard Long Beard Gear Appearance Set. The latter adds three long white beats for male and female avatars. </p>



<h3 id="h-casual-npc-costume">Casual NPC Costume</h3>



<p>If you are tired of seeing the game’s NPCs wear the same outfit the entire time, check out the Casual NPCs mod. It provides a complete wardrobe overhaul for 10 characters, including ” custom-designed ensembles.” Currently, the mod can change the appearance of the following characters in Hogwarts Legacy: Sebastian Sallow, Ominis Gaunt, Garreth Weasley, Amit Thakkar, Natsai Onai, Leander Prewett, Poppy Sweeting, Imelda Reyes, Arthur Plummly, and Andrew Larson. </p>



<h3 id="h-dark-arts-wardrobe">Dark Arts Wardrobe </h3>



<p>Another option for new outfits is the Dark Arts Wardrobe mods. Players can access three new costumes: Spooky Formal Attire, Beetle Suit and Halloween Vest and Stockings. All three are available in both male and female versions. Like Cliffans, players will find these outfits in Galdrags Wizardwear, and they must wait three in-game days for the items to be visible in the shop.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-skin-colour-and-hair-colour-change">Skin Colour and Hair Colour Change</h3>



<p>If you are done checking out all the new Hogwarts Legacy outfit mods, check out the new Skin Colours and Hair Colours. Colorful Skin Colors mod will add Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, and Purple skin color to the Character Creator. The Additional Hair Colors mod adds 10 additional hair color options to Madam Snelling’s Salon and Character Creator. </p>



<h2 id="h-hogwarts-legacy-gameplay-mods">Hogwarts Legacy Gameplay Mods&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The list up till now has focused on purely cosmetic mods for Hogwarts Legacy; however, the following mods will focus on how you modify your gameplay experience. </p>



<h3 id="h-unlock-all-spells-gear-and-brooms">Unlock All Spells, Gear and Brooms </h3>



<p>If you find the unlocking process too long, check out these mods to use zero Effort. Unlock All Spells will instantly unlock all the spells for the player character, and Unlock All Brooms will add all the game’s brooms to the player’s inventory. Unlock All Gear will reveal all gloves, glasses, hats, scarves, robes, and outfits, allowing players to transform any outfit. However, it won’t add anything to the player’s inventory and will only change the character’s appearance. </p>



<h3 id="h-cheat-plus">Cheat Plus</h3>



<p>The Cheat Plus mod for Hogwarts Legacy adds a variety of convenience-based cheats for gameplay. Players can access any shop anywhere, become invincible, perform super jumps, add or remove money, identify all gear and much more. </p>



<figure></figure>

<h3 id="h-alohomora-unlocked-lv3">Alohomora Unlocked (Lv3)</h3>



<p>This mod will set your Alohomora Spell to level 3 without having to find any moons in the game. Level 3 allows you to access any of the locked doors. </p>



<h3 id="h-instant-plants-and-potions-and-increased-capacity">Instant Plants and Potions and Increased Capacity</h3>



<p>If your interests lie in Herbology and Potions, these mods will be a perfect fit. Instant Plants and Instant Potions mods reduce the brewing and growing wait time to one second, allowing you to have a surplus of plants and potions. </p>



<h3 id="h-increased-gear-potion-and-resource-capacity">Increased Gear, Potion and Resource  Capacity </h3>



<p>With the help of Hogwarts Legacy mods, players can acquire resources and store many more of them instantly. Increased Gear Capacity increases the player’s inventory to 520 items. Instant Potion/Resource Capacity will increase the maximum capacity of plants and potions. If the maximum capacity were 999, it would expand to 9999, 500 would also increase to 9999, 25 would change to 2500 and 12 would change to 1200. </p>



<h3 id="h-dekita-battle-pets">Dekita Battle Pets</h3>



<p>Modders have found a way to merge Pokemon and Hogwarts Legacy, and that’s done through a new mod called Dekita Battle Pets. Through this mod, players will be able to take customisable pet companions into battle. First, they will only be allowed muggle pets, but later, they receive access to the game’s Magical Beasts. The pets will grow and become stronger over time by levelling up and learning new skills.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-hogwarts-legacy-mission-and-quest-mods">Hogwarts Legacy Mission and Quest Mods </h2>



<h3 id="h-dungeon-of-doom">Dungeon of Doom </h3>



<p>The Dungeon of Doom mod for Hogwarts Legacy adds a brand new experience for the player. The experience features new design elements and areas players haven’t seen in the game. The Dungeon of Doom tests players’ wits as they go through a series of rooms, take on a variety of enemies and unlock new rewards. </p>



<h3 id="h-sam-s-dungeon">Sam’s Dungeon</h3>



<p>Like Dungeon of Doom, the Sam’s Dungeon mod also adds the custom Dungeon, this time near the Hamlet of Upper Hogsfield. Sam’s Dungeon will feature some tricky puzzles, different enemies, and some exploration that will lead you to new rewards. </p>



<figure></figure>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-avowed-coming-to-xbox-game-pass.1102155/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-xbox-game-pass/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Microsoft is set for an interesting year in 2025, and Avowed is leading the charge for the green brand. Xbox Game Pass is one of the company’s leading benefits, and a partnership with Avowed could help both Obsidian and Microsoft at the end of the day.</p>



<p>Xbox Game Pass is a simple model—you pay a monthly fee, and you get free games. Game Pass’ library continues to grow month by month. It has players constantly wondering if they need to fork out top dollar on new AAA titles when they might be part of Xbox Game Pass.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-release-date-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Avowed</a> is looking like being one of Microsoft’s bigger exclusives in 2025—with titles such as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-5-ps5-release-period-release-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 5</a> making their way over to PS5—so let’s see if Game Pass users get to play it for nothing.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-avowed-on-xbox-game-pass">Can You Play Avowed on Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It looks enchanting. Credit to Obsidian Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Avowed is coming to Xbox Game Pass as a day-one title, meaning if you have an active subscription, you can play Avowed on Game Pass from February 18.</strong></p>



<p>The “Avowed – Official Announce Trailer” on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox’s official YouTube channel</a> (back on July 23, 2020) made waves. It’s a teaser, for sure, but it has enough substance and gameplay to stir up players for a new Obsidian franchise. Curiously, it makes no mention of Xbox Game Pass throughout its duration.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Avowed - Official Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W3QkO8fy3tg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>But thanks to some journalistic digging, I did find it in the video’s description: “<strong>Play day 1 on Xbox Game Pass</strong>.” With not long to go until February 18, five years is suddenly nothing! </p>



<p>Its status has remained unchanged for the last five years, meaning it is indeed a day-one Game Pass launch for Xbox and PC users. The news was also confirmed in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-game-pass-titles-for-february-2025-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">February 2025 Xbox Game Pass games reveal</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-long-is-avowed-on-xbox-game-pass">How Long is Avowed on Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>Neither Microsoft nor Obsidian has commented on how long Avowed is staying on Xbox Game Pass.</strong></p>



<p>It’s the kind of question that always comes up. You don’t want to miss out, and neither do I. FOMO is a powerful tool, but sleep easy knowing exclusive games like <strong>Avowed are usually on Xbox Game Pass for several years—and longer</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<p>Are you happy to see Avowed coming to Xbox Game Pass? Do you think it can go one better and outdo Obsidian’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-outer-worlds-2-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Outer Worlds 2</a> in 2025? Share your thoughts and feelings.</p>

That influence is particularly felt in Cloudheim, the upcoming debut title from Noodle Cat Games. In the first trailer below, Cloudheim does an admirable job of creating a visual style that is very similar to the two Zelda games while keeping the crafting elements from Tears of the Kingdom as well.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHnpo84ybmM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bHnpo84ybmM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Noodle Cat Games is a developer that features veterans from EA, BioWare, Codemasters, Disney, and Epic Games. According to their team, Cloudheim takes place in "an ancient Norse-inspired world," which players are tasked to restore to its former glory. The game can be played solo or with three online companions for a co-op experience. Additionally, all team members can share any weapons or abilities they uncover together.</p><p>Story details are still light at the moment, but Noodle Cat notes that Cloudheim has "a fully breakable world," and teammates can chain together their abilities for devastating combos when facing their enemies. Players can also team up with some of this world's fantastic creatures, including "the resourceful Blins, the ever-hungry Gnasher, and the spiky yet loyal Swordcupine."</p><p>Crafting is also a big part of this game, as players can utilize their resources to create weapons, gear, and new abilities. Their world is extremely dangerous, which is why the players will be able to take refuge on Odin Shell, a giant turtle floating in the sky who "carries a fragment of a dead god's power." That's where players can create their own customized spaces and expand their capabilities while also discovering the Odin Shell's hidden secrets.</p><p>Cloudheim is expected to debut in the third quarter of this year on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/06/age-of-empires-ii-age-of-mythology-are-coming-to-ps5-this-spring/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Microsoft’s cross-platform push is bringing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/06/09/age-of-empires-ii-definitive-edition-releases-this-fall/">Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/10/25/age-of-mythology-retold-has-been-revealed/">Age of Mythology: Retold</a> to PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>Age of Mythology: Retold will launch for PS5 on 4th March with Age of Empires II: DE coming to Sony’s console later this spring.</p>


<p>Launching at the exact same time as the PS5 port is the Immortal Pillars expansion for Age of Mythology: Retold. This delves into Chinese culture and mythology for its inspiration, featuring 12 new gods, such as Fuxi, Shennong, Nüwa, Gonggong and Zhurong, a 9-level campaign, new mythical units and 7 new maps.</p>
<p>Immortal Pillars is bundled into Age of Mythology: Retold Premium Edition, which also grants 5 days early access to the game on PS5 from 27th February.</p>
<p><iframe title="Age of Mythology: Retold - Immortal Pillars" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1vBe-Tcehu4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It’s a pretty special time to be a fan of Age of Empires series, with Microsoft having greenlit remasters/remakes of the whole classic RTS series, as well as bringing out Age of Empires 4 as a brand new entry. But they haven’t stopped there. Instead of treating each game’s remaster as a final, definitive edition, they have (regardless of the name) also brought new expansions, new campaigns and factions to the table. There’s also multiple expansions coming to Age of Empires 4 later this year.</p>

<p>A lot of this has been done with Microsoft’s World’s Edge team working closely with the fan-founded team at Forgotten Empires. Immortal Pillars also has Virtuos Games and Tantalus Media as developers.</p>
<p>It’s not always gone perfectly to plan, though. With so many Age of Empires games now being viewed as current projects, all deserving of attention and expansions, the teams have been stretched a bit too thin, and the audience spread across too many games. Because of this, it was recently <a href="https://www.ageofempires.com/news/age-of-empires-iii-definitive-edition-dlc-news/">announced that further Age of Empires 3 DLC has been cancelled</a>, and that it had been announced too soon before work had begun.</p>

			<p>It's GeForce NOW's 5th anniversary month, and to celebrate that milestone, there will be five major releases added to GeForce NOW. For this week, there are seven games that are being added to the service, with a total of 17 games being added to the service this month. If you want to play some of the latest major releases but don't have a game-ready rig, GeForce NOW gives you the option to be able to stream it to your own device without having to do any of the difficult work. If you are an Ultimate or Performance member, you'll be able to play Kingdom Come: Deliverance II at the highest frame rates on your devices.</p>
<p>If you're not sure about whether you want to plunge into the new historical RPG, you can read the <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sells-1-million-copies/">review written by Chris Wray</a>, which can help provide more information about what you'll get up to in this game and what you can expect from the performance of it.</p>
<p>This game has enhanced graphics powered by GeForce RTX, which makes it one of the better-suited games to play through GeForce NOW, even if you don't have a game-ready rig. You can play the game at 4K 120fps in an eight-hour session with the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ultimate membership</a>, or 1440p and 120fps in a six-hour session with the Performance membership, depending on what your preference is.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/civilization-7-early-access-mixed-reviews-50k-players</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/civilization-7-debuts-to-50k-early-access-players-and-mixed-steam-reviews.1102104/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/civilization-7-early-access-mixed-reviews-50k-players<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Players are starting to get their hands on the early access (as distinct from Early Access) release of&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7</em>, and while the numbers are pretty impressive even for an iconic franchise like this one, player impressions are decidedly mixed.</p>

<p>In case you need a refresher,&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7</em>'s early access period started today for those who bought either the Deluxe or Founders Edition of the game. This isn't an "Early Access" release; it's the full game, but some players are getting to check it out ahead of the full release <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/civilization-7-pc-specs" rel="nofollow">on February 11th</a>.</p>

<p>First, the good news for publisher 2K.&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7</em>'s early access launch has debuted to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1295660/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">over 55,000 players</a> on Steam at time of writing, which surely portends well for the full release of the game. I wouldn't be surprised if&nbsp;<em>Civ 7&nbsp;</em>smashed&nbsp;<em>Civ 6</em>'s 162,657 <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/289070/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">concurrent player record</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/civilization-7-early-access-mixed-reviews-city.jpg?itok=FGHaDJ2s 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/civilization-7-early-access-mixed-reviews-city.jpg?itok=pFGxgtT4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>has debuted in early access to high player numbers and mixed reviews.</figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately for 2K, the picture painted by the game's Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1295660/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_VII/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reviews</a> is perhaps a more ambiguous one.</p>

<p>At time of writing,&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>has attracted a Mixed rating across 2,587 reviews, with just 41% of those reviews being positive. Admittedly, the figure represents less than 5% of the game's overall early access player base, but that's still not a great look.</p>

<p>Common complaints from players include criticisms aimed at the game's user interface, as well as accusations that the game feels <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/NDYEE/recommended/1295660/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">"unfinished"</a> and that game customization is <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/machine001/recommended/1295660/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">lacking</a>.</p>

<p>Even some positive reviewers express dissatisfaction with the UI; one <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198049076071/recommended/1295660/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reviewer says</a> the "pros...outweigh the cons" when it comes to&nbsp;<em>Civ 7</em>, but describes the user interface as "abysmal".</p>




<p><em>Civilization&nbsp;</em>has been through cycles similar to this before; players often criticize new installments of the series for making changes to previous versions, and reception gradually improves as updates and DLC packs get released.</p>

<p>Time will tell whether or not that's what's happening here. We'll probably learn more about what the overall player impression of&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>is when it launches in full on February 11th for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1295660/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_VII/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/sid-meier-s-civilization-vii/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-for-xbox-series-xs/9N23HJHSC6BL" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/all-disney-games-on-nintendo-switch-in-order<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Disney is a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/every-company-disney-owns">multimedia powerhouse</a>, the king of every form of entertainment from movies, TV shows, theme parks, and even video games. Over the last 30 years, The House of Mouse had a hand in creating video game adaptations of some classic Disney movies and original games, like Kingdom Hearts and Epic Mickey.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today, there are plenty of Disney games on the Nintendo Switch for you to enjoy playing alone or with family and friends. Whether you’re relaxing at home and want to take a break from scrolling through Disney+ or taking a trip to a Disney Park, here's every Disney game for the Switch in release order.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">How Many Disney Games Are on the Nintendo Switch? </h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It can be a little challenging to pinpoint what is and isn't "Disney" these days. In total, <strong>11 Disney games have launched on the Switch</strong> since the handheld released in 2017. Three of those games are movie tie-ins, one is a spin-off of the Kingdom Hearts series, and one is technically a collection of multiple "Disney classics." I don't include them here in the interest of space, but there are also plenty of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-star-wars-games-on-nintendo-switch">Star Wars games on the Switch</a> that technically fall under the Disney umbrella.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Which Disney Game Is Worth Playing in 2025? </h3><div catalogid="d2a33a52-6f6f-4e47-97be-8b0c4ce3372d" id="214796"><div id="214796" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Disney Dreamlight Valley</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Featuring a sticker set, collectible poster, full access to the base game and exclusive digital bonuses.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Not every Disney game is created equal. The combination of "the Disney Brand" with Nintendo Switch games already being pretty expensive means I wouldn't recommend all of the games on this list at their current price points. That said, there have definitely been some winners in the past couple years. If you're looking for a game that makes you feel like you're part of the Disney world, Dreamlight Valley is as good as it gets. The Animal Crossing-like game places you in the position to rebuild Dreamlight Valley with the help of your neighbors, a host of Disney and Pixar characters with their own questlines. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">All Disney and Pixar Games on Switch (in Release Order)</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Cars 3: Driven to Win (2017) </h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The first Disney game that launched on the Switch is technically a Pixar game that also overlapped with the Nintendo 3DS. In 2017, the media giant released a tie-in game for the movie Cars 3. Naturally, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/cars-3-driven-to-win">Cars 3: Driven to Win</a> is a racing game featuring 20 tracks based on locations from the films (including Radiator Springs). The game also includes 20 customizable "characters," some that are automatically unlocked at the start, like Lightning McQueen, while others, like Mater and Chick Hicks, can only be unlocked by winning your way through the five game modes and various Master Events.</p></div><div catalogid="d2a33a52-6f6f-4e47-97be-8b0c4ce3372d" id="214789"><div id="214789" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Cars 3: Driven to Win</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3">LEGO The Incredibles (2018)</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">LEGO The Incredibles takes the plotlines of both Incredibles films, released 14 years apart, and merges them into one giant <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-lego-games">LEGO game</a>. Much like the LEGO Star Wars games, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/lego-the-incredibles">LEGO The Incredibles</a> contains some deviations from the original source material, like changes to the lore we don’t want to spoil for those who haven’t seen the films (even though you had nearly 20 years to do so), and adds original villains to fight along with Bomb Voyage, Syndrome, and the Underminer. But it’s fun to play through, especially seeing that the LEGO version of Elastigirl can stretch herself as far as her movie version can.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is only one of many <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-lego-games-on-nintendo-switch-in-order">LEGO games currently available on the Switch</a>. </p></div><div catalogid="d2a33a52-6f6f-4e47-97be-8b0c4ce3372d" id="214790"><div id="214790" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>LEGO The Incredibles</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3">Disney Tsum Tsum Festival (2019) </h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/disney-tsum-tsum-festival">Disney Tsum Tsum Festival</a> is a cute party game inspired by the Disney Tsum Tsum line of collectible toys and the mobile game from Japan, featuring all the Disney and Pixar characters in Tsum Tsum form. The game has 10 different minigames you can play alone or with family and friends, including bubble hockey, curling, and ice cream stacker, among others. You can even play the classic mobile puzzle game with the Switch in a vertical position.</p></div><div catalogid="d2a33a52-6f6f-4e47-97be-8b0c4ce3372d" id="214791"><div id="214791" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Disney Tsum Tsum Festival</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3">Kingdom Hearts: Melody of Memory (2019) </h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Disney and Square Enix’s spin on the latter’s Theatrhythm Final Fantasy lets you take control of Sora, Donald, Goofy, and other characters from across the Kingdom Hearts universe to slash the Heartless and their ilk to the beat of the series’ iconic soundtrack. Enjoy the musical stylings of Yoko Shimomura by yourself, or share the music with your friends in local co-op or online multiplayer battles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the grand scheme of things, Kingdom Hearts: Melody of Memory gives a recap of the series up to Kingdom Hearts 3 with narration from Kairi, who falls into a deep sleep under Ansem the Wise’s observation after the events of Kingdom Hearts 3’s Re: Mind DLC. Whether you’re a veteran fan of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-hearts-games-in-order">Kingdom Hearts games</a> or a newcomer, this game does an excellent job of getting you up to speed in preparation for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-hearts-4-release-date-gameplay-trailer-news">Kingdom Hearts 4</a>, which is currently in development.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Read our </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-hearts-melody-of-memory-review"><em>review of Kingdom Hearts: Melody of Memory</em></a><em>.</em></p></div><div catalogid="d2a33a52-6f6f-4e47-97be-8b0c4ce3372d" id="214792"><div id="214792" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Kingdom Hearts Melody of Memory</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3">Disney Classic Games Collection (2021)</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/disney-classic-games-collection">Disney Classic Games Collection</a> is an updated edition of 2019’s Disney Classic Games: Aladdin and The Lion King (a mouthful of a title) that includes the Final Cut of Aladdin and the console and handheld versions of The Jungle Book. It has an interactive museum, a rewind function to correct gameplay mistakes, an expanded soundtrack, and a retro-style manual for one of the three games if you buy a physical copy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This compilation lets you relive the game adaptations of your favorite Disney movies the way you played them in the ‘90s no matter which platform you owned at the time, hence the inclusion of the Sega Genesis and Game Boy versions of Aladdin and The Lion King, as well as the Super Nintendo version of the latter. Adding The Jungle Book makes the compilation even more valuable as no one had seen the game since 1994.</p></div><div catalogid="d2a33a52-6f6f-4e47-97be-8b0c4ce3372d" id="214793"><div id="214793" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Disney Classic Games Collection</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Includes multiple versions of the Aladdin, The Lion King, and The Jungle Book games that have been created over the years</p></div></div><h3 data-cy="title3">Disney Magical World 2: Enchanted Edition (Switch Release: 2021)</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">In hindsight, Disney's Magical World series feels a bit like the precursor to Dreamlight Valley. Originally released for the 3DS, the first two Magical World games let players befriend and complete quests for Disney and Pixar characters with additional farming, crafting, and even combat mechanics. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/disney-magical-world-2-enchanted-edition">Magical World 2: Enchanted Edition</a> is a remaster of the second game in the series released specifically for the Nintendo Switch.

It reveals another facet of life on the Grid without involving characters from the films, as it is set thousands of years after the events of Tron: Legacy. The game centers on a program named Query, a detective assigned to investigate an explosion in the vault of the Repository, a secure building in the center of the Grid. As the mystery unfolds, the other programs you interact with pose more questions than answers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each character you meet gives you the choice to either ally with them, antagonize them, or derezz them, depending on the dialogue. Plus, you have to complete puzzles in order to ask them more questions about the vault explosion. That’s a lot of detective work to do in three to six hours.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Read our </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tron-identity-review"><em>review of Tron: Identity</em></a><em>.</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Disney Speedstorm (2023)</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">2023 was a big year for Disney games, but the first release from that year flew a little under the radar. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/disney-speedstorm">Disney Speedstorm</a> is a kart racing game featuring some brawling mechanics and, of course, a pretty extensive lineup of Disney characters with unique skills and their own personalized vehicles.

Whether you’re playing in single-player or co-op mode with three additional players, you can play as either character and navigate the island Metroidvania style.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Disney Illusion Island carries the same comedic charm as the recent Mickey Mouse cartoons despite the change in art style.

You play as a human who arrives at the titular Dreamlight Valley, which has been gripped by the Night Thorns, leading to The Forgetting. This supernatural event caused the Disney characters who stayed in the valley to lose their memories while others returned to their home worlds for safety.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You work to rebuild Dreamlight Valley using magic called Dreamlight to weed out the Night Thorns, provide housing for the character via Scrooge McDuck’s construction company, cook food at Remy’s restaurant, and build friendships with everyone, both heroes and villains. The best part is, you never have to worry about your clothes, food, and tools taking up space in your inventory. And you can customize your character with the coolest Disney outfits complete with Mickey Mouse ears just like you were going to Disney World — or Disneyland, depending on where you live.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Read our </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disney-dreamlight-valley-review"><em>review of Disney Dreamlight Valley</em></a><em> or check out more </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/playlist/jkienlen/lists/the-best-switch-games-like-stardew-valley"><em>games like Stardew Valley for Switch</em></a><em>.</em></p></div><div catalogid="d2a33a52-6f6f-4e47-97be-8b0c4ce3372d" id="214796"><div id="214796" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Disney Dreamlight Valley</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Featuring a sticker set, collectible poster, full access to the base game and exclusive digital bonuses.</p></div></div><h3 data-cy="title3">Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed (2024) </h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The most recent Disney game on the Switch, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/disney-epic-mickey-rebrushed">Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed</a> is a remaster of the original Epic Mickey game that launched on the Wii in 2010.

                <p dir="ltr">After over three years, MercurySteam seems ready to share more about its dark-fantasy action-RPG with the working title Project Iron. The developer released a short clip on social media, teasing that more will be revealed at IGN Fan Fest (an event running from February 24-28).</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://x.com/ProjectIronGame/status/1887501508578890207" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">On X</a>, the Project Iron account shared a 15-second video focusing on a hammer resting on top of what appears to be a stone table. There's an orangish glow coming from the bottom-left corner, with embers floating through the air. One of the hashtags further teases what to expect, sharing a possible tagline for the game: Forge Your Legend.</p><p dir="ltr">In 2021, publisher 505 Games announced it was teaming up with MercurySteam on Project Iron. Little is known about the title. It's an action-RPG with a third-person perspective in a dark-fantasy setting. In 2023, MercurySteam co-founder Enric Alvarez told <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/project-iron-will-have-strong-graphics-storytelling-and-action-1292253/" rel="nofollow ">Gamereactor</a> that Project Iron is a single-player experience built in the Mercury Engine.</p><p dir="ltr">MercurySteam is best known for making Metroid: Samus Returns and <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=metroid+dread+review+gamespot&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metroid Dread</a> with Nintendo, though previously also worked on the Castlevania series with Konami. From 2010-14, the developer created Castlevania: Lords of Shadow, Castlevania: Lords of Shadow - Mirror of Fate, and Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, 505 Games is known for publishing titles like Terraria, Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night, and Control. Almost a year ago, though, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/remedy-secures-its-connected-universe-by-taking-control-of-control/1100-6521447/">Remedy acquired all of the rights to the Control franchise </a>from 505 Games.</p>

In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review/1900-6418276/" data-ref-id="1900-6418276">Space Marine 2 review</a>, we said, "Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is a more-than-worthy successor to the 2011 original.
