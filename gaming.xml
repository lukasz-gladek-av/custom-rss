		<p>Everyone likes to be winner. It’s one of humanity’s best, and possibly worst, traits, but when it comes to giveaways, winning is better than losing. One lucky reader will have the chance to be that winner, taking home a brand new Turtle Beach Stealth 500 Gaming Headset for PS5, PS4, PC and mobile platforms via Bluetooth.</p>

<p>The Turtle Beach Stealth 500 is one of our favourite sub-£100 headsets, earning <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/19/turtle-beach-stealth-500-gaming-headset-review/">8/10 in our review</a> last year. Praising its looks and comfort, we said, ” The first thing you’ll notice about the new Stealth 500 is how sleek and modern it looks, fashioned wholly out of black materials, it is almost as stealthy as its name implies. The build is mostly plastic, with a rigid plastic headband, but it has the added benefit of making this one very light headset. I’ve worn this thing for whole days and never had a moment of weariness, and that’s a huge boon if you live with your headset on.”</p>
<p>It sounds great, feels great, and will be a fantastic addition to any gaming setup where you’re looking to up your audio game. In order to be in with a chance to win, enter via the form below!</p>

							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5</span>
						</p></div></div>			
			<p>The WWE 2K franchise has been in a rebuilding phase for the past few years, culminating in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wwe-2k24/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last year’s WWE 2K24</a>, which was one of the best pro grappling games 2K and developer Visual Concepts had delivered in years. But as most seasoned wrestling fans know, it’s one thing to prove you’re championship material; it’s another challenge altogether to stay at that elite level. That’s the test <a href="https://wccftech.com/wwe-2k25-hands-on-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WWE 2K25</a> now faces.</p>
<p>Does WWE 2K25 continue the series’ upward momentum? Or does it make some unfortunate high-risk moves? It’s time to lace ‘em up again and find out.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/WCCFwwe2k2520.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Over the past few years, the WWE 2K games have taken steps to refine their in-ring action, adding offensive maneuvers and new ways the change the momentum of matches beyond standard reversals, such as blocks, dodges, and “breakers.” In some respects, WWE 2K25 further polishes the between-the-ropes product – animations feel a bit smoother and some minor features, like being able to launch attacks from the ringside barriers, have been added. I’m also a fan of the new “Giant” fighting style, which grants those playing as one of the big boys (or girls) an extra bar of “armor.” Once the giant’s armor is worn down, they play more like a regular wrestler, and their limited invulnerability is balanced by them not being able to do certain more acrobatic moves. I wouldn’t mind seeing other WWE 2K wrestler archetypes updated to stand apart more.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/WCCFwwe2k259.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>That said, WWE 2K25’s action also regresses in some ways. Blocking has been removed from the game, and while it was never something I used that much, it’s always disappointing to have something removed from your toolbox. The Chain Wrestling minigame has also been brought back, which I’m somewhat ambivalent about. Sure, the mechanic works well enough, but it isn’t particularly engaging, as it forces you to keep your attention on minigame meters instead of what your wrestler is actually doing for a significant amount of time. Overall, I still enjoyed the action in WWE 2K25, but I was left with a lingering feeling the series is taking a turn back toward gimmicks instead of faster action and fighting-game-style versatility.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/WCCFwwe2k2519.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>WWE 2K25’s two new match types are also largely duds. The Underground match is an odd addition, as the COVID-19 era “Raw Underground” experiment it’s based on isn’t particularly well-remembered by anyone. The match itself isn’t anything special, essentially just removing the ring ropes and darkening the arena for your standard hardcore match. There isn’t even a dedicated Underground arena (the unique presentation of Raw Underground was one of the few memorable things about it).</p>
<p>The new Bloodline Rules match sounds promising in theory but is pretty underwhelming in practice. Basically, players have the ability to call in up to three run-ins per match, which can be countered by your opponent with their own run-ins. These allies don’t just run in and disappear, they stick around and often start fighting each other, resulting in an increasingly disorderly schmozz. The end result is quite the opposite of the carefully orchestrated “cinematic” matches that Roman Reigns has made his trademark.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/WCCFwwe2k255.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>On the plus side, while the new match types aren’t terribly inspired, almost every type of match in the game can now be played with any mix of men and women as intergender wrestling makes its return. Of course, intergender wrestling is a divisive topic -- I’m not always a great fan of it in real life, but I’m also all for letting people have their fun within the largely consequence-free world of video games, and it can be switched off in the options.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/WCCFwwe2k2521.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Visually, WWE 2K25 receives the standard minor glow-up the series gets every year. Lighting has been improved and the often Medusa-like hair physics of years past have finally been tamed. As usual, some Superstars look almost uncannily realistic, others not so much (even after Bayley herself directed some shade at last year’s game, she <em>still</em> doesn’t look quite right).</p>
<p>Moving beyond the core in-ring action, WWE 2K25 offers the usual array of ways to play and an all-new one – The Island. Similar to NBA 2K’s The City hub, The Island allows you to explore themed areas with other players, climb the rankings in online matches, make your way through a series of single-player “quests,” and, of course, spend money on cosmetics.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/WCCFwwe2k2522.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>I won’t sugarcoat it: The Island is a drag. While it looks nice enough, with references to various WWE Superstars – a Kairi Sane Pirate Princess restaurant here, a very random Damage CTRL computer repair shop there – almost none of it is interactive in any meaningful way. The quests you can engage with are as basic as they get – find a WWE wrestler somewhere on The Island, get treated to a very underwhelming static, text-based “cutscene,” have a match, then go find another wrestler, read more inane text, and have another match. Rinse and repeat.</p>
<p>The stories laid out in The Island’s quests are purely Saturday morning cartoon fare. You’ll find yourself doing things like constructing special “video game armor” for Xavier Woods so he can do battle with his gaming alter-ego, who has somehow come to life, or going on a time-traveling escapade with Rey Mysterio thanks to a magical lucha mask. Maybe this stuff actually sounds kinda kooky and fun to you, but trust me, it’s all presented in the dullest way possible.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/WCCFwwe2k2523.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>And yes, of course, everything about The Island is tuned to maximize extra spending. In addition to the numerous in-game shops selling overpriced cosmetics (most things cost between 6,000 and 18,000 “VC,” meaning a single 32,500 VC pack costing $10 may only buy you two or three items) progressing your OVR is a slog, requiring <em>hours</em> of play to add a single point to your rating. Of course, when I tried to jump into some online matches mere minutes after The Island went live, I was almost exclusively matched up with guys with paid-for 100 OVRs. If you want to be competitive at all, you need to fork over for either an expensive special edition or VC packs.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the effort Visual Concepts sunk into The Island seems to have had a knock-on effect on the rest of WWE 2K25, as the MyRise career mode is notably diminished this year. Rather than two individual stories for the men and women, they’re smushed into a single story, and instead of a more intricate system of missions and side missions, you simply get a main story and the ability to engage in filler “Live Event” matches.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/WCCFwwe2k2524.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The MyRise story, entitled “Mutiny,” is mostly nonsense. After your created character debuts in WWE, the very unlikely duo of Kevin Owens and Bayley stage a mutiny of NXT veterans, despite both of them having left the brand ages ago. The mutiny makes no sense, as 90 percent of WWE superstars from the past decade or more have come through NXT, so what, exactly, are they rebelling against? Today’s WWE star is the NXT star of a few years ago. The whole thing just feels random, with none of the alliances or characters making any sense if you watch WWE even casually. It's disappointing, because MyRise storytelling had really improved in recent years, with plots that actually played off WWE history and personalities in interesting ways, sometimes even cautiously challenging WWE narratives. That's nowhere to be found this year.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/WCCFwwe2k2525.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>It's not all bad news, though, as some modes do offer improvements. “The Bloodline’s Dynasty” 2K Showcase builds nicely on the positive upgrades the mode received last year, adding matches that let you change history and “dream” showdowns that never happened in the real world. This adds some much-needed variety to the Showcase experience, which sometimes felt like a bit of a grind in years past. New timed objectives during matches are somewhat less successful, but overall, this may be the best Showcase we’ve got to date.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/WCCFwwe2k2526.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>MyGM is largely the same as last year, and still suffers from not allowing you to pre-determine outcomes, but the addition of online play is unquestionably a big boost for those who do enjoy the mode. Universe mode offers the usual handful of annual updates, including the return of promos, and remains a solid, if dry, tool for fantasy bookers. The Ultimate-Team-style MyFaction mode also returns and continues to be an odd fit for a game with a roster of only a few hundred names to draw on. A new single-player mode and a few more match options for online play freshen things up a bit but don’t fundamentally change the MyFaction experience.</p>
<p>While WWE 2K games have always had their share of glitches, I encountered more than usual this year, and they weren’t just minor graphical bugs – full-on crashes on PS5 were fairly common. Some of these issues may have already been patched, but it’s hard to escape the feeling that WWE 2K25 is arriving in a messier state than its predecessor. Even with this lack of polish and some skippable modes, it still feels like WWE 2K25 offers a solid amount of content worth exploring. That said, if you opt to stick with a dependable veteran like WWE 2K24, you won’t be missing out on as much as in some past years.</p>

						<section>
				<p>WWE 2K25 doesn’t manage to build on the momentum created by the last few entries in the series. For every step forward, such as online MyGM or the varied Bloodline 2K Showcase, there’s a step back, like the lifeless MyRise career mode and some questionable changes to core gameplay. The biggest blemish is The Island hub, which excels at separating players from their money and not much else. There’s certainly still fun to be had with WWE 2K25, but the series risks dropping back to the midcard if it continues on this new trajectory.</p>

This suggests the video is legitimate. IGN has asked Sony for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the video, as reported by The Verge, Sony Interactive Entertainment director of software engineering, Sharwin Raghoebardajal, has a conversation with an AI-powered Aloy via voice prompts and AI-generated speech and facial animations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The speech recognition is via OpenAI’s Whisper for speech-to-text, the conversational AI via GPT-4 and Llama 3 for dialogue and decision-making, the speech synthesis via Sony’s Emotional Voice Synthesis (EVS) system, and the facial animation via Sony’s Mockingbird technology.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the tech demo, Raghoebardajal asks Aloy how she's doing, to which she responds: "Hello, I'm managing alright. Just dealing with a sore throat. How have you been?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The voice heard coming from Aloy's mouth is not that of voice actor Ashly Burch, who famously plays the character in the video games. Rather, it is a robotic voice similar to the kind you get from any of the thousands of text-to-speech voice generators used to narrate social media posts. AI Aloy's facial movements are stiff and her eyes appear lifeless as she converses with Raghoebardajal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When asked how Aloy's search for her mother is going, she replies: "I discovered I'm a clone of Dr. Elizabeth Sobeck, which led me to understand my purpose and origins."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">How does it feel to be a clone? "Being a clone feels unique, connecting me to the past while allowing me to create my own path and future," Aloy replies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The demo then transitions into the actual Horizon Forbidden West game world, and Raghoebardajal continues the conversation while playing the game. It's slightly jarring to see the player converse with a character they're in control of, and the irony of using Aloy as an AI-powered PlayStation character given the plot of the Horizon games is obvious.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The demo is described as a prototype developed with the help of Horizon studio Guerrilla Games to show off the tech internally at Sony. “This is just a glimpse of what is possible,” Raghoebardajal says in the video. And while the video shows an investment from Sony in the exploration of AI-powered PlayStation characters, it’s worth noting the company has yet to confirm plans to incorporate the tech into any public-facing PlayStation product, and there is no suggestion it would even be possible with PS5 games at this stage. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it perhaps comes as little surprise to see Sony’s work behind the scenes here, given pretty much all its competitors in the video game space are working on AI tech of some description. Indeed, Xbox maker Microsoft is all-in on AI, and recently announced <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-and-hellblade-developer-ninja-theory-built-an-ai-called-muse-designed-to-generate-ideas-for-a-games-design-and-its-already-making-complex-gameplay-sequences">an AI called Muse designed to generate ideas for a game's design</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Generative AI is one of the hottest topics within the video game and entertainment industries, which have both suffered massive layoffs in recent years. Generative AI thus far has drawn criticism from players and creators due to a mix of ethical issues, rights issues, and AI’s struggles to produce content audiences actually enjoy. For instance, Keywords Studios attempted to create an experimental game internally using entirely AI. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/video-game-made-purely-with-ai-failed-because-tech-was-unable-to-replace-talent"><u>The game failed</u></a>, with Keywords citing to investors that AI was “unable to replace talent.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA said in September that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-says-ai-is-the-very-core-of-its-business-what-does-that-mean"><u>AI was "the very core" of its business</u></a>, and more recently <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-experimenting-with-generative-ai-to-create-hundreds-of-thousands-of-unique-ideas-needed-to-build-in-game-environments"><u>Capcom said it was experimenting with generative AI</u></a> to create the "hundreds of thousands" of ideas needed for in-game environments.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Head of PlayStation Productions and head of product at PlayStation Studios Asad Qizilbash <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-exec-says-ai-is-important-to-gen-z-and-gen-alpha-gamers-who-want-personalization-across-everything"><u>weighed in on AI to say its use in video games is important to Gen Z and Gen Alpha gamers</u></a> who seek "personalization across everything."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For instance, non-player characters in games could interact with players based on their actions, making it feel more personal,” Qizilbash said. “This is important for the younger Gen Z and Gen Alpha audiences, who are the first generations that grew up digitally and are looking for personalization across everything, as well as looking for experiences to have more meaning."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-finally-admits-it-uses-generative-ai-for-some-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-assets-after-backlash-following-ai-slop-zombie-santa-loading-screen">Activision recently admitted the use of generative AI for some Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 assets</a> amid a backlash to an "AI slop" zombie Santa loading screen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

        <p>"Being a clone feels unique"</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Sony are experimenting with AI-powered characters who'll speak to the player directly using OpenAI and Chat-GPT to hold a conversation, according to leaked footage seen by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/626695/sony-playstation-ai-characters-aloy-horizon-forbidden-west-prototype">the Verge</a>. The video shows familiar robot whacker Aloy from the Horizon games "responding to queries with an AI-powered synthesized voice and facial movements". Sony's copyright patrolmen showed up with a "'ello 'ello what have we 'ere" and got the video taken down from YouTube. But, shhh, there are other ways to see it.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The footage is still <a href="https://streamable.com/eygm5f?src=player-page-share">posted on Streamable</a>, for example. Skip to the three minute mark if you just want to see the Aloybot in action. It shows her answering some questions about herself and her origins, then entering the game world and responding to other questions as she moves around, like whether or not she can see enemies nearby, what time it is, what weapons she's using, and so on. After that, they return to an "interview" setting and she summarises the past few moments.</p>
<p>The presentation is given by Sharwin Raghoebardajal, a software engineer who works on AI and face technology for an internal Sony body called the PlayStation Studios Advanced Technology Group. Raghoebardajal points out that this is just a prototype but confirms it is also operating within a specialised build of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/horizon-forbidden-west">Horizon Forbidden West</a>. Guerilla Games worked with the group to develop the demonstration, he says.</p>
<p>As for the technology behind it all, it's a melange of different AI, sound, and animation tools. OpenAI's Whisper is used to generate the speech-to-text, then language models GPT-4 and Llama 3 do their wibbly wobbly thing, before Sony's own voice synthesis and face animation technology wraps it all up. The result is a number of robotic if somewhat accurate face movements, and an unsettling voice from the depths of tech bro hell. I don't want it near me or my pets.</p>
<p>"We'll not go into whether this is fun for games," says Raghoebardajal, "whether it even makes sense to talk to Aloy when you're her while playing the game... or where we're going to get the memory from to run this all on a consumer console. This is just a glimpse of what is possible."</p>
<p>After the Verge published their story on AI-loy, the video they posted was taken down via a claim from Muso, a copyright enforcement company who have Sony as a client. Hey, Sony, relax. It could have been worse. Remember when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/catholic-priest-ai-chatbot-is-defrocked-within-a-week-after-taking-confession-and-okaying-gatorade-baptisms">the Vatican's AI chatbot was defrocked for telling people you could baptise children in Gatorade</a>? That was fun.</p>
<p>If you haven't played the Horizon games, they are open world action adventures about human tribes trying to survive in a world where humanity was almost wiped out. The collapse of civilisation was caused by artificial intelligence.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>The release date for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> on PS5 has seemingly been leaked by the very reliable Bilibil-kun, who claims that the acclaimed Indy game will launch on Sony’s console on 17th April.</p>
<p>Writing on French deals site <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/voici-les-dates-de-sortie-de-indiana-jones-et-le-cercle-ancien-sur-ps5-60055">Deallabs</a>, Billbil-kun is best known for their string of accurate leaks and reveals of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PS Plus</a> monthly games, but has since made plenty more accurate predictions for pretty much anything video game related.</p>


<p>Per their “recent investigations”, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will launch for PS5 on 17th April, though a Premium version will feature two days early access from 15th April, in addition to a Temple of Doom outfit, digital art book and an upcoming The Order of Giants DLC. Both Standard and Premium editions will be available as a physical release, matching the Xbox pricing at £69.99 / €79.99 / $69.99 for the Standard edition and £99.99 / €109.99 / $99.99 for the Premium edition, with pre-orders for both versions expected to go live on 25th March.</p>
<h2>Further Reading: <a title="Indiana Jones and The Great Circle is best experienced as a serial, just like the films that inspired it" href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-best-experienced-as-a-serial-just-like-the-films-that-inspired-it/">Indiana Jones and The Great Circle is best experienced as a serial</a></h2>
<p>Earlier this year, Microsoft proudly proclaimed that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/30/indiana-jones-hits-4-million-players-but-xbox-revenue-and-hardware-sales-fall/">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle has brought in over 4 million players</a> across <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>, PC and through <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a> subscribers. We never get actual sales figures for Microsoft games anymore, but this was an encouraging amount of reach, and we’ll certainly see a big bump when the game arrives on PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>It will also be fascinating to see how the game is catering to the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> hardware, which will be significantly more powerful than the Xbox Series X. Full path tracing is likely off the table even with this spec bump – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/09/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-launch-day-update-adds-full-ray-tracing-on-pc/">though it is supported on PC</a> – but with the recent announcement of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/27/forza-horizon-5-ps5-release-date-set-for-april-22nd-launching-alongside-horizon-realms-update/">Forza Horizon 5 for PS5</a>, Playground Games is able to feature ray-traced car reflections during races and free roam, which was not possible on Series X. Some kind of visual uplift could certainly be on the cards for Indy.</p>

<p>Either way, this game should be on many a PS5-owner’s wish list. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is a great adaptation that defies the expectations of gun-heavy Uncharted-alike in favour of something more considered and true to the films. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/06/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review/">our review</a> I said, “Indiana Jones and the Great Circle forges its own, distinctive path as an archeological adventure, excellently capturing the feel of the films with its visuals and performances. There’s a fun new story here as well, wrapped around its blend of exploration, puzzles and pugilism.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-is-a-narrative-driven-game-where-you-decide-how-much-you-want-to-know/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>MercurySteam continues to share new details about Blades of Fire. In the span of a couple of weeks, we got the <a href="https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-is-a-new-action-adventure-from-mercurysteam-out-on-may-22/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reveal</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-will-focus-strictly-on-weapons-and-your-skills-instead-of-magic-and-rpg-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new info</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-detailed-requirements-upscaled-4k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">detailed PC system requirements</a>,&nbsp;<span><a href="https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-gets-lots-of-new-gameplay-footage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and new gameplay footage</a>, and now there's a fresh interview with Gamereactor in which studio co-founder and game director Enric Alvarez <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/video/724323/Forging+a+New+World+-+Blades+of+Fire+Interview+with+Enric+Alvarez/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discussed</a> the narrative structure. While a very narrative-driven game, Blades of Fire also provides the player with agency over</span>&nbsp;how much they really want to know about this world and its characters.</p>
<p><em>It might not look like it because of the freedom the game gives you, but it's a strongly narrative-driven game, and characters are the most important thing. Because you don't have a good story without good characters. So, when writing the story, we wanted to have a certain exposed narrative through cutscenes, other characters, etc., but we also wanted to have a kind of organic narrative, depending on how proactive you are. </em></p>
<p><em>The curiosity will drive you through important bits of the story. For example, there's two mechanics that you can talk to Adso anytime. One mechanic is, okay, tell me what you know about the mission you're accomplishing. And they will tell you vague stuff because they don't know everything about that. So, you, as a player, will know what they know.</em></p>
<p><em>And there's a second layer, which is, I want to talk about specific topics to Adso. You can stop at any time and say, hey, Adso, tell me about the forgers. Tell me about the hammers. Tell me about the master forgers, or about this castle, or about this new character we just found. All this requires your curiosity and active participation. There's a lot of narrative delivered in this way. I think between both, we have something quite cohesive and interesting.</em></p>
<p><em>In Blades of Fire, most of the story doesn't come for you. You have to go for it. You have to actively pursue wanting to know more. You'll find quite crazy characters in this game that will give you a different perspective on what's going on in the game and many surprises.</em></p>
<p>This new fantasy action/adventure game by MercurySteam is slated to launch in two months and a half, going live on May 22 for PC (only on the Epic Games Store), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

            <p>Konami is hosting a dedicated Silent Hill showcase later this week.</p>
<p>Silent Hill Transmission, as it is known, will take place in two days time, on 13th March at 10pm UK time.</p>
<p>"This Transmission will uncover <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>," Konami wrote on social media. "Excited to finally be able to share what we've been cooking," added the game's director <a href="https://x.com/QQBert/status/1899287454160716275">Al Yang</a>. </p>

<p>Silent Hill f, you may recall, will be the first new mainline game for the series in over a decade. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-f-announced-from-resident-evil-reverse-developer">It was initially announced back in 2022</a>, with a haunting trailer which will trigger anyone who lives with trypophobia (that's the aversion to the sight of repetitive patterns or clusters of small holes or bumps).</p>
<p>This trailer showed a young girl in what appeared to be rural Japan. As the trailer progressed, she gradually became overcome by flowers, before her face peeled away (shivers and debates delaying breakfast for a little while yet).</p>
<p>As per that initial reveal, Silent Hill f's story will be by Ryukishi07 (who created the When They Cry visual novel series), while its characters and creatures are designed by Kera. The game's producer is Motoi Okamoto, whose name you may recognise from Nintendo. Neobards, meanwhile, is handling the development side of things.</p>

<p>Last year, Konami along with developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">Bloober released the acclaimed Silent Hill 2 remake</a>, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-tops-one-million-copies-sold-in-less-than-a-week">passed a million sales in under a week</a>.</p>
<p>In October, Bloober went on to announce<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-developer-bloober-reveals-next-game-original-sci-fi-horror-cronos-the-new-dawn"> its next game will be an original sci-fi survival horror called Cronos: The New Dawn</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The Diablo IV <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24179278/the-2-2-0-ptr-what-you-need-to-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2.2.0 Public Test Realm (PTR)</a> goes live today for a week, allowing players to test the features that will be available in the next season. By far the most interesting is the fact that after defeating certain bosses, adventurers will be able to claim some of their powers for their own.</p>
<p>Blizzard said this is an attempt to increase build variety. In total, the current plan is that 24 of Sanctuary's bosses will be supported by the feature. Various world bosses, new Apparition Incursion event bosses (see the article for more information), and even Lilith herself are among the diabolical titans offering Boss Powers.</p>
<p>Each of their powers has two effects, a main effect and a modifier effect, that can be activated depending on the Power Slot you equip it to. Players can have up to one primary and three modifier powers active at any one time. The primary boss power you equip will be the star of the show, while the modifiers are designed to enhance your chosen Main Boss Power and take it to new heights.</p>
<p>Here's the full list of the supported Diablo IV bosses and their powers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wandering Death's Chest Beam (obtained after defeating the World Boss Wandering Death)</li>
<li>Ashava's Poison Breath (obtained after defeating the World Boss Ashava)</li>

<li>Harbinger of Hatred's Volley (obtained after defeating the Greater Lair Boss Harbinger of Hatred; must be acquired with difficulty set to Torment I or higher. Requires the Vessel of Hatred expansion)</li>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> head Neil Druckmann has shared more details of the studio's all-new next game, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-announces-all-new-ip-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet was announced at the end of last year</a>, with a trailer which featured a retro futuristic energy and introduced us to Tati Gabrielle's bounty hunter, Jordan A Mun. Other than that, details remained relatively slim on what this game would really be about.</p>
<p>Now, however, Druckmann has shed more light on the studio's sci-fi title, and joked it was a game about religion that will surely get less hate than the divisive The Last of Us Part 2 did on its debut.</p>

</figure>
<p>"With The Last of Us 2, we made certain creative decisions that got us a lot of hate. A lot of people love it, but a lot of people hate that game," Druckman said during a chat with 28 Days Later writer Alex Garland, to which Garland replied: "Who gives a shit."</p>
<p>"Exactly. But the joke is like, you know what, let's do something that people won't care as much about. Let's make a game about faith and religion," Druckmann quipped.</p>
<p>The Naughty Dog head revealed he has been working on Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet for four years now, and confirmed the upcoming release won't be set on Earth. "It takes place 2000 years in an alternate future that deviates in the late 80s," he shared.</p>
<p>"So there is not only in this alternate history timeline, we've made this -  where the where the timeline deviates - this new religion becomes pretty prominent and then we spend years just building out this religion like from the original prophet all the way [to] how it gets like changed and sometimes bastardised and evolves over all these years."</p>

</figure>
<p>Druckmann stated "this whole religion takes place on this one planet", which in December was revealed to be called Sempiria. "And then at one point all communication stops from this planet and you're playing a bounty hunter that's chasing her bounty and she crash lands on this planet," he continued, noting that while he "wanted to make a game about faith and religion" he also wanted to tackle themes of isolation and loneliness.</p>
<p>"So many of the previous games we've done there's always like an ally with you," he said. "I really want you to be lost in a place that you're really confused about what happened here, [about] who are the people here, what was their history and in order to get off this planet like - again no one has been heard from this planet for 600 years - so if you ever have hoped to have a chance to get off you have to figure out what happened here."</p>

<p>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet is in development for PS5.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/pirate-yakuza-hawaii-impressions-review-majima<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I get asked a lot what it is I like about <em>Yakuza</em>, and I usually start with how much I enjoy kicking bicycles into people's faces, move on to its love for Japanese urban spaces and their sense of place, then wind up with some appreciation for its soap opera storytelling. Sometimes that will prompt a follow-up along the lines of "those are some very different things", to which I can reply "yes, that's the <em>point</em>".</p><p><em>Yakuza </em>is a series built on its contradictions. Yes, it's a hilarious adventure through a heavily-fictionalised Japanese underworld, as a cast of losers and misfits find themselves in the most ridiculous scenarios imaginable, from underground fights against giant tigers to street battles against lubed-up sex predators.</p><p>But at the same time, between and throughout those moments, it's also one of the most sincere video game franchises on the planet. Some <em>real shit</em> goes down over the course of a 100-hour <em>Yakuza </em>game, including genuine, heartfelt attempts at exploring fatherhood, fraternity and what it means to belong to something and defend those you love.</p><p>There's even contradiction in the series' gameplay. Sombre walks through rain-soaked streets can give way to bruising fistfights against a band of thugs at breakneck speed, and ten minutes after fighting for your life in a cinematic rooftop battle you can be inside an arcade playing <em>Virtual On</em>.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Like A Dragon Pirate Yakuza: official musical number opening" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BswWPFDcdlI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>I had an adverse physical reaction to this musical intro</figcaption></figure></div><p>None of these things on their own are what makes <em>Yakuza </em>great. It's the duality itself that defines the series. The dumb stuff is so good because it stands in such stark contrast to all the heavy stuff, and moments of sincerity hit you so hard because your emotional guard can be down after 45 minutes of remote-control car racing.</p><p>I basically said much of this already last year<a href="https://aftermath.site/yakuzas-tv-adaptation-does-the-only-thing-it-can-do" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> when discussing the series' live-action Amazon adaptation</a>, which tries some interesting things when it comes to <em>Yakuza's</em> timeline, but ultimately failed because:</p><blockquote><p>...the straight-laced sitting alongside (and being frequently punctuated by) the absurd, is what makes Yakuza Yakuza. Kiryu isn't Kiryu if he's not splitting his time between grimly serious dialogue and a batting cage. So seeing him portrayed as he is in this TV series, with only the drama, is like seeing yin without yang, light without shadow. He's only half a man, and this is only half a show.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Now here we are just a few months later and I'm about to say the same things about a new game in the series. From the vibes to the setting to the fact we’re playing (in that particular setting) as longtime fan favourite Goro Majima, nearly everything about <em>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii </em>felt off from the moment it was first announced. Matt Elliott's review for <em>Eurogamer</em><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em> </em>nailed the questionable energy</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Even the choice of protagonist—the pleasantly unhinged Goro Majima - a man who, right now, you’re probably imagining screaming, stabbing, or both - speaks to a heightened sense of throwaway irreverence. It's the sort of concept people who don't play Yakuza probably think series obsessives would love, when, actually, all we want is to try all the different whiskies at a sunakku bar in the Champion District.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>That paragraph basically nails the <em>Pirate Yakuza</em> experience for me. The whole game feels slightly off, like it was pitched by someone who had never actually played a <em>Yakuza </em>game but had wet their finger, stuck it in the air and tried to gauge the series' appeal from the thinnest of breezes coming from the general direction of the series’ fandom. Yeah, the game is full of gags and wild shit and bombastic sequences, but you can't just do <em>anything </em>weird and pass it off as <em>Yakuza </em>when the series has two decades of a very specific <em>kind </em>of weirdness.</p><p>Goro Majima has existed throughout the <em>Yakuza </em>series as a foil to Kazuma Kiryu. They're an inseparable duo, right down to the fact we had to play as both of them in prequel <em>Yakuza 0</em> to get their full story. They're Batman and The Joker, Abbott and Costello. Majima's craziness works when it's in contrast<a href="https://aftermath.site/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-spoilers-kazuma-kiryu-ending" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> to the stoic Kiryu</a>, but even alone, his craziness works within the context of his character. His origin story, explored in<em> Yakuza 0</em>, is tragic, and his later years, where his life's meaning as part of the Yakuza has been taken away from him, are painfully melancholy. His bio is "crazy guy" in only the most reductive way; Majima is such a wonderful character because he's crazy in spite of everything, not just <em>because</em>.</p><p>In this game, though? He's got a very convenient case of amnesia, so for most of the storyline all that context goes right out the window. He spends the bulk of <em>Pirate Yakuza</em> as a cardboard cutout, a "hey guys, look how wacky Goro Majima is, he's a pirate captain wearing stupid clothes in 2025!" schtick in ways the game somehow manages to explain, but can never actually make <em>work</em>. He's all joke, no brakes, and the whole game feels paper-thin as a result.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii - Minato Girls Sidequest FULL WALKTHROUGH | Part 2" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j49I-m7ulsA?start=2161&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>The series' recent dips into creepy FMV sequences enter a fresh hell in Pirate Yakuza</figcaption></figure></div><p>Even when it tries (and fails) to more seriously examine Majima and his past, there's just no gravity in this game. It's the outline of a <em>Yakuza </em>game with none of the depth, a series of bullet points being ticked--outfits, check; diversions, check; combat, check--as though <em>Pirate Yakuza</em> wasn't an actual part of the series, but was something being made by someone else, tracing over it.</p><p>I'm not saying this is a <em>bad video game</em>. <em>Yakuza </em>is nothing if not dependable, so there is the scaffolding of the series experience here if that's solely what you're into: lots of gags, punishing melee combat, retro video games, some baseball. The highlight of all the diversions, though, is actually its surprisingly detailed naval combat, harking back to <em>Assassin's Creed Black Flag</em> and its combination of ship-to-ship battles that can culminate with a brawl on the deck. Only here you also have machine guns.</p><p>But it is a bad <em>Yakuza </em>game. This series is no stranger to spinoffs, but even the worst of them--like <em>Dead Souls</em>--have always had some trace of <em>Yakuza </em>energy to them. The most successful deviations, the <em>Judgment </em>series, are probably the best example of what has gone wrong here: They showed it was gangland drama and a cityscape that was key to the appeal of <em>Yakuza</em>, not any one character or storyline in particular. <em>Pirate Yakuza's</em> reversal of that--casting a series stalwart in a novelty location and cranking the absurdity levels to max--feels like a prank game, only the joke doesn't land.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/luffy-one-piece-lakers"><h3>Luffy Would Never Be On My Starting Five</h3></a><p>The king of the pirates would not run point on any basketball team.

                <p>Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann revealed some more narrative details about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet/" data-ref-id="5000-654981">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a> in Creator to Creator discussion with Civil War director Alex Garland.</p><p>The studio behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/uncharted-legacy-of-thieves-collection/" data-ref-id="5000-537795">Uncharted</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-last-of-us/" data-ref-id="5000-125470">The Last of Us</a> revealed Intergalactic, a brand new sci-fi game meant to kickstart a franchise, at The Game Awards 2024. That announcement trailer revealed a fair bit about Intergalactic's premise, namely that it follows a bounty hunter who gets standard on the distant planet of Sempiria. Ahead of season 2 of the popular The Last of Us TV show, Druckmann appeared on Sony's Creators to Creators podcast for a discussion with film director Alex Garland, who is promoting the upcoming film 28 Years Later. Toward the end of the conversation, Druckmann revealed more about the universe Intergalactic is set in and Naughty Dog's goals with the project.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJUab499PVA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iJUab499PVA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Druckmann highlights that Intergalactic will be "a game about faith and religion" and is set around 2000 years in the future in a universe that diverged from our own in the 1980s. He reveals that Naughty Dog has created 2000 years of history for the religion of Sempiria, which has been cut off from communication with the rest of the galaxy for the last 600 years prior to the start of the game. He also explained how Naughty Dog wants players to feel lonely and lost in a place whose people and history are mysterious to them.</p><p>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet is in development for PS5 but does not have a release window at this time. Druckmann admits that the Naughty Dog "still have a ways to go" in developing the game and he doesn't have a clear idea of the final form Intergalactic will take just yet, so don't expect it to release soon.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Sony is testing out new AI software, and it's using a beloved character--Aloy from the Horizon series--to show it off.</p><p dir="ltr">A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-RJ7O9Tqf4">YouTube video</a> narrated by Sharwin Raghoebardajal--a software engineering director at Sony Interactive Entertainment who focuses on gaming tech, AI, and face technology for the Advanced Technology Group within Sony's PlayStation Studios--appeared online last week, giving players a look at an AI-ified version of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/horizon-zero-dawn/">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/horizon-forbidden-west/">Horizon Forbidden West</a>'s main character, Aloy.</p><p dir="ltr">Raghoebardajal verbally interacts with Aloy throughout the video, starting off by greeting her and asking how she's been doing.</p><p dir="ltr">"Hello, I'm managing alright," AI-Aloy replies flatly. "Just dealing with a sore throat. How have you been?"</p><p dir="ltr">Raghoebardajal then proceeds to ask Aloy if she's willing to discuss events that have taken place in the Horizon franchise, like her search for her mother.</p><p dir="ltr">"Certainly," Aloy says, replying to Raghoebardajal's request for info with all the well-acted intonation of a TikTok text-to-speech video. "I discovered I'm a clone of Dr. Elizabeth Sobeck, which allowed me to understand my purpose and origins."</p><p dir="ltr">When asked what it's like to be a clone, Aloy replies with nightmare-inducing mouth animations, saying, "Being a clone feels unique, connecting me to the past while allowing me to create my own path and future."</p><p dir="ltr">Eventually, Raghoebardajal requests that Aloy take him into the game world.</p><p dir="ltr">"Sure, we'll transition to the game world now, get ready for the adventure ahead," Aloy replies in a tone so un-emotive it's rather hard to believe any sort of adventure awaits.</p><p dir="ltr">The screen goes black, then transitions to Horizon Forbidden West. Raghoebardajal continues communicating with Aloy in-game, asking her where they are. Using the same expressionless tone she's used for the entire video, Aloy explains that they're at The Scalding Spear, a large settlement near Arrowhand.</p><p dir="ltr">According to Raghoebardajal, AI is being used for Aloy's facial animations, verbal responses, and her voice itself. Notably, the Aloy in this demonstration sounds nothing like Aloy's real-life voice actress, Ashly Burch, who voiced the character in both games. Burch hasn't commented publicly on the demonstration, but has <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ashlyburch/p/Cw-q5DNx7Yw/" rel="nofollow ">historically supported protections against AI</a> for voice actors in video games.</p><p dir="ltr">As this article was being written, the video was removed from YouTube via a copyright strike filed by Muso TNT Ltd., a company that focuses on content protection and anti-piracy efforts in the entertainment industry. The company recently rebranded, and is now known simply as Muso. It's unclear why the video was taken down or if the footage had been leaked and uploaded by a channel not associated with Sony or Raghoebardajal.</p><p dir="ltr">Though the video has been removed, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/626695/sony-playstation-ai-characters-aloy-horizon-forbidden-west-prototype" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge managed to capture a gif</a> of what the demo looked like in action.</p><p dir="ltr">"This is just a glimpse of what is possible," Raghoebardajal said of Aloy's AI demonstration.</p>
