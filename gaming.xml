            <p>Armchair History Interactive would like to you know that their upcoming strategy game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/master-of-command">Master Of Command</a> is full of smart, unforgiving systems. I know that because they emailed RPS saying that our "strategy features often spotlight smart, unforgiving systems".</p>
<p>I imagine several other outlets also received this exact email but this didn't stop me thinking "you know what - they're right! I <em>am</em> strategy-clever and tactics-tough! And what better way to show that than by covering this game, completely of my own volition and with no outside influence from cleverly worded PR emails playing on my sense of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a>-knower's pride. That'll show those fatcats down at the community historical strategy club treasury committee. Who's "making too many explosiony noises during this serious reenactment of the Somme" now, eh?</p>
<p>Truthfully though, I probably would have covered this without the email. It looks suitably grand, and I really dig the idea of a strategy where the management isn't about empires, but the personal journey of your army on campaign. Plus, you get to play uniform dress-up. Here's a trailer.</p>

<p>The game is set during the Seven Years' War, and you'll be managing your army's supplies, soldiers and equipment across the campaign. Lose all your lads, you lose the run. The line from the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2878450/Master_of_Command/">Steam</a> description that really hooked me is this'n:</p>
<blockquote><p>At its core, Master of Command is about the relationship between your army and the world around it. March too far and your men will starve. Rest too long and the enemy will reinforce. Your troops rely on you not just to lead them into battle, but to keep them fed, equipped, and alive long enough to reach the final objective.</p></blockquote>
<p>Don't march on an empty stomach, though. That'd be madness. First, fill your belly with features:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li><strong>Real-Time Tactical Battles:</strong> No turns, no pausing. Engage in historical combat where morale, stamina, terrain, and timing determine the outcome.</li>
<li><strong>Fully Customizable Regiments:</strong> Equip your troops with historical equipment and weapons that affect accuracy, stamina, morale, and more.</li>
<li><strong>Real-Time Campaign:</strong> Choose a region and enter a fully real-time map with fog of war, branching encounters, and a mobile enemy presence.</li>
<li><strong>Persistent Army Management:</strong> Every loss matters. Units gain experience, officers level up, and your choices carry across each region of the campaign.</li>
<li><strong>150 Historical Units:</strong> Recruit from an extensive roster of 18th-century European forces, each with unique stats, roles, and visuals.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Master Of Command is out sometime this year. I'm going to paint all the hats pink, see how those damn fatcats down at the community historical strategy club treasury committee like that one.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/master-of-command-is-a-strategy-game-of-crunchy-musketry-and-total-war-style-battles-that-tells-the-story-of-an-army-not-an-empire]]></content:encoded>

It also, like the old games, includes visual gags in each of its updated levels. But one particular joke spotted in one of the game’s few totally new levels, Waterpark, seems to include a dig at how Activision treated Neversoft and the <em>Guitar Hero</em> franchise. And Iron Galaxy, the studio behind <em>THPS 3+4</em>, says it is going to remove the joke.</p><p>As spotted by fans online, in Waterpark, you can find a trash can containing a box for a fictional game titled “<em>Banjo Champion</em>.” In a Reddit post, one fan shared an image of the Easter egg/joke and insinuated it was Iron Galaxy shitting on Neversoft. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/THPS/comments/1ly2f8i/comment/n2rjhzz/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/THPS/comments/1ly2f8i/comment/n2rjhzz/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This led to a comment from Iron Galaxy denying the poster’s claim</a></span>.</p><p>“We have the utmost respect for anyone who makes games,” said Iron Galaxy on Reddit. “We’re investigating how that got in there in the first place. Thank you to the community for bringing this to our attention, and we’ll be removing that from the environment art in the next update.”</p><p>This prompted a lot of replies from fans asking Iron Galaxy to leave it in, as they didn’t believe it was a joke about Neversoft, but instead a joke about Activision. </p><p><em>Kotaku </em>has contacted Iron Galaxy and Activision for comment. </p><p>When I spotted this box on Waterpark, I assumed it was Iron Galaxy making a joke about how Neversoft, the creators of the <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater </em>series, were forced off the skateboarding franchise around 2005 and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20100216142213/http://www.bingegamer.net/2010/rumor-layoffs-loss-of-guitar-hero-at-neversoft/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100216142213/http://www.bingegamer.net/2010/rumor-layoffs-loss-of-guitar-hero-at-neversoft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">had to develop new <em>Guitar Hero</em> games instead</a></span>. That sounds a lot like how Activision operates in 2025, shoving all of its teams onto its current big cash cow, <em>Call of Duty</em>, and not letting them make their own stuff. Eventually, <em>Guitar Hero</em> sales tanked, and Neversoft was closed in 2014, with its remaining staff shoved into the <em>CoD </em>mines. A sad and frustrating end for a great studio. In this context, the <em>Banjo Champion</em> box in the trash can seems fitting.</p><p> It should also be noted that the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/THPS/comments/ilcj12/these_banjo_champion_guitar_hero_knockoffs_in_the/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/THPS/comments/ilcj12/these_banjo_champion_guitar_hero_knockoffs_in_the/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Banjo Champion </em>box was first seen in<em> THPS 1+2</em></a></span><em>,</em> developed by Vicarious Visions.

                <p dir="ltr">Not even a month after launch, Broken Arrow has received a hefty new update for the real-time strategy game. The patch lets players alter their map size in skirmish and custom lobbies; previously, this was automatically selected by the game. In addition, developer Steel Balalaika Studio has addressed anti-cheat issues.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1604270/view/521970734297251862" rel="nofollow ">Update 1.08</a> for Broken Arrow introduces new PvE scenarios on the Kaliningrad and Ruda maps, for up to three players. Meanwhile, the sprint cooldown for infantry is being slashed in half, down to 30 seconds. Steel Balalaika says it doesn't want to make too many balance changes all at once, so is starting with this alteration.</p><p dir="ltr">As for cheating, there have been over 2,000 players banned in Broken Arrow. However, the developer is investigating possible banishments that were unfairly handed out to people. For instance, Steel Balalaika noted <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1604270/view/537731883551691566" rel="nofollow ">on Steam</a> that players utilizing cheats only in single-player modes could have been banned from multiplayer, since the anti-cheat system can't differentiate between the two.</p><p dir="ltr">Broken Arrow launched on June 19 and costs $50. Per <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1604270/charts/" rel="nofollow ">SteamDB</a>, the RTS game is a top 100 seller on Valve's platform and appears to be averaging a peak of 20,000 concurrent players daily for July. It's a realistic take on the genre, offering a single-player campaign with 19 missions following US and Russian forces. The game also has more than 300 military and tech units to utilize.</p><p dir="ltr">Below are the full patch notes:</p><h3 dir="ltr">Added:</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Added option to change map size in Skirmish and Custom lobbies.

			<p>I’m slowly maneuvering through a neon-lit club that’s been the site of a casualty-heavy shooting alongside another teammate. The music is blasting and the lights are dazzling, but nobody is here save for a few terrified civilians, a handful of armed attackers, and crude piles of innocent bodies on each dancefloor. It’s grim, and I’m tense as I search every room for enemies. I slowly swing a door open…and it swings back towards me to close. I swing it open once more, and it returns back at me yet again. Before I can press the button to open it a third time, it pulls all the way back to reveal a shotgun-toting enemy who was behind it all along, and I laugh and scream as I frantically start shooting take him down. It’s fun and tense, it’s stupid and scary, and it’s Ready or Not.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ready or Not: Weight of the Badge - Console Release Date Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M5eMHPLjBgI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>At face value, Ready or Not is an incredibly serious game. Whether you boot up the single player Commander mode or a co-op lobby, you’re initially tossed into a realistic police station, and given a list of almost two dozen different S.W.A.T. encounters to take on – each one either based on an eerily familiar real-life tragedy, or simply set in the kind of speculative or terrifying circumstance that I would never want to find myself in. It’s easy to see a mission list that includes an active campus shooter level, a club shooting level, and a sex trafficking level and think the game is going out of it’s way to pursue shock value above all else. The game doesn’t just agree that these situations are awful and terrifying, though, but it also smartly acknowledges that the deliverers of justice can be awful and terrifying too.</p>


<p>When you load into a mission, your base objectives are always to rescue every civilian and “bring order to chaos” – this means killing or arresting every armed enemy on the premises. Your only option for securing an innocent life, though, is to yell them down and cuff them as they question what you’re doing in a terrified or confused tone. And while you’re hunting down a primary armed suspect, you’ll encounter questionable activities or environmental details that go strangely ignored by your direct objectives, yet slowly paint a clearer picture of corruption and ignorance that, instead of feeling like shock value, rings startlingly true with how cops in America are perceived and behave today.</p>


<p>This helps to provide a lot of nuance to the scenarios, but you can also play with four friends in co-op and watch each other get flung across a hallway by a booby-trapped door. The wild tonal ping-pong that happens when you play Ready or Not in co-op makes for some of the most entertaining multiplayer gaming I’ve dug into all year. Guiding AI companions through slow, narrow corridors is challenging, but nowhere near as engaging as the cops-and-robbers roleplaying that you get with real people. It’s so&nbsp;easy to either lock in and pursue objectives, or slip up and laugh until your belly hurts when a friend messes up or the mission goes south.</p>
<p>There is a staggering amount of hardware at your disposal in Ready or Not that makes it incredibly easy to tackle the same mission a dozen different ways. Besides multiple kinds of primary and secondary weapons to choose from, you’ve got a variety of attachments, scopes, and special gear that can help you lock in a particular specialisation and role. Maybe you want to rock a nimble amount of armour and non-lethal suppression gear. Maybe you want to be the first through every opening with a bullet proof shield. Maybe you just want to shoot the hinges off every door with a shotgun.</p>

<p>The mechanical variety at your disposal can get tripped up while playing on console by an equipment wheel that’s a bit too unwieldy to navigate – with the game’s PC origins, it’s great to see there’s support for keyboard and mouse controls, if you want to circumvent this issue. The UI in general is also just very small for playing on a TV, compared to playing on PC.</p>
<p>A few situations in Ready or Not&nbsp;do bring the experience to a screeching halt, though. As mentioned earlier, playing with AI isn’t nearly as thrilling. At times, they’re almost&nbsp;<em>too</em> competent and can clear out an entire room with the precision of RoboCop before you’ve even realized that room exists. The main single-player Commander mode attempts to add a layer of meta-progression with a squad of partners who you dynamically manage and upgrade as they go on missions, get injured, face failure, and can even die. It’s interesting, but not nearly enough and not all that exciting. Perhaps a roguelike spin on your mission objectives and gear could add a lot to the experience, but as it stands, I had no reason to get attached to the identical gruff old police men the game threw at me.</p>

<p>I also repeatedly faced an awkward moment in each mission where, as you get done exploring the level and have taken care of nearly every objective, there’s always just one more civilian or enemy hiding somewhere. Thus, you’re forced to slowly backtrack through the map to find them – a repetitive task that immediately strips away all tension and often brings the silly co-op fun to a screeching halt. Until one of you rounds the corner and yelps in surprise while firing wildly.</p>
<p>These are minor flaws, though, in what is otherwise an incredibly addictive and punishing co-op thrill ride. Ready or Not is an absolute blast, and the huge variety of levels and equipment provide a feast of equally intense and hilarious co-op possibilities for you and your friends.</p>

<p>In addition to Pokémon Presents</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>YouTuber Nate the Hate has claimed that a Nintendo Direct is due to take place later this month.</p>
<p>Speaking on his latest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYkD9QCBp4Y">podcast episode</a>, Nate states that a Direct will take place after <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> releases on <strong>17th July 2025</strong>. He goes on to stress that he does not know any further details, including specific dates, timings, and potential content.</p>
<p>He does, however, speculate that a Direct could happen in the last week of July, theorising that Nintendo will want to put a new showcase out before its three-month earnings release on <strong>Friday, 1st August 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Here's what he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"What I have been told... There is a Direct this month, so the month of July. But, that Direct will not take place until after Donkey Kong Bananza releases. Beyond that, I have no additional information, I do not have information as to the exact timing at this point.</p>
<p>"If I had to speculate, I would say probably the last week of July because Friday of that week is August 1st, right, which is Nintendo's earning report day. So I could see them having a Direct that week leading to that investor's report."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nate has proven to be reliable in the past, having successfully predicted the exact date on which the Switch 2 announcement trailer would drop. Still, it's worth taking this with a grain of salt regardless. It's a fairly safe estimate, all told, given that Nintendo has often dropped announcements and Directs around the time of its earnings reports.</p>
<p>We also have to keep in mind that we're getting a new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/the-next-pokemon-presents-is-coming-in-july">Pokémon Presents showcase on 22nd July</a>. It wouldn't be completely out of the question for Nintendo to follow up with a proper Direct so soon after, but it's definitely another wrinkle to consider.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest question mark lingering over our heads at the moment is when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> is due to release. The game is scheduled to launch this year, but no specifics have been shared at the time of writing. We're also very keen to learn when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> is due to launch, too.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>11 bit studios has announced a&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>modding competition, and the top prize is a hefty wad of cash, but even if you don't win that, there are other goodies up for grabs.</p>

<p>As revealed on the official&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1601580/view/498325386812199405" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">page</a>, the modding contest will see modders using the&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-2-modding-tool-at-launch" rel="nofollow">modding tools</a>&nbsp;in order to create something that will impress and delight the 11 bit judges. The top prize is a $10,000 cash payout, which ain't too shabby.</p>

<p>Even if you don't nab the top prize, though, there are several other areas you might win in. Other contest categories include Best City Mechanics, Best Frostland Mechanics, Best Graphics, and Best Politics, and the best mod in each of these areas will win a custom AMD Radeon RX 7700 graphics card.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/frostpunk-2-modding-contest-areas.jpg?itok=KZ7Nztlm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/frostpunk-2-modding-contest-areas.jpg?itok=B26iDu7Z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Frostpunk 2</em>'s modding contest wants you to make an unforgettable mod.</figcaption></figure><p>Even if you do happen to win in one of those other categories, you'll still be eligible for the Best Overall Mod category as well, so it's entirely possible that one mod will win two or even three prizes at once.</p>

<p>Three mods will also be the recipients of the contest's Honorable Mentions, which will net those modders an 11-bit "goodie pack", although 11 bit doesn't say what will be contained within those packs.</p>

<p>In terms of rules, you must submit your&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>mod to mod.io, although you can also upload it to the Steam Workshop if you like. You'll need to use the #fp2modcontest hashtag, too. You can check out the full rules for the contest, as well as info on how to enter, <a href="https://mod.io/g/frostpunk2/r/fp2-mod-contest-terms-conditions" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a>.</p>




<p>11 bit says it doesn't matter if you've already uploaded your mod; any mod is eligible, as long as it's uploaded to mod.io, it can run with the current version of&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2</em>, and it doesn't contain "harassment, sexual/erotic, or otherwise inappropriate content".</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the world of&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2</em>, 11 bit revealed back in February that the game will be coming to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-2-console-summer-roadmap" rel="nofollow">sometime this summer</a>, although we still don't have a release date for those versions yet, unfortunately.</p>

<p>For now,&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>is available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1601580/Frostpunk_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, and it's also part of PC Game Pass. The modding contest is open right now, and it runs until August 22nd, with the winners being announced by the start of September. While you wait, you can check out our own Andrew's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/frostpunk-2-review-balance-resources-or-city-will-burn" rel="nofollow">review of the game here</a>.</p>

Deep beneath the smog of a plausibly denied planetoid, there lurks a space hulk full of dessicated hand monsters, shorn dreadlocks and long-emptied Pulse Rifles. The vessel mostly lies silent, but every so often, an ancient server deep within the core crackles awake, beaming an ominous signal far out into the void, and the chitinous corridors come alive with flamethrowers and squelchy stabbing noises and oh, so much screaming. Also, the coveted chirping of Steam achievements.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The vessel in question is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/aliens-vs-predator">Alien Vs Predator</a>. Not Rebellion's original three-way <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> from 1999, mind, but the 2010 threequel which people derided at the time, but which is clearly some gradation of Good Video Game in that a few of those people are still playing it, 15 years later. 
</p>
<p>
This weekend, the supposedly dead game enjoyed a sudden Steam playercount bounce to around five thousand concurrent players, care of a community-run server. Many were motivated by the desire to earn one of the game's rarest Steam achievements, The Six Pack, which requires you to play a ranked match with six Steam friends. That a whopping 2.2% of players have earned this to date suggests (out of context) that the original AVP multiplayer scene died on its arse rather quickly. So it's nice that <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/10680">somebody's coordinating efforts to boost the numbers</a>. We'll make it to 3.0 someday. Perhaps in another 15 years.
</p>
<p>
I'm writing this up partly because it's evidence of the good that can happen when publishers take steps <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/70-of-games-with-online-requirements-are-doomed-according-to-stop-killing-games-survey">to ensure that their online games can be played after the cessation of official support</a>. And partly, I'm writing it up because it's nice to revisit Rebellion's Alien games. The 1999 game was a frantic pressure-cooker shooter with excellent lighting, in that you generally couldn't see the Aliens until you flash-bulbed them with muzzle fire. It also featured many lovely adaptations of the film sets, which you could clamber all over as a sticky-fingered xenomorph. It didn't do nearly as good a job with the Predators, but then again, there has never been a good Predator game. You know I speak truth, Yautja lovers. Fight me.
</p>
<p>
The 2010 game has been much shat-upon. In our review, Alec Meer (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-aliens-vs-predator">witheringly summed it up</a> as "not a terrible singleplayer shooter", "just a very ordinary one", adding that the multiplayer almost saves it: "when a couple of adept players are stalking random panickers like myself, this really threatens to be the game we hoped it would be." I was similarly unenamored when I reviewed the game for some magazine or other, but the community drive for Six Pack achievements has me yearning for the dropship.
</p>
<p>
The Six Pack initiative seems to have prompted a wave of Overwhelmingly Positive Steam reviews. I was tickled by the one that objects that the game should more properly be called "Marines vs Aliens vs Predator". I like the implication that human players of Aliens vs Predator - which I estimate covers about about 70% of you, based on the wording and tenor of the average RPS comment - are in danger of feeling left out. Also, Marines aren't a species, but don't let that stop you launching a Change.org petition. While you're at it, see if you can get Godzilla vs Kong retitled Godzilla vs Kong vs Commuters.

This guy wants to save everyone he can, and the movie makes a point of showing him going to great lengths to protect the people and animals of Earth. One of the standout moments in the movie is when Clark, in the midst of a much bigger battle, saves a small squirrel. Superman doesn’t trade lives. Everyone is worth saving, whether they’re a person or a little rodent. He initially does this because a damaged message from his parents, recorded before they sent him from his doomed home planet of Krypton, seemed to instruct him to be humanity’s protector. But once the message was repaired, it’s revealed that, in this version of events, Clark was sent to the planet to rule over it like a dictator. Nevertheless, he makes his own decision to commit to the mission he started: to be humanity’s protector. But he’s not “of this world,” so Lex Luthor and his ilk conspire against our hero and use propaganda to try and turn the public on him. That’s pretty much the immigrant experience in America.</p><p>The core conflict of <em>Superman </em>is refreshingly simple. Clark cannot fathom how geopolitics could be more important to <em>anyone</em> than saving the lives of innocent people. An early interview between him and Lois Lane escalates because she repeatedly pokes at him for not saving people “the right” way. This principle extends to him stopping the country of Boravia from invading its neighbor, Jarhanpur. Though these places are fictional, the parallels between these events and the real-world conflict between Israel and Palestine aren’t subtle. Some debate whether or not this was actually Gunn’s intention or if it’s merely happenstance that the film’s geopolitical conflict mirrors a real one, but that hasn’t stopped people from taking this to mean the movie is pro-Palestine or, more specifically, anti-Israel.</p><p>As <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://comicbookclublive.com/2025/07/13/is-superman-about-the-israeli-palestinian-conflict/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://comicbookclublive.com/2025/07/13/is-superman-about-the-israeli-palestinian-conflict/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some critics have pointed out</a></span>, <em>Superman </em>could very well be about Palestine, but it could also be about Ukraine. The truth is the film’s fictional framing is non-descript enough that it can be interpreted as being about many things. My cynical read is that it could give DC some plausible deniability to talk about these kinds of conflicts without having to make a big public statement, but whatever the authorial intent is, the fact that viewers are coming away from it wholeheartedly believing that it is “political” speaks to the truth of its story. It’s emboldening to those who want the world to be better, and uncomfortable for those who think things are just fine as they are. Lex Luthor is willing to spread lies, put people in danger, and even kill innocent people to maintain his power. Superman, having been on the receiving end of a torrent of abuse and distrust, still wants to believe in people, rather than falling into cynical detachment. When Lois asks how he can still think everyone he meets is “beautiful” after everything he’s been through, Clark says believing in people, even after you’ve been let down, is “punk rock.” If that’s “too political” for you, then that sounds like a you problem. </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/superman-israel-palestine-woke-clark-kent-punk-rock-1851786212]]></content:encoded>

Reviews were mixed for the title, though fans of the animated cartoon will likely find something to enjoy about the simple adventure. What makes this version compelling, however, is the exclusive Gnome Plush.</p><p>Each bundle comes with one of two different gnomes, making it a fun surprise for young Bluey fans. While the video game is available on most consoles, this bundle is limited to Nintendo Switch (though it's fully playable on Switch 2).

But since the adventure is quite short, consider pairing your Bluey game and gnome with some other Bluey merch. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bluey-Seasons-One-Three-Blu-ray/dp/B0DFWKTXTD?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bluey: Seasons 1-3 (Blu-ray)</a> is also on sale for just $26 (was $50), which happens to be its lowest price of all time.

            <p>Xbox's principle development lead for its graphics department has put out a LinkedIn post announcing some new job opportunities. The catch? He used a cringey AI-generated graphic to do so, drawing ire.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7349539853866344449/">Mike Matsel's weekend post </a>calls for those experienced with "device drivers, GPU performance, or related validation or engineering system experience". The attached image shows a lady typing away on a computer, with the text displayed on the back of the monitor. Brilliant.</p>
<p>This caught traction online and, as you can imagine, responses to this post are quite negative. Alexander Bertram-Powell wrote: "Appreciate this preview of the care and attention to detail that make you a leader", while Danylo S followed up with: "First layoffs, then post for hire with AI slop, wonderful work, Xbox".</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-penny-farthing-is-alive-and-well-in-2025.1243074/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I wasn’t very happy when I lived in Washington DC. After The Washington Post <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/washington-post-is-closing-launcher-its-highly-regarded-video-game-website" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shut down</a> its video games desk Launcher, two months after I moved to town to run it, I felt lost and angry. I felt stuck: in a lease in a city I didn’t want to live in, in a job that had its upsides but simply wasn’t the one I’d overhauled my life for. Determined not to let my situation ruin my sobriety, and with most of my friends hundreds of miles away, I channelled all my feelings into riding my bike.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite being a car-centric city, DC and its surrounding areas have an excellent trail system and robust <a href="https://waba.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bike</a> <a href="https://www.thebikehouse.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">culture</a>. I spent my weekends <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cv8VA5IOOib/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">devising</a> <a href="https://x.com/rcmacleod/status/1639772559129313282" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">long</a>, <a href="https://x.com/rcmacleod/status/1644833560811929607" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">aimless</a> loops around town; I joined <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dcbikeparty/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">group rides</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C_T_UzltqOC/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">themed</a> <a href="https://waba.org/event/the-cider-ride/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rides</a> and <a href="https://x.com/rcmacleod/status/1664998270320492545" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">races</a> and one queer-specific meetup full of terrifyingly fit older men in Spandex whom I gamely tagged after in my work pants. I threw myself into bikepacking, jumping from a couple short jaunts along the C&amp;O Canal on a newly-purchased <a href="https://x.com/rcmacleod/status/1642575452639305728" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gravel bike</a> into a three-day loop through <a href="https://x.com/rcmacleod/status/1660665354639507456" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Maryland farmland</a>. After that, if I could think of someplace to go and map out an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cvpr4PFOimJ/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">impractical</a> way to bike there while sleeping in a tent along the way, I went. I did little <a href="https://x.com/rcmacleod/status/1670780212856979457" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">overnights</a> on the C&amp;O and in a sweltering <a href="https://x.com/rcmacleod/status/1673101872880549889" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">campsite</a> off Virginia’s Washington and Old Dominion trail. I wandered through <a href="https://x.com/rcmacleod/status/1678089175050887170" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Virginia gravel</a>; I <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CwyhB2pMBOQ/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biked</a> (and <a href="https://aftermath.site/failing-on-a-bike-trip-taught-me-too-much-about-myself" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">failed</a> to bike) to neighboring towns. I eventually took a train all the way to <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-road-goes-ever-on-and-on" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pittsburgh </a>just so I could spend a week <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CyenHj4tOFH/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biking</a> back, and I still have a list of trips in the area I’d like to tackle even though I’ve moved away.</p><p>One of my more ridiculous dreams during this time was to bike to Frederick, Maryland to see the <a href="https://www.highwheelrace.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Clustered Spires High Wheel Race</a>, a penny farthing race around a few blocks in a small, <a href="https://www.visitfrederick.org/plan-your-visit/about-frederick-county/history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">historic</a> town about 50 miles out of DC. Despite the minimal distance, I could never figure out a reasonable bike route to get there. This didn’t stop me from planning a trip and even reserving a campsite in 2023, but a warning from a colleague who attempted the ride and a mechanical issue on another ride the week before shook my confidence, and I ended up not going. But this weekend, a friend with family in the area agreed to drive me down from New York to finally see the race.&nbsp;</p><figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><span><figure></figure></span></figure><p>The National Clustered Spires High Wheel Race bills itself as “the only race of its kind in America” and “<a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DL2JOVKsIts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the largest high wheel race in the Western hemisphere</a>.” (There are also penny farthing races in <a href="https://www.sweden3days.se/home.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sweden</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/hillingdon-cycle-circuit/the-grand-old-ordinary-race-british-penny-farthing-championship-2024/1298044204225226/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">England</a>.)&nbsp; Started by Frederick couple <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0ILnIKpcKg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eric and Jeanne Rhodes</a> in 2012, 2025 marked its 11th year. The format has changed over the years, and this most recent version had heats of riders competing in timed crits around a .4 mile section of Frederick’s downtown. The two qualifying rounds required riders to do as many laps as possible in 20 minutes, with the top riders going at a half-hour championship through a blisteringly sunny 90+ degree afternoon.</p><p>Rider Chris Meacham of Pennsylvania ultimately <a href="https://results.raceroster.com/v2/en-US/results/gf3bw7vj3zq64bte/results?subEvent=234172&amp;page=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won </a>the men’s division with 24 laps, while Melissa Eisdell, all the way from England, won the women’s division with 21. (The race itself was co-ed; the announcers said that 10 women competed this year out of a field of around 50, the most women who have ever competed.) Meacham told the <a href="https://www.fredericknewspost.com/news/economy_and_business/tourism/thousands-line-downtown-streets-as-high-wheel-racers-fly-past/article_8cbd9af1-3826-5669-92e6-522bf21f2eaa.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Frederick News-Post</a>, “People are so much more excited about this type of bike race than any other bike race I go to… People are freaking out, so that's amazing. It just feels comfortable and safe here.”</p><p>It is, frankly, pretty hard not to freak out when you see a penny farthing in real life instead of an old photograph. The penny farthing was invented in <a href="https://www.highwheelrace.com/high-wheel-bicycles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1871</a> and was basically obsolete by the <a href="https://tnmot.org/collection/penny-farthing-bicycle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">late 1880s</a> thanks to the invention of the bike as we know it today, then called a “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_bicycle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">safety</a>” bike due to how much safer it was than its predecessor. Without the drive train of today’s bikes, the penny farthing gets its speed from the size of its front wheel; the bigger the front wheel, the farther the bike goes with each wheel rotation, so a bigger wheel means a potentially faster bike. When these giant wheels start turning too fast for riders to keep up, they’ll drape their legs over the handlebars to get them out of the way of the spinning pedals, something I saw frequently at the race.</p><figure><video controls="" src="https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2025/07/IMG_6216.mov"></video></figure><p>Those handlebars are one part of what makes the penny farthing so <a href="https://theviewfromadrawbridge.com/2024/01/05/penny-farthings-transportational-death-traps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dangerous</a>. Unlike the bikes we know today, the rider’s entire weight is over that big front wheel; not only do your knees have to clear the handlebars to turn the wheel, but they can make it hard to bail from the bike if you fall. (This led to various <a href="https://www.udcpennyfarthing.com/history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">innovations</a> in handlebars.) Given where the rider is sitting and the design of the bike, a penny farthing is particularly prone to flipping over, called “taking a <a href="https://www.unicycle.com/blog/from-the-velocipede-to-the-modern-penny-farthing-a-history-of-bikes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">header</a>” because riders would launch head-first into the ground. This was a common occurrence in the past, and a potentially fatal one. For a bike that I mostly associate with old-time whimsy, I was horrified to learn how <a href="https://allthatsinteresting.com/bicycle-history/2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">treacherous</a> they are.</p><p>The street fair at the Frederick race included the opportunity to sit on a penny farthing, safely immobilized and mounted via stepladder rather than a notch on the frame that actual riders <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QubZwutTtfM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">use</a> once they get some speed going. I was shy when my friends suggested we sit on the bike for a photo, imagining it was meant for kids, but we drifted into the suspiciously adult-heavy line anyway, where two women were offering to draw handlebar mustaches on those waiting. I waved away the period-appropriate clothing as I climbed onto the bike, still trying to maintain some sense of journalistic distance, but once up there it was hard not to, in Meacham’s words, freak out. Even safely balanced, the bike was <em>very high</em>; I could see over the top of the street fair onto the racetrack, and it was exhilarating how flimsy and exposed the whole thing felt.&nbsp;</p><p>The one bike <a href="https://www.cyclingclassic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">race</a> I did in DC was a frighteningly serious affair, full of expensive racing bikes and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bikedc/comments/13zgp12/why_so_many_crashes_at_armed_forces_cycling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brutal crashes</a> in which I rode my little 80s <a href="https://x.com/rcmacleod/status/1528891151335424001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trek</a> with its upright handlebars, a contrast that caused the race announcer to comment on how happy I looked pedaling along as grimly hunched racers swept past me. The atmosphere of the penny farthing race reminded me of that moment in its combination of frivolity and serious race kit. The common denominator was, of course, penny farthings, which ran the gamut of restored antiques, modern <a href="http://www.hiwheel.com/antique_replicas/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">replicas</a>, and even a few smaller designs. Some racers wore period-appropriate outfits like suspenders, knickerbockers, and waistcoats. Others wore more dramatic costumes, with colorful tights, fake tuxedos, and decorative sunhats or tricorners affixed to their required helmets. Still others wore racing gear, bike shorts and jerseys stuffed with gels and water. One racer <a href="https://www.fredericknewspost.com/news/economy_and_business/tourism/heart-donation-by-one-mans-son-allows-another-to-advocate-from-atop-a-high-wheel/article_8d08a684-0e24-570a-a02e-3dd629aa816e.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wore a jersey</a> for the organ donation organization Donate Life; the father of the rider’s heart donor was among the spectators.&nbsp;</p><figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><span><figure></figure></span></figure><p>But even the silliest-dressed person looked intense and focused as they did their laps. At first, it seemed absurd to see people on penny farthings <a href="https://www.liv-cycling.com/global/campaigns/how-to-draft-on-a-road-bike/21873" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">drafting</a> each other or bending low to be more aerodynamic as they swept around the course. During the final I stood next to a man in an antique wool jersey and tall argyle socks, who told me he was a collector of vintage bikes but had only tried out a penny farthing once, at a prior year’s race, where he fell off and broke two ribs. He explained the unique strategic and physical challenge of racing a penny farthing: due to the bike’s mechanics, there’s not much chance of coming from behind or a dramatic sprint to the finish, so the race is instead a push-and-pull of getting and maintaining a lead and conserving your energy for the duration. It takes a lot of effort just to move and balance the bike, not to mention the fitness required of any bike race. As Meacham told the Frederick News-Post, “Being fit is one thing. Actually handling [the bike] is another."</p><p>But things weren’t all serious: In the intermission between the qualifiers and the finals, there were unicycle tricks, a “low wheel” race where riders raced the tiniest bikes they could find, and a “slow” race where penny farthings tried to go as slow as possible to cross the finish line last. This short, slow race was in many ways more harrowing than the main event, as riders wavered and wrestled gravity, towering above their spotters. The first round of the slow race had to go again when the effort made a rider veer so much that they didn’t travel in a straight enough line.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>During the intermission I explored the perimeter of the course, where downtown Frederick bustled with the crowd. There were food vendors set up on the green outside City Hall, and a soda shop selling race merch and vintage sodas. Beyond just riding my bike, one of my favorite things about my DC-area bike trips was getting to see new towns for the first time, and I scrambled around reading informative history markers and admiring the old architecture. After the race, my friends convinced me not to buy an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbKApkQe2Jk&amp;list=RDnbKApkQe2Jk&amp;start_radio=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">autoharp</a> from a nearby pawn shop, and I failed to convince them to visit the <a href="https://www.visitfrederick.org/listing/national-museum-of-civil-war-medicine/750/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Museum of Civil War Medicine</a>, both of which were probably <a href="https://aftermath.site/civil-war-middle-age" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for the best</a>. We escaped the sun and heat by eating some very good Thai food and browsing a freakishly large antiques store. The racers all appeared to have their afterparty at a brewery off the course, and it was wild to see so many penny farthings lined up in the alley like you’d see any other bikes after a group ride.</p><figure></figure><p>If anything bad came of my day, it’s that I learned that a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESEF6FOhvGQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">small penny farthing</a> can be had for a few hundred bucks, which would make it not impossible for <em>me</em> to take part in the Frederick race next summer. My friends didn’t entirely talk me out of this ridiculous idea when I shared the fruits of my online shopping research in the car back to NYC the next morning, but this plan reminded me of how swiftly my bike-riding time in DC had ramped up into feats that brought me stress as well as happiness. Maybe as a consequence of the years I spent <a href="https://aftermath.site/dry-january-sober-curious" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">drinking</a> about my feelings instead of having them, I’m not very good at just <em>enjoying</em> enjoyable things, instead having a tendency to push their limits rather than just let them be what they are. So hopefully I will <em>not</em> buy a penny farthing of my own (unless you are a reader looking to offload one?..).</p><p>The best thing about the race was the best thing about all of my bike trips: getting out of the grooves of my own head and into the world. Even though I'm back in New York and in a job Jeff Bezos can't dissolve on a whim, I still struggle with feeling stuck sometimes. I still dream of just vanishing into the woods on my bike when the pressures of owning a business and the horrors of the world feel inescapable. Leaving all that behind to learn about some new niche subculture, to see people thriving in a unique world they've made and to get to share it with them, was the perfect antidote for these times, and even worth living my dream via car instead of ridiculous bike journey.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/uma-musume-gacha-horse-racing-anime"><h3>Pretty Girl Horse Racing Game ‘Uma Musume’ Is Engrossing And Weird As Hell</h3></a><p>Breed horse girls to create even better horse girls, so that they can achieve their dream of winning races and performing a concert literally right after</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-disability-pride-last-of-us-forza"><h3>Why Disability Journalism In Games Needs To Evolve Beyond Marketing</h3></a><p>"We’ve conditioned ourselves to believe that we’re all one big happy family"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/outlier-best-mens-pants-indestructible-pants"><h3>All My Pants Are From Outlier Because They Appear To Live Forever</h3></a><p>Outlier makes pants that will survive the abuse of several presidential administrations.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/plushie-lawsuit-emotional-support-chicken-nuggets-what-do-you-meme"><h3>Plushie Maker Suing Over ‘Emotional Support Chicken Nuggets’</h3></a><p>It’s a pretty standard copyright and trademark infringement case, despite being about stuffed chicken nuggets.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/high-wheel-bike-race-frederick]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/krafton-confirms-subnautica-2-leaked-documents-are-real/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/krafton-confirms-leaked-subnautica-2-development-documents-are-real-as-a-way-of-%E2%80%9Cminimizing-speculation%E2%80%9D.1243062/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>If you were making a list of predictions for the video game industry in 2025 back in January, it's doubtful that you would have included a very public and messy battle between developer Unknown Worlds and its parent company, KRAFTON, over the development of Subnautica 2 on that list. </p>



<p>But that's exactly where we are today, as the whole situation has kept getting messier and even more public, with KRAFTON confirming that leaked documents showing the development progress of Subnautica 2 are in fact real. It is confirming the legitimacy of the documents as a measure of "<em>minimizing speculation</em>," it said in a statement to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/in-latest-subnautica-2-twist-krafton-confirms-this-leaked-internal-review-document-is-real">Eurogamer</a> and other outlets. That said, establishing the legitimacy of these documents accomplishes more than 'minimizing speculation.'</p>



<p>To recap, two years ago, and just a couple of years into <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-studio-unknown-worlds-entertainment-acquired-by-krafton-inc/">Unknown Worlds being a KRAFTON subsidiary</a>, everything looked fine from the outside. According to KRAFTON in November 2023, we were going to have a new Subnautica game to play by <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-is-getting-a-new-game-by-june-2025-says-publisher/">June 2025</a>. When Subnautica 2 was properly revealed in <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-launches-next-year-in-early-access-on-pc-and-xbox-will-also-be-on-game-pass/">October 2024</a>, everything seemed on track with the November 2023 prediction.</p>



<p>June 2025 came and went, without Subnautica 2 launching into early access as planned. Everything almost immediately became very messy and very public. </p>



<ul>
<li>On July 2, 2025, <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-developer-unknown-worlds-changes-leadership-krafton/">KRAFTON fired the three co-founders of Unknown Worlds</a>, Charlie Cleveland, Ted Gill, and Max McGuire, replacing them with former <a href="https://wccftech.com/callisto-protocol-devs-next-game-project-titan-cancelled/">Striking Distance Studios</a> head, Steve Papoutsis. <p>KRAFTON offered no explanation for Cleveland, Gill, and McGuire's departure at the time, only <a href="https://krafton.com/en/news/press/krafton-announces-gaming-industry-veteran-steve-papoutsis-as-new-ceo-of-unknown-worlds/">saying</a> that while it "<em>sought to keep the Unknown Worlds' co-founders and original creators of the Subnautica series involved in</em> <em>the game's development, the company wishes them well on their next endeavors</em>." KRAFTON quickly switched to how confident it was in Papoutsis, and added, "<em>There is nothing more important than the gamer experience."</em></p></li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>The next day on July 3, <a href="https://unknownworlds.com/en/news/subnautica-community-letter">Unknown Worlds did its best to reassure concerned fans</a> that Subnautica 2 was still in good hands, and that there was no reason for alarm at the departure of Cleveland, Gill, and McGuire. <br></li>



<li>On July 4, Cleveland <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lryw9o/what_is_a_wave_but_a_thousand_drops/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">published a lengthy statement on social media</a> in which he called his and his co-founders' departure "<em>quite a shock</em>," and claimed that Subnautica 2 was "<em>ready for early access release</em>."<br></li>



<li>Five days later, on July 9, <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-delayed-subnautica-2-2026-reportedly-to-avoid-250-million-bonus-pay/">Bloomberg published a report</a> that claimed Subnautica 2 had been delayed into 2026, which would jeopardize Unknown Worlds' chances of earning a $250 million bonus the studio was promised when KRAFTON acquired Unknown Worlds in 2021, if the team hit certain revenue targets by the end of 2025. <p>To the external viewer, it was easy to speculate that KRAFTON was delaying Subnautica 2 to avoid paying the substantial bonus. Not only had one of the game's lead developers claimed it was ready to launch, but Bloomberg's report also included internal comments from Papoutsis, who allegedly said KRAFTON's reason for the delay was a lack of content, a fairly subjective measure to base the readiness of an early access launch on. Sources Bloomberg spoke to also alleged that hitting the revenue goals required to unlock the bonus were "<em>unattainable</em>" without a 2025 launch for Subnautica 2.</p></li>



<li>Hours after Bloomberg's report, <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-delay-confirmed-krafton-claims-delay-decision-was-not-influenced-by-any-contractual-or-financial-considerations/">the delay was confirmed by Unknown Worlds</a>, which published a statement saying the decision to delay the game was based on feedback it had received during internal playtests. KRAFTON also added that delaying the game "<em>was not influenced by any contractual or financial considerations."</em><br></li>



<li>The next day, on July 10, <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-blames-founders-subnautica-2-delay/">KRAFTON pointed its finger directly at the three co-founders</a>, Cleveland, Gill, and McGuire, blaming them for Subnautica 2's delay, alleging that they had "<em>abandoned</em>" their roles and responsibilities. KRAFTON claimed the three leaders "<em>refused</em>" to do their jobs, and even claimed that Cleveland was prioritizing a personal film project over his day job working at Unknown Worlds. KRAFTON also claimed that the three co-founders were due to get 90% of the aforementioned $250 million bonus, with the remaining 10% divided amongst a portion of the 100 developers working at Unknown Worlds.<br></li>



<li>Later that same day, Cleveland confirmed what seemed inevitable at this point, that he and his fellow co-founders <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lwsxco/lawsuit_a_community_update_from_charlie/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">had filed a lawsuit against KRAFTON</a>. Cleveland also denied any insinuation that he and his co-founders would have kept the $250 million bonus to themselves, saying that the bonus would have been shared with the whole studio, and added that they did the same thing in 2021, sharing the earnings from KRAFTON's purchase of Unknown Worlds with the development team. Jason Schreier, who authored the original Bloomberg report, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3ltpa5br36k2o">added that the suit was for a "<em>breach of contract</em>."</a><br></li>



<li>The next day, on July 11, documents claiming to be part of an internal presentation documenting <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-leaked-document-shows-krafton-delay/">Subnautica 2's development leaked online</a>. The documents showed that, in KRAFTON's eyes, Subnautica 2 was below the "<em>level of polish and market impact required to drive IP growth and expansion.</em>" It also showed that content initially planned for the early access launch had been removed, and overall, dubbed the game as not ready for launch, even in early access. "<em>Due to a gap between the current state and the content volume assumed during the initial planning, it is necessary to reassess the release timeline and roadmap</em>," reads a bolded section on one of the leaked pages.</li>
</ul>



<p>Which brings us to today, July 14, where over the weekend on July 13, KRAFTON confirmed that the leaked documents are in fact real. "<em>KRAFTON is issuing the following statement in response to growing speculation surrounding the development of Subnautica 2,</em>" the company began. "<em>This statement aims to offer clarity and context regarding the current situation</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>The document that has been circulating on social media and reported by various outlets is indeed part of an internal milestone review conducted as part of the Subnautica 2 project. KRAFTON has confirmed that portions of it have been leaked and are now being widely shared across online platforms and within the fan community. KRAFTON recognizes the confusion this has caused. Given these circumstances, KRAFTON has determined that transparent communication is necessary and has chosen to confirm the authenticity of the document. KRAFTON believes that minimizing speculation and ensuring accurate communication with players must take precedence</em>." </p>



<p>"<em>Milestone reviews are conducted regularly in collaboration with KRAFTON's creative studios across all projects. These reviews help assess development progress, define clear objectives, and ensure that each project aligns with KRAFTON's standards in both creativity and quality. This process is central to KRAFTON's commitment to delivering polished, high-quality games at the right time.</em>" KRAFTON ended its statement saying it will "<em>continue working closely with Unknown Worlds to ensure that Subnautica 2 meets the expectations of players who have supported the franchise over the years</em>."</p>



<p>In all of KRAFTON's public comments on this issue, the company has tried to claim that it is centering the player in all of this, and that its goal is always to ensure players are getting the absolute best experience possible, and that KRAFTON is being as transparent as possible with players. </p>



<p>Confirming the legitimacy of these leaked documents backs up what KRAFTON has been saying all along, that Subnautica 2 was not ready to be out this year and that it needed more time. It also potentially helps KRAFTON in both the court of public opinion and the coming lawsuit it faces against Cleveland, Gill, and McGuire. </p>



<p>It remains to be seen whether it can prove the three co-founders "<em>abandoned</em>" their roles, and that the game really wasn't ready to launch, and if players will believe that a massive corporation like KRAFTON is as concerned as it says it is with clear communication with players in all of this. It'll also be interesting to see what Cleveland, Gill, and McGuire's lawsuit is referring to regarding KRAFTON allegedly breaching the contract it had with the three co-founders. So far, at the time of this writing, there has been no word from Cleveland, Gill, and McGuire since KRAFTON confirmed the leaked documents to be authentic.</p>



<p>Needless to say, this story is far from over. We'll continue to update you as more details become public.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Ludeon Studios has released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/rimworld/">RimWorld</a>: Odyssey, a massive new expansion for the sci-fi colony sim. This releases alongside a free 1.6 update that is also available to those who only own the base game.</p><p dir="ltr">Odyssey marks the sixth major expansion for RimWorld and includes a focus on exploration. Players will be able to build their own gravship to travel across the planet and explore new biomes, including the glowforest, the scarlands, the glacial plains, and the lava fields. These new biomes also introduces new landmarks, such as cliffs, fjords, and ancient structures where you can find more resources.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FutmQwQ-O2A" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FutmQwQ-O2A" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The gravship can also take you out of your planet and into space, where there are wrecked orbital platforms, derelict satellites and asteroids to explore and acquire more resources from, though you can expect some dangerous competition from space scavengers and killer mechanoids. You'll also need to ensure your gravship is prepared against the harsh conditions of space, from maintaining power to oxygen pumps to building airlocks to prevent deppressurization.</p><p dir="ltr">Even if you don't pick up the expansion, the Odyssey expansion releases alongside a free 1.6 update that brings with it a sweeping list of quality-of-life changes to the base game, such as a rework of map generation and giving winged animals the ability to fly, as well as performance improvements that will see launch times significantly reduced. A comprehensive list of changes can be found in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRCjqVtPQDFGu4POiKTUd_8o3U2Asdhx99SOvcgU66ABdYtk3Cgndd53yJ6BC4tZX530pp_m6lf4Z9P/pub" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">patch notes</a>. </p><p dir="ltr">You can get the Odyssey expansion at a reduced price at Fanatical. RimWorld's base game is also available at a discount if you haven't yet experienced this complex sci-fi story generator.</p><p><em>GameSpot and Fanatical are both owned by Fandom.</em></p>

If everyone's heads down on Battlefield, there's no one to double back on Battlefront.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Making new content would also be technically difficult because it ended development 5 years ago. Not only would the tooling be out of date, but there may be serious tech debt and flaws in shipping on modern consoles. Making new Star Wars content also might require EA to renegotiate its license with copyright holder Disney. That doesn't seem likely, given that CEO Andrew Wilson has repeatedly stated the company is </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-shutters-battlefield-dev-ridgeline-games-torches-respawn-s-unannounced-star-wars-shooter">moving away from licensed games</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/patch-notes-13-trump-s-video-game-funding-cuts-laid-bare-and-krafton-reportedly-screws-over-the-subnautica-2-dev-team" target="_self" data-discover="true">Patch Notes #13: Trump's video game funding cuts laid bare and Krafton's wild public feud with Subnautica developers</a></p><p>Image via EA/DICE.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That just leaves the question of a hypothetical sequel. GameDiscoverCo founder (and former Game Developer publisher) Simon Carless doesn't think this player surge is enough to sway EA on making another Star Wars Battlefront game. Based on his company's data, he estimated that the game has earned "about $5 million" in gross revenue since May 1st, out of a total of "around $32 million" for its entire lifetime on Steam (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Battlefront II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> only launched on Steam in 2020. It had previously been available on EA's Origin app).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"While it's true that its concurrent users are now giant, it's all via one-off purchases," said Carless. "We'd imagine that EA sees this as good catalogue revenue, but may or may not see it as a reason to make a new game in the series." A new game would likely cost at least $60, and players who bought </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Battlefront II </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">for a few dollars might blink at an expensive successor.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those are the realities of game development in 2025. But thanks to reporting and statements from former developers, we can see how EA failed to adapt to the shifting environment of online games, all because it was laser-focused on financial growth at all cost.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Battlefront II's"><span>Battlefront II's</span> monetization scheme was originally a disaster</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That laser focus on profits-at-all-costs was on display when </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Battlefront II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> first launched in 2017.

            <p>
Following the Federal Bureau of Investigation's widely reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-rom-site-seized-by-fbi-as-companys-crackdown-against-piracy-continues">seizure of pirate ROM site Nsw2u.com last week,</a> the US government agency has confirmed the move was part of an operation that impacted "multiple" targets.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/atlanta/news/fbi-atlanta-seizes-major-video-game-piracy-websites">statement shared on its website</a>, the FBI announced "the seizure of several online criminal marketplaces" that it said had, "for more than four years", provided access to "pirated copies of highly anticipated video games days or weeks before their official release date". It also claimed these websites had seen cumulative downloads of 3.2m in just three months this year - from 28th February and 28th May - resulting "in an estimated loss of $170m".
</p>
<p>
On top of Nsw2u's closure, the FBI says its investigation - performed with the assistance of the Fiscal Information and Investigation Service in the Netherlands - had additionally resulted in authorisation to seize the domain of "multiple" other sites, including nswdl.com, game-2u.com, bigngame.com, ps4pkg.com, ps4pkg.net, and mgnetu.com.
</p>
<p>
"These domains hosted and facilitated access to the pirated video games," it continued. "Anyone visiting these sites will now view a seizure banner that notifies them the domain has been seized by federal authorities."
</p>
<p>
The FBI's operation is just the latest move in an ongoing crackdown against video game piracy. Earlier this year, Nintendo<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-latest-legal-win-against-piracy-significant-for-the-entire-games-industry"> won a legal battle against French file-sharing company Dstorage</a>, meaning European file-sharing companies must now remove illegal copies of games when asked to do so. It also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-emulator-yuzu-shuts-down-as-creator-agrees-to-pay-nintendo-24m">successfully shut down Switch emulator Yuzu</a> last year, after claiming the software facilitated piracy "at a colossal scale".

Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>It’s looking like Nintendo might have a DK-sized addition to its feature film lineup. The company has <a href="https://publicrecords.copyright.gov/detailed-record/rmm_voyager_V01503556900000">filed a copyright notice</a> for a motion picture listed as an “Untitled Donkey Kong Project.” And last month, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa said in <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/qa2506e.pdf">an investors call</a> that the company was working on more movies, explaining that “although we cannot discuss our plans beyond <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> movie at this time, we are working on various other projects.” So even though a Donkey Kong movie isn’t official just yet, it seems likely — and it would make a whole lot of sense for Nintendo.</p><div><p>Nintendo’s current foray into film got off to a great start. It partnered with Universal for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23669598/super-mario-bros-movie-review"><em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em></a>, which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/1/23695720/nintendo-mario-movie-billion-box-office">earned more than $1 billion</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/666569/super-mario-world-movie-sequel-nintendo-universal">currently has a sequel in the works</a>. It was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/671949/nintendo-switch-2-era-risks">a safe bet among a series of safe bets from Nintendo</a>: taking one of the most iconic properties in games and adapting it alongside Universal’s Illumination animation studio, the same team behind family-friendly blockbusters like <em>Minions</em> and <em>Despicable Me</em>. Nintendo used a similar tactic for its foray into theme parks, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23608700/super-nintendo-world-entertainment-miyamoto-takahashi-interview">leading with Mario and the Mushroom Kingdom</a>, and also partnering with Universal.</p></div><p>Things will get trickier from there. While the <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> sequel seems like a fairly safe follow-up, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682751/legend-of-zelda-live-action-movie-date-delay">upcoming adaptation of <em>The Legend of Zelda</em></a> feels much riskier. <em>Zelda</em> games are as popular as they’ve ever been thanks to Switch-era releases <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14787082/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review"><em>Breath of the Wild</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Tears of the Kingdom</em></a>, but taking a beloved fantasy world and translating it into a live-action film is more complicated than an animated Mario movie crafted by an established studio. The casting of Link and Zelda alone will likely bring much more scrutiny than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/17/23645093/super-mario-bros-movie-chris-pratt-mario-voice-nintendo">Chris Pratt’s Mario voice</a>. <em>Zelda</em> director Wes Ball has had some success in the past, most recently with last year’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/10/24152293/kingdom-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-review"><em>Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes</em></a>, but nothing to suggest that the live-action take on Hyrule will be a guaranteed box office success. (And that’s not even factoring <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23668181/super-mario-bros-movie-live-action-revisited">Nintendo’s questionable history with live-action films</a>.)</p><div><p>Given how calculated Nintendo tends to be, balancing out a risky bet like Zelda with a safer one like Donkey Kong makes a lot of sense. And the company has been priming DK for his breakout moment for years now. Not only did the character have a major role in the first <em>Mario Bros.</em> film (voiced by Seth Rogen), but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/11/24293604/super-nintendo-world-theme-park-donkey-kong-country-osaka-date">a DK-themed area was the first expansion for the Super Nintendo World theme park in Osaka</a>. DK is also playing a major role in the launch of the Switch 2. Following the launch title <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/684518/mario-kart-world-review-nintendo-switch-2"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a>, this week’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/703468/donkey-kong-bananza-developer-interview-switch-2"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></a> — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/695726/donkey-kong-bananza-developers-super-mario-odyssey">developed by the same team behind <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em></a> — will be the console’s second significant Nintendo exclusive.</p></div><p>So this really is Donkey Kong’s moment. The original game from 1981 was a pivotal point as Nintendo cemented its space in video games, introducing Mario to the world and also providing a taste of what <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23604504/shigeru-miyamoto-interview-super-nintendo-world">creator Shigeru Miyamoto</a> had in store for the future. Now, a few decades later, DK is playing a different but no less pivotal role in the company’s biggest expansions, whether it’s a theme park or new console — and, just maybe, his own movie.</p></div></div><div><form><div><h2>Installer</h2><p><span>A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></main></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/analysis/706610/donkey-kong-movie-copyright-notice-nintendo-strategy]]></content:encoded>

While the mainline video game series may have <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-z-a-scarlet-violent-sword-shield-switch-2-1851766786&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-z-a-scarlet-violent-sword-shield-switch-2-1851766786">broken from its traditional three-year cycle</a></span>, the trading card game has not, and the run of Gen-IX-led packs comes to an end with this month’s release of Black Bolt and White Flare. Oddly, it’s a celebration of the Unova region, the home of <em>Black</em> and <em>White</em>’s Pokémon, and it’s the English language version’s first ever split set.</p><p>There’s a lot going on here, and little of it makes a great deal of sense. For the last 15 years, there’s been a new mainline <em>Pokémon </em>game from Game Freak every three years. As such, the TCG has followed behind, running three-year cycles adding the new generation of monsters to the mix, and introducing the new wave of Trainers. But without a game this year, and DLC for <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em> having dried up long ago, there’s nothing new for the table-top game to add—hence the re-introduction of Mega Evolution.</p><p>But also, hang on, this is all happening six months early! <em>Sword &amp; Shield</em> didn’t finish until March 2023. Given the lack of a new game, why are we moving on already? I’m so confused. And given this, you might imagine the seemingly last set from the <em>SV</em> era to be a climactic celebration of Gen IX Pokémon, the Paldea region in which the games were set, and the “ex” cards that dominated the game. But nope.</p><h2 id="h340724"><a id=""></a>Wait, this is a <em>Black</em> and <em>White </em>set?</h2><p><em>Sword &amp; Shield</em>’s three years ended with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-crown-zenith-vstar-universe-pull-rates-art-1850005871?_gl=1*1lmmirp*_ga*Nzg4NTQ4NDM0LjE2MjQwMjI5MDc.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTI0ODgzNTUkbzUkZzEkdDE3NTI0OTEwNjAkajYwJGwwJGgw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-crown-zenith-vstar-universe-pull-rates-art-1850005871?_gl=1*1lmmirp*_ga*Nzg4NTQ4NDM0LjE2MjQwMjI5MDc.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTI0ODgzNTUkbzUkZzEkdDE3NTI0OTEwNjAkajYwJGwwJGgw">the fantastic Crown Zenith</a></span>, a special set that was a mighty send-off to the V and V-Star cards and the Galar region, so something similar was expected. Instead, and honestly I’m delighted by it, we have a <em>Black &amp; White</em>-based collection that features all 156 Unova region Pokémon! Bonkers.</p><p>This new set also represents the first time a non-Japanese set is being released in two distinct halves, with specific cards only available in either Black Bolt or White Flare. This is different from when a set releases with two variant Elite Trainer Boxes, as while those have unique extras, the packs within remain identical. Here we’ve got different packs with different cards, found inside different ETBs. Also, because it’s a so-called special set, there are no booster boxes, and no packs sold loose. So, er, yeah, given the current state of the TCG, it’s going to be an absolute nightmare to find anything.</p><p>However, should you find something, there are some stunning cards to pull. We have no idea of pull rates yet (I should have more of an idea later this week when I’ve torn through some early samples), but I’m desperately hoping <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-destined-rivals-review-pull-rates-mewtwo-1851781001&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-destined-rivals-review-pull-rates-mewtwo-1851781001">the more recent trend</a></span> of generosity might continue, even to the point of the glorious stats of Crown Zenith.</p><h2 id="h340725"><a id=""></a>So what’s in Black Bolt and White Flare?</h2><p>Right, hopefully you’re now as utterly confused as the situation requires. Will we see a surprise return from <em>S&amp;V</em> next year? No one knows! But in the meantime, we have this completely inexplicable celebration of <em>Black &amp; White</em> pocket monsters to enjoy. I’ve gone through all the Black Bolt and White Flare cards we know will be in the set to pick out some highlights, the cards you’ll either want to pull because they’re so pretty, or because they’ll fetch the biggest prices. Not all have had an English version released yet, but while the text will change, the art remains identical.</p><p>The set is going to be so daft. Every single basic card will have a regular version, then a reverse holo variant, and then a different Poké Ball reverse holo variant, <em>and then another</em> Master Ball reverse holo version. Anyone looking to complete a master set is going to need to collect 800 cards.

Another weird thing is that it’s almost entirely red. This was a promo in Japan, given away in tournaments and lotteries, making it far more rare. Ours will likely still be a very rare pull, but not quite as obscure. Still though, as a novelty, it’ll attract a lot of attention.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d6cca7a72cc1d603d025be40d82cd6f6" data-recommend-id="image://d6cca7a72cc1d603d025be40d82cd6f6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Zekrom ex Black" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Zekrom ex Black" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d6cca7a72cc1d603d025be40d82cd6f6" data-recommend-id="image://d6cca7a72cc1d603d025be40d82cd6f6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Zekrom ex Black" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>This and the next card are the big two, however.

The first shows Superman and Krypto sitting on the moon looking down at Earth. The second is a goof between Superman and Mister Terrific about trying to patch up Metropolis after the third-act catastrophe. There are no surprising reveals. No teases for new characters and future movies. I thought for sure that Darkseid’s eyes were going to light up from the other side of a pocket universe portal or something.

Their powerful-but-bumbling-but-ultimately-goodhearted shtick is a familiar trope in Gunn’s movies. They are essentially Diet Pepsi <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em>, but nothing in <em>Superman</em> wastes time trying to lay the groundwork for a potential spin-off. They serve clear roles within the plot, have their own little micro-character arcs within the movie, but are mostly kept out of the way. The one exception is Mister Terrific who eventually becomes one of the anchors of the movie. Even then, nothing in <em>Superman </em>seeds the threat of a spin-off. </p><p>At no point do you feel like actor Edi Gathegi is “trying out” for a standalone movie, even though he aces every line, including some really terrible ones, and has the best single action sequence in <em>Superman</em>. It feels like how support characters were always used in the DC animated series, the only successful semblance of a DCU that Warner Bros. ever managed. The <em>Batman</em>,<em> Superman</em>, and <em>Justice League</em> animated series episodes were a tight 22 minutes each, designed to appear on TV out of order on any given afternoon or Saturday morning. The stories were never constructed as launching boards for new reoccurring characters in hopes of launching, for example, a separate <em>Aquaman</em> cartoon. They instead encouraged you to revel in whoever did show up because you  might not ever see them again except as part of the background scenery. </p><p><em>Superman</em> isn’t completely free of the superhero marketing industrial complex which shows like <em>The Boys</em> have successfully mocked for years. There’s a Peacemaker cameo, though it’s brief and simply played for laughs. And we do see<em> Supergirl</em> show up at some point after partying off-planet. Even that tease for the upcoming 2026 movie is tastefully limited and doesn’t sabotage the actual story everyone’s actually showing up to see. It does explain Krypto’s role in <em>Superman</em>, putting a neat, easily ignored bow on what is otherwise the most endearing part of the movie. What the movie doesn’t saddle us with are any throwaway scenes where characters we don’t know or care about mumble things like “Daggett Industries” to help “lay the groundwork” for a <em>Clayface</em> movie. That movie, coming next year, will have to rely on its own merits rather than riding the coattails of a greater DCU to achieve above-average box office success.</p><p> “I do believe that the reason why the movie industry is dying is not because of people not wanting to see movies,” Gunn told <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-features/superman-director-james-gunn-dc-studios-interview-1235356450/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-features/superman-director-james-gunn-dc-studios-interview-1235356450/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Rolling Stone</em> last month</a></span>. “It’s not because of home screens getting so good. The number-one reason is because people are making movies without a finished screenplay.” You can tell the difference in<em> Superman</em>, a movie not labored by rewrites, reshoots, and backbench Marvel talent shuffling. It exists because watching a kind-hearted person protect people from monsters and corporate megalomaniacs is fun and cool and entertaining to watch. Not because it can <em>Moneyball </em>another half-dozen billion-dollar comic book franchises into existence. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/superman-post-credits-james-gunn-dcu-marvel-supergirl-1851786204]]></content:encoded>

                <p>BioShock creator Ken Levine has shed new light on his upcoming next game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/judas-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6531958/" data-ref-id="1100-6531958">Judas</a>. Speaking to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njzERtlBcB0&amp;t=2255s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nightdive's Lawrence Sonntag</a> in a wide-ranging interview, Levine described Judas as being an "old-school" kind of game, adding that it eschews modern trends like online and live service.</p><p>"You buy the game and you get the whole thing. There's no online component, there's no live service, because everything we do is in service of telling the story and transporting the player," he said, as reported by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/bioshock-creator-says-audiences-reward-single-player-games-that-dont-have-other-methods-of-monetization-like-baldurs-gate-3-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-and-clair-obscur-expedition-33/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> What Exactly Is Judas? | Spot On</p>
      </div>
<p>Levine went on to say he doesn't want to "diss" developers who make those kinds of games, noting that they are expensive to make and companies want to see a return on investment. For Levine and his studio Ghost Story Games, the developer said he feels fortunate that company owner Take-Two gives the team freedom. "We're very fortunate to work at a company where they believe in us enough that they say, 'OK, you've been working on this thing for a long time, it's gonna cost a reasonable amount of money, and we're not gonna push any of that stuff on you,'" he said.</p><p>He also cited recent examples of games succeeding in the market that do not contain live-service and major online elements, mentioning titles like Baldur's Gate 3, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, and Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.</p><p>"These are games that are really traditional single-player games, and they don't have that kind of monetization in them, and I think the audiences reward those games, especially in the AAA space because they can get so expensive that people want other methods of monetization," Levine said. "I'm just grateful that we're allowed to not do that because that just frees us to purely design the game for the player's experience."</p><p>Judas was announced years ago, but it still has no release date, or even a release window. The game is in the works for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>It's Levine's first project since BioShock Infinite, which was released in 2013. In 2022, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-03/bioshock-creator-s-next-game-and-its-narrative-legos-in-turmoil" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg reported</a> that the game was originally targeting a 2017 release but has been stuck in "development hell." The report said Levine was given time and creative freedom to realize his vision for Judas, and this "lack of oversight seemed idyllic at first" but ultimately became "detrimental," developers said.</p><p>Mike Snight, who previously worked with Levine at Irrational Games and joined him at Ghost Story, said Levine is a "very hard person to work for." Snight, and half of the original team working on Judas, left the company during development. Levine was reported to have told staffers that the money Take-Two gave to Ghost Story amounted to a "rounding error" for the GTA company, and one analyst, Michael Pachter, said he believes Take-Two will give Levine all the time he needs.</p><p>As for the BioShock series, Take-Two's 2K division is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioshock-4-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6530162/" data-ref-id="1100-6530162">producing a new BioShock game at Cloud Chamber</a>. Levine is not involved at all and the game has no release date.</p>
