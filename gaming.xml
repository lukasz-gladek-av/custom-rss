            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>CD Projekt Red has announced a new <em>Witcher</em> board game. This new entry, <em>The Witcher: Legacy</em>, will be handled by Go On Board, building upon the foundation of their past experience with the license to bring a new narrative-focused board game experience.</p>

<h2><em>The Witcher: Legacy</em> Board Game Announcement</h2>

<p>On its official <a href="https://gamefound.com/en/projects/go-on-board/the-witcher-legacy" rel="nofollow">Gamefound campaign</a> page, Go On Board's own Łukasz Woźniak discusses what players can expect from <em>The Witcher: Legacy </em>board game.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-witcher-legacy-miniature-promo-art.jpg?itok=irb7A2iA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-witcher-legacy-miniature-promo-art.jpg?itok=1KKUuYTM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The game is a story-driven scenario-based experience for one to four players. Each player takes on the role of a witcher from the School of the Wolf after a devastating attack has devastated their home..</p>

<p>Players will battle monsters, train their skills, explore the kingdom of Kedwin, and manage resources, all while tracking down the ones responsible. How will these witchers protect what remains of their legacy? That is for your table to decide. The game's narrative scenarios will feature challenging moral decisions with long-term consequences for your campaign, contributing to its high replayability.</p>

<p>Woźniak also confirms that <em>The Witcher: Legacy</em> will build upon what the design team learned from their last big experience with the franchise, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/witcher-old-world-now-on-kickstarter" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>The Witcher: Old World</em></a>. This Kickstarter success story is similar to <em>Legacy</em>, in that both are prequels set before the time of Geralt of Rivia and focus on witchers facing down monsters in a hostile environment.</p>

<p><em>The Witcher</em> is one of Poland's most popular fantasy franchises ever. What began as a series of novels swiftly shot to mainstream success with three acclaimed action RPGs designed by CD Projekt Red, several crossovers with <em>Soul Calibur</em> and <em>Monster Hunter</em>, and a popular live-action Netflix adaptation. CD Projekt Red has announced both <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/witcher-4-official-reveal" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>The Witcher 4</em></a>, featuring new protagonist, Ciri.</p>

<p>At time of writing, the Gamefound campaign for <em>The Witcher: Legacy</em> hasn't gone live. However, you can follow the campaign and receive updates if you are interested in backing the campaign.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/these-are-the-best-jobs-for-each-bravely-default-hd-character.1263870/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><i>Bravely Default HD</i> offers nearly limitless team customization thanks to its take on the iconic <i>Final Fantasy </i>job system. Want to have a Monk who can cast healing magic to back up the party? You can. Need a dedicated tank to take the hits while wielding two shields? No problem. Maybe your Black Mage could use swords and heavy armor, it’s all up to you! And as it turns out, there’s a <i>very </i>subtle layer of customization underneath that robust job system which might influence the way you build your party.</p> <p><i>Bravely Default </i>follows four main characters throughout its runtime: Tiz, Agnes, Ringabel, and Edea. Each has slightly different base stats, which <i>technically </i>makes certain characters fit select jobs better than others. It doesn’t make a huge difference, as a character’s power will be predominantly determined by their job and their equipment. Still, stats are stats, and what is an RPG if not an exercise in taking every advantage to make your damage numbers as big as possible? Below you’ll find a breakdown of what stats each character excels in, and what that means for how you should build them.</p> <h2>Each characters’ base stats in Bravely Default</h2> <p>Both <i>Bravely Default </i>on the 3DS and the HD Remake on Switch 2 appear to follow the same rules when it comes to each characters’ stats. Here is what each character excels at:</p>

 <p><b>Edea</b>: Highest STR and VIT of the party.<br> <b>Ringabel</b>: Highest DEX and AGI of the party, though his stats are well rounded. INT is also high.<br> <b>Agnès</b>: Highest INT and MND of the party.<br> <b>Tiz</b>: Highest HP of the party. Has high STR, VIT, and MND</p> <p>What do we make of this information? Well, let’s do another breakdown:</p> <figure id="attachment_2000614614" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614614"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614614">© Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p><b>1: Edea is a clear candidate for a physical attacker or tank role.<br> </b><b>2: Agnès is your best source of magic damage</b>. She has an edge as a healer too, though I’d personally say the best defense is a good offense.<br> <b>3: Ringabel is your best Thief or Ninja, but he can be a strong magic attacker as well.</b> Ringabel’s naturally high AGI means he’s slightly more likely to attack before your other party members, particularly in the early game.<br> <strong>4: </strong><b>Tiz can be best thought of as a Paladin, even if you don’t need to build him that way</b>. He’s your best healer if Agnes is already spoken for, and your best tank or physical attacker aside from Edea.</p> <p>Tiz only lags behind the party in INT and AGI, making him <i>almost </i>a near mirror image of Ringabel. Which is fitting, as Edea and Agnès are both also opposites in their stat distribution.</p>

 <h2>The best jobs for each character in Bravely Default (through Chapter 1)</h2> <p><b>Take this section with a grain of salt, for reasons we’ll get into below</b>. But if you’re still early enough in the game where these stat differences will be the most noticeable, consider giving each character any of the following jobs:</p> <p><b>Tiz</b>: White Mage, Knight, Merchant, Monk<br> <b>Agnès</b>: Black Mage, White Mage, Time Mage, Thief<br> <b>Ringabel</b>: Thief, Monk, Black Mage, Spell Fencer<br> <b>Edea: </b>Knight, Spell Fencer, Monk, Merchant</p> <figure id="attachment_2000614615" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614615"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614615">© Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p>Caption: A screenshot of <i>Bravely Default </i>for the Nintendo Switch 2. Tiz, Agnès, and Edea are looking at a Black Knight who has boarded their ship.</p>

 <h2>After the opening hours, don’t limit your job choices to each characters’ role</h2> <p>When you’re still getting your feet wet with the game, your future job choices will likely be determined by the jobs a character has already used. For example, if Agnès is your magic attacker, you’ll likely keep her as a caster so she can seamlessly carry over her spell-slinging prowess to whatever job she equips next. A well balanced party will help a lot early on, but the more jobs you unlock, the more you’ll realize just how the game rewards you for thinking out of the box.</p> <p>Does a party of four black mages sound crazy? Maybe, until you realize the job’s innate Black Resonance ability boosts magic damage for every Black Mage in your party, setting yourself up to potentially nuke bosses into the moon in a single brave-boosted turn. Conversely, you might decide to level up everyone as a Knight so they can learn the Two-Handed ability and tear through random encounters. Heck, if a character masters <i>every </i>job, they can become absolute monsters as a lowly Freelancer thanks to the Late Bloomer ability!</p> <p>All of this is to say that there’s a <i>lot </i>to be gained by experimenting with jobs, even the ones that don’t fit a character’s role. And to restate what was said above, most of a characters’ power will come from their build and not their innate stats. Edea won’t be quite as good of a Black Mage as Agnes, but she won’t feel weak if you decide to build her as one either. So please, <i>please </i>experiment with your job choices as you progress, as you may be surprised by the combos you uncover. And considering just <a href="https://kotaku.com/bravely-default-flying-fairy-switch-2-hd-mini-games-1851784559">how long <i>Bravely Default</i> is</a>, you’ll have plenty of time to level up your party before your journey is over.</p> <hr> <p><i>Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD</i> is available on the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Kadokawa Corporation has recently registered a web domain for Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice Anime. </p>



<p>Talks about a Sekiro anime have been circulating for a very long time; however, the latest development almost seals the deal. The only thing left now is an official announcement, which will also confirm who is involved in the upcoming project. Read more about the Sekiro anime web domain registration below. </p>



<h2 id="h-sekiro-anime-announcement-could-arrive-soon">Sekiro Anime Announcement Could Arrive Soon?</h2>



<p>Spotted on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-web-domain-for-the-long-rumored-sekiro-shadows-die-twice-anime-has-been-registered.1263348/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ResetEra</a> (via <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1953100767453220870" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Wario64</a>), Vestan has posted about the Sekiro Anime web domain registration on the forum. The domain has been registered by Kadokawa Corporation, which is the parent company of FromSoftware, the developers of Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. The domain was registered on July 31, 2025, in Japan, and the name has been set as ‘SEKIRO-ANIME.JP’. It will expire on July 31, 2026. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The leaker has also provided more information about the upcoming Sekiro anime. It appears that a studio called Qzil.la, the creators of Hell’s Paradise, is bringing the Sekiro anime to life. As it is a relatively new studio, the anime adaptation is expected to have a low episode count. Moreover, as the domain has been registered, a reveal could arrive “soonish”. However, as this information doesn’t come from an official source, players should take it with a grain of salt. </p>



<p>In other news, FromSoftware is reportedly in “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fromsoftware-new-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">advanced development</a>” of an unannounced game that is expected to arrive next year. Additionally, Elden Ring’s movie director is likely more skilled at the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-movie-director-better-than-you/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">than most players</a>. What are your thoughts on a Sekiro anime web domain being registered?

                <p>The most traditional input throughout the lifespan of Battlefield has been a controller. While <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield 6 </a>has full support for mouse and keyboard on PC as well as consoles, a majority of the playerbase will head into battle with a controller in their hands. Due to the popularity of controllers, Battlefield 6 offers a wide range of input settings, including some brand-new options that haven't been seen before in the franchise.</p><p>It can get a little daunting trying to go through all of the available controller settings, so if you want to set all of them correctly and head straight into the action, we have you covered. Below, you'll see a list of every major controller setting in Battlefield 6 and what you should be using for those settings.</p><h2>Best controller presets in Battlefield 6</h2><p>For starters, you'll want to head into the "Settings" menu of Battlefield 6, which is done by pressing the cog icon at the top of your screen. Once you're in Settings, go to the Controller section on the left side of the screen.</p><p>This brings you to a large image of your current controller layout. Here, you can choose to "Edit Presets" or "Edit Settings." Choosing to edit your presets allows you to simply go through all six of the available controller schemes and decide what buttons you want assigned for every action in those schemes. You can also "Edit Keybinds" by clicking edit presets, which allows you to change every single keybind within a specific controller scheme individually.</p><p>While you can customize everything to your liking, the simplest way to go about your controller schemes is by using the following presets:</p><ul><li><strong>Controls</strong>: Default</li><li><strong>Buttons</strong>: Alternate</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4544943-386bdfb69134c736d1188a83789bd073.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4544943" data-ratio="0.558984375" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4544943-386bdfb69134c736d1188a83789bd073.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4544943"></a><figcaption>The basic controller settings menu in Battlefield 6</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4544943-386bdfb69134c736d1188a83789bd073.jpg"></figure><p>By going with the "Alternate" buttons preset, you're swapping some key actions on your controller. The Alternate preset makes it so your Melee button is now assigned to B/Circle and your Crouch/Prone button is assigned to the right joystick on the "Soldier" controller scheme. This has always been the most popular way to play first-person shooters, but you can, of course, switch this back to default if that's what you're used to.</p><p>However, you really don't want to switch back to default in the "Vehicles" and "Aircraft" schemes. By swapping these to the "Alternate" preset, you change the left joystick to turn/yaw left and right instead of moving backward and forward. This makes it much easier to control aircraft and ground vehicles in Battlefield 6, and should result in you crashing less.</p><p>The other schemes can also be set to the "Alternate" buttons preset, but they're not as important.</p><p>Once you're done switching your presets, you can now press "Edit Settings," which launches you into an entirely new section of your controller options.</p><h2>Best control settings in Battlefield 6</h2><p>After clicking "Edit Settings," you can click on "Control Settings" in each of the different sections. Specifically, you want to click Control Settings within the "Infantry" section, as this changes how your character moves, aims, and shoots in Battlefield 6.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4544955-f641fa1cb2992114ffd16b99f5cd1792.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4544955" data-ratio="0.561863743148" data-width="2554" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4544955-f641fa1cb2992114ffd16b99f5cd1792.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4544955"></a><figcaption>The Control Schemes menu</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4544955-f641fa1cb2992114ffd16b99f5cd1792.jpg"></figure><p>In the Infantry Control Settings menu, you can change your aiming sensitivity, field of view, aim assist, and general movement settings.

                <p>The Battlefield franchise has always been known for its high-quality graphics, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield 6</a> is no different. From what we've seen so far, PCs will be pushed to their limits, and a high frame rate might be difficult to achieve if you're not using the best graphics settings.</p><p>Fortunately, that's where we come in. We'll be listing off every single one of the PC graphics settings in Battlefield 6 and letting you know what you should set each one to. This will not only give you a great-looking game, but it will also allow you to play at a high FPS and get the most out of your PC.</p><h2>Best graphics settings in Battlefield 6</h2><p>To get started with your graphics settings, go to the main menu screen in Battlefield 6 and click on the cog icon at the top of the screen. From here, click the "Graphics" section on the left side of the screen.</p><p>Here, you'll be able to change around all of the general graphics settings, including choosing what resolution you play at and which monitor Battlefield 6 appears on. These settings are going to be more personal for every player, but you can find a list of our best settings for the general graphics menu below:</p><p><strong>Graphics</strong></p><ul><li>Graphics Quality: Custom</li><li>Brightness: 50-60</li><li>Sharpness: 75</li></ul><p><strong>Camera</strong></p><ul><li>Field of View: 105-110</li><li>Vehicle 3rd Person Field of View: 83</li><li>Weapon Field of View: Wide</li><li>World Motion Blur: 0</li><li>Weapon Motion Blur: 0</li><li>Camera Shake Amount: 20</li><li>Chromatic Aberration: Off</li><li>Vignette: Off</li><li>Film Grain: Off</li></ul><p><strong>Display</strong></p><ul><li>Fullscreen Mode: Borderless or Fullscreen</li><li>Fullscreen Device: Your preferred monitor</li><li>Fullscreen Resolution: Your preferred resolution from the monitor you're using</li><li>Aspect Ratio: Auto</li><li>Refresh Rate: Maximum Hz of your monitor</li><li>Vertical Sync: Off</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4544975-fe83912e6fb099ad597a10f9cb79e849.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4544975" data-ratio="0.56360078277886" data-width="2555" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4544975-fe83912e6fb099ad597a10f9cb79e849.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4544975"></a><figcaption>The main graphics settings menu in Battlefield 6</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4544975-fe83912e6fb099ad597a10f9cb79e849.jpg"></figure><p>There are other sections further down in the graphics menu, but they only relate to your HUD. Change them as you see fit, but they can be left alone for the most part.</p><p>Moving on, if you scroll back up to the Graphics section of the menu, you can click on "GRAPHICS" to modify each individual setting. This allows you to raise or lower the graphical fidelity of Battlefield 6 by changing settings that have a high or low impact on your PC's performance.</p><p>You can see a full list of these settings and what they should be set to below:</p><p><strong>Graphic Settings </strong></p><ul><li>Texture Quality: High</li><li>Texture Filtering: High</li><li>Mesh Quality: Low</li><li>Terrain Quality: Medium</li><li>Undergrowth Quality: Low</li><li>Effects Quality: Low</li><li>Volumetric Quality: Low</li><li>Lighting Quality: Low</li><li>Local Light &amp; Shadow Quality: Low</li><li>Sun Shadow Quality: Low</li><li>Shadow Filtering: PCF</li><li>Reflection Quality: Low</li><li>Screen Space Reflections: Off</li><li>Post Processing Quality: Low</li><li>Screen Space AO &amp; GI: Off</li><li>High Fidelity Objects Amount: Medium</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4544976-68cd1e35a19f117f41bbf8a7aa12c02e.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4544976" data-ratio="0.55660847880299" data-width="2005" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4544976-68cd1e35a19f117f41bbf8a7aa12c02e.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4544976"></a><figcaption>Customizing the individual graphics settings</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4544976-68cd1e35a19f117f41bbf8a7aa12c02e.jpg"></figure><p>Naturally, if you want the most frames per second possible, then just set every single setting to its lowest value. Our settings will still give you a decent frame rate, but they also keep your game's graphical fidelity high so you can see objects and enemies more clearly.</p><p>Finally, back out of the "GRAPHICS" settings and look right below the "Brightness" and "Sharpness" settings in the graphics menu. Here, you'll see an option called "ADVANCED." Click on it and you'll be brought to a new menu where you can change your upscaling and other performance options. Look below for the optimal settings in this menu:</p><p><strong>Advanced Settings</strong></p><ul><li>Fixed Resolution Scale: 100</li><li>Frame Rate Limiter: On and set to your maximum refresh rate (160,144, 240, etc.)</li><li>Nvidia Reflex Low Latency: Enabled + Boost</li><li>Upscaling Technique: DLSS for Nvidia users / FSR for AMD users</li><li>Upscaling Quality: Quality for better visuals, Performance/Ultra Performance for the highest FPS</li><li>Nvidia Frame Generation: Off (adds too much input lag)</li><li>Future Frame Rendering: Off</li><li>Performance Overlay: Off</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4544977-b736cb8b816eb2eee044551e3d5dc719.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4544977" data-ratio="0.56281800391389" data-width="2555" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4544977-b736cb8b816eb2eee044551e3d5dc719.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4544977"></a><figcaption>Going through the upscaling options in Battlefield 6</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4544977-b736cb8b816eb2eee044551e3d5dc719.jpg"></figure><p>Your choice of upscaling depends on your graphics card's brand and whether you want to run Battlefield 6 at a native resolution. You can also run Nvidia Frame Generation if you have a capable RTX GPU, but the added input lag is noticeable, so you'll have to decide if the extra frames are worth it.</p><p>With that, we've covered every available graphics setting.

              <p><span>Sometimes you hear about something and realize the trajectory of your life could have completely changed if one thing had happened differently. Or, I guess in this case, two things had happened differently. For years now, there’s been a story circulating online in </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>spaces about Nintendo of America allegedly asking Game Freak to give Pikachu, the lovable little yellow guy who would go on to become one of the most prominent pop culture mascots of all time, human-like breasts when bringing </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>over to the west. If that had happened, the world would be different, and I probably wouldn’t have a job here at </span><i><span>Kotaku </span></i><span>because I would have likely never been allowed near </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>as a child and gone on to become hyperfixated on the rest of nerd culture. This story has </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1mbg8nc/til_that_when_pok%C3%A9mon_was_being_localised_for_the/"><span>been disputed</span></a><span> because of what some deemed a questionable translation, but Japanese outlet </span><a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/07/29/155531.html"><i><span>Game*Spark</span></i></a><span> went looking and found the original interview and it sounds like, yeah, someone at Nintendo wanted Pikachu to have giant bazongas to appeal to Americans.</span></p> <p><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-of-america-really-did-suggest-giving-pikachu-large-feminine-breasts-at-one-point-japanese-media-confirms/"><i><span>Automaton</span></i><span>’s</span></a><span> translation breaks down the findings and the translation disputes. The </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180731153121/https:/www.nintendo.co.jp/nom/0007/taidan1/page03.html"><span>25-year-old interview</span></a><span> with Pokémon Company CEO Tsunekazu Ishihara includes a story about how Nintendo of America thought that Pikachu and company were “too cute” and might need a redesign to appeal to Americans’ edgy sensibilities. Pikachu’s redesign was described as “a tabby cat with huge breasts,” similar to what you might see in the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical </span><i><span>Cats</span></i><span>, but the Japanese word “mune” is used here, which can be used to refer to either pronounced pecs or the presumed mommy milkers, which led to the aforementioned dispute. However, when the interviewer asked if this design was “like those girls who do Pikachu cosplays at anime conventions,” Ishihara said, “Yes, exactly.”&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Ishihara said that it was an interesting thought experiment and made him appreciate the cultural differences between the Eastern and Western audiences, but he thankfully turned down the design, we got the little yellow guy unchanged, and </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>still became a cultural phenomenon over here. That’s not to say that monster taming franchises can’t also have sexualized designs and be successful. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/digmon-story-time-stranger-preview-pokemon-pc-ps5-xbox-1851784677"><i><span>Digimon</span></i></a> <span>has several humanoid monsters like Angemon and Angewomon that appeal to people looking for that, but </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>’s longevity is tied to how timeless its characters are and how every new generation of kids can jump into it from anywhere. That certainly hasn’t stopped them from creating humanoid Pokémon over the years, but the visual identity of those characters has remained child-appropriate. The franchise already had to weather enough bullshit from people trying to paint it as </span><a href="https://filmschoolrejects.com/pokemon-satanic-panic/"><span>some kind of gateway to evil</span></a><span>. Imagine if it was also having to fight against parents accusing it of trying to corrupt children’s minds with sexual imagery. </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/70p101/til_that_a_40second_sequence_of_james_showing_off/"><span>Good thing that never happened, right</span></a><span>?</span></p>

<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza Ending" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9824329e3a075/donkey-kong-bananza-ending.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>From the moment Nintendo revealed Pauline's presence in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, I knew one thing for certain: I was going to be writing a feature on the DK timeline in the next two months.</p>
<p>Look, you know I love Bananza. DK and Pauline have such a wholesome little relationship, I adored hearing the same senile rant from Cranky on each and every layer, and the little nods to the great ape's previous endeavours were perfectly balanced. It felt like a wall-to-wall celebration of all things DK while also serving as an introduction to the modern age of 3D platforming for one of Nintendo's oldest characters.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4ljokus&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>And then the ending happened. It's a wonderful set piece that I played with the biggest, cheesiest smile on my face, but it, along with the mere presence of a 13-year-old Pauline, throws up a lot of questions about where Bananza sits in the wider canon, and let's be honest here, DK doesn't need that.</p>
<p>If you've stayed with me this far and you think there's a chance I'll make it through the next 800 words without spoiling the end of Donkey Kong Bananza, you are very much mistaken. I'll be talking about the final sequence of Donkey Kong Bananza in depth. Heck, there might even be some screenshots thrown in for good measure.</p>
<p>If you don't want that spoiling (and I'd really recommend seeing it fresh for yourself — it's awesome), then wrap up your reading here and only scroll past the following image when you've seen everything for yourself, <strong>as there are major spoilers below</strong>.</p>

<p>Where was I? Ah yes, the ending!</p>
<p>The final stage of Donkey Kong Bananza finally sees DK and Pauline get back to the latter's home turf on the surface, which is... New Donk City! Yep, the very one seen in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>. There's some more platforming and a boss fight (I've broken it all down in an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/donkey-kong-bananza-ending-explained-is-it-a-prequel-to-mario-odyssey">Ending Explained guide</a>, if you need reminding of the deets), but the tl;dr of it is that NDC returns to its rot-free glory, DK returns to the mines — <a href="https://youtu.be/wJO_vIDZn-I?si=_2rCxvy25prEHc_s&amp;t=4">like Steve, he yearns for them</a> — and Pauline gets to live out her dreams of singing in front of the whole city. Hmm.</p>
<p>That last note got under my skin when I first played through the grand finale, and I haven't been able to shake it in the weeks since. This is <em>Pauline</em>. This is <em>New Donk City</em>. This is <em>singing</em>. Nintendo could have played the riff from 'Jump Up, Superstar!' over the entire sequence, and it wouldn't have made it any more obvious that the game is going, "Look, it's just like that 2017 3D Mario game!! See??"</p>
<p>All these threads come together in a great big Odyssey-shaped signpost, actively encouraging us all to think about the prized plumber's previous platforming exploits and start to question where Bananza fits in around it.</p>
<p>And think about it I did. I was so ready for Bananza to end with Pauline saying something like, "You know what my <em>real</em> dream is, DK? To be mayor of this great city!," but it doesn't. Instead, it ends with an image of a very-much-still-13-years-old Pauline singing on the roof of City Hall (after the post-credits missions, that is), and all of those references to her grandma — which she's been banging on about throughout the game, let's not forget — ringing in your ears.</p>

<p>This isn't the Odyssey prequel that I thought it would be, but instead a <em>sequel</em>. Another child in the Pauline family tree (also called 'Pauline', confusingly), learning to love the giant ape that had caused so much drama for her ancestors. <em>Aw</em>.</p>
<p>No! Not "<em>Aw</em>"! This is exactly why I started this piece in the first place. I have put too much thought and energy into a timeline that, let's admit it, is a load of rubbish.</p>
<p>Don't even get me started on Cranky Kong. We all know that this elderly ape is <em>the</em> DK from the original arcade machine (it's even referenced in one of his Bananza speeches), so what's he doing <em>still</em> up and about all these years later? And what about his son, Donkey Kong Jr? Are we just going to assume that vest-wearing chimp faded away as he headed back to his home planet?</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I can get behind a BS timeline. I know the <strong>Zelda</strong> one more than most and actually enjoy slotting things into it. But at least <strong>Hyrule Historia</strong> is based loosely (and I mean <em>loosely</em>) on the games' narrative events and not solely on "how old is this kid now, do you reckon?"</p>
<p>A Donkey Kong timeline — or, casting the net even wider in this instance, a <em>Mario</em> timeline — is a fool's errand right from the jump because there's almost no narrative to hang things on. Nobody is saying "<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/donkey_kong_country_tropical_freeze">Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze</a> <em>has</em> to come after <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/dk_king_of_swing">DK: King of Swing</a> because you can see DK still riding the high of the Jungle Jam Festival".</p>

<p>And I really want to hammer this home, I <em>love</em> Donkey Kong Bananza, I just don't think that good things necessarily need to be strung up to other good things. I should be relishing in the glow of post-Bananza joy, but instead I'm getting myself wound up over lore that didn't exist until a month ago.</p>
<p>If we're going to keep pretending that the narrative events of DK or Mario matter to the wider pantheon of Nintendo games, at least give us a nicely bound lore book to add to the coffee table. The DK Dictionary? Kong Kompilation? Gorilla Glossary?... I'll work on it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>EA is kicking off its first public beta for <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6</a> tomorrow, and even though the first two days of this weekend's beta is only open to players who were able to grab a code through Twitch or sent out to players that previously signed up to participate in Battlefield Labs, servers for the beta are already starting to fill up, as tens of thousands of players are queued up for the beta ahead of launch.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/tens-of-thousands-of-players-are-queuing-for-the-battlefield-6-beta-ahead-of-this-weeks-launch/">VGC</a>, players on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mj6s2e/the_hype_is_real/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Reddit</a> are sharing that the servers have already been maxed out, and there are thousands more waiting in the queue to get in, which means there are thousands who are keeping their devices on and ready, waiting in the game's lobby for the beta to go live tomorrow.</p>



<p>At least for these coming beta weekends, it seems like EA won't need to use <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-include-bots-servers-arent-full-classic-maps-fan-feedback/">bots to fill the game's servers</a>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Even <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3081410/charts/">SteamDB</a> is showing thousands of users currently in-game with a peak of 24,879 players earlier today. </p>



<p>Pre-loading the beta has been available to players since <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-preload-now-available-matchmaking-skill/">yesterday</a>, and with thousands already chomping at the bit to try out the next entry in the Battlefield series, it's clear that the caption on the above Reddit post is right. The hype is indeed real, for Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>Will it live up to the hype is another question all together. <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-october-10-pre-orders-open-two-open-beta-weekends/">Last week's reveal</a> was a very promising show of the new shooter, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-hands-on-impressions/">Wccftech's Kai Tatsumoto had plenty of positive things to say in his hands-on impressions,</a> saying "<em>this is exactly what I've wanted out of Battlefield multiplayer since the days of Operation Metro and Strike at Karkand. Massive maps with the flow of infantry, tanks, and jets all coordinating in tandem, and the constant chatter of squadmates calling for revives or ammo packs. While I know what I've experience during the multiplayer reveal event is only a small slice of the complete Battlefield 6 package, October 10th can't come soon enough.</em>"</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/everything-you-need-to-know-about-getting-three-star-gold-trophies-in-mario-kart-world.1263819/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>What does it take to “beat” the single player Grand Prix and Knockout Tour modes in <i>Mario Kart World</i>? For some, simply finishing Rainbow Road and rolling the credits is enough to call it a day. For others, maybe you want to get gold trophies in every cup on 150cc, or even <a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-mirror-mode-unlock-free-roam-1851784857">Mirror Mode</a> if you know how to unlock it. But what if that’s not enough? What if you want bragging rights that well and truly signaled to the world “I’ve <i>conquered</i> this?” That’s what your Star Rank is for.</p> <p>In short, your Star Rank is the extra stars you might see next to your gold trophies in both the single-player Grand Prix and Knockout Tour. The better you did during that particular challenge, the more stars you’ll earn (up to a maximum of three). If it sounds straightforward, that’s because… it kind of is. Still, critical details about this system are never explained in-game, so if you’re looking to earn a three-star rank on every cup in single-player mode, here’s what you need to know.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000614605" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614605"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614605">© Nintendo / Timothy Monbleau / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>How do you get three stars in Grand Prix in <i>Mario Kart World</i>?</h2> <p>Similar to past <i>Mario Kart </i>games, your star rank in Grand Prix mode depends on your final point tally at the end of the final race. 54 points gets you one star, 57 points gets you two stars, and 60 points gets you the full three stars. To put that in straightforward terms, <b>getting three stars requires finishing first in all four races of a single cup</b>.</p>

 <h2>How do you get a three-star rank in Knockout Tour in <i>Mario Kart World</i>?</h2> <p>Since Knockout Tour is new to <i>Mario Kart World</i>, the rules here are a little different than the series’ standard Grand Prix mode. In lieu of a proper point system, your Star Rank is instead determined by your position when you pass through each of the checkpoints that kicks out the bottom four players from the race. <b>To get three stars in Knockout Tour, you have to be in first when you pass through each of these checkpoints</b>.</p> <p>Yes, that includes the first one, so you’ll have to dash from 24th to 1st fast!</p> <h2>Your Star Rank in a higher difficulty will count as completion for all previous difficulties as well</h2> <p>If you want to get three stars in every cup in Grand Prix and Knockout Tour modes, your first instinct may be to start from 50cc and work your way up from there. After all, you might as well save the hardest stuff for last, right? Well, if you’re confident enough in your skills to pump up the difficulty ASAP, all Star Ranks are retroactive across all previous difficulties. That is to say, if you get three stars in a cup in 150cc, you’ll see your 50cc and 100cc completion appear as three stars as well. Conversely, if you get three stars in 50cc and only one star in 150cc, your previous record won’t be overwritten.</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-mirror-mode-unlock-free-roam-1851784857"><b>Mirror Mode</b></a><b> also grants retroactive star rankings</b>. This hasn’t been the case in past <i>Mario Kart </i>games, but a Mirror Mode max Star Rank in <i>Mario Kart World </i>will also carry over to 50cc, 100cc, and 150cc if you haven’t already done so. In other words, if you’re trying to get your bragging rights as fast as possible and you think you’re ready for it, you can immediately start in Mirror Mode.</p> <h2>What do you get for getting three stars in every cup in <i>Mario Kart World</i>?</h2> <p>Nothing! Absolutely nothing!</p> <p>I’ve been calling this a bragging right for a reason. Much like <a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-coins-question-marks-outfits-1851784658">most tasks in Free Roam mode</a>, earning a max Star Rank is a challenge that exists for its own sake. This might be disappointing for longtime <i>Kart</i> fans, as previous games would often signify your accomplishment with some kind of reward. But here, you won’t even see a congratulations message for pulling off this feat.</p>

 <h2>Tips for getting three stars in <i>Mario Kart World</i></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614608" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614608"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614608">© Nintendo / Timothy Monbleau / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>If you’d like to press on to get a suite of maxed out Star Ranks despite knowing there is no reward attached, here are a few quick tips to propel yourself into first place (usually).</p> <p><b>1: Practice</b>. It sounds obvious, but the more you know which twists and turns are ahead of you on a track, the better equipped you’ll be to blow past the competition without slamming headfirst into a wall. The Time Trial mode comes equipped with ghosts for each track that you can study, and if you’re feeling adventurous <b>you can load the ghost data of whoever holds the world record in a track too.</b></p>

 <p><b>2: Focus on getting coins at the start. </b><a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-coins-vehicles-speed-power-up-unlock-1851785020">The more coins you have, the faster you’ll go</a>. And the faster you’ll go, you’ll… I don’t need to explain why going fast matters in a racing game, right? You can stop going out of your way for coins once you have 10-15, and by the final lap you should focus on cutting tight corners as you approach the finish line.</p> <p><b>3: Prioritize shortcuts</b>. This is especially important for Knockout Tour, as you’ll need to make up a lot of ground to go from 24th to 1st before hitting the first checkpoint. Fortunately, players in a lower place will get better items from item boxes, and the first item you’ll usually get in Knockout Tour is a Mushroom (or something else that boosts your speed). Look for any turns that you can speed right across, and don’t be afraid to hold your item if it means waiting for that right moment.</p>

 <p><b>4: Manage your items</b>. As mentioned above, racers further back will get better items. And if you’re on a tear blazing past the competition with three red shells around you, you might want to use them strategically to specifically target opponents you can’t catch. Alternatively, you might want to hold at second so you don’t get targeted by a Blue Shell. Conversely, once you’re in 1st, the name of the game is defense. Shells and feathers can prevent you from taking a hit from red shells, and the Superhorn can break Blue Shells before they hit you. Try to have at least one defensive item ready at all times.</p> <p><b>5: Be patient. </b>No matter how good you are or how well you race, you can and <i>will </i>fail to get a three-star rank simply because you got hit with the wrong items at the wrong time. After all, <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/mario-karted">there’s a reason the term “Mario Karted” is common internet slang</a>. It can be incredibly frustrating and defeating when it happens, so just accept that a few bouts of impossibly bad luck are just going to happen and give it a try another time.</p> <p>Remember, this challenge only exists for fun, and you should probably take a break if you’re not enjoying it. Take some time to <a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-coin-farming-tips-vehicles-unlock-1851784093">grind coins</a> or <a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-clips-stunts-rewind-wall-1851783907">pull off some super cool stunts</a>, and come back to it when you feel ready. Getting three stars wouldn’t be a bragging right if there was nothing to brag about!</p>

Each player controls an interstellar alliance of three unique factions drawn from a pool of 40 distinct options. This creates an asymmetric suite of abilities that informs and influences strategy. Utilizing a selection of multi-use cards, players explore new systems, settle planets, research advanced technologies, and build shiny galactic cruisers. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While quick and sharp, the main focus is on executing tough decisions on how to use cards for either long-term benefits or short-term bursts. The inclusion of a solo mode is also a very nice addition that extends the life of the game. </p></div><p id="ace-of-spades"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Ace of Spades">Ace of Spades</h2></p><div catalogid="e8f12747-5728-4e80-83b6-331bd2f6a37c" id="226508"><div id="226508" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Ace of Spades</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games"><u>Solo gaming</u></a> is not a new concept, but it’s certainly exploded in recent years. Ace of Spades is the latest noteworthy title in this category, allowing a lone player to utilize a hand of cards to battle progressively tougher bosses. On the surface, it looks a lot like the tabletop version of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a>, but a closer gander reveals an interesting card game brimming with identity. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The wild setting helps as you head to Sweet Haven, Arizona seeking vengeance upon a vile necromancer.

The twist here is that the victim tries to form clues from a randomly dealt allotment of cards. These contain symbols and characters of various types, requiring some creative thinking from the murdered participant. You’re given a few minutes to arrange the clue cards how you’d like, using them in conjunction with several suspect cards placed off to the side. The idea is that in the last moments of life, you’ve done what you can to leave a message for those who find you. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">After arranging the murder scene, the victim sprawls out on the table capturing their final position at time of death. The ensuing discussion as people try, often in vain, to tease out the meaning of the scene and decipher the clues can be riotous and engaging. Ultimately, the group guesses the murderer and either succeeds or fails. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a quirky design that absolutely requires the right set of people.

High Tide is the latest to break out in this category, selling out at Gen Con due to its stellar aesthetic and intriguing play. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a small game, easily portable and completely unassuming. But it boasts a surprising amount of depth. Tiles are arranged randomly in a grid and players take turns stacking pieces upon ones that are higher. You may only move your own or neutral tiles, however. It teases out just the right level of strategic thought without tipping over into a cerebral grind.

His previous work, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-imperium-board-game-review"><u>Dune Imperium</u></a>, is a modern classic that has caught on like wildfire in the gaming community. This new release uses a similar concept of bag building as players add various resources to their bag in a strategic bid for developing their company. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The goal is to open train stations and railroad lines across North America, facilitating the delivery of goods to cities in need. The interesting detail is that players can share each other's infrastructure, sending cargo along another participant’s route. Both receive benefits from this cooperation, birthing a more nuanced and fuzzy strategic space. Unlike most games in the train category, Lightning Train is a more approachable design that slots in as a step up from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ticket-to-ride-board-game-buying-guide-and-expansions">Ticket to Ride</a>.</p></div><p id="the-lord-of-the-rings-fate-of-the-f"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="The Lord of the Rings: Fate of the F">The Lord of the Rings: Fate of the Fellowship</h2></p><div catalogid="e8f12747-5728-4e80-83b6-331bd2f6a37c" id="226511"><div id="226511" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Lord of the Rings: Fate of the Fellowship</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pandemic-board-game-buying-guide"><u>Pandemic</u></a> has dozens of spinoff games at this point, and The Lord of the Rings: Fate of the Fellowship appears to be just another iteration on Matt Leacock’s modern classic. That is not the case. This new design does contain some faint indicators of that previous game’s DNA, but it’s so much more than that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a rich adventure game where players cooperate to take the One Ring to Mount Doom while evading the attention of Sauron. It’s part tower defense, with players recruiting Free World troops to battle invading Orcs and Southrons, and it’s part stealth thriller as Frodo must constantly sneak past armies and Nazgul. This is a tense affair, and it’s far more detailed and thematic than expected. In fact, it barely feels like a Pandemic property at all, which may take some people by surprise.

This latest version of the system is pared down to a straightforward and approachable core game that retains the interesting card play of its predecessor. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of the elements have been simplified, and it’s easier than ever to introduce this game to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-beginner-board-games">beginners</a> and non-hobbyist of any age. The magic resides in the game’s module system. Multiple add-ons exist that can be inserted to layer on sub-systems for flight, dinosaurs, and environments. This slightly increases the complexity, while boosting the strategic potential. A huge boon is that it changes up the feel of each session, and allows North Star Games to expand this properly infinitely. Nature is poised to have the longest legs of any game in the Evolution line.</p></div><p id="star-wars-battle-of-hoth"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Star Wars: Battle of Hoth">Star Wars: Battle of Hoth</h2></p><div catalogid="e8f12747-5728-4e80-83b6-331bd2f6a37c" id="226513"><div id="226513" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Star Wars: Battle of Hoth</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Battle of Hoth was the most talked about game heading into Gen Con.

Players take on the role of either the contingent of Imperial AT-ATs and snowtroopers, or the Rebel soldiers holding the line in order to protect the planet’s shield generator. Each takes turns playing cards from their hand to activate one portion of the battlefield, choosing from a selection of units occupying that flank. This restriction of the card system is a hallmark of the Memoir series, forcing tough decisions with only a modicum of rules overhead. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While this is a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games">wargame</a> of sorts, it’s also a very streamlined and rules-light design. It’s a dramatic game, full of dice rolling and big moments where units are scattered and lines are broken. The Star Wars backdrop only helps.</p></div><p id="spooktacular"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Spooktacular">Spooktacular</h2></p><div catalogid="e8f12747-5728-4e80-83b6-331bd2f6a37c" id="226514"><div id="226514" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Spooktacular</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">During the 1986 Spooktacular horror film festival, a freak accident occurs involving a lightning strike and a little bit of mystery.

Players take on the roles of movie monsters animated from the screen, competing to scare and devour guests. Each of the 20 included monsters is unique, featuring its own suite of abilities and cards.

It seems the crowds of Gen Con agreed, as this game was everywhere. This is a fully cooperative adventure where players crash land on an uncharted planet and must navigate its many mysteries in order to fulfill a collective mission. While this was clearly designed in the tradition of modern narrative adventure games, it goes about things its own way, massively improving on the pre-existing approach. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For one, it’s not a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-campaign-board-games">campaign game</a>. Each individual session has a complete arc, which makes it far more approachable for most groups. It also does away with narrow objectives requiring players head to specific locations. Instead, many of the missions may be fulfilled in numerous ways. This highlights the game’s focus on creativity and freedom, allowing you to wander and explore whatever catches your eye. Finally, the mysteries of the world are special and worthy of the effort required. This is a fantastic game, and it was the closest thing to a singular standout title of the convention. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Charlie Theel is a tabletop games freelancer.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-studio-head-weighs-in-on-ethical-ai-use.1263786/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>InXile Entertainment’s next game is the first-person steampunk RPG <a href="https://kotaku.com/everything-we-saw-at-xboxs-big-summer-2025-showcase-1851784007"><i>Clockwork Revolution</i></a>. Studio founder Brian Fargo, who’s leading the project, recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjeRn2eA3y4">sat down with YouTuber MrMattyPlays</a> for a deep-dive interview about his long career and his take on current hot topics in the video game industry like generative AI and LLM technology, which the Xbox studio’s parent company is currently investing $80 billion in. Has InXile embraced it in a similar fashion? “For certain things, but but I’m very keen to what are the ethical uses of it?” he said. “I am worried about job loss.”</p> <p>Fargo, whose career in games dates back to the 1980s when he worked on influential role-playing games like&nbsp;<em>The Bard’s Tale&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Wasteland</em>, laid out <a href="https://kotaku.com/larian-baldurs-gate-3-nier-automata-ai-chatgpt-1851778257">a couple of different use cases</a> he foresees for tools like ChatGPT, but distinguished them from things like using generative AI to plagiarize the creative output of other artists. “These games…we’re close to about the same word count as the Bible, basically, and so that’s a lot of data no human can get in in its head,” he said. “So would I like an LLM to be able to query: ‘How many times did [inaudible] talk?’ ‘How many times have we used this skill?’ Like there’s some things that I would want to query the information to make sure so I see that.”</p> <p>The veteran studio head said he also uses generative AI for inspiration they way he might visit a museum or scroll through people’s Deviant Art pages, but that only commissioned work is used in the actual production process. Other uses Fargo pointed to were cleaning up motion capture footage and potentially voicing quick pickup lines added to a game at the last minute if the actor agrees to it and is paid extra but is otherwise unable to make it into the studio. That part sounds in line <a href="https://kotaku.com/sag-aftra-strike-voice-actor-game-darth-vader-1851784189">with what SAG-AFTRA members settled on</a> in a new contract after months on strike.</p> <p>“Can we use it for, like, mundane tasks that nobody wants to do so the human creativity can soar?” Fargo said. “Well, I think that’s kind of cool. I don’t think anybody wants to do some of these things. Do we really want humans going through checking for punctuation? You know, I mean, I don’t have it doing it right now, but that would seem like I’d rather have those same people going, ‘I have a great idea to to make this scene far better.’ Like that, I’d rather have the minds thinking about the good stuff.”</p>  <p>While the <em>Clockwork Revolution</em> director wasn’t as hypercritical of AI and the hype around it as some game developers have been, he also came off as more cautious than others within Microsoft, including CEO Satya Nadella. Nadella recently boasted that <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/29/satya-nadella-says-as-much-as-30percent-of-microsoft-code-is-written-by-ai.html">30 percent</a> of Microsoft code is written by AI, and revealed earlier this year that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-05-15/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-on-his-ai-efforts-and-openai-partnership">he uses multiple AI assistants</a> to get him through his day. The company is pushing its use in gaming as well, rolling out models that can <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/introducing-muse-our-first-generative-ai-model-designed-for-gameplay-ideation/">hallucinate gameplay</a> or watch you play games and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/719668/microsoft-xbox-gaming-copilot-windows-game-bar-beta-test">Google tips for them</a>. A Copilot add-on for Xbox is already being tested on PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Black Ops 6 Season 5 update introduces three new multiplayer maps, three new weapons, and adds the final Zombies map for this game. </p>



<p>The star of the show in BO6 Season 5 is the sixth and final Zombies map, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-the-new-black-ops-6-zombies-map-come-out-everything-we-know-about-reckoning/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reckoning</a>. Set in the project Janus headquarters, the towers’ systems are on the verge of total failure, and it’s up to the team to stabilize the Aethor Reactors before the Aetherium leak gets out of hand. </p>



<p>Reckoning features a new Wonder Weapon that alters gravity, a new elite enemy, and adds several other surprises. Let’s jump right into what fans can expect. <br></p>



<h2 id="h-all-black-ops-6-season-5-update-patch-notes">All Black Ops 6 Season 5 Update Patch Notes</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Boxing gloves are a new melee weapon in BO6 Season 5. </figcaption></figure>



<p>Here are the complete Black Ops 6 <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/08/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-05-patch-notes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Season 5 Patch Notes</a>. </p>



<h3 id="h-new-multiplayer-maps">New Multiplayer Maps</h3>



<p><strong>Runway (6v6)</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>A Pantheon mole attempts their escape via the Arzak Provincial Airport. All hell breaks loose as the Rogue Black Ops team pursues one of their final targets. Wreckage and luggage litter the tarmac, flames licking the sides of the terminal and black smoke rising from the fire in the airport control tower.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Exchange (6v6, 2v2)</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Rogue Black Ops pursues a mole attempting to strike a deal in a vibrant Avalon marketplace. Crash the party and unleash havoc on this small-sized three-lane map centered around the Deli, its roof adorned with a marble statue of a mythic sea god.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>World Motor Dynasty (W.M.D.) (6v6)</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>From its inception as a Nova 6 processing laboratory first introduced in the original Call of Duty: Black Ops, W.M.D. returns in a reimagined form as an Italian luxury car manufacturer in Avalon. Trade the snow of the original map for an overcast day around the Autofiorno plant, using your memories of the prior map to help navigate the larger area of operations.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-new-multiplayer-mode">New Multiplayer Mode</h3>



<p><strong>Aim High</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Aim high to survive across a variety of game modes — including Team Deathmatch, Domination, Hardpoint, and Kill Confirmed — where headshots land instant eliminations while full body armor minimizes damage dealt anywhere below the neck. As a bonus, this headshot training is likely to hone your talents when unlocking Weapon Camos.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-new-weapons">New Weapons</h3>



<p><strong>PML 5.5 – LMG (Battle Pass)</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Full-auto light machine gun. Fast rate of fire and high lethality offset by low mobility and hefty recoil.</li>



<li>When a rival Operator is holding the trigger down on the PML 5.56, you’ll know, mainly due to the damage and huge ammunition reserves, mitigated somewhat by a lengthy reload.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>ABR A1 – Assault Rifle (Battle Pass)</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Three-round burst assault rifle. Good handling and power. Moderate recoil and range. Configurable to full auto.</li>



<li>The iconic Assault Rifle returns! With a similar weapon being a fan-favorite staple of the Black Ops series, the ABR A1 combines a high damage output that can drop enemies in tight three-round bursts with a brief pause in-between, almost fast enough to be called automatic.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Boxing Gloves – Melee (In-Season, Event Reward)</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Moderate damage. Fast attack speed. Long range.</li>



<li>Slip on the Boxing Gloves and knock out foes with a swift barrage of jabs and uppercuts.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-new-attachments">New Attachments</h3>



<p><strong>9mm PM Skull Splitter (Two Attachments, Battle Pass)</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Bring the power and precision of a marksman rifle to your favorite pistol with the 9mm PM Skull Splitter Barrel. The Barrel greatly increases damage, especially to the head, reducing rate of fire. Pair with an extended magazine that gives the Operator additional ammo for this weapon at the expense of handling.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>PPSh-41 Helical Magazine (In-Season, Event Reward)</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Fire to the beat of your own drum with this SMG attachment that puts other magazines to shame. Manage heat on this high-ammo count magazine that excels at spraying bullets in close and medium ranges.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-season-5-zombies-update-patch-notes">Black Ops 6 Season 5 Zombies Update Patch Notes</h2>



<h3 id="h-new-map-reckoning">New Map: Reckoning</h3>



<p>Looming over the once-sleepy settlement of Liberty Falls, the Project Janus Headquarters—three edifices known locally as Janus Towers— now teeters on the verge of collapse.</p>



<h3 id="h-new-enemies">New Enemies</h3>



<p><strong>Uber Klaus + Uber Klaus Core</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>The secret Research and Development program of Project Janus appears to have been more evolved than originally thought, developing many more robots in the Klaus Assembly Lab than first anticipated. The greatest of these threats is the Uber Klaus – a murderous automaton encased in a toughened, bulky exoskeleton – that maintains a cocky attitude, lethal efficiency, and super strength, all directed at newly-programmed threats.</li>



<li>Enemy takedown tactics are unknown at this point, though combat is likely to be focused on disrupting the Uber Klaus form’s heavy shielding and avoiding its melee attacks. Once the exoskeleton is broken, the Uber Klaus Core will eject, revealing its second deadly form.</li>



<li>The Uber Klaus Core increases in agility, sacrificing defenses for less lumbering locomotion and flying capabilities thanks to rocket-powered hover boots. It continues to employ energy-based, arm-mounted launchers, while its defensive shield can prevent your incoming attacks.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Kommando Klaus</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Preceded by a strange red mist, these automated enemies have had their higher functions disconnected and self-destruct sequences activated.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-new-wonder-weapon-gorgofex">New Wonder Weapon: Gorgofex</h3>



<p>Latest intel all but confirms Janus Towers may be hiding a new and grotesquely potent Wonder Weapon known as the Gorgofex. Partly charred experimentation notes discovered on microfiche indicate the existence of a “bio-aetheric” armament.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Combining fungal, floral, and insectile traits to deliver precise impact damage and gravity-defying disruption in close quarters, glowing membranes on the weapon show hints of motion and circulation under the surface. The weapon seems to pulse and breathe, with a beating central heart-like organ that “pumps” energy through the weapon. Due to the saturation of Dark Aether and other unknown energies, the weapon is said to emit faint psychic vibrations.</p>



<h3 id="h-new-field-upgrade-mister-peeks">New Field Upgrade: Mister Peeks </h3>



<p>Summon Mister Peeks to our reality to create chaos, as the deadly and distracting bunny busts out the moves and bashes undead brains to a raving disco beat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once Mister Peeks arrives in your hands, throw this hairy helper into the fray, and he gleefully attracts normal and Special enemies and attacks any undead within his wandering radius, savaging foes until they explode in a shower of bright confetti.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Mister Peeks: Major Augments</strong>
<ul>
<li>Dance Party
<ul>
<li>Mister Peeks becomes the life of the party, attracting nearby zombies to him, before he detonates an Aether Pulse to thin out the crowd considerably.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Arcane Fury
<ul>
<li>Mister Peeks has become a master of the elements, enhancing his regular damage with a random Ammo Mod (with an Augment from that Ammo Mod).</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Apex Hunter
<ul>
<li>Mister Peeks focuses all attacks on the strongest nearby enemy other than bosses. For example, Uber Klaus would be targeted over regular foes, with increased damage inflicted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Mister Peeks: Minor Augments&nbsp;</strong>
<ul>
<li>Social Butterfly
<ul>
<li>Increase Mister Peeks’ attraction radius.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Peeks’ Favor
<ul>
<li>Mister Peeks is good to have around Mystery Box locations. Get a free box spin if you’re near one during activation!</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Party Animal
<ul>
<li>Increase Mister Peeks dance duration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

It will be available in late August or early September, according to a FAQ on the DLC's <a href="https://orbxstudios.com/jwarchipelago/faqs/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">website</a>, and will first be available for Microsoft Flight Sim 2024 before later coming to Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxMDu5i9jEE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cxMDu5i9jEE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Players will be able to fly between the five islands and parts of Costa Rica to take on various challenges and tours.

Starting August 11, experiences that get the "Sensitive Issues" label will receive the descriptor on their details page and will be unavailable by default for users under the age of 13, although parents of older teens can choose to enable access if they wish.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The issues, according to the company, involve "current sensitive social, political, and religious" themes.

These issues are topics that are frequently in the news and inspire strong opinions and emotional debate."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a more specific example, the company said that an experience with a core gameplay loop focusing on immigration or border security would qualify, but one that simply includes references to countries and borders would not.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/you-can-still-get-into-this-weekends-battlefield-6-beta-but-youll-have-to-watch-30-minutes-of-those-awful-twitch-people.1263762/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>If you failed to swipe a key for this week's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> beta, because you <em>neither</em> signed up via the Battlefield Labs programme before 31st July <em>nor</em> watched Your Favourite Creators play the game during the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-full-multiplayer-reveal-sees-ea-trying-to-rebottle-the-lightning-of-battlefield-3-and-4">recent multiplayer reveal</a>, then Don't Sweat It, Soldier, because Drill Sergeant EA Have Your Back in the shape of a last-gasp code giveaway. </p>
<p>All you have to do is sign into the EA and Twitch apps, then watch 30 minutes of Your Favourite Creators streaming the game. Unfortunately for me, the suggestion that I watch 30 minutes of anything on Twitch is a grievous insult akin to filling my wineglass with Vimto or farting on my outstretched hand. I hate game streaming and so do you, which is why neither of us will be playing Battlefield 6 this weekend. I will share further details of the giveaway only out of a sense of absolute perversity.
</p>
<p>Here's the specific wording from Drill Sergeant EA.</p>
<blockquote>The first step in participating is logging into your EA and Twitch accounts and linking them HERE. Then, during Battlefield 6 Open Beta Early Access, August 7th &amp; 8th, tune into your favorite creators streaming Battlefield 6 to unlock your own early access code after watching just 30 minutes.* Once you have your Twitch Drops code, visit Battlefield's Code Redemption page and enter the code to get Early Access added to your account. </blockquote>
<p>The little asterisk there is for "while supplies last". Perhaps it's too late, and you'll have to play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/boomtown-rats-transformice">Transformice</a> instead.</p>
<p>These giveaways are business as usual for videogame publishers, but I've found EA's attempts to drive up Twitch engagement with Your Favourite Creators kind of eerie. It's an open effort to cook the numbers and fox Twitch's visibility algorithm. I imagine they don't care whether you actually watch Your Favourite Creators, only that you leave your fingerprints on the client, so why not turn on Twitch, lower the volume and spend 30 minutes ensuring that all of your socks are correctly paired.</p>
<p>If you're a real sucker for punishment, EA are also handing out cosmetics for people who carry on Twitching their Favourite Creators. Here's what you get for time served, with some observations of my own about how your state of mind might escalate in the process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Watch for 1 Hour and, once you have conquered your nausea, you will earn the Mimic Weapons Package</li>
<li>Watch for 2 Hours and, once you have stopped feverishly washing your face, you will earn the Landslide Soldier Skin</li>
<li>Watch for 3 Hours and, once you have stopped cursing the day you were born, you will earn the Shattered Vehicle Skin </li>
<li>Watch for 4 Hours and, once the police have persuaded you to come down from the tree, you will earn the Imperial Soldier Skin</li>
</ul>
<p>Have I mentioned that I really hate game streaming? I'm sorry if you don't, and I'm harshing your buzz. I probably just haven't found the right streamer. Recommendations pls. People who prefer the comforting silence of text might want to read James Archer's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-three-deafening-hours-of-its-multiplayer-battlefield-6-sure-looks-like-a-battlefield-game">Battlefield 6 hands-on thoughts</a> instead. </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-can-still-get-into-this-weekends-battlefield-6-beta-but-youll-have-to-watch-30-minutes-of-those-awful-twitch-people]]></content:encoded>

<p>Activision announced that PC users will have to enable Secure Boot to play Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. </p>



<p>Secure Boot is a Windows 10 and Windows 11 security feature that ensures a PC only loads safe software during startup. Secure Boot enables Activision to detect and remove users of banned third-party devices or other cheating software. </p>



<p>EA also uses the security measure for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-secureboot-not-enabled-error/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a>, and players experienced difficulties because they couldn’t play the game without enabling it. Enabling Secure Boot varies depending on the manufacturer of your PC, which can make it a confusing process. Black Ops 6 players are about to experience the same confusion. </p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-introduces-secure-boot-ahead-of-black-ops-7">Black Ops 6 Introduces Secure Boot Ahead of Black Ops 7</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Black Ops 7 players on PC must enable Secure Boot. Image via Activision </figcaption></figure>



<p>Starting in Black Ops 6 Season 5, which begins on August 7, PC users must have Secure Boot enabled. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/08/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-ricochet-anti-cheat-season-05" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Activision</a> explained, “Secure Boot makes cheating at a hardware level much more difficult, ensuring cleaner PCs at start and allowing for more trusted environments for RICOCHET Anti-Cheat to operate in.” </p>



<p>If you need more information on how to enable Secure Boot, Activision provided a <a href="https://support.activision.com/articles/trusted-platform-module-and-secure-boot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">manual</a> on how to do so. You won’t be able to play BO6 without having the security measure enabled, and that also applies to Black Ops 7, when the upcoming game releases later this year. </p>



<p>In addition, the devs encouraged you to secure your account with email verification and two-factor authentication. Activision also introduced new detection tools targeted at rooting out boosting and teaming in BO6 multiplayer and Warzone Ranked Play, and confirmed that 22 additional individuals responsible for developing and selling cheats were cut off.  </p>



<p>Is Secure Boot enough to cut down on cheating? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/black-ops-7-will-require-secure-boot-to-play.3211/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forum</a>. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-vs-call-of-duty/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-%E2%80%93-activision-leadership-isn%E2%80%99t-worried-about-battlefield-6-because-call-of-duty-is-%E2%80%9Ctoo-big-to-fail%E2%80%9D.1263753/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Insider Gaming has learned that Activision leadership has been taking note of Battlefield 6’s recent hype, but is not worried that the franchise will surpass Call of Duty.</p>



<p>Speaking with sources who wished to remain anonymous because they were not authorised to talk about Activision’s internal conversations, it’s been said that although Activision is keeping a close eye on Battlefield, they are not worried about the game outcompeting its flagship franchise.</p>



<p>It’s said that Activision leadership believes that Call of Duty is “too big to fail” and will remain a profitable, annually released franchise for many years to come. At the time of writing, an annual Call of Duty title is penciled in for the next four years at least.</p>



<p>This year’s Call of Duty title, dubbed ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-revealed-during-xbox-games-showcase-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7</a>‘, is said to be a “strong” title according to those familiar with the game’s plans, despite initial problems in development. </p>



<p>Interestingly enough, this year’s Call of Duty will take place in a slightly futuristic setting similar to Battlefield 6, with both games targeting a similar audience. Whether or not that direct competition will impact Call of Duty is unclear, but at the time of writing, Activision doesn’t think it will.</p>



<p>There’s also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6’s Battle Royale</a> to consider, which is believed to be a free-to-play component to the premium game. If EA can take a considerable chunk out of Call of Duty: Warzone’s playerbase, which has been depleting for the last couple of years, it could have a detrimental impact on Call of Duty’s long-term playerbase.</p>



<p>Call of Duty: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-watch-black-ops-7-reveal-event-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7 is set to get a full reveal</a> at this year’s Opening Night Live on August 19th.</p>



<p>What do you think of Activision not being worried about Battlefield outcompeting Call of Duty? Should they be? Let us know through the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>&nbsp;discussion.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, EA <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-will-shut-down-anthem-in-january">announced it would shut down BioWare's Anthem</a> on January 12, 2026. And now, after a rocky six years for the game, its executive producer Mark Darrah has come forward to share details on exactly how Anthem came to be, and what went wrong in the process.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_QY8F8z_4c" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">part one of a planned multi-part video series</a>, Darrah spends an hour walking viewers through Anthem's development as he understands it from 2011 through the moment he took over as executive producer in 2017. Admittedly, his perspective isn't 100% complete, as Darrah was not working directly on the game throughout much of this time. But as a higher-up at BioWare and eventual executive producer, he was nonetheless positioned to see a lot more than most.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Darrah was only executive producer for the final 16 months of the game's development. Even so, he opens the video by taking ownership of Anthem's failings and struggles:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Some of this video is going to look like I'm trying to shift blame around, but ultimately the responsibility for this game does mostly rest on me," he says. "I have a list of people that I won't share that I also feel share blame on this project. Almost everyone on that list is more senior than me. The team worked really hard on this game, the team put a lot of excellent work on this game, and there are things that are amazing in this game even now."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Darrah goes on to walk through the first six years of development, outlining a number of pitfalls Anthem ran into along the way. He talks about Anthem's original conception at a time within EA where its executives believed single-player games were no longer desirable, leaving BioWare in a challenging position as an historically single-player-focused studio. BioWare lead Casey Hudson's early vision of Anthem, he says, was to do BioWare storytelling in a live service, always online format, and he proposed they come up with a new, never-before-seen business model to do it. That's how Anthem initially got momentum internally among EA's executive leadership. As Darrah puts it, "What if BioWare game, but it could do FIFA numbers?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, early on, Anthem ran into trouble because it struggled to get personnel to actually work on it. At one point, BioWare workers were shown a presentation intended for executives that outlined the game's more live service-y vision, and this put many developers off the idea. Additionally, as BioWare shipped Dragon Age: Inquisition, staff kept being moved to Mass Effect: Andromeda, leaving Anthem without the staff Hudson wanted.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another trouble with Anthem highlighted by Darrah was the repeated shifting of what the game actually was. While the original pitch was to make something wholly unique, Darrah talks about how difficult that actually is when you can't offer reference points to developers or explain it to executives via familiar touchstones. So over time, Anthem did actually become more like familiar games such as Destiny and Borderlands.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>In an early design document, Anthem was going to have six javelins. Where did this number come from? It got pulled out of someone's ass.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">And yet another issue, says Darrah, was the level of secrecy involved. While he acknowledges it's important to keep things locked up to avoid leaks, there's a certain level to which he believes it's good to share details more widely. In the early days, he recalls Hudson would strategically share certain elements of Anthem within the wider organization, which allowed him to create excitement and gather feedback. But when Hudson left, no one stepped into that role, and Anthem became aggressively secretive. As a result, Darrah says, it was easier to hand-wave issues, tailor messaging to a very small group of people who were more susceptible to groupthink.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Darrah also tells a pretty pointed story about how being too specific about expectations too early on can lead to disaster. Here's his full recounting of why Anthem didn't have six javelins when it launched:</p><blockquote>In a pretty early design document, Anthem stated that it was going to have six javelins. Where did this number come from? It basically got pulled out of someone's ass. I guess to be more fair, it was effectively broken down like this: We're going to have light, medium, and heavy javelins, so we're going to have two of each kind...and unfortunately this number, six, got presented in early 2017 to EA executives, that Anthem was going to have six javelins.</blockquote><blockquote>Pretty close to that presentation, the team realized that it couldn't do six javelins, for two primary reasons. One, because it couldn't completely figure out how to differentiate six different kinds of javelins, but also because it realized that it didn't have time to make six entirely different archetypes of gameplay. So now, the team is forced to present that no, in fact they're going to have four javelins at launch, and even though that six was based on nothing, was based on a number we said because it kind of seemed pretty logical at the time, but there's nothing behind that, became a source of immense pressure and anxiety from the executives.</blockquote><blockquote>I wouldn't be surprised to find out that one of the reasons that everything came to a head in 2017, with the massive changes that occurred on the project in 2017, culminating in me taking over the project, I wouldn't be surprised to learn that this was triggered by this change from six javelins to four. Again, that number six was based on nothing, but it was seen as the team falling apart.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Darrah goes on to say that he remembers one of the cut javelins was a tanky paladin javelin that was more of a support class, while the other was a medium-class that he cannot remember at all — highlighting how nebulous the idea was to begin with. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Toward the end of his video, Darrah talks about a push at EA in 2016 for all its AAA franchises to be "billion-dollar franchises", which would have involved Dragon Age releasing a game every two years. This push is also what sealed Anthem's fate as a live service game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Darrah also cites three different occasions where he told leadership he thought they should push Anthem's release date out further, let Anthem define itself more, ship Andromeda first, and then bring Andromeda people over to finish Anthem. All three times, he says, he was turned down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_QY8F8z_4c" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You can watch Darrah's full video here.</a> He says he has at least a part two, and perhaps also a part three planned.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anthem eventually launched in February of 2019 to middling reviews, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/02/21/anthem-review">with our own reviewer giving it a 6.5/10</a> and criticizing the grindiness, lack of polish and variety, and mismatched story.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">RTA in Japan, a well-established charity speedrunning contest, has removed Nintendo games from its upcoming Summer 2025 event, despite showcasing them for the past nine years. This is because they suddenly received a warning from Nintendo about using games without permission. The non-profit hopes to feature Nintendo titles again in future events, likely having to lodge individual applications on a per-game, per-event basis. But why has Nintendo suddenly done this now?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">First held in 2016, RTA in Japan is a charity speedrunning event. Contestants apply to play through all or part of their chosen game, aiming to break records or just smash their personal best in front of an audience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a result, a huge number of games have been featured in previous events, ranging from NES classics to recent titles. Their upcoming event, RTA in Japan Summer 2025, takes place in Tokyo from August 9-15, with proceeds going to Doctors Without Borders (Médecins Sans Frontières). The line-up includes Cuphead, Castlevania Dracula X, Final Fantasy IX, Silent Hill 2 remake and Wattam, to name a few. However, all the Mario and Kirby titles that have been part of the event in previous years are glaringly absent.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/06/gettyimages-2217743482-1754500679089.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Don't expect Nintendo games at Japan's biggest charity speedrunning event. Photo by RICHARD A. BROOKS/AFP via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On August 4, RTA in Japan posted an <a href="https://rtain.jp/rtaij/nintendo/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>official announcement</u></a> on their website, explaining exactly why the Summer 2025 event will not feature any Nintendo titles. According to the announcement, Nintendo pointed out to the non-profit organization on June 13 that “organizations require prior permission to use Nintendo games,” adding that RTA in Japan’s previous use of Nintendo titles was “unauthorized,” as permission was not obtained in advance. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Upon receiving this notification, RTA in Japan began negotiations with Nintendo, in the hopes of using the Japanese game giants’ titles again for future events. As of August 4, it has been decided that RTA in Japan will apply for permission on a per-event, per-game basis, basically having to ask Nintendo every single time one of their contestants wants to play through a game (even if it has been featured at a previous RTA in Japan event). In their announcement, RTA in Japan revealed that they were unable to establish clear guidelines on this process in time for the Summer 2025 event, hence the decision to omit Nintendo titles this time round.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">RTA in Japan also apologized to those who had applied to speedrun Nintendo games for the Summer 2025 and had their hopes dashed. Considering the number of Nintendo titles including classic games like Super Mario 64, in previous RTA in Japan event line-ups, it seems likely that many applicants were disappointed.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">At first glance, this seems like over-protective Nintendo picking on a small charity event. However, the majority of Japanese-speaking users commenting on the matter via Twitter / X took a balanced view of the situation or even sided with Nintendo, with many saying they understood why Nintendo had taken this action now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">RTA in Japan started off as a small, volunteer-run effort. However, over the past few years it has grown into a large public event with major sponsors, and the organizer is now registered as a general incorporated association, with all the bureaucracy and responsibility that brings. The event’s growing prominence is likely what made Nintendo sit up and take notice. Some <a href="https://x.com/wsSe4nneZyMWvW1/status/1952515228874559675" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>commenters</u></a> even said RTA in Japan should have been more responsible and proactively taken measures to ensure that they had Nintendo’s permission to avoid disruption to speedrun events (comments archived on <a href="https://togetter.com/li/2585429" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Togetter</u></a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On a side note, with the Summer 2025 event, RTA in Japan will be doing <a href="https://x.com/englishrestream/status/1949258455589548514" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>restreams of speedruns with English commentary</u></a> for the first time, making the event more accessible to viewers overseas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by RICHARD A.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Tekken spinoff <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tekken-tag-tournament">Tekken Tag Tournament</a> won over a generation of fans not just for coming out alongside the PS2 in the year 2000 (and having an amazing Tekken Bowl minigame built in), but for being a quality Tekken game in its own right. A sequel followed in 2011, but since then Bandai Namco has remained quiet on the prospect of a series return.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But is now the time, given tag fighting games are back in vogue with the likes of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls">Marvel Tokon Fighting Souls</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/invincible-vs">Invincible VS</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/2xko">2XKO</a> in the works, for Tekken Tag Tournament to finally return?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We asked Kohei Ikeda (Nakatsu), game director on Tekken 8, Katsuhiro Harada, Tekken Project director, and Michael Murray, Tekken 8 producer exactly that. Harada’s response makes for interesting reading for fighting game fans. He said, essentially, that a new Tekken Tag Tournament would be too much for casual fighting game fans to contend with because it would force players to learn multiple complex characters and how they work together. And so, it’s far more likely for Tekken Tag Tournament to pop up as a separate mode within a standard Tekken game, should Bandai Namco ever decide to return to it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Back in '99 when I made the original Tag Tournament… each character has so many moves in a 3D fighter, right, compared to these other games that there's so much to learn just for one character,” Harada began.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And then to pair that with two, even though back then in Tag 1, a lot of the characters were called compatible or you'd have versions that look different, but they share a similar type of move list. Whereas the Tekken series progressed, the characters became more unique in their move sets, etc. So it's even more involved to try to learn and master a character, and then another one on top of that. And then when you throw in the combination of the two and your opponent's characters, there's just so much more knowledge that's necessary to enjoy the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So the hardcore, they ate it up, for example, in Tag 2. But for your average player, it was very hard to gain a more casual audience, I guess you could say. So if we were to do it again rather than have a standalone game, it would probably be better to have it as some kind of a separate mode within a normal Tekken franchise, right?”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/06/gettyimages-2221602697-1754482065283.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Harada has thoughts on a potential Tekken Tag Tournament return. Photo by Sia KAMBOU / AFP.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Michael Murray, Tekken 8 producer, chimed in to agree with Harada’s point about tag fighters being harder to learn.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Nakatsu and myself, we probably grew up in the arcades playing while he was making Tag 1, so we really enjoy the game,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I guess we're more on the hardcore side of being able to use several characters and such, and we loved Tag 2. But we are fully aware that there were just so many people that couldn't get a handle on it because of all the knowledge that's involved.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, it seems Tekken Tag Tournament is consigned to history. But Tekken 8 continues. It’s worth reading the interview in full to get an idea of what’s to come, and what Harada and co have up their sleeve for the coming years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

That earlier version of RedOctane was then quickly acquired by Activision (which also ultimately shut it down).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, this new incarnation of RedOctane has been established as part of Embracer, and will be led by Simon Ebejer, who worked as production director on various Guitar Hero titles during the franchise's Neversoft heyday, before later moving on to Vicarious Visions and Blizzard.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"This game won't be Guitar Hero, DJ Hero, Guitar Freaks or Rockband," RedOctane teased in a <a href="https://www.redoctane.games/https/redoctanegamessquarespacecom/news/blog-1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a> today. "This is something new. A rhythm game built with love, by people who care, with the community at its core in this fast-changing modern world we live in. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We firmly believe the expert here is the community and a new generation of development talent, the folks that have kept the lights on these last few years."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Staffed by a mix of new and veteran developers, RedOctane's rhythm project will be overseen by brothers Charles and Kai Huang, founders of the original RedOctane, as part of a special advisory board. Further details on the game, including a name and project release date, currently remain under wraps.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, this isn't the first attempt at a rhythm genre revival. Back in late 2023, Epic Games launched <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fortnite-festival">Fortnite Festival</a>, a Guitar Hero-style mode developed by Harmonix (now a part of Epic) that allowed players to tap along via standard controllers or more recent instrument accesories. The offering is still kept updated with weekly tunes, but has not attracted the same player numbers as Fortnite's main battle royale modes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Music has done extraordinarily well in Fortnite, but ironically, not so much in music games," <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tim-sweeney-says-fortnites-biggest-challenge-is-convincing-people-its-the-everything-game-and-not-just-a-battle-royale">Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney told IGN earlier this year</a>, "more just in Battle Royale and elsewhere.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>MiHoYo has announced plans to cease support for <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/genshin-impact/genshin-impact-review-into-the-great-wide-open">Genshin Impact</a> on PlayStation 4. Furthermore, the game is being delisted from the platform.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.hoyolab.com/article/40408849">blog post</a>, the developer states it is ending support for the popular free-to-play action RPG on PS4 due to “limitations related to hardware performance and platform application size." In layman's terms, it sounds like the game has simply become too big and demanding for Sony's last-generation console to handle anymore. This means that in the near future, Genshin Impact on PS4 will no longer receive any updates, and MiHoYo is beginning the process of sunsetting that version of the game.</p>

<p>MiHoYo details a three-step plan that begins with the game’s removal on PS4, which takes place on September 10. The game will be unavailable to download after this date, but those who have previously downloaded the game will still be able to reinstall it, as it will not disappear from their library. You’ll also still be able to log in and receive update patches until the game is taken completely offline.</p><p>Next, in-game PS4 purchases on the PlayStation Store and the in-game shop will be disabled on February 25, 2026. Items purchased on PSN before this date but not yet claimed in-game can still be obtained, however.&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly, on April 8, 2026, MiHoYo will cease all support for Genshin Impact on PS4. Players will be unable to log into the game, it won’t receive any more updates, and unclaimed items purchased on the PlayStation Store will only be obtainable by logging into the PS5 version.&nbsp;</p><p>The PS5 version of Genshin Impact will be unaffected by this development, and the game supports cross-progression, making it easy to transition to the other platforms the game remains playable on. &nbsp;In addition to PS5, Genshin Impact is available on Xbox Series X/S, PC, iOS, and Android.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/06/genshin-impact-is-being-delisted-on-ps4-as-hoyoverse-plans-to-cease-support]]></content:encoded>
