            <p>The studio-killing fallout of Embracer's acquisition frenzy continues to fall like ash on the industry. The publishing giant has reportedly closed Piranha Bytes, the studio known for cult RPGs like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gothic">Gothic</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/risen">Risen</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elex">Elex</a>, according to a worker who spoke to Polish games site <a href="https://www.cdaction.pl/newsy/piranha-bytes-zamkniete-to-koniec-tworcow-gothica">CD-Action</a>. The studio's existence had been under threat since early this year, after being targeted in Embracer's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embracer-group-to-close-studios-and-cancel-games-as-part-of-restructuring">purgatorial studio massacre</a>. At that time the German studio were hopeful to avoid being closed down, insisting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/piranha-bytes-devs-of-gothic-and-elex-are-next-on-embracers-chopping-block">"don't write us off yet!"</a> Unfortunately, it looks like those who worked at the studio have since been laid off.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The former head of Piranha Bytes, Bj√∂rn Pankratz, confirmed the news on a Discord server for Pithead Studio, a newly established games company co-founded with his wife, Jenny Pankratz.</p>
<p>"As you sure noticed, the gaming industry was not doing well last year," says a message in the Discord,  as spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/embracer-has-reportedly-closed-elex-developer-piranha-bytes-as-former-creative-director-announces-a-new-indie-studio/">PC Gamer</a>. "This was also the case for the Embracer Group, to which THQ Nordic and Piranha Bytes belong. A lot of studios had to close, thousands of people in the gaming industry worldwide lost their jobs. Sadly, Piranha Bytes was also affected by this."</p>
<p>Images in the CD-Action report also show the <a href="https://www.cdaction.pl/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cdaction.pl%2Fimages%2F2024%2F07%2F08%2F47e10678-9580-460e-8a37-46151afd5289.jpeg&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75">Piranha Bytes offices</a> in a state of relative abandonment, with unused desks, chairs and lamps piled up in a room. </p>
<p>The RPGs of Piranha Bytes were known for being somewhat janky but spirited. Gothic was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gothic-retrospective">more believable than modern RPGs</a>, according to Sin. The Risen games had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/risen-2-review">"heart and soul"</a> even if they were sometimes wobbly, said Alec once upon a time. And although Elex II was not Alice B's cup of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elex-ii-prevew-a-weird-science-fantasy-rpg-that-doesnt-care-about-you-at-all">sci-fi lizard battering</a>, she could still clearly see why people would gel with it. </p>
<p>As brands, Gothic, Risen and Elex still belong to publisher THQ Nordic (owned by Embracer), according to another message on the Pithead Studio Discord. But it's hard for even those who spent their lives working on these games to know whether the franchises will continue in any meaningful way in the future.</p>
<p>"All we know is that Alkimia Interactive from [Spain] is working on [a] Gothic Remake," say Pithead. "We are not included in the making of the remake in any form, and therefore have no influence on it."</p>
<p>The closures brought about by Embracer have greatly impacted the industry, putting a huge number of people out of work, and killing dead a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-embracers-cuts-killed-a-potential-red-faction-sequel-and-gutted-a-promising-studio">potential Red Faction sequel</a>. They say <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embracer-say-their-restructure-is-over-but-its-too-early-to-start-acquiring-studios-again">their "restructuring programme" is over</a>.</p>

            <p>I gaze with alarm and approval upon the recent phenomenon of "dark <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a>" or "horror strategy" games, a devilish parade of top-down drag-clickers, from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-fabulous-fear-machine-out-today-is-a-strategy-game-of-engrossing-evil">The Fabulous Fear Machine</a> to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/out-now-in-early-access-the-tribe-must-survive-is-frostpunk-for-people-who-love-being-afraid-of-the-dark">The Tribe Must Survive</a>, that strive to find the fear in a genre that typically places you at a managerial remove. The best-known is probably <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a>, with its perpetual raging against the dying of the light, its ceaseless scrape for coal and wood as the temperature falls. Anoxia Station, announced this month, is similarly driven by the gathering of fossil fuels, and similarly shaped by questions of worker death and morale, but it takes you deep underground - into a sumptuous, brutal world of quartz crystals, salt caves, magma lakes, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonmilk">moonmilk</a> rivers, swirling gases and, judging from the below trailer, enormous maggots and centipedes. Larva lakes, amirite.</p><!--more-->

<p>Anoxia Station is set in 1988, but not the 1988 you may remember. The Earth's surface has been devastated by a supervolcano and, in a shocking display of wildcard speculative world-building, humanity is now dependent on petroleum for survival. You take charge of a group of Terranauts, sent into the guts of a festering world in search of a fabled ocean of oil. You'll excavate a path to this mega-deposit, sector by sector. Along the way, you'll need to extract smaller pockets of oil for the benefit of the world above, expand your mining facilities and keep your (irreplaceable) crew alive, sane and at peace with each other. </p>
<p>This is easier said than done, because this is 1988, the height of the Cold War, and your miners hail from different sides of various Iron Curtains - there are people from the Soviet Union, the United States, the German Democratic Republic and Japan, among others. Some are enemies within who have hidden agendas, others just hate each other instinctively. You'll have to look after all of them, regardless. "Crewmen might become despicable, but if they fall, entire production lines might be extinguished, spelling hardship, if not death for the whole mission," explains <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2924310/Anoxia_Station/">the Steam page</a>. Sounds challenging! And that's before we start talking about those massive insectile lifeforms, which look like they've wriggled out of the catacombs of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/scorn">Scorn</a>. The Steam page trails off ominously here.</p>
<p>Anoxia Station has "a uniquely isometric style grounded in real physical processes", with audio design that consists of "a mix of the deafening roars of shifting rock, the harsh sounds of mining and welding, the distant clicking of something clearly inhuman, and a familiar scream". It's the work of Yakov Butuzoff, whose other works include visual novel Loretta, with Abylight Studios publishing. There's no release date yet.</p>

Twitch streamer MissMikkaa has completed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Elden Ring DLC</a> Shadow of the Erdtree with a dance mat controller.
</p>
<p>
Fans of the streamer won't be surprised by this news, after Mikkaa previously not only <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-streamer-dancing-through-elden-ring-with-a-dance-pad">completed the base game on a customised dance mat</a>, but played <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-streamer-defeats-elden-rings-malenia-in-dance-pad-and-controller-simultaneous-challenge-run">two games simultaneously on dance mat and controller</a>.

</p>
<p>
Of course, the release of Shadow of the Erdtree means she's back at it. And, after a week of dancing, she's completed the DLC. There's a video of the feat below so <strong>spoiler warning</strong>.

"I did it! ALL bosses of my dance pad Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree run have been deFEETed!" she posted on X, formerly Twitter.
</p>
<p>
"The last boss fell after 52 tries and 7 hours of dance-padding (my feet hurt). DLC took me 7 days in total with 325 deaths; 69 of them to gravity, nice. I hope Miyazaki is proud of me."
</p>
<p>
A video alongside the post shows the streamer defeating the final boss, so <strong> final spoiler warning</strong>. "I'm so tired," she says at the end, collapsing to the ground. I'm not surprised.
</p>
<p>And when so many players are debating whether the DLC is too difficult, here's a streamer finishing perhaps the ultimate challenge. A true expert!</p> <div>

As we previously reported, the release of Shadow of the Erdtree has meant <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/streamers-continue-to-play-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-in-weird-and-wonderful-ways">the return of streamers playing the game in weird ways</a>.

			<p>A fan recently created a Fallout Unreal Engine 5 prototype, providing a glimpse at what possibilities the future holds for the popular series by Bethesda.</p>
<p>The prototype, which was made by Milwaukee Games, takes advantage of the latest version of the game engine by Epic to recreate the atmosphere the series is known for. The moment the Vault opens, in particular, looks great, as do the open wasteland and the recreation of the iconic Pip-Boy.</p>
<p><iframe title="I Made a Fallout Prototype in Unreal Engine 5 (Gameplay)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SQK1VjUL3l4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It has been a while since the release of Fallout 4, so this Fallout Unreal Engine 5 is definitely making us hunger for another proper new entry in the series even more. A statement from Xbox head Phil Spencer suggested the success of the Amazon Prime Video TV Show may have <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-5-release/">sped up plans for a new game</a>, but Todd Howard later confirmed that <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-fallout-games-wont-be-rushed-says-howard-bethesda-game-studios-had-25-million-players-last-month/">new entries in the series won't be rushed out</a> just to take advantage of the franchise's current popularity.</p>
<p>The latest entry in the series is Fallout 76, now available on PC and console. The game is currently available for a very low price as part of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1151340/Fallout_76/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam Summer Sale</a>, so there's no better time than now to join the many Vault Dwellers roaming post-nuclear America and experience the largest and most dynamic world created for the franchise.</p>

			<p>The launch of Parasol Stars: The Story of Bubble Bobble III on PlayStation means that for the first time in many, many years, all three Bubble Bobble games are available on one platform. Both <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP8908-CUSA46390_00-HAMPRDC000000001">Rainbow Islands</a> and <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP8908-CUSA03943_00-HAMPRDC000000001">Bubble Bobble</a> were released as part of the Arcade Archives series, direct ports of the arcade games, but Parasol Stars has had a few extra tweaks thanks to developers ININ and this one is actually published by the original arcade machine manufacture, Taito.</p>
<p><iframe title="Parasol Stars - The Story of Bubble Bobble III Launch Teaser" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sHhXUfVmwD8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The game ‚Äì also confusing known as Rainbow Islands II even though there are no rainbows ‚Äì features the same elements as the previous two instalments but with an added twist. The basic gameplay is still the same, with mostly single screen levels that have a bunch of enemies moving in fairly predictable paths, where one touch from any of them will cause you to lose a life. The twist here is that Bub and Bob (still in human form) have parasols which they can use&nbsp; in a number of ways.</p>


<p>Get close to an enemy and flourish you parasol and you can stun the creature, pick it up and throw at other enemies. You can also use the parasol to block incoming attacks, and collect bubbles that drop from the ceiling. Throw a single bubble and it will knock out an enemy, but collect five and it will turn into a super weapon ‚Äì either a pool of fire, an electric bolt, or a torrent of water ‚Äì which you can use to knock out multiple bad guys at once.</p>


<p>Like all the Bubble Bobble games the premise is quite simple, and unlike it‚Äôs predecessors, Parasol Stars is actually much easier and you can breeze through the first couple of levels without much thought. However, thinking is exactly what you need to do if you want to score the big points.&nbsp; Hitting multiple enemies at once brings showers of point giving fruit, and there many secrets hidden in the levels, just throwing a bubble in a certain direction may produce enough ice creams and eclairs to keep anyone happy. As the enemies always start in the same position and you have just a brief second before they start moving, the key is to work out the best path through the level, hitting as many enemies at once and uncovering all the delicious goodies.</p>
<p>At the end of each of the eight levels you will face a boss fight and the mechanics change. Now you can spawn bubbles by floating around, charge up a super burst and hit the boss. There are also two hidden bonus levels that can be unlocked‚Ä¶ if you know how.</p>

<p>As mentioned this isn‚Äôt a direct port of the arcade game, and while the core game is exactly the same ININ have tweaked a few things. The control scheme has been modified for our modern controllers and I have to say it works like a dream, so much better than the controls from the previous games. The graphics, while still in the 16-bit pixel glory, are superbly crisp and colourful and make Rainbow Islands look rather washed out in comparison. The colours also help make the game look a lot less dated; it could be an indie game from 2024.</p>
<p>The game also has the usual modern features including a rewind button, load and saves, and filters. There‚Äôs also options for those who are colour blind and a hilarious if totally useless feature to change the screen size to the original GameBoy version, which results in the game running in a 3cm square in the middle of a 4K screen.</p>
<p>The jewel in the crown is the two player mode, as unlike the previous games you can work together, or be a dick. Do you help the second player, giving them a boost up on your brolly and working together to clear the screen, or do you hide on your side and throw enemies at your pal, stunning them so they can‚Äôt move and get smacked in the face by a sentient trombone?</p>

		
		

<p>So the big question, is as good as the the other two games? Well yes and no. It‚Äôs still a brilliant game but perhaps lacks the ‚Äúone more go‚Äù factor of Rainbow Islands, but if you have two players then this is by far the best in the series.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/you-dont-need-an-xbox-to-play-xbox-says-new-fire-tv-app-ad/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Starting yesterday, the newly released <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09MVCQJBJ/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox app</a> for the Amazon Fire TV stick allows users to play Xbox games on the go, even without the console. Of course, you will need an active Game Pass Ultimate subscription, as that's the only way to access cloud gaming for Xbox - unless all you want to play is Fortnite, which can be checked out for free.</p>
<p>The app is initially available on the <a href="https://amzn.to/3LBrJ7D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fire TV 4K Max (2023)</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/3VWvQ2D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fire TV Stick 4K (2023)</a>, with pricing starting at $49.99. A Bluetooth-enabled wireless controller, such as Xbox Wireless Controller, Xbox Adaptive Controller, PlayStation DualSense, or DualShock 4, is also needed to play.</p>
<p><iframe title="No Xbox? Have no fear with Amazon Fire TV Stick" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xiVHc3UBJFk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>To celebrate the occasion, Microsoft also released a dedicated ad where the phrase 'you don't need an Xbox to play Xbox' can be heard - something that would have been unthinkable mere years ago. Of course, it is no news that Microsoft is pushing beyond the limited confines of the console space. Partly, that is because sales aren't great (in fact, <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-boosts-microsot-q3-gaming-revenue-xbox-consoles-sales-collapse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they have been declining for a while now</a>), but it's also because Microsoft's ambitions are much bigger than the total addressable market for consoles could ever allow. There are only a few hundred million users interested in console gaming, whereas Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/nadella-xbox-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wants to reach up to three billion gamers</a> wherever they may wish to play.</p>
<p>That includes PC gaming (all Xbox first-party titles have launched on PC for several years now), other consoles (as we've seen with the ports of Sea of Thieves, Pentiment, Grounded, and Hi-Fi Rush to PlayStation 5/Nintendo Switch), TVs (<a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-and-samsung-partnership-brings-xbox-app-to-samsung-gaming-hub-on-2022-smart-tvs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there's been an app on Samsung televisions</a> for two years now), and mobile devices, the real deal, with Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-to-launch-mobile-store-via-web-in-july-microsoft-sees-tremendous-growth-in-cloud-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ready to launch a dedicated store later this month</a>. The Amazon Fire TV stick app is just a stepping stone on a path to bring Xbox games to every possible device.</p>

			<p><a href="https://x.com/eXtas1stv/status/1810470552731095545?t=VNOHCe8Wbww2sHiGT0Ge7w&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Spanish leaker extas1s</a>, Deck13's action RPG Atlas Fallen is coming soon to Microsoft's Game Pass subscription service. The leaker did not specify any specific date, but chances are it will happen alongside the upcoming launch of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/atlas-fallen-gets-enhanced-with-free-reign-of-sand-update-on-august-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">big free Reign of Sand update</a>, scheduled for August 6.</p>
<p>Atlas Fallen launched in August 2023 to slightly mixed reviews. The game earned a 7 out of 10 score <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/atlas-fallen-god-of-sand/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in Wccftech's review</a>:</p>
<p><em>Before release, Atlas Fallen looked like an intense action game that could rival the best titles released in the past few years. The execution, however, relegates Deck13's latest game to be nothing more than a decent title that can be fun if one is willing to look past its shortcomings. With a little more polish, the game could have been great, but in its current state, it will eventually become a faint memory like the world that was covered in sand by the God Thelos.</em></p>
<p>Deck13 is known mostly for its Soulslike games (the first Lords of the Fallen and the two The Surge titles). With Atlas Fallen, they tried to switch genres, but they didn't find commercial success, either, as publisher Focus Home Interactive <a href="https://wccftech.com/atlas-fallen-was-a-financial-disappointment-but-an-enhanced-version-and-new-content-is-coming-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> in December 2023.</p>
<p>However, they set on trying to improve the game. The Reign of Sand update will introduce some brand new voice acting by the award-winning actor Ben Starr (who voiced Clive Rosfield, the protagonist in Square Enix's Final Fantasy XVI), a new area, new enemies, 25 new Essence Stones, new progression mechanics, quality of life improvements (mostly to the camera, but also to balancing and onboarding), the highly requested New Game Plus mode, and a new difficulty mode called Nyaal's Nightmare.</p>
<p>It only makes sense to ensure as many people as possible check out this improved version of Atlas Fallen through Game Pass. After all, as KeokeN's Koen Deetman <a href="https://wccftech.com/deliver-us-home-qa-keoken-talks-studio-layoffs-kickstarter-campaign-and-life-as-a-small-indie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told Wccftech in our fresh Deliver Us Home interview</a>, Game Pass is a great discovery tool that is sure to boost a game's visibility for a while.</p>
<p>We'll keep an eye on the official announcement, which will probably happen soon.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/console-us-spending-declines-ghost-of-tsushima-resurgence-validates-sonys-pc-strategy/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/console-us-spending-declines-ghost-of-tsushima-resurgence-validates-sony%E2%80%99s-pc-strategy.922287/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/console-us-spending-declines-ghost-of-tsushima-resurgence-validates-sonys-pc-strategy/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://x.com/MatPiscatella/status/1810377988434964526">Hardware spending in the US declined by 40%</a> in May on a year-on-year comparison, according to Circana (formerly NPD). This includes popular consoles such as the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 5. The main culprit is the tough comparison with May 2023, which saw the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">release of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>, a masterpiece and massive commercial success for Nintendo that drove lots of sales of Switch hardware.</p>
<p>This May, Sony's PlayStation comes out on top. Ghost of Tsushima was the best-seller in May 2024, surging back from rank #71 in the chart thanks to the game's <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-sets-new-concurrent-player-peak-record-for-sonys-single-player-games-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">successful release on PC</a>. During this time, Nintendo also saw the release of the Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door remake. However, Sony remained on top with better sales in physical and digital media from Ghost of Tsushima.</p>
<p>Also, Helldivers 2 was a massive release for Sony, and it can be played only on PC or PlayStation 5. The large number of sales accrued with these two games shows that Sony's strategy of bringing its exclusives to PC is incredibly successful, being able to tap into a whole new market.</p>
<p>As the years go by, we see more and more PlayStation exclusives, such as The Last of Us, Ghost of Tsushima, Horizon Zero Dawn, and many more, be ported to PC. As this happens, Sony's sales skyrocket as it adds a new layer of accessibility to the game for fans who may not be able to afford a PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>Circana also notes that May 2024 saw a 3% dip in all content spending, compared to a 13% growth in mobile content spending. As more games are put on mobile (including <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-7-biohazard-coming-to-iphone-ipad-and-mac-on-july/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CAPCOM's Resident Evil series</a>), new audiences can discover them, and they can usually get them for cheaper than they may get on another console.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch is seeing the biggest drop in sales, which could be related to the upcoming announcement of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-higher-resolution-steam-deck/">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. Many players avoid buying a new Nintendo Switch because they don't want to have outdated technology, and a new era of future games could be exclusive to the Nintendo Switch 2. Then again, most users who wanted a Switch probably already have one by now.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/9/24194631/logitech-g309-gaming-mouse-powerplay<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I haven‚Äôt thought about charging my Logitech wireless gaming mouse in two and a half years, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23005435/magic-mouse-apple-logitech-powerplay">because I have a magic mousepad</a> that does it automatically. But Logitech mice that work with the Powerplay mousepad are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/5/23043644/logitech-g-pro-x-superlight-2-gaming-mouse-price-release-date-specs">expensive</a>, heavy, or both, and none of them double as a Bluetooth mouse so I can wirelessly pair them to my laptop, handheld, or phone.</p><p>Today, Logitech is changing that with <a href="https://logitech.cfzu.net/c/482924/499820/8585?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitechg.com%2Fen-us">the Logitech G309</a>, an $80 mouse that almost does it all. It‚Äôs the first Powerplay mouse this inexpensive, the first with Bluetooth, the first that lets you use a AA battery when you‚Äôre on the go ‚Äî and the first Logitech wireless mouse with a supercapacitor inside so you don‚Äôt <em>necessarily</em> need a battery at all. </p><p>Even without Powerplay, the G309 is a dual-mode wireless gaming mouse that promises up to 300 hours of battery life using its Lightspeed wireless dongle, or up to 600 hours over Bluetooth, while you‚Äôre slinging around its 86-gram frame. </p><p>But if you‚Äôve got that $120 Powerplay pad, you can remove the AA battery to reach a total mouse weight of <em>just 68 grams</em>, nearly as light as the 60-gram, $160 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/5/23043644/logitech-g-pro-x-superlight-2-gaming-mouse-price-release-date-specs">Logitech G Pro X Superlight 2<em> </em>that gave me serious mouse envy</a> last year. It‚Äôs possible because the supercapacitor acts as a tiny battery constantly being wirelessly charged by the Powerplay mousepad underneath. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs never going to die at all; it‚Äôs endless battery life,‚Äù promises Logitech senior global product manager Nicolas M√©tral.</p><p>It‚Äôs not the first wireless gaming mouse to test the waters with a supercapacitor ‚Äî but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/1/9/16867292/razer-wireless-charging-hyperflux-mamba-firefly-mouse-pad-ces-2018">when Mad Catz and Razer tried that in 2018</a>, those pricey wireless power mice didn‚Äôt have any <em>other</em> way to charge. You had to use them on their bundled pad or with a wired cord. Until now, Logitech‚Äôs used internal rechargeable lithium cells to let you make its Powerplay mice somewhat portable; here, a AA battery picks up the slack. </p><p>Despite being on the budget end of Logitech‚Äôs gaming mice, the G309 also has the same Hero 25K sensor and hybrid optomechanical switches the company‚Äôs been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/30/23328970/logitech-g502-x-lightspeed-plus-gaming-mouse-mice-optical-buttons-usb-c">shipping in premium mice for a while</a>, both of which might be welcome upgrades over the $60 G305 mouse it‚Äôs based upon. </p><p>But it‚Äôs still missing the one Logitech mouse feature I‚Äôd have a hard time doing without ‚Äî the company‚Äôs dual-mode ratcheting/free spinning scroll wheel that I‚Äôm constantly using to zip through documents and webpages when I‚Äôm using my gaming mouse for work. Among gaming mice, that‚Äôs still exclusive to its G502 and G903 from what I can tell. </p><p>And, it‚Äôs a bit of a shame Logitech still sells its Powerplay mousepad for $120 with only the rarest and smallest of discounts. If the company really wants to fulfill the G309‚Äôs promise of ‚ÄúWireless Play for All‚Äù ‚Äî that‚Äôs Logitech‚Äôs tagline ‚Äî I‚Äôd recommend making the complete package more affordable.</p><p>Logitech says it will keep selling the G305 alongside the G309. The G309 can also share a single Lightspeed wireless dongle with a bunch of Logitech‚Äôs wireless keyboards, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185020/logitech-keyboard-mx-keycaps-gaming">the new G515 TKL</a>, G715, G915, G915 TKL, Pro X 60, and Pro X TKL.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The latest main entry in the series is 2010's Toy Story 3 from Disney Interactive Studios. This title was released for the PS3, Xbox 360, Wii, and PC.&nbsp; As you can imagine, fans have been hoping for a new game in the series following the release of the 2019's Toy Story 4 movie. We've included a part of the official Toy Story 3: The Video Game press release from 2010 below.</p>
<p>"‚ÄúToy Story 3: The Video Game addresses a fact understood by every kid: imagination is what truly brings toys to life,‚Äù said John Blackburn, vice president and general manager of Avalanche Software. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs really what a toy box is about. We remember that kind of play from our own childhood, and it‚Äôs where we began as game designers. With this title, we want to encourage and reward creativity in others.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWith Toy Story 3: The Video Game, audiences will have multiple ways to experience and enjoy the Toy Story world,‚Äù said Craig Relyea, senior vice president of global marketing, Disney Interactive Studios. ‚ÄúStory Mode follows the film‚Äôs story and adventures, while Toy Box Mode gets to the playful heart of the Toy Story franchise. By combining the power of imagination with the Toy Story universe, the game appeals to the joy of play in all of us.‚Äù</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/hellblade-ii-woeful-sales-in-may-2024/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Senua‚Äôs Saga: Hellblade II was released on May 21 following years of teasers and trailers. It was first announced in 2018 and was penned as being one of the most visually advanced games ever made ‚Äì and to give the game credit, it hits that target just fine. However, it‚Äôs a testament to the fact that visuals aren‚Äôt everything, as recent sales data has revealed that the game performed terribly during May 2024.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-sacrificing-senua">Sacrificing Senua</h2>



<p>Hellblade II is a fairly short game that offers an immersive, impactful story mixed up with groundbreaking visuals, and it performed fairly well in reviews when it was released. Presently, it sits on Metacritic with a score of 80, which isn‚Äôt awful.</p>



<p>However, US sales data published by Circana has revealed how poorly Hellblade II performed when it was released, with the game coming in 37th place overall in the charts for full-game dollar sales. On Xbox, it ended up in 21st place. In terms of player count, it fell behind the likes of Fallout 76, and on Steam, it peaked at just 3,892 players. </p>



<p>In the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ea-sports-fc-24-and-gta-5-top-european-charts-in-tough-may-european-monthly-charts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">European sales charts</a>, it was revealed that Hellblade II failed to break into the top 100 games in May. On streaming platforms, Hellblade II crashed pretty quickly. It reached a peak of 110,193 viewers on Twitch on launch day, but by the second day on the market, that number had dwindled by 90%, and by the following week, a peak of just 900 users was recorded. </p>



<p>It‚Äôs hardly a flash in the pan, but it‚Äôs a short-lived, short-form game that only offers a few hours of entertainment, and once you‚Äôre done, you‚Äôre <strong>done</strong>. </p>

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, for example, can <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-explains-huge-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-file-sizes">exceed 200GB alone</a>. NBA 2K23 weighs in at 150GB and even older games like God of War: Ragnarok and Horizon Forbidden West  require 90GB of space. Future games like Grand Theft Auto VI will undoubtedly demand even more space. The advantage of a PS5 console over the Xbox Series X is that the SSD slot is not proprietary; you can install most third party PCIe Gen4 x4 SSDs as long as they are fast enough. Slower drives WILL work, but they may bottleneck the original SSD.</p><p>Although TEAMGROUP isn't as well known of a brand as SanDisk or Samsung, this brand has been around for a while and is a legitimate manufacturer of flash-based storage. This particular model has plenty of good reviews on Amazon. This particular SSD meets all the requirements for your PS5 upgrade.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/sketch-confirms-of-leaks-real-stream/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Earlier this week, images emerged online showing popular streamer, Kylie ‚ÄòSketch‚Äô Cox, performing explicit acts ‚Äì and it was alleged that the images were screengrabbed from an old OnlyFans account. The surfacing of the images led to Sketch being bombarded on social media with homophobic abuse, prompting many of his peers to speak up in support of him amid an unplanned outing. </p>



<p>He went live just hours ago with an explanation that led to him confirming that the images are real and that they were taken from a ‚Äòdark time‚Äô in his life and he has since ‚Äòchanged‚Äô.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-we-move-on">We Move On</h2>



<p>Sketch might not be everyone‚Äôs cup of tea and he‚Äôs one of the more zany characters on Twitch, but there‚Äôs no discrediting the rampant growth that the streamer has experienced in the last few months. In March 2024, he blew up, amassing more than 350,000 followers in a single month, and he now sits at 1.1 million followers on the top-tier streaming platform.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, images appeared on social media showing Sketch engaged in a sexual act with another man, which prompted an ignorant portion of the gaming community to unleash a tirade upon him. He was dragged through the wringer, and during <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2192642945" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">an emotional appearance on stream</a> last night, he revealed that the revelation hitting the air almost ended him:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Yeah, it came out. And I have a lot of people to credit for‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll be honest, Plan A was ‚Äì and I will say candidly ‚Äì was to probably eat a ‚Äî well, probably to call it quits, if this ever came out. But some people saved me. Shout out Banks, shout out my parents, shout of y‚Äôall. I f***ed up, but I‚Äôm changed.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It‚Äôs widely assumed Sketch was about to say he would have to ‚Äòeat a bullet‚Äô if this came out. His reference to Banks is a nod to FaZe Banks, who was supportive of Sketch when the news dropped online. Following his explanation, Sketch suggested he might be taking a break from streaming to get his head in the right space ‚Äì but there‚Äôs still a chance he might quit, he said.</p>

Well right now Walmart is offering a <a href="https://zdcs.link/ZRjOY?content_id=7953c3b3-369f-45a6-81ed-f5e6f99ab47b&amp;pagetype=article" target="_blank">SanDisk Ultra 512GB Micro SDXC Card</a> for only $24.99. Walmart+ members get free shipping, otherwise you need to get your order total to $35. Currently this is the least expensive 512GB Micro SDXC card we've seen from a legit brand.  It's part of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/walmart-deals-sale-is-live-prime-day-competition-heats-up">Walmart's larger sale</a> that competes with Amazon Prime Day. SanDisk is owned by Western Digital and is the most popular memory card brand for the Nintendo Switch console.</p><p>Don't have a Walmart+ membership? <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/save-50-off-a-12-month-walmart-membership">It's currently 50% off</a>.</p><h2>512GB SanDisk Ultra Micro SDXC Card for $24.99</h2><div id="168464" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Nintendo Switch Compatible SanDisk Ultra 512GB Micro SDXC Card</h3></p></div><p>If you've started compiling a collection of digital games, you probably already know just how limited the Switch's base storage capacity is. The Switch and Switch OLED have 32GB and 64GB of internal storage, respectively, some of it reserved for the OS. Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom uses up 16GB and Breath of the Wild about 13.5GB. If bought digitally, those two games alone would take up all of your internal storage on the OG Switch console. There's only one expansion slot in the Switch console so you want to make sure you get the biggest card you can afford.</p><p>The SanDIsk Ultra Micro SDXC card is compatible with virtually any device that accepts the Micro SDXC card standard. That includes the <strong>Nintendo Switch</strong>, Steam Deck, and the ASUS ROG Ally. It has a U1 A1 speed rating with up to 120MBps read speeds. There are faster cards out there, but the Nintendo Switch can't take advantage of such speeds.

It normally retails for $199, which was already a great deal because it included the full Animal Crossing: New Horizons game. It's part of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/walmart-deals-sale-is-live-prime-day-competition-heats-up">Walmart's larger sale</a> that competes with Amazon Prime Day. We are pretty certain that Amazon will not match or beat this deal on Prime Day proper.</p><h2>Nintendo Switch Lite with Animal Crossing for $159</h2><div id="202969" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Nintendo Switch Lite (Timmy &amp; Tommy‚Äôs Aloha Edition) Animal Crossing: New Horizons Bundle</h3></p></div><p>The Switch Lite retails for $100 less than the original Switch and $150 less than the Switch OLED. It is compatible with most Nintendo Switch games and it runs off the same hardware, so performance is identical. The three main tradeoffs of the Switch Lite is that (1) the controllers are not detachable, (2) the console can't be docked and played on a TV and (3) the display is smaller (5.5" vs 6.2" on Switch and 7" on Switch OLED). If you were intending to use the Switch solely as a handheld console, you might be better off just getting the Switch Lite. Even though the controls aren't detachable, the Switch Lite does support wireless Bluetooth, so you can always purchase another pair of Joy-Cons, a Switch Pro controller, or a compatible third party wireless Switch controller, and you can still play untethered.</p><p>If you enjoy life sim type games like Stardew Valley, Harvest Moon, or Minecraft, you'll probably love Animal Crossing. It's obvious that Nintendo put in a lot of love into this first party title and it's certainly one of the best - and most relaxing - games for the Nintendo Switch. This is an excellent pick for gamers of all ages, even children.

Now, thanks to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-drops-the-hardest-as-all-consoles-decline-by-double-digits-compared-to-2023">Circana's most recent sales data</a>, we have a clearer idea of its performance.</p><p>According to Circana analyst Mat Piscatella, Hellblade II was 37th overall in terms of full dollar sales for May 2024, putting it at 21st overall on the Xbox Series consoles. Hellblade II did not receive a physical release. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Getting a lot of questions on this one...

That puts it just behind Fallout 76 on the platform, but ahead of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, Apex Legends, and Forza Horizon 5.</p><p>Piscatella shared the sales info on X/Twitter, since Hellblade II's performance meant that it didn't appear on any of the major charts. Xbox and Ninja Theory have shared little about Hellblade II's sales since its initial release, leaving fans to speculate over Steam concurrents and other data. Gamesindustry.biz publisher Chris Dring noted that it failed to crack the Top 100 on European sales charts in what he described as a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ea-sports-fc-24-and-gta-5-top-european-charts-in-tough-may-european-monthly-charts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"brutal month" for game sales.</a></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The sequel to the acclaimed action-adventure game by Ninja Theory, Hellblade II was announced not long after Xbox acquired the studio in 2018 and finally released earlier this year. It was described as a "defining moment in the evolution of real-time visuals" by <a href="https://x.com/digitalfoundry/status/1793689567838519686" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Foundry</a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-review">we wrote in our own review</a>, "Senua‚Äôs Saga: Hellblade II delivers a spellbinding adventure packed with cinematic spectacle and story surprises that maintains a surging sense of forward momentum and never wastes a second of its slender run time."</p><p>Elsewhere, Ghost of Tsushima returned to number one thanks to its Steam release, while Call of Duty dominated the sales charts for both Xbox and PlayStation. Overall, though, it was a rough month for hardware spending as all three consoles recorded double-digit declines.</p><p>With Hellblade II now available, Xbox is looking ahead to the rest of 2024, with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/everything-we-know-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a> among the first-party releases on its docket.

Following Microsoft's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-partnering-with-amazon-to-deliver-xbox-cloud-gaming-via-fire-tv-devices">announcement it's teaming up with Amazon</a> to bring Xbox games to Fire TV devices via cloud streaming, the initiative is now live for Game Pass Ultimate subscribers.
</p>
<p>
Getting set up for console-free gaming with Fire TV is relatively straightforward; just download the Xbox app to a compatible device - Amazon's Fire TV Stick 4K and Fire TV Stick 4K Max are both supported - then sign in with an active Xbox Game Pass Ultimate account.
</p>
<p>
That'll give you access to Microsoft's <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/play/gallery/all-games">streamable Xbox Game Pass library</a> (a 20 Mbps internet connection over 5GHz Wi-Fi is recommended for play), with the last step being to connect a Bluetooth-enabled controller. The likes of the Xbox Wireless Controller, Xbox Adaptive Controller, and PlayStation DualSense are all supported.

<p>
Today's Fire TV rollout (which is available across 25 countries) follows the 2022 launch of Microsoft's Xbox app for Samsung TVs. Xbox boss Phil Spencer previously confirmed the app was Microsoft's new approach to bringing cloud gaming to the masses after it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-decides-to-pivot-away-from-xbox-game-pass-streaming-box-for-now">pulled the plug</a> on its own Xbox cloud gaming device, codenamed Keystone, back in 2022.
</p>
<p>
A patent seemingly showcasing the ill-fated Keystone device's external design <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-what-xboxs-ill-fated-cloud-gaming-console-might-have-looked-like-according-to-newly-surfaced-patent">recently appeared online</a>, matching the "old prototype" version that set tongues wagging when it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fans-think-phil-spencers-shelf-is-teasing-the-xbox-game-pass-streaming-box">was spotted on Phil Spencer's shelf</a> in October 2022.

<!-- cache hit 21:single/related:031cb7736f07f1fcbf58d1cbaae43f0a --><!-- empty -->
<p>It's been a whirlwind journey of stops and starts, but <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/07/05/apple-green-lights-epic-games-store-in-rapid-reversal">AppleInsider reports</a> the Epic Game Store for iOS in the European Union has passed Apple's notarization process.</p>
<p>This paves the way for Epic CEO Tim Sweeney to realize his long-stated goal of launching an alternative game store on Apple's closed platform‚Äîat least in Europe.</p>
<p>Apple announced plans to allow third-party app stores on iOS in the region earlier this year, complying with the letter of the law (though some say not the spirit) as required by the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which was enacted in hopes of making platforms more open and competitive.</p>
<p>Apple's new policies allow for alternative app marketplaces but with some big caveats regarding the deal that app developers agree to. We discussed it in some detail <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/apple-announces-sweeping-eu-app-store-policy-changes-including-sideloading/">earlier this year</a>.
</p><p>The change followed years of contentious PR campaigns and court battles around the world between Epic and Apple, with Sweeney proclaiming that Apple's app approval processes are anti-competitive and that its 30 percent cut of app revenues is unfair.</p>
<p>Even after the shift, Apple is said to have rejected the Epic Games Store app twice. The rejections were over specific rules about the copy and shape of buttons within the app, though not about its primary function.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>With the rejections, Apple told Epic that some buttons within the app were too similar in both appearance and copy to Apple's own buttons‚Äîincluding the "Install" button and the "in-app purchases" copy. Apple felt that this violated rules it had set out in its guidelines to prevent developers from mimicking Apple app designs too closely, ostensibly confusing users.</p>
<p>After those rejections, <a href="https://x.com/EpicNewsroom/status/1809179985682325649">Epic took to X</a> to accuse Apple of rejecting the app in a way that was "arbitrary, obstructive, and in violation of the DMA." Epic claimed it followed Apple's suggested design conventions for the buttons and noted that the copy matched language it has been using in its store on other platforms for a long time.</p>
<p>Not long after, Apple went ahead and approved the app despite the disagreement over the copy and button designs. However, AppleInsider reported that Apple will still require Epic to change the copy and buttons later. Epic <a href="https://x.com/EpicNewsroom/status/1809658856466698515">disputed that on X</a>, and Sweeney offered <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1809336745613287445">his own take</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple‚Äôs DMA saga has taken a turn towards the absurd.</p>
<p>Apple is now telling reporters that this approval is temporary and are demanding we change the buttons in the next version - which would make our store less standard and harder to use.</p>
<p>We‚Äôll fight this.</p></blockquote>
<p>While the matter remains contentious, it looks like the Epic Game Store will soon reach iPhone and iPad users in the European Union. Epic still has to build some key parts of the new storefront, such as its mobile payment system for the platform.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/goodbye-kotaku-australia-you-were-a-very-good-website.922137/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/kotaku-australia-closed-layoffs<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Kotaku was launched in New York in 2004, and it didn't take long for readers (and advertisers) to realise it was a good website. So in 2008 the publication's owner at the time, Gawker Media, made a deal that saw the Kotaku brand licensed out to an Australian media company. And so Kotaku AU was born.</p><p>Based in Sydney and paying a fee to Gawker for the name and content, Kotaku Australia (and its stablemates Gizmodo AU and Lifehacker AU) served two masters. First, it handled the republication of the American site's content on a local masthead, where it could attract whole new ad deals. But it also hired Australian writers, who could publish their own criticism and do their own reporting.</p><p>This lent the site a voice of its own, an identity distinct from the American mothership, shaped by a succession of local (or at least locally-based) editors who were able to provide a softer tone and cultivate a community that, I'll be honest, was often the envy of the US site.</p><p>Kotaku AU was able to perform miracles relative to its headcount and budget, providing a constant stream of original reporting that held the local industry to account when needed, but could champion Australian games development and its community at the same time.</p><figure><blockquote><p>I‚Äôm tired of this heartless corpo bullshit. Fuck these dogs.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Anyway, you've read the headline already (<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-weekend-essay/is-the-media-prepared-for-an-extinction-level-event" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and are living through 2024 and the media apocalypse</a>) so you know why we're here writing these words in this tone: yesterday the owners of Kotaku AU--<a href="https://www.mi-3.com.au/08-07-2024/matt-rowley-exit-pedestrian-group-drops-vice-refinery29" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the embattled Pedestrian Group</a>, part of <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-06-28/nine-entertainment-job-cuts-commercial-media-slowing-economy/104036502" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the even more embattled Nine Network</a>--<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/article/2024/jul/08/vice-kotaku-gizmodo-job-cuts-australia-channel-nine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shut down the sites and laid everyone off</a>. Writers weren't even allowed to access their CMS to say goodbye, leaving the site's last posts (at time of publishing) to be a report on <em>LA Noire</em> weirdness and a <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> tip.</p><p>Denied even that last dignified act--and disclosure time, because I've worked closely with many of these people and think they're all amazing--I've turned Aftermath over for one blog to former editors and writers of Kotaku Australia, so that they can share their thoughts and say their goodbyes.&nbsp;</p><p>First up is <strong>David Wildgoose</strong>, an elder statesman of Australian games media and the second Editor of Kotaku Australia:</p><blockquote><p>Perhaps we shouldn't be too surprised that the Pedestrian Group would slow-walk to death a formerly vital hub of Australia's games community. Perhaps, as we survey the wreckage of the games media landscape over the past five years, the surprise is that Kotaku AU survived as long as it did. Regardless, the masthead and remaining editorial staff deserved a kinder fate than to be chewed up and spat out by an uncaring corporate machine.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Next up is the site's third Editor, the <a href="https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2017/07/fairy-bread-is-an-abomination/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decidedly un-Australian <strong>Mark Serrels</strong></a>, whose eight-year tenure perhaps marked the site's high-water mark, at least <a href="https://www.kotaku.com.au/2014/08/i-spent-an-entire-day-wearing-a-sleeping-bag-because-i-like-playing-video-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in terms of the resources allocated to it</a>:</p><blockquote><p>News that the Australian edition of Kotaku has come to an end has been sitting heavy on me all day. It almost feels like the death of a distant, beloved relative.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Over the course of eight years I published 11,000 posts on Kotaku Australia. The happiest times of my professional life were spent working on the site, publishing everything from news, reviews to unhinged shitposts. Every now and then I‚Äôd also post stuff that felt important. Those days were the best.</p><p>I‚Äôve worked at a number of places ‚Äì and loved it ‚Äì but I don‚Äôt think I ever feel as aligned with a website‚Äôs purpose like I did at Kotaku Australia. At the time it was simply tailor-made for me and the way I wanted to write. I could do pretty much anything I wanted. I walked around Sydney wearing a sleeping bag all day. <a href="https://www.cnet.com/culture/features/the-time-i-tried-polyphasic-sleep-and-started-hallucinating/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I did a completely cooked polyphasic sleep experiment</a> so I could play more video games. It was a wild time and I‚Äôve tried to replicate that energy to every place I‚Äôve worked since.&nbsp;</p><p>Kotaku Australia had its own unique identity, and a truly powerful community. They welcomed me with open arms and those first couple of years were magic. The TAYbies as they called themselves (it‚Äôs a long story) were endlessly supportive of the work I wanted to do and drowned out the gross mess of gaming discourse during dark times. In the depths of Gamergate that community got me through some truly challenging days. I met lifelong friends through Kotaku Australia. In fact, I just caught up with one of them at the pub last weekend. (Hi Ruffleberg!)</p><div><p>It was also a wicked conveyor belt for talent. I hired Jackson Ryan not once but twice and first met him through the Kotaku community (he once won a competition for writing a story about pissing himself while playing <em>Super Mario World</em>). I met Dan Crowd, who now looks after gaming content at the ABC, at a Kotaku meet-up. Zorine Te, who went to Gamespot and became an esports superstar, used to be a community mainstay as well! And hey ‚Äì did you know that my old Dep Ed Tracey Lien is now a famous best-selling author?</p><p>That‚Äôs not to mention all the incredible people I worked with across all three sites. I hesitate to name names because I‚Äôm a moron and I‚Äôll miss someone important, but almost all of the best games and tech journalists in Australia had a stint on these sites at one time and we all learned something important from one another. It was a melting pot for ‚Äúgood shit‚Äù before I arrived and it was a melting pot for ‚Äúgood shit‚Äù long after I left.</p><p>And on that note, a special shout out to the folks who steered Kotaku in its final days. David Smith, Emily Spindler, Courtney Borret, Lauren Rouse and Chris Neill among others were killing it. It absolutely sucks they‚Äôve been cut off at the peak of their powers.</p><p>I‚Äôm gutted, absolutely gutted.&nbsp;</p></div><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><figure><blockquote><p>...the masthead and remaining editorial staff deserved a kinder fate than to be chewed up and spat out by an uncaring corporate machine...</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>Tegan Jones</strong>, an award-winning tech journo who worked across all three Gawker-down-under sites (and was Editor of Gizmodo Australia) says:</p><blockquote><div><p>I‚Äôm beyond heartbroken over the demise of Gizmodo, Kotaku &amp; Lifehacker Australia. </p><p>The people working across these publications - some of the last bastions of paid, niche tech journalism in this country - were powerhouses who deserved better. </p><p>I‚Äôm so sorry for them all. </p><p>Gizmodo was my life for so long. Being its editor was something I took very seriously. It was my dream job. I wore the title proudly. For better or worse, it was my entire identity for a while there. Perhaps that‚Äôs a good lesson in the importance of divorcing one‚Äôs sense of self from the thing that pays their rent. </p><p>Because in this business, one day, it probably won‚Äôt.</p><p>Still, I‚Äôm not the only former editor to express such sentiments about Giz. There‚Äôs gotta be a reason for that. I will always love it for changing my life and the part it has always played in local tech journalism under so many wonderful and talented editors. </p><p>The same goes for Kotaku and Lifehacker. </p><p>Just look at the public lamentations of all former editors and writers across these publications - some of whom haven‚Äôt worked there in years. They weren't just jobs or websites for us. Gracing the digital pages of these sites will always be career highlights. Life highlights even.</p><p>For many of us, they gave us our first big breaks. They were our homes. For Alex [Ed's note: former Kotaku AU Editor Alex Walker] and myself in particular, they were the catalyst for our nine year relationship. Kotaku is the reason we met - at a local <em>Need For Speed </em>preview, which is eternally hilarious. </p><p>Looking at the toxic flames engulfing the local tech media landscape, I honestly don‚Äôt see a way forward. Perhaps that‚Äôs the sadness of the day speaking, but considering the dire state even mainstream journalism is in, I‚Äôm afraid I may be the right amount of jaded. </p><p>Regardless of what the future may hold, I think we can all agree that the industry will be worse off without these publications. It‚Äôs a dark day for Australian journalism and tech media globally - something that is becoming alarmingly common.</p></div><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p><strong>Ruby Innes</strong> was a great writer and an even better illustrator for Kotaku AU. Few things brought me more joy over the site's 16-year history than <a href="https://www.kotaku.com.au/2023/06/how-to-be-a-gamer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seeing some weird little guy she'd drawn at the top of a very good post</a>:</p><blockquote><div><p>I started at Kotaku AU in November 2021 and finished up in July 2023. Yeah, I wasn‚Äôt there for yonks, but I like to think I made myself known in a way. Not a smart or intellectual way, but definitely A Way.</p><p>Thanks to my wonderful editor David Smith, I was allowed to go turbo. I wrote some bonkers shit, some bonkers shit disguised as real shit, and some very personal shit too. I got to draw all sorts of silly drawings to go along with my insane ‚Äòillustrated guides‚Äô too, and that was a treat. But most importantly, I got to talk to so many cool people both in and out of the games industry, and shine a spotlight on Australia‚Äôs local games industry. Writing for Kotaku AU opened my eyes to a world of local game dev talent that I hadn‚Äôt seen before, and boosted my love for games in a way I‚Äôm very thankful for.</p><p>Kotaku AU has been a beacon for writing about games in Australia in a unique way. So many talented writers, artists, game devs, and so on have had their work published on Kotaku AU. Sure, it came with baggage, but Kotaku AU very much stood on its own two feet as an Australian games publication that gave a shit about the local industry. And wasn‚Äôt afraid to dig deep or have a chuckle.</p><p>The loss of Kotaku AU is fucked. The games journalism world is fucking cooked right now, and to see one of the biggest platforms that Australia has in games journalism disappear in one fell swoop alongside other great titles is sickening. I‚Äôm tired of this heartless corpo bullshit. Fuck these dogs. Love to Kotaku AU and everybody that played a part in making it what it was.</p></div><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p><strong>Amanda Yeo</strong>, one of the smartest writers and critics I have ever worked with,  says:</p><blockquote><div><p>My early years at Kotaku Australia were some of the happiest of my career. Kotaku AU gave me my start in games journalism, enthusiastically encouraged by then-editor Mark Serrels (to whom I will always be grateful). I loved my time there, and in another universe where things went differently, I can picture myself having chosen to stay.</p><p>Unfortunately, one of the many lessons I learned there was that good things rarely last. I had hoped Kotaku AU would always continue on, enduring the ups, downs, and many challenges to remain a constant stalwart. In my more optimistic musings, I even imagined Kotaku AU growing beyond what it was in my nostalgic memories, likely while I watched enviously from the sidelines.</p><p>I simply couldn't picture an Australian games journalism scene without Kotaku AU. Even with it now a sombre reality, I still struggle to comprehend it.</p><p>Being a full-time games journalist was barely feasible when I began in this industry, and it's only gotten worse in the years since. Kotaku AU was a bastion for Australian games journalism, offering not only entertaining, informative, and heartfelt content, but also some of the few opportunities in the country for writers covering this beat. It's devastating to think of those opportunities now being turned to dust, leaving budding writers with one less buoy to cling to in increasingly rough seas. Without Kotaku AU and its sister sites Gizmodo AU and Lifehacker AU, my life would have been very different. Now even fewer people will get a similar chance.</p></div><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><figure><blockquote><p>I wrote some bonkers shit, some bonkers shit disguised as real shit, and some very personal shit too</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>Alex Walker</strong>, who joined Kotaku AU as a journalist in 2015 before spending five years as its Editor, says:</p><blockquote><p>I loved writing for everyone on Kotaku Australia. Everyone I worked with did the same, and that applied to the other local wings just as much. And as we go full steam ahead into the AI-generated shitstain of a content world that is already upon us, I believe more than ever that human beings want that reverence, that love, that deep personal passion for the same things they love and share.</p><p>The question is, who pays for it? I haven‚Äôt figured out that part yet. But if they can, I know there‚Äôs a legion of folks who will go to the wire to bring that content to life. I just hope that this time they‚Äôll be greeted with an owner and managers with a vision and a belief that lasts longer than a quarter.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>I've left the last word to <strong>David Smith</strong>, Kotaku Australia's final steward, who performed Herculean tasks to the end despite an ever-dwindling budget and precarious ownership:</p><blockquote><p>Long before I worked there, I revered Kotaku Australia as the gold standard for Australian games coverage. Its features were the best. Its headlines were the best. Its writers were the best. I never thought I'd get to write for Kotaku AU, much less run it. But for two and a half years, I got to do just that.</p><p>I took that custodianship seriously and gave it everything. Its coverage of Australian games development was second to none. Serrels' stories about working conditions at EB Games still send shivers down the spines of those who worked there at the time. Alex's understanding of byzantine government process made it a leader in policy reporting around the games industry. Carrying that standard consumed my life, dramatically worsened my personal health, and required a considerable and surprising amount of my own money to get us to events or ensure our writers had review code due to being tarred with the US' many blacklists. I was up at 6am every day to get stories on the page for the morning commuters and I rarely logged off before 9 at night.</p><p>And I loved it. There were days I hated it, but I loved it.</p><p>KotAU was different to the US flagship in many ways, and it won us dedicated readers. Not just for our local coverage, but our tone too. We weren't as acidic as the US site could be, our takes considered more even-handed or good-natured. We still called a spade a spade and got ourselves in trouble with publishers as often as the US site, so I still feel we did our bit for the brand.</p><p>It was never easy, and often frustrating. Pedestrian Group never really understood Kotaku AU or how to get the most out of the brand commercially. Truthfully, it wasn't ever a good fit there, the PGroup voice and that of Kotaku AU couldn't have been more different. However, that lack of understanding had its benefits. Because they weren't really paying attention to us, we were able to publish a ton of cool shit. Sure, by the end, Google Discover plays were the only way to keep the SEO traffic hose flowing, but we fought to keep great stories coming. We even founded a TikTok (something the US site still hasn't done) and amassed a dedicated audience there by doing what we'd always done -- cutting the shit and talking to the audience like people, not consumers.</p><p>I'm still shellshocked that it's over. I don't know what's next. The shadow Kotaku AU cast is long and irreplaceable. I leave knowing I did everything I could to save and preserve it. I hope that, for the people who loved the site as much as I did, that will be enough.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The deal applies to the second generation AirPods with a Lightning charging port.

You'll get very high-quality sound from the AirPods as they're powered by Apple's H1 chip and the battery life is around 24 hours total listening time with the included charging case.</p><p>You'll also get a simple one-tap setup with the AirPods, and once you've done that, they'll automatically detect when they're in your ears as they self-activate. This means that you can pair them effortlessly with an iPhone, Apple Watch, Mac, iPad, and Apple TV, as well as use Siri for assistance without needing to grab your phone. Another neat feature is that you can share audio between two sets of AirPods on a single Apple device, in case you want to have a little audio-visual party.</p><p>If you don't mind spending more, you can also save on other AirPods models at Amazon. Third-gen Apple AirPods are on sale for $129 (normally $169), the AirPods Pro with a USB-C charging case are discounted to $169 (was $249), and the premium Apple AirPods Max headphones are discounted to as low as $450.</p><h2>Apple AirPods Early Prime Day 2024 Deals</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Apple AirPods (2nd gen)</a> -- $69 (<del>$129</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D1WXVQTN?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Apple AirPods (3rd gen)</a> -- $129 ($<strike>169</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D1XD1ZV3?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Apple AirPods with USB-C charging (2nd gen)</a> -- $169 ($<strike>249</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08PZJN7BD?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Apple AirPods Max (Sky Blue or Pink)</a> -- $450 ($<strike>549</strike>)</li></ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/07/08/gothic-elex-developer-pirahna-bytes-has-reportedly-shut-down<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Piranha Bytes, the developer of series such as Elex, Gothic, and Risen, has been shut down. The studio was owned by Embracer, which had been seeking a buyer for the German developer as part of its ongoing cost-cutting restructuring following failed $2 billion deal with Saudi Arabia-backed Savvy Games Group last year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was reported that Pirahna Bytes was looking for a new publisher following job cuts last year. In January, following a period of radio silence and inactivity from the studio, CEO Micahel R√ºve <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/01/22/gothic-elex-ii-dev-piranha-bytes-addresses-studio-closure-rumors-dont-write-us-off">addressed reports</a> of an impending closure by stating the company was in a ‚Äúdifficult situation‚Äù while expressing optimism about finding a partner by saying, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt write us off yet!‚Äù&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, German website <em><a href="https://www.gamestar.de/artikel/piranha-bytes-zukunft-bjoern-pankratz-pithead-studio,3416007.html">GameStar</a></em> (as surfaced by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-owned-gothic-risen-and-elex-developer-piranha-bytes-closes"><em>Eurogamer</em></a>) published a story reporting the studio was officially shut down in late June. Despite this report, there still has not been an official&nbsp; announcement of closure from Embracer or Pirahna (the studio's <a href="https://www.piranha-bytes.com/">website</a> remains inactive, however), and details about what exactly happened are scarce. <em>Game Informer</em> has contacted Pirahna's publisher THQ Nordic for comment and will update this story with a response should we receive one.&nbsp;</p>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="3125c744-7314-4cf1-9cfd-4389c6608691" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><p>However, earlier today, Pirahna leaders Bj√∂rn Pankratz and Jenny Pankratz&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/PitheadStudio/status/1810222288484389201">announced</a> the formation of Pithead Studio, a new indie studio. In an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCOIsrbctNM&amp;t=7s">announcement video</a>, the pair acknowledges Pirahna's silence over the past few months and says they plan to answer questions about Pithead's founding on their YouTube channel starting each Monday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Piranha Bytes was founded in 1997 and is perhaps best known for creating the Gothic series. The studio also developed the three Risen titles and the Elex series; its final release was Elex II in 2022. A remake of Gothic 1 is currently in development by a different studio,&nbsp;Alkimia Interactive. Piranha Bytes was acquired by THQ Nordic in 2019, itself a publishing subsidiary of Embracer Group.</p>

<p>If true, this news would represent the latest Embracer casualty following the <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/06/17/embracer-shuts-down-developer-of-the-new-alone-in-the-dark">closure of Alone in the Dark developer Pieces Interactive</a> last month. After months of layoffs, studio closures (including Saints Row developer <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/08/31/saints-row-developer-volition-games-has-been-shut-down">Volition Games</a> and Timesplitters developer <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/12/12/embracer-reportedly-might-close-free-radical-design-its-reformed-timesplitters-team">Free Radical</a>), and selling off its properties. In April, Embracer <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/04/22/embracer-group-to-split-into-three-companies-including-one-called-middle-earth">split itself into three companies</a>: Middle-earth &amp; Friends, Coffee Stain &amp; Friends, and Asmodee.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/apex-legends-battle-pass-changes-met-with-anger-confusion-from-fans<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">New changes splits Apex Legends Battle Pass into two parts, won't let players spend coins on future passes.</h2></div><section><p>EA and Respawn Entertainment are introducing a new Apex Legends battle pass structure, but players aren‚Äôt happy with the changes promised so far.</p><p>This new take on progression in the Titanfall spinoff was announced with <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/battle-pass-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an update post on the game‚Äôs website</a>. The post outlines a litany of fundamental changes to how rewards are earned, with the team saying that its goal is to ‚Äúimprove your experience and progression goals.‚Äù</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Starting with Season 22, we‚Äôre evolving the Apex Legends Battle Pass to improve your experience and progression goals.</p><p>Read on to learn everything to know about the upcoming changes or check out the infographic below to learn more. </p><p>üìÉ: <a href="https://t.co/kg5NhlFfVq" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/kg5NhlFfVq</a> <a href="https://t.co/i516ktP9ma" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/i516ktP9ma</a></p></div>‚Äî Apex Legends (@PlayApex) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayApex/status/1810330029265420515?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 8, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Where players will find the biggest changes are the length of the Battle Pass and how future passes will be purchased. Up to this point, Battle Passes have required players to complete 110 levels to acquire all rewards, including one Reactive Weapon and a Reactive Weapon Variant. But Season 22 will deliver two passes ‚Äì one for the first half and one for the second ‚Äì with 60 levels to complete each. Both halves include one Reactive Weapon each.</p><p>"The impact of this change is twofold," the post says. "It allows us to align seasonal progression more closely with Ranked while also increasing the value for your time."</p><p>EA and Respawn claim that the new structure will result in twice the seasonal rewards for Apex Legends players who use the free version of the battle pass. However, each half-season Premium pass will now cost $10, and the option to purchase passes with Apex Coins is being removed. Players have previously been able to earn 200 coins with the free version of the pass and 1300 coins through the Premium version of the pass, which costs 950 coins. </p><p>Each pass will offer the same number of coins for free and Premium players, which means double the amount of earnable Apex Coins per season, but those who have been saving up their coins will no longer be able to use them for future passes.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>15 Best Free-to-Play Games on Xbox</h3></div></output><p>Other tweaks to the Premium Apex Legends formula increase the number of Apex and Legend-Themed packs while doubling the amount of crafting materials in the Premium pass. The Premium Bundle, which was previously purchasable for 2800 Apex Coins, is now called Premium+ and costs $19.99. It includes only 10 level skips while offering more Exotic Shards, two Premium+ Legendary Character Skin Variants and the ability to play all Legends for the duration of the battle pass. </p><p>All of the changes will go into effect with Season 22, which is expected to launch next month.</p><p>"The decision to move from AC to real world currency is not one that we made lightly, but it does allow us to decrease the price of Premium+ for our community," Respawn's post says. "The new Premium+ Battle Pass comes in at $19.99 USD* and offers additional value; a cost difference of ~29% when compared to the discontinued Premium Battle Pass Bundle at 2800 AC."</p><h2>Apex Legends fans react to the new Battle Pass</h2><p>So far, Apex Legends players aren‚Äôt too happy with the changes.</p><p>‚ÄúSo basically pay 10 dollars twice a season instead of being able to continue buying battle passes every season with a one time purchase,‚Äù one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/1dyblr3/comment/lc7d10m/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Reddit user said</u></a>. ‚ÄúIn what world is this better for players?‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúThe advantage of gathering enough coins to buy the next BP via gameplay was that I was basically stuck with playing your product for dozens of hours on end, so engagement was high,‚Äù another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/1dyblr3/comment/lc7d105/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>user added</u></a>. ‚ÄúIf you're gonna make me pay every time and THEN grind my ass off then that's it brother.‚Äù</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I‚Äôm glad apex legends in season 22 otherwise known as shockwave is finally changing the battlepass. At least a little bit. Only problem is they are charging double and introduced splits to the battlepass. I hate EA.

So if we pay the $10, we have access to both splits? Because that's not very clear. I'm not giving anymore than that because that's how it's been for over 5 years... also, if I can't use already earned coins to help pay for the Battle Pass, I won't support it at all</p>‚Äî Corey Cooper (@MetroidFREAK21) <a href="https://twitter.com/MetroidFREAK21/status/1810331483174797356?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 8, 2024</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-conversation="none" data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">$40 + tax every season for the full battle pass ü•∏</p>‚Äî Esidi (@esidixo) <a href="https://twitter.com/esidixo/status/1810330636567159048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 8, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Apex Legends was released in 2019 and has continued to evolve in the half-decade since its launch with more playable Legends, weapons, abilities, maps, and game modes. Though the ability to purchase battle passes with coins is on the way out, players can still use them on Legends, Apex Packs, and more in the in-game store.</p><p>EA adds that players will be able to unlock the first half of Season 22‚Äôs premium battle pass offerings by completing ‚Äúa set of challenges‚Äù within the first two weeks of launch. It‚Äôs currently unclear what these challenges entail or if this method will be available in future seasons.

However, when you turn on features like RGB lighting‚Äîthe earbud‚Äôs Razer logo lights up‚Äîits battery life drops. </p><h2>Gaming Headset FAQ</h2><h3>What Type of Headset is Best For Gaming?</h3><p>Similar to other peripherals, like a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-gaming-mouse"><u>gaming mouse</u></a> or <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-gaming-keyboard"><u>gaming keyboard</u></a>, it‚Äôs always up for debate whether you should go for a wired or wireless headset. Wired always seemed to be the most reliable option, given the plug-and-play, direct connection to the device ensures latency isn‚Äôt a problem. But wireless headsets have almost conquered this issue in recent years thanks to the easy-to-use 2.4GHz dongle that slots into your console or PC, providing almost completely lossless audio. Though, there‚Äôs always the possibility of signal interference. </p><p>Battery life should also come into consideration. Of course, it‚Äôs a nonissue on wired headsets, while many wireless headsets offer a decent battery life, lasting 25+ hours, making recharging less of a chore. </p><p>Extra time and money are often spent on adding wireless functionality to headsets. That means you may sacrifice sound quality and features on cheaper wireless offerings. Budget wired headsets often don‚Äôt fall victim to those same problems. </p><p>Though that cable seems to give wired headsets a slight advantage over wireless, it does mean you‚Äôre tethered to your gaming device. If you like to move around or get overly excited during a match, there‚Äôs a chance of yanking it right out of the console. Wireless headsets give you much more freedom to move around and even offer features that let you connect to multiple devices, so you can listen to music while still hearing all the action on screen. Luckily, many headsets these days offer both wired and wireless connection options. </p><h3>Are Headsets Good for Streaming? </h3><p>Gaming headsets are a viable option for streaming. You just need to be sure you‚Äôve got one with a quality microphone. Many gaming headsets come with boom mics, which place a microphone just below your mouth, making it easier to pick up your voice for a clear line of communication while keeping your hands free. There‚Äôs also often technology that ensures only your voice is picked up and not distracting sounds in your environment. You can even play around with mic sound settings on many headsets using companion apps to get the best sound for your broadcast.</p><p>However, the sound quality of a headset‚Äôs built-in mic will still pale in comparison to stand-alone <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-microphone"><u>streaming microphones</u></a> with their wide frequency response, high sample rate, bit-depth, and extensive software. But these microphones do require a more involved setup, including finding the proper placement for the best sound during a stream. You may even need to purchase a separate boom arm to hold the mic in an ideal position. Gaming headsets are a much easier-to-use plug-and-stream option that requires a slight sacrifice to audio quality. </p><h3>Do You Need a Bluetooth Adapter for Wireless Gaming Headsets? </h3><p>Many wireless gaming headsets offer two wireless connectivity options: a 2.4 GHz dongle that you slot into your PC or console and Bluetooth. A wireless dongle is often the ideal choice when gaming, as it has less latency than Bluetooth. But in some cases, Bluetooth may be your only option. </p><p>Luckily, most pre-built gaming PCs and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-gaming-laptop"><u>gaming laptops</u></a> have Bluetooth support baked-in, making it easy to connect your gaming headset. However, if your PC's motherboard lacks a Bluetooth card or its current Bluetooth version is dated and doesn‚Äôt offer a reliable connection, grabbing one of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-bluetooth-adapters-for-pc"><u>best Bluetooth adapters for PC</u></a> is a simple solution to quickly and wirelessly pair your headset, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pc-controller"><u>PC controller</u></a>, and other peripherals. </p><h2 id="ukgamingheadset">Where to Get the Best Gaming Headset in the UK</h2><p>You definitely need a quality gaming headset if you're looking to take your favourite hobby even remotely seriously.

So, when you're shopping for a gaming headset there are a few key specs you should look out for.</p><p>The first is the size of the drivers, which follows the rule of bigger is better. Drivers are the internal mechanism inside headsets and headphones (or really any speaker) that ultimately create the soundwaves you hear by vibrating back and forth in response to an electrical current.</p><p>The larger the driver, the more air they can move to not only to make louder sounds, but it also allows them to produce a wider, more nuanced range of frequencies‚Äîwhich happens to take us to our next specification.</p><a href="https://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2019/06/DSCF5079-720x405.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Frequency response is another important spec, and it's the range of frequencies the headset can reproduce. On the low-end, most gaming headsets hit a minimum of 20Hz and a maximum of 20,000Hz. As you go from the bottom of the range to the top, sounds go from a low thud to a warm, steady hum and finally a piercing screech.</p><p>While on the hunt for a gaming headset, you'll likely find more than a few promising 5.1 or 7.1 channel surround sound, which are both designed to give users a more immersive audio experience. 5.1 surround places speakers directly in front of you, front right, front left, back right, back left and adds a subwoofer to relay bass. 7.1 surround gives you the same setup as 5.1 surrounds, but it adds two more speakers to your immediate right and left.</p><a href="https://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2019/06/DSCF5242-720x405.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Dolby Atmos and DTS Headphone:X (2.0) are two specially branded types of surround sound you'll also likely encounter. They both essentially do the same thing of adding positional audio for effects for objects like say a plane flying over or a bomb falling from the sky above you.</p><p>Now while surround sound on a headset is cool, it's not exactly the same as having a real multi-speaker system, like some of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-soundbar">best soundbars</a> offer. In fact, the majority of gaming headsets employ virtual surround sound‚Äîwhich is to say they're faking it with mathematical algorithms. </p><p>But just because the surround sound you hear on a gaming headset is fake, doesn't mean you shouldn't enjoy it or doubt its ability to create an immersive environment.</p><p>The fact that surround sound can be virtualized also means you can get it on any gaming headset even if it only has two channels. On Windows 10 you can download the Windows Sonic for Headphones app and get 3D spatial audio from even the most basic set of stereo headphones.</p><h2>Gaming Headsets vs. Headphones</h2><p>The line between gaming headsets and headphones has blurred significantly in recent years. There are still distinct differences between the peripherals that make one better for gaming and the other ideal for listening to audio. We discuss those below. </p><p><strong>Connectivity: </strong>The <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-wireless-gaming-headset"><u>best wireless gaming headsets</u></a> offer a 2.4GHz dongle that‚Äôll slot into your PC or gaming console, delivering a latency-free connection to ensure you never miss audio cues in a game. Beyond the dongle, you‚Äôll also often get Bluetooth to listen on other devices, and many offer a wired lag-free connection, too. As for <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-wireless-bluetooth-headphones"><u>wireless headphones</u></a>, you‚Äôre usually just limited to Bluetooth, and there‚Äôs always a bit of latency that comes with it, which could make or break you in a gaming setting. However, some higher-end headphones do offer a wired connection to devices, making lag less of an issue, but you‚Äôll be tethered to the device. </p><p><strong>Audio: </strong>Headphones, for the most part, deliver a neutral, well-balanced sound, so a high-end pair of headphones is what most audiophiles will grab for listening to music or movies. Gaming headsets often offer a punchy, brighter listening experience, but with cheaper headsets, this can lead to a muddy sound, which isn‚Äôt as much of a problem on budget headphones. Where gaming headsets take the cake is spatial audio support, often having some form of it baked in, making it easier to place enemies in a game based on sound cues for an edge over the competition. </p><p><strong>Microphones:</strong> Many gaming headsets come with boom mics that help keep a clear line of communication between you and your teammates, thanks to an arm placed just below your mouth. This extension is often removable or can at least fold out of the way when not in use. Headphones typically use beamforming mics, which hide the microphones away in the earcups and use processing technology to pick up your voice over the sounds in your environment. Gaming headsets have a leg up in this category, but neither compare to a standalone microphone. </p><p><strong>Design:</strong> If you want audio controls on your earcups, gaming headsets are the way to go. You‚Äôll often find buttons for mute, game-chat mix, audio presets, and a volume dial on higher-end sets for easy adjustments in the heat of the action. However, they are often bulky and give off major gamer vibes, especially with a boom mic attached, making them less practical for use outside the battle station. Headphones, on the other hand, look sleeker and have more simplified controls. A premium pair of headphones will also last longer than most gaming headsets, as headsets are usually less expensive with more features that can fail over time.  </p><p><em>Danielle Abraham is a freelance writer who loves all things tech with a special passion for sound.

                <p dir="ltr">The asymmetrical horror genre has exploded in recent years. Formerly a space inhabited by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dead-by-daylight/" data-ref-id="5000-452548">Dead By Daylight</a> (DBD) almost exclusively, it now includes several major counterparts, such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-texas-chain-saw-massacre/" data-ref-id="5000-547380">The Texas Chain Saw Massacre</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/killer-klowns-from-outer-space-the-game/" data-ref-id="5000-570897">Killer Klowns From Outer Space</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hunt-showdown/" data-ref-id="5000-283965">Hunt: Showdown</a>. Go a level deeper, and many horror-adjacent games, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/predator-hunting-grounds/" data-ref-id="5000-496361">Predator: Hunting Grounds</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ghostbusters-spirits-unleashed/" data-ref-id="5000-561168">Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed</a>, capture similar gameplay mechanics in less spooky settings. The genre is old enough now that a number of competitors have come and gone already, such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/friday-the-13th-the-game/" data-ref-id="5000-350279">Friday The 13th</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/evil-dead-the-game/" data-ref-id="5000-523752">Evil Dead</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">One name dedicated players may recall is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/last-year-the-nightmare/" data-ref-id="5000-485614">Last Year: The Nightmare</a>. Originally, the 5v1 horror game was developed around the same time as Dead By Daylight, with crowdfunding kicking off way back in 2014. In some alternate universe, it might today be DBD's biggest competitor. But a slew of unfortunate circumstances led to the game never quite establishing a solid foundation.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Forest Hills: The Last Year - Official Teaser #3 | Fear Never Dies</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Launching in 2018 exclusively on Discord during the brief period in which the messaging app tried (and failed) to take on Steam as a PC gaming marketplace made community-building highly improbable. Players rejected the Steam alternative, as they tend to with seemingly all others, which, for a multiplayer game like Last Year: The Nightmare, was a death knell. In 2019, a move to reinvent the game for Steam with a new name, Last Year: Afterdark, also wasn't able to capture the attention of more than a small, albeit passionate, group of players. In 2020, the pandemic led to a prospective publishing deal collapsing at the eleventh hour, which tore up the game's content roadmap. Combined, these unfortunate missteps ultimately killed the studio, Elastic Games.</p><p dir="ltr">But from its ashes has risen Undaunted Games, a studio composed of about 20 people, some of whom worked on earlier games in the franchise. Together, they're making <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/forest-hills-the-last-year/" data-ref-id="5000-622860">Forest Hills: The Last Year</a>, technically the third attempt to turn this franchise into a hit, only this time without the baggage of its predecessors. The name, Undaunted, comes from the team's refusal to quit on this particular IP, studio head Matthew Itovitch told me in a recent conversation. This is emblematic of the team's wider and unwavering intent to get its asymmetrical horror game into the pantheon with the genre's titans.</p><p dir="ltr">"The reason we originally picked up the [intellectual] property is that we've always had faith in The Last Year," Itovitch told me, adding that Undaunted feels the game at the core of this years-long saga still "has really good bones." Forest Hills: The Last Year is made under the assumption that such a future is still possible. Thus, keeping the original name in the game's title is a nod to the core of players who saw similar potential in earlier iterations. The team isn't running from the name.</p><p dir="ltr">"We're still paying homage to the original content that was there that people grew to love as they were playing it," brand coordinator Brooke Eyler told me. "But in addition to that, it's <em>Forest Hills</em>: The Last Year. We are expanding; it's not just a school anymore. It's a town. There are multiple locations you can explore. It's not just a singular instance of play. It's an entire world now."</p><p dir="ltr">Forest Hills takes advantage of Unreal Engine 5, including some of its most dazzling features like Lumen lighting, which Eyler said should make the game "more immersive" than the past versions. The game will forego an early-access period and launch directly into 1.0 on Steam this October, with seven maps, six Fiends (killers), seven Displaced (survivors), and more new features never before seen in the franchise.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4330007-belltower-teamfightvsgiant.png" data-ref-id="1300-4330007" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4330007-belltower-teamfightvsgiant.png" data-ref-id="1300-4330007"></a><figcaption>Typical high school problems include homework, SATs, dating, and fending off relentless monsters.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4330007-belltower-teamfightvsgiant.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">The team has already laid out a content roadmap that is "pretty much planned all the way to 2026," Eyler revealed. Ramping up with better tech, as well as more maps, heroes, and monsters, seems like the right idea, especially since Forest Hills will debut in a genre much more crowded than it was when the franchise first tried to plant its flag. "The space is very crowded," Eyler said, "but I think it's important to recognize how different all of these games are." In terms of mechanics, atmosphere, and objectives, there really is a lot of variety.</p><p dir="ltr">So what sets Forest Hills apart? "You think of cult classics, you think of '90s slashers, how they have these cult followings of people who are so invested in them and think of them so fondly," she said. "We're leaning into the camp of '90s horror, and we're leaning into fostering those communities within our own personal space so that you can hop on the game, you can play with your friends, and you can feel not only like you're involved in this horror setting, but also like you can laugh about it alongside your friends as well."</p><p dir="ltr">Eyler didn't cite specifics, but seasoned players are likely familiar with toxicity in the genre. Dead By Daylight's community has a reputation for being hostile and "sweaty." I recently went back to it myself after some time away and received hate-mail immediately after my first match, which I found to be a bit too on-the-nose.</p><p dir="ltr">I wondered what causes these PvP horror games to get that way sometimes--DBD isn't alone; it's just the most notorious--and what, if anything, Forest Hills might do to prevent hostility in its community now that it finally has a chance to properly build one. "We're leaning into that humor [and] levity. And hopefully, the levity is able to buoy it above any kind of toxicity that might be laying underneath," Eyler told me.</p><p dir="ltr">In Forest Hills, survivors can work together to craft things in the game such as weapons and support items, and they can even fight back to take down the killer, which isn't often an option in games like this. The team hopes these mechanics may also lend themselves to fostering a healthier, happier community of horror fans.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4330008-library-strangler-stalking.png" data-ref-id="1300-4330008" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4330008-library-strangler-stalking.png" data-ref-id="1300-4330008"></a><figcaption>The Fiend will oppose a team of five players, but they'll have special abilities and AI allies on their side.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4330008-library-strangler-stalking.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">"We're trying to encourage people to work together, "she continued. "Whereas maybe in other games, it's very killer-versus-this and if I'm bad as the killer, it means I'm bad. If I'm not killing them, it means I'm bad. So I have to do whatever it takes to tear them down. And this isn't about tearing people down. This is about having fun. It's about helping not only yourself, but helping your team to get out because you're not helpless. In Forest Hills, you can fight back, and I think that does lend itself to a bit more cooperation, and a competitive spirit that might be a bit more fun because the killer doesn't feel overbearingly powerful."</p><p dir="ltr">That crafting system is uncommon in this genre, and it's joined by other uncommon or unique mechanics. For players controlling the villain, they'll be able to swap among a few different killers mid-round. This allows for greater gameplay variety, as the ghostly warlock offers different strengths and weaknesses than the venomous spider or the relentless slasher, each of which can counter or be countered by the opposing team on the fly. It reminds me of moments in a hero shooter when a particular character or team composition isn't cutting it, so you switch it up to approach the bout from a new angle.</p><p dir="ltr">Even those surviving teens, each of them playing off of high-school tropes like the jock, the nerd, and the popular girl, are decoupled from specific builds, so two versions of the same character may play quite differently, which should even the playing field when the monster on the other side thinks they know who they're getting in any given round.</p><p dir="ltr">With several misfortunes in its past, Forest Hills clearly has the franchise's best shot to date to make a name for itself. Despite the franchise's "good bones," The Last Year is a name previously associated with false starts and failed do-overs. Now, however, on a new engine, on the right platform, fostering a good-natured community, and offering a lot more content out of the gate, Forest Hills: The Last Year could embody the spirit of an unkillable slasher. Just when you think it's dead and gone, it's resurrected and bloodthirsty once more.</p><p dir="ltr">Forest Hills: The Last Year is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2864310/Forest_Hills_The_Last_Year/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">coming to Steam</a> on October 22, with a console launch planned for 2025.</p>
