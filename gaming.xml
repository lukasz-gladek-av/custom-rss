A source close to the project has told IGN that the Sleeping Dogs movie <em>is </em>in development, and we’re hearing Simu Liu, who plays Shang-Chi in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/shang-chi-and-the-legend-of-the-ten-rings">Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings</a>, is producing and set to play the lead role of Wei Shen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has asked Square Enix for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sleeping-dogs">Sleeping Dogs</a> was first released in 2012 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC and tells the story of detective Wei Shen as he infiltrates one of Hong Kong's notorious Triad crime syndicates. While it failed to meet publisher Square Enix's lofty sales expectations, it is much-loved by fans and sequel hopes have followed it ever since.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/01/sleeping-dogs-1738448345955.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Sleeping Dogs is set for a wake-up call with a movie adaptation. Image credit: Square Enix.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/03/donnie-yen-to-star-in-sleeping-dogs-video-game-adaptation"><u>The original adaptation was announced in 2017</u></a> with Donnie Yen set to star, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/02/05/sleeping-dogs-movie-donnie-yen-confirms-its-still-in-production"><u>the film disappeared a year later</u></a> and, just a few weeks ago, Yen himself confirmed it had been scrapped.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I spent a lot of time and did a lot of work with these producers, and I even invested some of my own money into obtaining the drafts and some of the rights," Yen told <a href="https://www.polygon.com/action/506279/sleeping-dogs-movie-donnie-yen-release-update" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polygon</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I waited for years. Years. And I really want to do it. I have all these visions in my head, and unfortunately… I don’t know, you know how Hollywood goes, right? I spent many, many years on it. It was an unfortunate thing. Well, on to better things."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So when Liu tweeted to say he was working to make the Sleeping Dogs movie a reality, there was a degree of confusion among fans. Liu himself followed up with <a href="https://x.com/SimuLiu/status/1885252869483340236" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another statement</a> that added fuel to the fire, and even revealed his intention to help bring a Sleeping Dogs video game sequel to life.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So few film projects make it from pitch phase to greenlight,” he said. “Pitching execs who don’t understand the game has been tiring. Everyone’s overwhelming love of Sleeping Dogs here has really given us life!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“First a movie, then a sequel game for everyone… that’s always been the dream.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings: Who's Who in the Cast</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN can reveal that Story Kitchen is leading the Sleeping Dogs live action feature film project, with Square Enix the rights holder in question. Story Kitchen has form when it comes to video game adaptations, having worked on everything from the Sonic the Hedgehog films to Netflix’s animated Tomb Raider series. It’s currently working on the upcoming Streets of Rage adaptation and an adaptation of It Takes Two for Amazon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/just-cause-movie-announced-with-blue-beetle-director-at-the-helm">Story Kitchen announced a film adaptation of Square Enix's Just Cause</a>, with Blue Beetle director Ángel Manuel Soto signed on. IGN understands the Sleeping Dogs project has a writer and major filmmaker attached to the project, but there’s no release date or word on when production will begin just yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The movie marks a significant revival for Sleeping Dogs, which saw its video game sequel canceled in late 2013 before it entered production, and its original developer, United Front Games, shut down three years later. Now, over a decade later, Sleeping Dogs could finally be set for a wake-up call.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

<p>Atlanta FaZe just secured a 3 – 0 victory over Toronto Ultra to push one step forward at the CDL Madrid Major. The massive victory forced Ultra into the elimination bracket to square off against the Royal Ravens – their last chance at staying in the running.</p>



<p>Following the sweep of a match, I sat down with Atlanta FaZe’s Tyler ‘aBeZy’ Pharris and McArthur ‘Cellium’ Jovel to talk about their nine-game win streak, playing more aggressively this season, and how they bounced back from a rough start.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-i-was-underperforming">‘I Was Underperforming’</h2>



<p>Atlanta FaZe didn’t have the cleanest start to the 2025 CDL season. The squad suffered a 0 – 3 loss in a qualifying stage for the first time since May 2023. That decisive defeat was handed down by the Carolina Royal Ravens, a team that has been on fire so far in 2025.</p>



<p>From there, FaZe lost three matches back-to-back-to-back before taking a break and turning things around. Presently, the team is on a near-historic nine-match win streak, almost refusing to drop a map in any series.</p>



<p>I caught up with Cellium and aBeZy to chat about the change-up:</p>



<p><em><strong>Cellium: </strong>For me personally, I was underperforming really badly. There were a lot of internal team talks about how we play the game and how we think about everything, and I think it definitely helped us improve over the break. Everyone is on the same page now and we trust each other.</em></p>



<p><em><strong>aBeZy: </strong>We had a team talk after the break, leading after the Falcons match that we won. We put everything on the table and after that, we’ve just been firing on all cylinders. Like he said, we just trust each other in every situation that we’re in and we’re just frying.</em></p>



<p>The talk turned to a recent comment made by Drazah, who wasn’t present for the chat. He’d previously said that ATL would take on ‘anyone, anytime’, suggesting the strategy had now turned to aggression. I asked aBeZy and Cellium if that was the case:</p>



<p><em><strong>aBeZy: </strong>Yeah, 100%. I don’t think it matters who we play. I feel like if we’re playing at our best, I feel like no one can beat us.</em></p>



<p>Cellium mirrored that sentiment, echoing with the claim: <em>‘I just think we’re the best team right now, by a mile.’</em></p>



<p>For the third time in two days, I asked the Call of Duty League pros what they thought about the crowds supporting the tournament here in Madrid. Thus far, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/optic-shotzzy-wants-more-eu-majors-thanks-to-madrid-crowd/">OpTic Texas</a> and LA Thieves have agreed that the EU crowds are on another level compared to NA, and that was supported by the Atlanta FaZe guys:</p>



<p><em><strong>aBeZy</strong>: I think EU crowds are insane … Even this crowd is <strong>crazy</strong>.</em></p>



<p><em><strong>Cellium: </strong>Both times I’ve went to Europe so far, it has been amazing. I would use the EU crowd is insane.</em></p>



<p>Atlanta FaZe now pushes into the winner’s final against the LA Thieves, which is set to take place tomorrow evening. The loser of that match will be pushed down into the elimination bracket for a final chance to go forward, and they’ll be taking on either Toronto, Carolina, Miami, or Minnesota.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/lat-scrap-and-ghosty-interview-cdl-super-team/</link>

<p>The LA Thieves just destroyed the Miami Heretics on (sort of) home turf, pushing them down into the elimination bracket following a complete sweep. The 3 – 0 scoreline was probably easy enough to predict, but it came a little closer than some would have expected, with the Heretics putting up a considerable fight.</p>



<p>In the aftermath of the win, which pushed LA Thieves further towards the grand final, I caught up with Dan ‘Ghosty’ Rothe and Thomas ‘Scrap’ Ernst to learn how they were handling the expectations of being the CDL’s ‘Super Team’ this season.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-shouldering-it">Shouldering It</h2>



<p>For the opener, I asked Scrap and Ghosty whether they felt extra pressure trying to live up to these lofty expectations and whether they believed they <strong>had</strong>. In the run-up to the CDL kicking off, the LA Thieves’ squad was billed as being a Super Team, with Nadeshot making it very public (even if in jest) just how much securing the talented roster had cost the organisation.</p>



<p>Here’s what they had to say:</p>



<p><em><strong>Ghosty: </strong>I feel like there’s always a sense of pressure as a competitor to be the best version you can be. There’s definitely more external pressure from other teams, fans, whatever – but it still doesn’t amount to the personal pressure you put on yourself as a competitor.</em></p>



<p><em><strong>Scrap: </strong>For myself, from how much shit I talk, there’s just pressure from the whole community on me, no matter what team I play for. People can call us a Super Team, yeah, I’ll call myself a Super Team because <strong>my team is godlike</strong>. You know, we have pressure on us, but we go into every match taking no-one lightly.</em></p>



<p>Following that, Scrap walked me through his growth in the CDL since entering the League as a rookie during the MWII season. He was painted as (and loved being) the villain, going on a notorious arc that set his profile ablaze.</p>



<p><em><strong>Scrap: </strong>I don’t think I’ll ever change. Honestly, I’m just being myself up on that stage, to be honest. If it comes out, it comes out. I feel like over the past couple of years in the League I’ve grown into more of a leadership role of a sort, not like the kid that just flies around. Now that I’m on a younger team that has a lot of young players and I’m just trying to work as best around them.</em></p>



<p>Like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/optic-shotzzy-wants-more-eu-majors-thanks-to-madrid-crowd/">OpTic Texas’ Shotzzy</a>, the pair agreed that the crowd in Madrid is one of the most energetic they’ve ever seen, and they are ‘down for some more’ EU tournaments.</p>

So I hopped down to a part that wasn’t on fire, turned around, and used my magical powers to grab a piece of the burning scaffolding and launched it back at the monster, doing enough damage to kill it. I felt extremely cool in that moment. Then I ran across a piece of debris that had landed on the platform and my character’s physics got weird and I fell off the tower to the ground below, where I stood alive, but damaged.

            <p>A new report now suggests that some BioWare staff "loaned" to other EA studios will not be returning.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, amid reports of potential layoffs at BioWare, studio general manager <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-confirms-many-staff-moved-elsewhere-in-ea-as-core-team-focuses-on-mass-effect-5-in-downsized-studio">Gary McKay has confirmed "many" employees have now been moved elsewhere in EA</a> following the completion of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> - and that a remaining core team is fully focused on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect-5">Mass Effect 5</a>.</p>
<p>Now, however, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-01-31/electronic-arts-slashes-bioware-after-dragon-age-sales-miss">Bloomberg</a> is reporting that the "loans" made by BioWare to support EA teams elsewhere have now "morphed into permanent relocations".</p>

<p>According to Bloomberg sources and "people familiar with what happened", staff are no longer BioWare employees "temporarily on assignment elsewhere" but, in fact, now work for whichever EA subsidiary had borrowed them.</p>
<p>"If they want to work at BioWare again in the future, they would have to look for job openings and re-apply," Bloomberg stated.</p>
<p>"This was an unwelcome development for some of the employees, who now find themselves on brand-new teams at studios they’d never planned to join. Some had come to BioWare to work on storied role-playing game franchises and found the idea of working on action or sports games less appealing."</p>
<p>This means BioWare has seemingly halved its 200 headcount to around 100 in just two years.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/603938/off-rpg-translation-interview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>In 2008, Mortis Ghost made a game with his friend, composer Alias Conrad Coldwood. It was <a href="https://offtherpg.com/">a surreal roleplaying game about a baseball player fighting ghosts called <em>Off</em></a>. He shared it for free on a French-speaking forum, where it garnered a small audience. One player was a French artist who was inspired to make a piece of fan art, which she shared with her then-girlfriend. “I was very intrigued,” says Quinn K, now a writer and game developer. At the time, she was a 15-year-old living in Austria who had no idea how influential <em>Off</em> would be for her, nor she for <em>Off</em>.</p><p>After beating the game, K lay awake at night thinking about the ending. “Something had gotten its hooks in me,” she says. Wanting to show it to more friends, she resolved to translate the game from French to English — neither of which were her first language. “I wasn’t the right person for the job,” she says. “I was just the person that did it.”</p><p>Fan translation for games is often a tricky process, not just because of linguistics but also technical limitations and potential copyright claims by the original developers. But K knew it was possible to make her version work because there was already a partial translation, and when she contacted Ghost, he gave his approval. With the help of some friends in proofreading and asset creation, she put together a translation of the 10-ish-hour RPG by 2011. She posted it on the forums for a website called Starmen.net, which was popular among fans of the <em>Mother</em> / <em>EarthBound</em> series. K was partially inspired by a <em>Mother 3</em> translation, and other <em>Mother</em> fans quickly connected with the similar vibes in <em>Off</em>. </p><p>After the initial release, K put out an improved version in 2012. By 2013, <em>Off</em> was an “astonishing success,” says Ghost, with users who discovered it on the Starmen forums spreading it via fan creations like art and cosplay to DeviantArt and Tumblr. On the latter, it was the sixth-most-talked-about game of the year, behind major franchises like <em>Pok</em>é<em>mon</em>, <em>Animal Crossing</em>, <em>Kingdom Hearts</em>, <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>, and <em>Mass Effect</em>. Unlike those established hits, <em>Off</em> was free, spread only through word of mouth, and was still clearly finding a devoted audience.</p><p>Despite its popularity, K was aware that the translation wasn’t perfect. “A lot of people rip [it], and I get why,” she says. “It was full of very severe flaws, just born from the fact that I’m neither an English native speaker nor a French native speaker. So it was possible to make mistakes in both languages.” There were also other fans making their own translations or patches that added to K’s work. One of these, released in 2017 by artist <a href="https://ladysaytenn.art/">Lady Saytenn</a>, added an option for the player themselves to be referred to with they / them pronouns.</p><div><p>“It was full of very severe flaws”</p></div><p>“That inspired me so much,” says K. Having had a few years of space from <em>Off</em>, and having improved in both English and French as well as “grown a bit wiser as a person,” she embarked on making a third version of her translation. This time, she collaborated directly with Lady Saytenn, as well as another artist who created image assets, Rosie Brewster.</p><p>K categorizes the second translation as the one that “most millennials” have played, while the third reached a younger wave of fans. K says that she was actually surprised to find that many people who encountered <em>Off</em> through the third translation hold it in high regard because “back when it first came out, that translation was not particularly popular.”</p><p>Some changes were straightforward, like correcting pop culture references that K had been unaware of, as well as an error where she had interpreted the French word femme as “wife,” rather than “woman.” It can mean either, but K’s choice changed the implication of a key line, and Ghost let her know it wasn’t what he originally intended.</p><p>However, some fans felt that the newest translation was overly sanitized; K says she deliberately made some characters “a little less crass” since “a big sign of an inexperienced translator is swearing a lot.” She also removed an instance of the R-slur, which upset “some edgy people.” </p><p>More nuanced was the shift to clearer language and a tendency to stick more closely to the original lines. The 2.0 translation had been vague and sometimes confusing in a way that players appreciated; it seemed to reflect the atmosphere of the game. “The little weirdnesses [in the 2.0 translation] really twist the knife on how strange and off putting the world of the game is,” says K.</p><div><p>“I’m excited to rediscover the game.”</p></div><p>But some of that was down to K’s imperfect French and English, so in the third version, she chose to clarify some lines, leading some players to feel that she had removed an aspect of whimsy and poetry that they had actually enjoyed. </p><p>These are tensions inherent to the act of translation, which is always adaptive. Now that <em>Off</em> is getting an official remaster, there will be a fourth version later this year, and it’s not clear how they’ll balance clarity and atmosphere, as well as its own adaptation, with K’s. The announcement was careful to acknowledge K’s work and says that the remaster will be “based on” K’s translation. She’s also been paid for what was once years of fan labor. But it does seem that the script is in the process of being readapted by professional localizers. (Publisher Fangamer did not respond to requests for confirmation.)</p><p>For K, the readaptation is a good thing. “The one thing I can say from everything I’ve seen of their updated version of the translation is they’ve improved it in every conceivable way,” she says. “I’m excited to rediscover the game.”</p><p>On the other hand, “it’s a strange feeling to be most well known for the work that you did on somebody else’s work,” says K, who has made several of her own games and is now working on <a href="https://blanksword.carrd.co/"><em>Blanksword</em></a>, a roguelike RPG “very strongly inspired by <em>Off</em>.” Ghost, too, says he’s changed a lot in the 17 years since <em>Off</em>’s original release. “I am of course very proud to have produced a game that has touched so many people, but I think that the game now belongs much more to the community,” he says. He is currently working on a new game called <em>Help</em>.</p><p>The remake won’t just feature an improved script but will also have updated combat mechanics, new animations, and some additional content written by Ghost. The goal was to “completely preserve the original atmosphere, while polishing everything that could be [polished],” he says. As with all remakes, this will be a difficult balancing act; adding in the complex adaptive work of translation, there will always be divided opinions over which of the now four major versions is the best.</p><p>But K’s efforts undeniably made <em>Off</em> what it is today, and the remake acknowledging and building on that history is a rare step in an industry where fan translations are usually unacknowledged at best and taken down at worst.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It turns out <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/forza_horizon_5" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forza Horizon 5</a> is the first to make the jump, having been officially revealed for Sony's current-gen system with a Spring 2025 release window. Unsurprisingly, fans have been <em>very</em> opinionated about the announcement ever since it dropped.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's even heartbreak over the decision to move such a treasured Xbox exclusive over to its rival console, but truthfully it's something we've been expecting for a while now. If you read between the lines, Phil Spencer and the team at Xbox have subtly tried to inform us about the <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2024/11/xbox-boss-says-everything-is-on-the-table-when-it-comes-to-ps5-ports" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"no red lines"</a> rule when it comes to exclusives these days, which most likely means that Halo, Gears, <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/starfield" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Starfield</a> and many other Xbox franchises will be heading to PS5 and possibly even Nintendo Switch 2 sooner or later.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But why do this? Why risk alienating loyal fans who have aligned themselves with the Xbox brand <em>because</em> of its exclusives? The answer almost certainly lies in the numbers. We've seen time and again how hardware revenue has declined for Microsoft, while income from <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/01/xbox-hardware-declines-but-content-and-services-grows-in-fy25-q2-earnings-report" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox content and services has increased</a>. It's no wonder the company's priorities have shifted. This change in strategy means Xbox can focus more on <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/01/xboxs-multiplatform-releases-made-microsoft-the-top-game-publisher-in-the-world-last-month" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">becoming a publishing behemoth</a> while also making its games accessible to more players on all platforms.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this year Spencer talked about <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/01/xbox-is-evolving-rather-than-losing-its-identity-says-phil-spencer" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox having "evolved" its identity</a> in order to continue thriving amidst challenging times for the industry. Furthermore, he believes Xbox's new approach would be best adopted by the masses, to allow major developers and publishers to keep making high-budget AAA games. <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/01/xbox-has-right-approach-to-exclusives-and-playstation-may-follow-suggests-ori-dev" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moon Studios CEO Thomas Mahler recently agreed</a> with this idea, suggesting that, due to rising game development costs, the industry can only grow if it starts reducing its reliance on exclusives.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, it helps when those former <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/guides/best-xbox-exclusives" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox exclusives</a> actually sell in big numbers. Back in February 2024, Xbox announced that <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/hi-fi_rush" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hi-Fi RUSH</a>, <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-one/sea_of_thieves" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sea Of Thieves</a>, <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/pentiment" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pentiment</a> and <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-one/grounded" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Grounded</u></a> would be heading to other systems, and we quickly discovered PlayStation and Nintendo owners had an appetite for games they previously couldn't play. Sea of Thieves, in particular, has become a massive success on PS5, and <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2024/06/xbox-exec-talks-multiplatform-strategy-team-really-pleased-with-sea-of-thieves-on-ps5" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft hasn't been shy in highlighting that fact</a>. That said, there was also criticism for suggesting <em>only</em> four titles would make the jump, which inevitably was never going to be the case once PlayStation owners started flocking to them in droves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that is the biggest issue I have with Xbox's new strategy at this point. Xbox has embarked on a major marketing campaign claiming <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2024/11/phil-spencer-explains-why-this-is-an-xbox-will-be-beneficial-to-console-owners" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">every device "is an Xbox"</a>, and everyone seems to have understood that message by now. However, it's never <em>really</em> explained what's happening with games going to PS5 and Switch. Initially it was four games, followed by a couple more, and eventually it might (okay, probably will) be Xbox's entire catalogue. Xbox fans still don't have a <em>truly</em> clear picture of what to anticipate, aside from rumours and the occasional hint from Phil Spencer.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Will Microsoft be able to sell hardware without major exclusives as a sweetener, and can&nbsp;Xbox Game Pass&nbsp;shift enough systems on its own?</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Forza Horizon 5's debut on PS5 may feel like a new era or even the beginning of the end for some Xbox fans, but really it's just the evolution of a strategy that's been underway for some time – a strategy that's set to be very profitable in 2025. <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/features/reaction-like-it-or-not-xbox-has-gone-full-throttle-on-multiplatform" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The multiplatform push is in full swing</a>, and even though Microsoft clearly doesn't want to give us much of a roadmap, we're bound to see more <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/features/xbox-game-studios-all-microsoft-first-party-developers-and-what-theyre-working-on" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox first-party titles</a> on PS5, Nintendo Switch 2 and other platforms before the end of the year. It'll be fantastic from a business and industry perspective, but obviously sad for those who'd prefer Xbox to keeps its games down as exclusives.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also no telling how it'll fare in the long run. What happens when the <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/guides/next-xbox-console-everything-we-know-so-far-about-microsofts-next-gen-system" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">next Xbox console</a> rolls around? What about the <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/guides/xbox-handheld-everything-we-know-so-far-including-the-latest-rumours" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox handheld</a>? Will Microsoft be able to sell hardware without major exclusives as a sweetener, and can <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/guides/xbox-game-pass-in-2025-the-full-list-of-everything-announced-so-far" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox Game Pass</a> shift enough systems on its own? I have no doubt Phil Spencer has thought about these questions and more and, hopefully, has answers to them. But there's a feeling of unease throughout the Xbox community right now, and Xbox will have to work harder than ever to keep its loyal fans coming back in the future. I just hope that's enough because Xbox is changing, forever.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Fraser Gilbert is the Editor of </em><a href="https://www.purexbox.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Pure Xbox</em></a><em>.</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3><div data-cy="carousel"><p><h2 data-cy="title1">Pure Xbox Column</h2></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

If you want to know what platformers you can expect this year, make sure to check out this list for some of our most anticipated platformers of 2025. So far, there haven't been many major platformers released, but you can expect some great indie titles on this list among some familiar faces.

<figure></figure>

<h2>Revenge of the Savage Planet - May (PlayStation, Xbox, PC)</h2>
<p>Journey to the Savage Planet was well-received, and Revenge of the Savage Planet is the <a href="https://wccftech.com/raccoon-logic-showcases-revenge-of-the-savage-planet-featuring-co-op-modes-new-pois-several-additions/">sequel to that title</a>, bringing you back into the fun, satirical sci-fi world. You'll get to traverse alien worlds while getting gear upgrades and uncovering secrets of the worlds that you traverse. Even the trailer itself is dripping in satire and comedy. You're bound to be in for a good time with this one.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Little Nightmares 3 - June (PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, PC)</h2>
<p>When it comes to horror franchises, Little Nightmares is beloved by many. While it isn't particularly full of jumpscares, there are small details that make the game intense and horrifying. The third installment in the franchise is set to release in June, and this will be the first time that the franchise will have the option for full co-op throughout the game. Previously, the games were single-player, despite often telling a tale of two characters throughout the game. Make sure to put this one on your wishlist.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>MainFrames - March 6 (Nintendo Switch, PC)</h2>
<p>If you've been wanting to get that hit of nostalgia that comes from old PCs from the 90s, then this is a game you'll want to check out. It's an adorable little platformer set to release on March 6, where you play as a Floppy Disk and explore the ins and outs of a PC, taking you on a variety of journeys through mini-games and puzzles. It's set to be a cozy platformer, so stay tuned for the release of this one.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>A Webbing Journey - TBA</h2>
<p>Be warned, as this one isn't for the arachnophobes out there. However, if you've found yourself wanting to become a spider and swing around the house while building webbed structures, this is the game for you. It combines platforming, physics, and wholesome sandbox goodness. While it doesn't have a release date just yet, the game is already out on iOS and Android.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Yooka-Replaylee - TBA</h2>
<p>While you could just play the original version of Yooka-Laylee as that still stands up as a fantastic game, Yooka-Replaylee will be an enhanced version of the loved platformer, adding in new challenges and content to play with, as well as new secrets to uncover. If you are a fan of Spyro the Dragon or Crash Bandicoot, you'll definitely want to check out Yooka-Replaylee.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered - February 14 (PlayStation, PC, Nintendo Switch, Xbox)</h2>
<p>What's a platformer without Lara Croft? For those who didn't get to experience the greatness of Tomb Raider 4 through 6, the remasters are just days away. It's set to release on Valentine's Day, so why not make it the gift to yourself, getting to see Lara in HD again? Angel of Darkness will be getting a huge revamp, and a lot of people will be playing it for the first time ever.</p>

                <p>Way back in the day, the original Mass Effect was my favorite video game. I played it more than a dozen times before Mass Effect 2 came out, eager to immerse myself in BioWare's slick new space opera and its cosmic mysteries. I was pretty young back then in 2007, still a college kid who wasn't old enough to legally drink alcohol, and a longtime Star Wars nerd dealing with how much I hated the prequel movies. Mass Effect hit the spot.</p><p dir="ltr">Cut to a couple decades later. I've just finished reading a series of novels, dubbed the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B087RSGKS3?binding=paperback&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Revelation Space</a> series after the first book, by Welsh author Alastair Reynolds. In the early Aughts, Reynolds released a trilogy of these books along with a standalone side novel, a prequel novel, a pair of novellas, and a bunch of short stories. All of these works were set in his own original and extremely weird science-fiction universe that seems to have been extraordinarily influential on the games industry. Having now read them, it's difficult not to see the way that some of Reynolds' best and strangest ideas made their way into all sorts of games--Stellaris, Destiny, Dead Space, Knights of the Old Republic and Mass Effect are some that immediately spring to mind.</p><p dir="ltr">I myself finally got around to reading these books because they are commonly accepted as inspiration for Mass Effect's Reapers. In Mass Effect, the Reapers are a race of ancient machines who periodically pop up to wipe out any galactic civilization that may have risen up. In Revelation Space, published in 2000, we instead have the Inhibitors, a race of ancient machines who periodically pop up to wipe out any galactic civilization that may have risen up. While sci-fi writers have always loved their ancient space civilizations, these are too specifically similar to ignore.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4435674-masseffectreaper.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4435674" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4435674-masseffectreaper.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4435674"></a><figcaption>Mass Effect's Reapers appear to have been inspired by the novel Revelation Space.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4435674-masseffectreaper.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">While Revelation Space's influence on Mass Effect is fairly obvious, I'm not accusing BioWare of plagiarism--like all stories, Mass Effect is a pastiche of a lot of things that came before. It's got as much Star Wars, Babylon 5, and Starship Troopers in its DNA as it does Revelation Space, and Mass Effect is not truly hard sci-fi the way that Revelation Space is. BioWare may have borrowed some concepts from Revelation Space, but it took them all in very different directions. And none of those other directions, in this writer's humble opinion, can hold a candle to Reynolds's vision.</p><p dir="ltr">Revelation Space, as a series, tells the future history of human expansion into the depths of outer space and some of the super bizarre things they find as they go. Thanks to Reynolds's background as an astrophysicist, Revelation Space is a work of "hard" sci-fi that delves deeply into the mechanics of how everything works, even when Reynolds is trying to describe impossible things. That penchant results in an unusual storytelling structure that may not be satisfying in all the usual ways--but it's more a matter of defying convention than it is one of competence.</p><p dir="ltr">Revelation Space is a sprawling series, but the heart of it is a 400-year saga that kicks off in the 26th century at an archaeological dig on a remote planet called Resurgam. The dig concerns an alien race called the Amarantin, who were rendered extinct a million years before, just as they began expanding into space. As we learn a little bit later in the book, the Amarantin were the victims of the Inhibitors, machines that emerge and destroy any civilization advanced enough to leave their home solar system and accidentally trigger any of the signaling devices that the Inhibitors had left all over the galaxy. And while humanity had managed to expand throughout a 20-light year bubble around Earth without yet triggering the Inhibitors, that streak of luck is coming to an end.</p><p dir="ltr">But with Revelation Space's hard sci-fi bent, this conflict is a very long one. One of the key pillars of this universe is that faster-than-light travel isn't possible--those who have tried, in a fun little twist, tend to accidentally delete themselves from history during their attempts. Without any FTL ability, travel between solar systems takes a <em>really</em> long time (like years or decades), and so there's no hopping around all over the universe like it's no big deal.</p><p dir="ltr">Along the way, we dive very deeply into a ton of spectacularly bizarre concepts. We've got alien entities like the Shrouders (beings who live in restructured and compressed regions of spacetime) and the Pattern Jugglers (apparently sentient ocean bacteria that do all sorts of weird and exciting and scary stuff to a human consciousness). We've got the human Conjoiners, who have computers in their heads that allow them a semblance of a hive mind, and who have been communing with future versions of themselves in order to be better prepared for the inevitable arrival of the Inhibitors. There's also a lot of fun cyberpunk concepts within the novels, including conversations about AI, digital consciousness, and all manners of body modifications. And I'd be remiss to not mention the neutron star that houses an alien computer from the beginning of time that a person can only access by having their body physically destroyed.</p><p dir="ltr">It's fair to say that Reynolds did not quite have the storytelling chops to pull off everything he wanted to do with these books--Revelation Space is absurdly ambitious for a first novel. The most common complaint about those early books in particular is their rushed climaxes, but that issue stems, I believe, from Reynolds' intense commitment to thinking everything all the way through. When he's in that mode, natural stopping points simply do not arise because one thing always leads to something else. So his endings are often abrupt and overly neat. But the journey to those endings is always so f**king strange and mind-opening that I can forgive those missteps.</p><p dir="ltr">It's that particular aspect of the Revelation Space universe that, nearly two decades later, is helping me process some residual subconscious frustrations I've long had about the Mass Effect trilogy but didn't know how to articulate. I always felt that Mass Effect 2 was the trilogy's weak link--it has a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-2-tried-something-bold-but-didnt-spark-a-revolution/1100-6529017/">lot of cool individual stories, but they don't add up to anything</a>. Cerberus and the Illusive Man are completely inscrutable and make little sense, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-2s-human-reaper-was-dumb-and-im-sad-we-didnt-get-more-of-it/1100-6520609/">human Reaper</a> is a big wet fart, and you spend the entire game doing side quests that are largely unrelated to the main plot or each other. I understood <em>what</em> parts of that game frustrated me, but I didn't really get the <em>why</em> of it.</p><p dir="ltr">After reading these novels, though, I'm somehow mad about that human Reaper all over again, because now I have a better grasp of what it represents about how the powers-that-be at BioWare chose to tell Mass Effect's story. The premise with the Reapers is that when they wipe out a civilization, they "harvest" the people by breaking them down and uploading their matter to a new Reaper. Mass Effect 2 really doesn't want you to think too hard about this--it presents this process as simply a horror that needs to be stopped by any means. So you shoot the human Reaper until it's dead, and then are presented with a choice of what to do with the corpse that never matters in any way.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4435679-masseffecthumanreaper.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4435679" data-ratio="0.56296296296296" data-width="1350" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4435679-masseffecthumanreaper.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4435679"></a><figcaption>Mass Effect 2's human Reaper idea has aged pretty poorly, and it wasn't particularly well liked to begin with.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4435679-masseffecthumanreaper.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">But the human Reaper would have actually been a really interesting idea if BioWare had followed through with its original idea, which was that the Reapers were actually uploading those people wholesale into a digital construct of some kind--collecting civilizations, more or less intact, and storing them in Reaper form. Mechanically, it's basically the same concept as the neutron star supercomputer from Revelation Space that I mentioned above, but applied in a very different way.</p><p dir="ltr">But Mass Effect never had time for ideas that complex, and the whole concept was gutted. But imagine how much different the ending of Mass Effect 2, not to mention the entirety of the third game, would have been had BioWare been willing to go all the way on just this one concept. It would have fundamentally altered how we dealt with the human Reaper, it probably would have led to some actual understanding about what the Illusive Man and Cerberus are doing, and the entire fight against the rest of the Reapers in Mass Effect 3 would have had a different tenor.</p><p dir="ltr">That, to me, is the real tragedy of Mass Effect, looking back through this new lens. BioWare seems to have borrowed many concepts from Revelation Space, but very little of it is explored with any depth, and none of the ideas are given new twists that improve upon them. The human Reaper could have been one such improvement, giving the Reapers actual character and giving the player an actual reason to consider allowing the Reapers to keep existing at the end of Mass Effect 3.</p><p dir="ltr">But since Mass Effect avoided most of the extra weird stuff, the ending of Mass Effect 3 never really had a chance to be good. The choices presented by the Catalyst at the climax of the trilogy are very big and impactful ones that we are simply unable to process because the groundwork was never laid for them. It didn't matter how much extra exposition they added with the extended cut ending--since BioWare had simplified the rest of the story for the lowest common denominator for three straight games, any ending with actual big ideas was always doomed to feel like some goofy nonsense that came out of left field. Because that's exactly what it was.</p><p dir="ltr">Fortunately, at least some corners of the games industry have matured greatly in the decade since Mass Effect 3 came out. Cyberpunk 2077 is a blockbuster title that goes hard on all the fantastical cyberpunk stuff that Mass Effect dodged, and nowadays I feel about that game the same way I did about Mass Effect in 2007. Cyberpunk 2077 and Revelation Space actually have a lot of commonalities in that regard, since Reynolds's books are chock full of cyberpunk weirdness--and 2077 actually explores those ideas with comparable depth. So that game serves as an excellent primer for Revelation Space, oddly enough.</p><p dir="ltr">But whether you're an old Mass Effect fan who wants a deeper and more interesting version of that story, or a Cyberpunk 2077 fan who's looking to get even weirder, Revelation Space will hit spots in your brain that you didn't even know were there. These books and stories are beautifully bizarre, and must-reads for any sci-fi nerd.</p><h3 dir="ltr">See Revelation Space series at Amazon</h3><p><strong>Main thread</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Revelation-Space-Inhibitor-Trilogy-1/dp/0316462446/?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Revelation Space</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Redemption-Ark-Inhibitor-Trilogy-2/dp/0316462497?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Redemption Ark</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Absolution-Gap-Inhibitor-Trilogy-3/dp/0316462632?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Absolution Gap</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Inhibitor-Phase-Revelation-Alastair-Reynolds/dp/0316462764/?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Inhibitor Phase</a></li></ul><p><strong>Prefect Dreyfus noir thriller prequel series</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Aurora-Rising-GollanczF-Alastair-Reynolds/dp/1473223369/?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Aurora Rising</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elysium-Fire-Prefect-Dreyfus-Emergency/dp/0316555673/?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Elysium Fire</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Machine-Vendetta-Prefect-Dreyfus-Emergencies/dp/0316462845/?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Machine Vendetta</a></li></ul><p><strong>Standalone works</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Chasm-City-Inhibitor-Alastair-Reynolds/dp/0316462470/?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Chasm City (novel)</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Diamond-Dogs-Turquoise-Alastair-Reynolds/dp/0575083131/?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Diamond Dogs, Turquoise Days (two novellas)</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Galactic-North-Alastair-Reynolds/dp/0575083123?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Galactic North (short stories)</a></li></ul>

Punk talks that talk whenever he has a microphone in his hand. While that won’t necessarily help him win the Rumble, it has propelled him to becoming one of the most magnetic, controversial, and can’t-miss promos in the history of sports entertainment.</p><p>To honor Punk’s elite gift of gab, we assembled his nine greatest moments on the mic and broke them down, one pipebomb at a time.</p></div></div><div><p>A strong barometer for a wrestler’s proficiency on the microphone is how well they fare against one of the all-time greats. Three weeks ahead of the 2013 Royal Rumble, it didn’t matter what The Rock said. CM Punk was better.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dwayne-the-rock-johnson-pee-red-one-1851695097&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dwayne-the-rock-johnson-pee-red-one-1851695097">The Rock</a></span> returned to the WWE in pursuit of the WWE Championship, a belt he hadn’t held in 10 years. Standing in his way was CM Punk, who, at the time, was the longest-running champion of the modern era.</p><p>Punk was delivering one of his signature heelish sermons, questioning why R-Truth’s imaginary friend Little Jimmy (remember him?) was better positioned on the card than Tyson Kidd and claimed that “I am successful in spite of [the fans].” Rock interrupted, defending the WWE Universe (a la John Cena), and led the crowd in a “Cookie puss, cookie puss” chant at Punk. Rather than engage The Great One in a sing-along battle, Punk did what he does best—hit his enemies with the truth.</p><p>Whether Rock had a full-time schedule or showed up once a year Santa Clause style, Punk was going to kick his ass. Boom. Punk didn’t need a “tired, lame-ass shtick” filled with rhyming and catchphrases to get over. Pow. Rock was playing at the kid’s table, while Punk was in the big leagues, swinging for the fences. Wham.8</p><p>The champ landed a final haymaker, beating Rock at his own game by pulling out a catchy one-liner: “Come Royal Rumble, understand that when you step in the ring, your arms are just too short to box with God.” Knockout punch.</p></div><div><p>Pro Wrestling Illustrated voted CM Punk vs. Jeff Hardy the second-best feud of the year in 2009. It should have been number one.</p><p>Punk, a babyface at the time, shocked fans when he successfully cashed in his Money In The Bank briefcase on an exhausted Hardy who minutes before had outlasted Edge to become the World Heavyweight Champion. It was an underhanded move, the first of several for the slowly turning Punk.</p><p>At The Bash pay-per-view a few weeks later, Punk and Hardy fought in a rematch, with the former “accidentally” kicking the referee in the back (due to blurred vision from a supposed eye injury), which disqualified him and allowed him to keep the title.</p><p>Punk was firmly cementing his place as a smarmy, weaseling heel—and then, he made things personal. He began deriding Hardy for his “reckless” lifestyle and inability to say “no” to drugs, which stems from Hardy’s real-life history of alcohol and substance abuse.</p><p>On a July episode of <em>Friday Night Smackdown</em>, Punk unleashed his most resounding verbal assault. He flashed a vial of medication, teasing Jeff that he knows “a thing or two about prescription medication.” The only difference is, that Punk obtained his (for his “injured” eye) legally.</p><p>Then, Punk dealt a deafening blow: “Jeff, you’ve got two strikes. You know how many I have? Zero. Jeff, you know how many times I’ve been suspended? Zero. You know how many times I’ve been to a rehab facility? Zero. You know what your chances are of beating me at Night of Champions? Zero.”</p><p>It was a classic example of something Punk does exceptionally well. He took a piece of reality and wove it into a storyline, all while garnering nuclear heat and hyping up the next pay-per-view. In other words, it was a chef’s kiss heel promo.</p></div><div><p>You want people to hate you? Interrupt Rey Mysterio singing “Happy Birthday” to his daughter.</p><p>Punk was at his most abhorrent as the founding member of the Straight Edge Society in the late aughts. He preached a lifestyle free from drinking, drugs, and smoking while denigrating those (namely, fans) who partook in any of the vices.</p><p>It’s an underrated era of Punk’s career. And as he, Serena, and Luke Gallows crashed the Mysterio family celebration, the boos that rained down were giving Muhammad Hassan. (if you know, you know.)</p><p>Punk terrorized each member of the Mysterio clan, beginning with Aalyah, who pulled off one HELL of a performance as a child looking horrified. As she covered her ears, Punk said: “As my birthday present to you, I’ll let you shut your eyes while… I make [your daddy] beg for my mercy.” Sheesh!</p><p>To a young Dominik (yes, Dirty Dom was present!), Punk threatened that he was going to make his dad “squeal like a pig.” Finally, when Punk aimed his vitriol at Rey’s wife Angie, claiming, “After I do what I’m going to do to your husband, it will be the worst of times” and all Rey can do is stand between himself and his vulnerable family. As the Mysterios left the ring, Punk sang a sinister rendition of “Happy Birthday” to Aalyah.</p><p>The promo was disturbing, deplorable, and effective in positioning Punk as pure evil. It also makes you wonder why Dom hasn’t recruited his sister to join Judgement Day.</p></div><div><p>For years, fans clamored for a CM Punk return to the wrestling ring. They would often chant his name during random matches and segments (usually if they were bored) across promotions and around the world. That’s why his reemergence at AEW Rampage in 2021 felt as momentous as Jon Snow rising from the dead.</p><p>Set at the United Center in Chicago, a raucous crowd (already anticipating a Punk sighting) lost its shit when the Second City Saint actually showed up. As he walked through the curtain, the “CM Punk” chants drowned out his “Cult Of Personality” entrance song. He stage-dove into the front row, hugging fans who’d been reaching out to embrace him for years. Tears filled the eyes of many in attendance as if they were teens at a Taylor Swift concert—which makes sense, as Punk too was a rock star. And “FI-NALLY,” to quote another star wrestler who at one point left the business for 7 years, CM Punk had come back to the ring.</p><p>Punk grabbed a microphone and admitted that he hadn’t prepared a speech because he wanted to react to how he felt in the moment. He addressed the feelings of frustration and disappointment that fans might have experienced based on his past decisions, and that he understood. He hoped they would understand that he was sick—physically and mentally—from the last place he worked (WWE) and that he had to go away to get better.</p><p>Punk then spoke about the exciting promises of working at AEW, stating that much like how Ring of Honor was a “place where people could come work, get paid, learn their craft, and love <em>professional wrestling</em>,” so too was AEW.</p><p>Needless to say, things ended much differently from how they started for Punk in AEW, but this was a once-in-a-generation, passion-filled return of a pro wrestling icon.</p></div><div><p>True wrestling junkies may remember CM Punk’s pre-WWE career with Ring of Honor (ROH). Did you know the original “Summer of Punk” took place six years before his infamous Pipebomb promo (more on that later) in ROH?</p><p>It was June 2005 and Punk had agreed to sign with the big, bad WWE, which is why his victory over Austin Aries to win the ROH World Championship (for the first time) was shocking. Even more shocking was what Punk, then a face, said immediately after to the cheering crowd: “I am the devil himself, and all of you stupid, mindless people fell for it… Ladies and gentlemen, the champ is here.”</p><p>The reference to John Cena—a despised figure among independent wrestling fans given what he stood for—put an exclamation point on Punk’s heel turn. It was a legendary moment in Ring of Honor that gave Punk one final memorable run in the company as a corporate sellout, threatening to take the ROH title with him to the WWE.</p><p>Over a decade and a half later, Maxwell Jacob Friedman (MJF) remixed lines from his childhood hero’s promo in their feud. Speaking of which… </p></div><div><p>The type of wrestling fan you are will likely determine your favorite CM Punk mic moment in his program with MJF.</p><p>Maybe it’s when Punk compared the foundation of his career (being Straight Edge) to that of MJF’s (cheating to win with his Dynamite Diamond Ring), and challenged the upstart to a dog collar match to teach him a lesson. Or maybe it’s when a battered and bloodied Punk derangedly stared down a camera backstage with fiery, dilated pupils, and harkened back to one of his old Ring Of Honor promos to intimidate MJF.</p><p>To me, the best mic moment(s) came when Punk and MJF verbally sparred for the first time in the ring, trading hall-of-fame-level insults, a signature of both wrestlers. These are a handful of the ways Punk punked Max:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>“I had no idea your first name was Maxwell. This entire time, I thought MJF stood for ‘My Jealous Fan’”</li><li>“Look at me, Maxwell, I’m in your head. Probably has a lot to do with the fact that there’s a poster of me on your wall”</li><li>“He thinks what he does is revolutionary to the wrestling business when in reality, he’s just a less famous Miz” </li><li>“Who’s the man around here? Is it you? No, I don’t think so. The only way you’re going to be number one is if we all wait around long enough for Tony to have a daughter that you marry”</li></ul><p>The Scoville levels ratcheted up instantly between the two, and it aptly laid the foundation for the best and spiciest feud in AEW history.</p></div><div><p>Sometimes at work, you’re handed a shit sandwich and don’t really have a choice but to eat it. In CM Punk’s case, he picked up the rotten sandwich he was served and hurled it at the people who allegedly put it on his plate in the first place… then he took a flamethrower and torched his shit-covered enemies for good measure.</p><p>If you’re looking for 23 minutes and 30 seconds of pure entertainment and NSFW soap opera-level drama, do yourself a favor and watch (or rewatch) CM Punk’s press conference after AEW All Out in 2022. A bloodied Punk–who just defeated Jon Moxley to regain the AEW World Championship—expressed his genuine, non-scripted thoughts. He:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Ripped into Scott Colton (AKA pro wrestler Colt Cabana), adamantly dismissing the rumors that he convinced Tony to fire his former friend. Punk also revealed that he used to pay Colton’s bills and that Colton (at the time, 41) shared a bank account with his mom</li><li>Disparaged the executive vice presidents of AEW, namely Kenny Omega and Matt and Nick Jackson (the Young Bucks), who “couldn’t fucking manage a Target” </li><li>Called AEW star Adam “Hangman” Page an “empty-headed dumb fuck” for cutting a promo on Punk that strayed significantly from what they agreed to beforehand</li><li>Addressed the media directly about their lack of journalistic integrity: “If y’all are at fault, fuck you. If you’re not, I apologize”</li></ul><p>The rants were awkward yet hilarious, made even funnier by the fact that Punk did it while sitting next to (a wildly uncomfortable) AEW CEO Tony Kahn and calmly eating muffins. It was an all-time CM Punk performance, but it did result in a real-life physical altercation with Omega and the Young Bucks immediately following the scrum (the details are unclear), and then a whole bunch of ripple effects for the next year-plus, ultimately leading to Punk’s firing from AEW.</p><p>On the bright side, the ordeal ultimately led Punk back to the WWE, and now we all know that Mindy’s Bakery is closed on Mondays and Tuesdays.</p></div><div><p>It was another ordinary episode of <em>Monday Night Raw</em> in 2011. Until it <em>really</em> wasn’t.</p><p>After interfering in John Cena’s tables match against R-Truth, causing the leader of the Centation to *gasp* lose, CM Punk grabbed a microphone, walked up the ramp, sat cross-legged in front of the Titantron, and delivered the most industry-shifting promo since Austin 3:16—which coincidentally occurred almost exactly 15 years to the day prior.</p><p>Punk fittingly donned a Stone Cold tee and aired out his list of grievances with the company. He also predicted a victory over John Cena for the WWE Championship at Money In The Bank the night before his contract with the WWE would end.</p><p>It quickly seemed that Punk was maybe, possibly going off script when he compared John Cena’s ass-kissing abilities (very not PG) to Hulk Hogan’s, who at the time was a persona non grata in the WWE. He strangely admitted that “I’m breaking the fourth wall” while waving directly to the camera and claimed he was the best <em>wrestler</em> in the world—a word that then Chairman Vince McMahon apparently <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://wrestletalk.com/features/full-list-of-banned-words-in-wwe-updated/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://wrestletalk.com/features/full-list-of-banned-words-in-wwe-updated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">forbade</a></span> his talent to use.</p><p>Punk claimed he would defend the WWE Championship he won from Cena in rival promotions, mentioning Ring of Honor and New Japan Pro Wrestling by name (something that never happened in the WWE). Shit felt really real when he began taking personal shots at McMahon: citing Stephanie (his “idiotic daughter”) and Triple H (his “doofus son-in-law”) as the reasons why the company won’t be any better after Vince is dead. Whoa.</p><p>When he threatened to reveal a true story about McMahon and the hypocrisy of his anti-bullying campaign, his mic stopped working. What the Hell happened? Fans were left genuinely wondering if “the boys in the truck” were told to cut him off.</p><p>Pulling off an effective worked-shoot promo (i.e. a promo where it’s unclear whether the wrestler delivering it is going off script) is the smallest of needles to thread. Punk did it masterfully. He grounded everything he said in at least some kernel of truth, but never <em>really</em> crossed a detrimental line. He complained about the stale, predictable WWE product—which ironically, felt very fresh and warranted—while also promoting an upcoming pay-per-view.</p><p>The influence of Punk’s pipebomb is clear in promos we see today in the WWE: fewer catchphrases and more (seemingly real) personal shots directed at fellow talent. Punk’s career is filled with accolades, but this is truly his shining moment on the mic. </p></div><div><p>Punk faced two of the biggest power hitters on the microphone and struck both of them out with nasty pitches. Bear with me on the baseball metaphor.</p><p>Coming off Punk’s pipebomb promo, the build to Money In The Bank in Chicago was reaching a head. The superstar would face John Cena in a heavily stipulated match. If Punk won, he’d leave the WWE with the WWE Championship and John Cena would be fired.</p><p>In a last-ditch effort to re-sign Punk, Vince McMahon took matters into his own hands, negotiating a new contract with him live on <em>Monday Night Raw</em> a few days before MITB. Vince was as brash and smug as ever until Punk reminded him who held the leverage.</p><p>Punk physically pushed his boss (a provision in the contract), demanded he bring back WWE ice bars (still need those!), and even dropped this dandy: “Vince, I’ll kick you in the nuts and you’ll smile at me and like it, and show me some respect!”</p><p>Shortly after, Cena joined the fray, and Punk lost it at his rival’s declaration that he had lost sight. Punk hit Cena with a harsh truth about his character and position within the wrestling business: The 10-time champ, who prided himself on being the underdog, was now the opposite. Cena was no longer like his hometown team, the underdog Boston Red Sox. Instead, he’d become the detestable New York Yankees. See? Baseball.</p><p>Cena took exception to the insult and punched Punk, causing him to retreat to the same place he cut his pipebomb promo weeks earlier. Sitting on the ramp, he revealed:</p><p>“I’m glad you just punched me in the face John… because it hit me like a bolt of lightning exactly why I no longer want to be here. It’s because I’m tired of this. I’m tired of you. I’m just tired.”</p><p>With that, Punk said that after Sunday night (Money In The Bank), the company will need to say goodbye to the WWE title, say goodbye to John Cena, and say goodbye to CM Punk.</p><p>BOOM. That is how you sell a story and a ca n’t-miss event in front of (as Punk referred to them) the George Steinbrenner and Derek Jeter of the WWE. More baseball! This Punk performance is often lost in the giant shadow of the pipebomb, but you could argue it’s just as effective. And epic. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Fallout New Vegas and Horizon Zero Dawn lead writer John Gonzalez has announced he will be retuning to Obsidian after 14 years. </p>



<p>The announcement came via his LinkedIn profile, where he was quick to shoot down impending rumours of Fallout New Vegas 2, by simply saying, “No, it’s not Fallout: New Vegas 2.”</p>



<p>As for what Gonzalez is working on remains to be seen and could ride on the success of the studios next two upcoming games, Avowed and The Outer Worlds 2. If tremendously successful, he could be working on a future sequel.</p>



<p>However, Obsidian Entertainment has also released some stellar games in the past few years, including Pentiment, Pillars of Eternity, and Grounded, so he could also be working on a sequel to those, or a new IP entirely. But for now, all we know if that he’s not working on New Vegas 2… Apparently.</p>



<p>What do you think Gonzalez is working on? Would you like to see a Fallout: New Vegas 2? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>
