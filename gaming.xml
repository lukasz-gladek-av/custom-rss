Open world fuhgeddaboudit simulator <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mafia-the-old-country">Mafia: The Old Country</a> will release in summer 2025, according to a Youtube trailer that has leaked on social media ahead of tonight's Game Awards. The trailer also treats us to a few snippets of the game's story scenes, shoot-outs and punch-ups. We get to see wise guys swinging knives, riding horses and glowering silently at sun-baked Sicilian countryside.

It's all set to the sorrowful strains of Madama Butterfly. I was going to comment that Madama Butterfly takes place in Japan and as such, is a bizarre soundtrack for an Italian gangster game, but of course, the opera was composed by Puccini. See, this is the kind of high-quality research I can pack in when I get the details two hours in advance of the Game Awards, rather than writing trailers up like I am trying to catch bullets fired out of an actual Tommy gun.
</p>
<p>
Tommy guns feature in previous Mafia games, but they hadn't been invented at the time of Mafia: The Old Country's story. It's a prequel to the first three games, "set in the brutal underworld of 1900s Sicily". Expect "authentic realism and rich storytelling". Personally, I don't think you're allowed to be both authentic and realistic. It goes against nature. I'll allow it, though, because I enjoyed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mafia-iii">Mafia 3</a> for all its flaws. That game had the most incredible review bugs, but it had a lot of style. Being set in 1960s New Orleans definitely helped.
</p><p>
The Old Country is the work of Hangar 13, who are both the studio behind Mafia 3 and staffed by people who worked on Mafia 1 and 2. You might like to revisit <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mafia-the-old-country-coming-in-2025-taking-the-series-to-early-20th-century-sicily">last year's announcement trailer</a>. There will probably be a fuller version of the leaked trailer at GeoffFest later tonight. I'll post it here when it lands.
</p>
<p>Mafia: The Old Country settling on summer 2025 theoretically gives it a little headstart on 2K Games stablemate <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a>, which parent company Take-Two Interactive are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-release-date-wont-slip-to-2026-take-two-assure-theyre-highly-confident-about-fall-2025">"highly confident" will launch in the autumn</a>. Needless to say, it wouldn't go well for Mafia if the two rocked up side by side.</p>

            <p>
Former <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> and Marathon reboot director Christopher Barrett is suing Bungie and Sony for $200m USD, claiming the companies "deliberately destroyed [his] reputation by falsely, and publicly, insinuating...he had engaged in sexual misconduct."
</p>
<p>
Word of Barrett's departure from Bungie arrived earlier this year, amid claims of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-marathon-reboot-gets-new-director-as-part-of-creative-leadership-shakeup">leadership shakeup</a>. However, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier later reported - after speaking directly with some of those involved - that Barrett was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-former-marathon-reboot-director-chris-barrett-reportedly-ousted-following-inappropriate-behaviour">fired from the studio following an internal investigation</a> into accusation of inappropriate behaviour filed by "at least eight" female employees.
</p>
<p>
At the time of Bloomberg's report, Barrett responded, "I never understood my communications to be unwanted and I would have never thought they could possibly have made anyone feel uncomfortable. If anyone ever felt that way about their interaction with me, I am truly sorry."
</p>
<p>
Three months on, however, and Barrett is in a far more combative mood. He's now filed a complaint with a Delaware court accusing Sony and Bungie of "deliberately [destroying his] reputation by falsely, and publicly, insinuating they had 'investigated' [him] and 'found' he had engaged in sexual misconduct." The filing continues, "[They] did not care that none of it was true. They had blatant motivations for their brazen scheme: (i) to avoid paying Barrett the nearly $50m he is owed under his employment agreement, and (ii) to shift blame for and deflect attention away from their massive business failures."
</p><p>
Barrett goes onto allege the internal investigation into his behaviour was a "premeditated scheme" and a "sham". To support these claims, the lawsuit argues Barrett was told about the investigation "out of the blue"; was "not advised to bring counsel to the interview"; was "asked questions about communications with his colleagues but was never shown" these communications; was "never asked whether he had ever engaged in inappropriate sexual conduct, whether he ever sent inappropriate sexual or pornographic materials to a co-worker, or whether he ever retaliated against a co-worker for rebuffing his advances or discriminated against a female colleague on the basis of her sex", and was instead "asked questions about run-of-the-mill communications."
</p>
<p>
Barrett then alleges that three weeks after the investigation, Sony and Bungie revealed he was to be terminated for "gross misconduct" but "refused to explain further", and that he was told "nothing he could say would make a difference, despite never giving him a chance to engage with the allegations in the first place." It's also claimed, "No one ever told Barrett who had made the decision to fire him or even what conduct he was being fired for."
</p>
<p>
Next comes the allegation that Bungie and Sony "wrongfully retained nearly $50m owed to Barrett for his stock in Bungie" following his termination, and that the defendants then "completed the Machiavellian trifecta by providing wildly misleading statements to Bloomberg designed to: (i) deflect blame for Sony's poorly performing $3.6b acquisition of Bungie and delays in video game production by casting shade on Barrett for his role on Marathon and (ii) shift blame for their own public #MeToo problems by falsely insinuating that the accusations of severe misconduct had been directed at Barrett, when they had not."
</p>
<p>
The lawsuit insists, "Barrett did not do anything remotely resembling gross misconduct or 'Cause' as defined in the Retention Agreements... and there could not have been any credible allegation he did because Barrett had a spotless twenty-five year track record at Bungie."
</p><p>
Barrett argues Sony and Bungie's actions "irreparably harmed [him] financially, physically, and emotionally" and that the goal of his lawsuit is to "recover tens of millions of dollars he is owed for stock he earned through twenty-five years of hard work, to recover for the retaliation he has suffered, to restore his hard-earned reputation, and to be compensated for the falsehoods knowingly and maliciously spread about him by the Defendants."
</p>
<p>
Barrett is seeking $200m in damages, including $45,579,627 (plus interest) owed under his employment terms, another $45,579,627 (plus interest) for violating Washington's Wage Rebate Act, and "not less than $100m" in defamation and punitive damages. He is also requesting to be reinstated as franchise game director on Marathon.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted Sony and Bungie for comment.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/archeologists-have-potentially-pieced-together-rules-to-ancient-shahr-i-sokhta-board<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A team of archeologists may have uncovered a piece of tabletop history. Decades ago, an ancient Shahr-i Sokhta board game was uncovered, but its rules were not included. After some speculation and research, the team may have figured out those rules.</p>



<p>In a report by <a href="https://www.iflscience.com/after-losing-the-rules-for-4000-years-we-may-know-how-to-play-this-ancient-board-game-77152" rel="nofollow">IFLScience</a>, the Shahr-i Sokhta board game was uncovered in 1977 by a group of Italian and Iranian archeologists. As the name suggests, they were excavating a cemetery Shahr-i Sokhta in the south-eastern region of Iran when they uncovered the board game.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shahr-i-sokta-board-game-photograph.jpg?itok=2gHPj3EI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shahr-i-sokta-board-game-photograph.jpg?itok=kWjklV-M 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Thanks to radiocarbon dating, they were able to determine the game was created around 2600-2400 BCE. The problem is only the game was present; no rules or instructions.</p>

<p>For comparison there is the <em>Royal Game of Ur</em>. This game appeared roughly around the same time in Mesopotamia, and had its rules written down on a cuneiform tablet, allowing the British Museum to translate and interpret the game's rules. They surmised it was a strategic racing game played with dice.</p>

<p>The team puzzling out the Shahr-i Sokhta board game didn't have that convenience. Instead, they took what they knew about ancient board games alongside historical evidence.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shahr-i-sokhta-board-game-on-table.jpg?itok=2b5kNchX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shahr-i-sokhta-board-game-on-table.jpg?itok=L57EipBK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Their conclusion is the game is a more strategic spin on <em>Royal Game of Ur</em>. This is due to the game&nbsp; having more varied game pieces and blockers. As the team wrote in their report:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The blocker pieces cannot attack the opponent’s blockers, as the core of the gameplay is racing,&nbsp; and the rules must focus on the racing aspect.&nbsp; Moreover, the blocker pieces should be able to move more strategically,"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Shahr-i Sokhta board game, now referred to as <em>The Game of 20</em>, is available to play online for free on Persian Wonders' website. It is described as an older version of Backgammon. The goal is for you to remove all ten of your game pieces from the board before your opponent does.</p>

<p>Naturally, even with a ton of research and playtesting, there is the chance this board game wasn't played as intended. But that is part of the ongoing challenges of archeology and historical research.</p>

A <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-28/-marathon-video-game-director-barrett-was-ousted-over-inappropriate-behavior?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTcyNDg2NDU0OCwiZXhwIjoxNzI1NDY5MzQ4LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTSVhUWktEV0xVNjgwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.lJDK2mJTGM2v8mjO2siujiOigS68jyckaTagfGlXp_A" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg report</a> cited sources claiming that Barrett "called lower-level female employees attractive, asked them to play truth-or-dare and made references to his wealth and power within the studio, suggesting that he could help advance their careers."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Barrett released a statement at the time saying, "I feel that I have always conducted myself with integrity and been respectful and supportive of my colleagues, many of whom I consider my <br>closest friends. I never understood my communications to be unwanted and I would have never thought they could possibly have made anyone feel uncomfortable. If anyone ever felt that way about their interaction with me, I am truly sorry.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/05/24/marathon-blogroll-02-1684962151922.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Chris Barrett was Marathon's director before being fired in 2024. Image source: Bungie.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Barrett's lawsuit alleges that he was scapegoated for Bungie's overall struggles in the wake of the PlayStation acquisition and that the investigation was used as cause to fire him after requesting FMLA leave. Barrett's lawsuit also says that many of the allegations laid out in a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-report-battle-soul-work-culture-harassment-crunch">2021 IGN investigation into Bungie's workplace culture were "not shocking to him"</a> and lays out several allegations of his own, including claims that at least one employee "frequently exposed himself in the office" and that Bungie "maintained an email channel that shared lewd and semi-pornographic content to the entire studio."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Barrett alleges that he sought to take mental health leave in late 2023, but was instead removed from his role on Marathon. In describing the investigation into his conduct, Barrett claims that he was confronted about what he described as "unspecified texts" but "but failed to show Barrett any of the communications, identify any of the recipients or senders, or even disclose when the communications took place — thereby rendering Sony's supposed 'investigation' into these texts pointless, and failing to meet any professional standards for conducting an investigation." Barrett was subsequently fired for gross misconduct in March 2024, with Joe Ziegler taking over the role as Marathon director.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Barrett's lawsuit adds to Bungie's recent struggles. Earlier this year, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-says-it-remains-committed-to-destiny-after-layoffs-will-reveal-plans-for-multi-year-journey-soon">studio laid off 220 staff</a>, and in a report published in December 2023, Bungie devs described the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-devs-say-atmosphere-is-soul-crushing-amid-layoffs-cuts-and-fear-of-total-sony-takeover">atmosphere at the studio as "soul-crushing."</a> Marathon, meanwhile, does not yet have a release date, though it's expected to see a playtest sometime in 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-problem-with-red-dead-redemption-2%E2%80%99s-horse-testicles.1059501/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/you-are-error-horses-red-dead-redemption-2-horse-testicles<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Video game history is riddled with foundational Horse Moments, whether we’re talking classics like<em> Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</em> and <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> or (slightly) more off-the-beaten-path fare like <em>Barbie Horse Adventures</em>. But in the recent gaming canon, one game effectively represents an equine epoch: <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>. Its horses are so detailed that <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/meet-the-hundreds-of-horse-girls-running-red-dead-onlines-kindest-posse/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thousands of players</a> treat it as a massively multiplayer trail ride simulator. Even before the game came out, the internet became enamored with its horse testicles, which <a href="https://kotaku.com/two-hours-with-the-amazingly-detailed-red-dead-redempti-1829187487" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">developers said</a> expanded and shrank depending on the in-game temperature. Turns out, however, there’s a problem with that last bit. On the latest episode of You Are Error, we discuss Rockstar’s fumbling of that figurative and literal ball and so much more.</p><p>The topic of this episode of You Are Error, Aftermath’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/you-are-error-podcast-rami-ismail-arabic-palestine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new podcast about gaming’s greatest misconceptions</a>, is horses. It’s a pretty far cry from the globally consequential subject matter of episode one, and that’s by design. With these first two episodes, I’m hoping to demonstrate You Are Error’s full potential breadth. It can be serious, it can be silly, it can be something in between.</p><p>I decided on horses in particular, though, because while there’s plenty of lighthearted enjoyment to be derived from man’s best friend that isn’t a dog, there’s a deceptive amount of depth and cultural relevance to the topic as a whole. Horses are everywhere – in society and media. We can all at least sort of draw one. How and why do games mess up those, of all things? And what are game makers choosing to focus on instead?&nbsp;</p><p>Today’s guest who, yes, unfortunately, I asked about horse testicles, is <a href="https://x.com/MaliceDaFirenze" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alice Ruppert</a>, video game horse consultant and creator of <a href="https://www.themanequest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Mane Quest</a>, a website about video game horses. We discussed the history of horses in games and how, even in this era of photorealism, some companies still fail to stick the landing when it comes to basics like legs. Legs! That’s the main thing about horses.&nbsp;</p><p>But alongside major releases, there’s also an entire, oft-overlooked genre of games focused on caring for, nurturing, and riding horses. If you grew up in the era of <em>Barbie Horse Adventures</em> (and all the jokes surrounding it), you might be starting to see the faint outline of a gendered component to this conversation, and well, at this point I’ll just let the conversation speak for itself. Buckle – or perhaps I should say saddle – up for an interview that I enjoyed tremendously, and I hope you will too.</p><p>You can listen below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7w7V296dt8HCoDryWiofI4?si=f79446b5647c44bc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/you-are-error/id1782231480" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, please consider leaving a review so that this foal of a podcast can eventually become a championship-winning race horse.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> In the run up to <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>’s release, they started talking about the amount of detail they packed into their horses, and the example that they used is that, if you had a horse in different temperatures, depending on if it was hot or cold, the size of their testicles would change. They’d be smaller or larger depending on if it was hot or cold outside.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Alice:</strong> It is not the first time I’ve been asked about <em>Red Dead</em> horse balls.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>I’m not surprised by that! Because I feel like, as we’ve already talked about, in a lot of games, horses are almost invisible beyond their utility to the player. And this was a moment where people actually talked about them beyond that. Admittedly it was still only kind of about the horses; it was really more about “Our game is so realistic. It’s the most realistic game ever. Here’s a salient example.” But nonetheless, how did you feel about that being such a big part of the discussion around that game?</p><p><strong>Alice: </strong>Definitely mixed feelings in the sense of, as you say, the horse testicle thing is more of a stand in – both for people who like<em> Red Dead</em> as a way of [saying] “It’s so realistic that even the horse balls shrink and grow,” but also for the game’s detractors who are like “That game has so much padding and detail I don’t care about; you should have done this or that instead of spending time on your horse testicles.”</p><p>My actual opinion on <em>Red Dead </em>horse balls is that there’s too many of them, because there’s no reason for that many horses to be stallions. So, quick horse anatomy lesson: A stallion is an uncastrated male horse, and a gelding is a castrated male horse. Gelding horses is a practice that goes back thousands of years. It wasn’t always popular in all cultures, but it was definitely popular and practiced in the American West. The reason for that was just that geldings are much easier to handle than stallions because they’re not distracted by female horses, to put it simply.&nbsp;</p><p>So there would not have been cowboys riding stallions everywhere. You would use mares or geldings. Is it a bad thing that all the horses in <em>Red Dead </em>have balls? No, but I find it weird! As an actual rider, you don’t see as many horse balls as you see in <em>Red Dead</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>And also, this is complete speculation, but I feel like by the time they revealed that fact, people were talking about it so much that they did something to the ratio of male and female horses you find so that enough people would see their goddamn horse balls. It can be genuinely hard to find a mare in <em>Red Dead 2</em>, which I also think is stupid. Also, prominent, static testicles in every screenshot I take of my horse in that game are just not something I need. And in motion, they look really fucking weird – I can’t believe I’m talking about horse ball physics again – no, these are not static. In your super hyper realistic game, it just looks wrong. It looks like they’re made of wood.</p><p>Does that mean I think <em>Red Dead</em> should have added horse ball physics to their game as well? Not really. I just think it’s a really fucking weird choice, a weird combo of priorities. It definitely did its job as a marketing gimmick. We’re still talking about it six years later. So I can’t fault anyone for doing that, but at the same time, I don’t take it seriously as a realism metric.&nbsp;</p><p>But it’s hard to deny that the <em>Red Dead 2 </em>horses are some of the best that exist. The people at Rockstar definitely put a lot of work into it that otherwise isn’t [usually done] with different breeds and behaviors – different models and characteristics. At the same time, I have some nitpicks with the models of <em>Red Dead</em> that put them into uncanny valley territory for me. How their ears move and how their mouths move is wrong to me, and so they look a bit off. But that might just be me.&nbsp;</p><p>I know a lot of horse-loving gamers who absolutely adore <em>Red Dead</em>. There’s people who play <em>Red Dead</em> specifically for the horses – people that meet on dedicated servers and in special communities and mod<em> Red Dead</em> so they can come together and do show jumping competitions, essentially. And I think that’s beautiful.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> That’s really cool. How big is that community?</p><p><strong>Alice: </strong>The biggest community that I’m aware of is about 10,000 people, which is <a href="https://www.rifttrails.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Rift Trails</a>. As far as I know, it got started in the horses-in-video-games Facebook group I launched a few years back – during covid, actually, when people started meeting up digitally and going on trail rides together during a time where, of course, many people were not allowed to visit their horses. That’s when I saw it starting, I believe. It’s possible something happened earlier.<em> Red Dead Online </em>has been out since 2018, but I think it got a big boost during the peak covid months of spring 2020.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>That’s one of those things, too, where I feel like it’s a beneficial side effect of that game’s horses being so good: Beyond what Rockstar intended for them, people found these other uses – these other ways to interact with what they had made.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Alice:</strong> Absolutely. In many ways it’s something that I love – that I think is super beautiful and nice. Community and play emerging from places where it wasn’t intended. And at the same time, I was like, I think there’s a market for games that target horse-loving people explicitly and make these sorts of experiences to begin with on all platforms, and not just modded on PC if you jump through 20 hoops to find them.&nbsp;</p><p>If that many people are willing to jump through so many hoops to get the horse gameplay they want, imagine how many people would play it if it was simply something they could buy and find organically rather than explicitly having to go look for it and be tech savvy enough to create that experience themselves.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Are there any games along those lines currently in development or that have come out?</p><p><strong>Alice: </strong>There are games that took inspiration from that or tried to provide something similar. … [One example is in] <em>Star Stable Online</em>, which is the biggest horse game there is, essentially. It’s an MMORPG aimed at 8- to 18-year old girls that nobody has heard of, but they have, like, 600,000 monthly active players, and it’s huge.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Wow. Damn, good for them.</p><p><strong>Alice: </strong>Yeah, there’s so many people that work in games and talk about games a lot that are not aware of the kinds of numbers these games pull. That’s why I mention them at every opportunity, because at some point I’m hoping to get some investors and publishers to listen.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Well yeah, because based on what you’re saying, there’s clearly a bigger appetite for this than what is being provided for. There are more people who want these things.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Alice: </strong>Yeah, I would absolutely say that.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Which is interesting, because I went into this episode thinking it would be about what games get wrong about horses physically, but maybe the biggest misconception is this idea that there’s not an audience for games about horses.</p><p>&nbsp;<strong>Alice:</strong> I totally agree, and that’s why part of my work is essentially trying to gather that evidence. That’s why I like to shine a light on these modding communities and why I like to shine a light on bad horse games that still get players – because they’re the only ones offering this particular experience. Because what I want out of this is better horse games. In that way, it’s a very selfish endeavor. Even though we’ve seen improvements in the past few years, there’s still so much untapped potential.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-melee-weapons-ranking"><h3>Objects To Hit Fascists With In Indiana Jones, Ranked</h3></a><p>I've been playing Indiana Jones and The Great Circle and have constructed a ranking internally.</p></div><div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/game-awards-trailer-ad"><h3>Is It A Trailer Or An Ad</h3></a><p>Rebekah Valentine assigned me this blog</p></div></div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/a-game-about-digging-a-hole/" data-ref-id="5000-654217">A Game About Digging A Hole</a> is the aptly named new game from indie developer Cyberwave, and it is, you guessed it, about digging a hole.</p><p dir="ltr">For what Cyberwave describes "costs as much of a coffee, but is fun for longer," A Game About Digging A Hole sees players buy a mysterious house for an "unbeatable price." That house just so happens to have buried treasure in the backyard, leading players to start digging to discover the riches underneath.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Ys4PRZxsw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/P-Ys4PRZxsw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">It's a simple premise with an even simpler gameplay loop. Players will dig, find treasure, sell those treasures, use the money to upgrade their digging tools, and keep digging deeper. The game's announcement trailer teases there may be something more sinister lurking in the deep, dark depths, but that will be for players to discover, as Cyberwave teases a "big secret" hidden beneath the dirt.</p><p dir="ltr">An eye-catching and hilariously straightforward name definitely seems to be part of the game's marketing strategy. In a blog post on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3244220/A_Game_About_Digging_A_Hole/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, Cyberwave asks players to help make the "quirky" project "go viral" so that it's "the game everyone's talking about."</p><p dir="ltr">The original idea for the game came during the development of Cyberwave's upcoming floating island survival game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/solarpunk/" data-ref-id="5000-559930">Solarpunk</a>. It was experimenting with voxel-based terraforming, only to eventually ditch the idea. One of the game's artists, inspired by the tech and the game Motherload, then put together what would become A Game About Digging A Hole in just 14 days of his spare time. Solarpunk itself is not out yet and is planned for a 2025 release, but Cyberwave emphasized that A Game About Digging A Hole didn't take a single day from Solarpunk's development.</p><p dir="ltr">A Game About Digging A Hole doesn't have an exact release date or price just yet but is slated to arrive in 2025 for PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/wb-games-montreal-lays-off-99-staff-members-majority-were-subcontractors/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, a French outlet <a href="https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/2126300/wb-games-montreal-keywords-licenciements" target="_blank" rel="noopener">named Radio-Canada</a> mentioned that 99 developers have been laid off at WB Games Montreal. It's been said that 99 employees were impacted by this new round of layoffs. However, the vast majority of the employees affected by this round of layoffs were subcontractors hired through Keywords. Keywords is a game service provider that helps connect studios with professionals. They have previously worked with companies such as BioWare and NetEase for their projects. The workers at WB Montreal were in the QA department and helped Rocksteady with the development of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League.</p>
<p>This news comes after Rocksteady announced that the live-service shooter will no longer be supported as of January 14, 2025. The developers that were impacted by the layoffs mentioned to Radio-Canada that those let go will be made to leave WB Montreal in approximately eight weeks, which is roughly around the start of February.</p>
<p>A source mentioned to Radio-Canada that they were offered the opportunity to be kept on a contact list for any projects that were going to be going forward at WB Games Montreal. However, the source said that the projects may not need any people to work on them until 2026. Although this source has said this, it's not 100% certain that it's true, as they had reportedly been assured that WB Games Montreal had "enough projects to work on."</p>
<p>It's not a surprise to anyone who knows about Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League that it performed poorly. As a result of the game performing so badly, Warner Bros. Games revenue saw a <a href="https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-games-revenue-decline-suicide-squad/">hefty 41% decrease in Q2 2024</a>, which is most likely why Rocksteady decided to pull the plug on the game entirely in January. WB Games did expect a drop in revenue, as they didn't release anything this year that was as successful as Hogwarts Legacy, but they were hoping that Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League would at least provide some padding.</p>
<p>At the moment, it's a bit uncertain as to what WB Games Montreal is working on, with their most recent game being Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. Prior to that, they developed games such as Gotham Knights and Batman: Arkham Origins. While it hasn't been confirmed, WB Games Montreal is allegedly developing a DC Comics game utilizing Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>Looking further than Montreal, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-sells-30-million-units-hogwarts-legacy-2-huge-priority/">Hogwarts Legacy 2 is the biggest priority for WB Games</a>, given the wide success of Hogwarts Legacy. So much so that the game sold more copies than the WB Games Senior Brand Manager expected.</p>

            <p>
Thursday is upon us once more, meaning another Epic Games Store freebie is here to claim and (ever-mounting backlog allowing) play. And this time, it's the turn of fantasy survival adventure <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria">The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria</a> - which is reportedly the first of 16 free games being given away by Epic over the festive period.
</p>
<p>
Starting with Epic's current freebie, though, developer Free Range Games' The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria launched to a decent reception back in 2023, transplanting familiar survival mechanics - exploration, combat, resource gathering, and crafting - to Middle-earth with atmospheric, if largely unspectacular results.
</p>
<p>
"This is a game with a lot of soul and a lot of problems, even if I've still found myself willingly sinking dozens of hours into exploring the mines"," Eurogamer contributor Emma Kent wrote in her <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria-review">three star review</a>. "What is unique about Return to Moria is the way it pairs a relatively focused story with survival mechanics... The manner in which the game has been infused with Tolkien's lore and world-building is impressive, and that it somehow evokes the feeling of a Tolkien journey is remarkable in itself. For fans of Middle-earth this is worth experiencing, particularly if someone else joins you for the adventure."

<p>
The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria is <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria-f01344">free to claim</a> right now until Thursday, 19th December. As to what's next, that - somewhat unusually - is yet to be revealed. However, according to extremely reliable leaker billbil-kun, Epic is poised to embark on another series of daily free game giveaways, just as it's done over the festive period for the last few years.
</p><p>
In a post <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/epic-games-store-voici-le-nombre-et-le-calendrier-complet-des-jeux-gratuits-a-venir-lors-de-levenement-de-fin-dannee-59770">on Deallabs</a>, billbil-kun wrote that one new game will be free to claim on the Epic Store every day from 19th December to 2nd January 2025. Each will be claimable for 24 hours, aside from the last, which will be free between 2nd and 9th January.
