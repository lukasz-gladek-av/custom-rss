            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/funko-fusion-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>At this point it almost seems that licensed Funko Pop figurines are being birthed into the world at a greater rate than actual human babies, so it makes sense that someone finally scooped up a bunch of these block-headed bookshelf warmers and stuck them in their own video game. Funko Fusion structures its campaign around seven beloved TV shows and films, including Masters of the Universe and Jurassic World, and stuffs it with iconic pop culture cameos from everyone from Marty McFly to Mega Man. However, despite the fact it certainly appears faithful to the distinctive Funko style at first glance, its meaningless story, mind-numbingly repetitive mission design, and maddening game-breaking bugs cause the whole thing to topple over like a doll with a head that’s too big for its body.</p><p>Effectively a third-person shooter spin on the tried-and-tested LEGO videogame formula (à la LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga) right down to the way literally every object around you can be belligerently smashed into studs – sorry, <em>chunks of vinyl</em> – Funko Fusion’s eclectic handful of familiar stories can be played in any order. I opted to open with Hot Fuzz and close with Scott Pilgrim vs The World, but the sequence I chose didn’t really seem to have any impact on the paper-thin overarching storyline, which centres around a good-versus-evil battle between Funko Freddy and the evil Eddy Funko. These two Funko faces may be familiar to the more dedicated Funko collectors, but from where I’m sitting having owned just a handful of them, the less said about these thoroughly uninteresting and underdeveloped arch rivals, the better. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Funko Fusion Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Each substory runs for five stages and gives you four characters to switch between. In some cases there’s a strong incentive to do so, particularly in The Umbrella Academy where I found myself using Allison to persuade certain vulnerable NPCs to do her bidding and then swapping to Number Five for his ability to blink through the air to otherwise out of reach areas, but more often than not there’s not too much discernable difference between each character other than basic attributes, such as the rate of fire of their weaponry. </p><p>Across each of the seven substories, levels typically rehash the same escort missions and fetch quest formats, and also tend to copy and paste encounters to artificially lengthen each stage to frankly offensive degrees – like the Scott Pilgrim vs The World encounter that forced me to fight the same few variations of a cloned stunt double enemy in three or four near-identical scraps in a row. This is before each substory culminates in a boss fight that is each structured in the same enormously unsatisfying way, where you must blast purple blobs off a big bad’s body while fending off its crowding minions until you have enough purple goo to fill a towering Funko flask. At this point you can trigger the arrival of a super-sized Pop, like Battle Cat or a T-Rex, to finish the monster off while you shoot vinyl chunks out of its body on autopilot and try not to look bored until the cutscene comes.  </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I found combat in general to be pretty arduous for the most part.</p></div><p>In fact, I found combat in general to be pretty arduous for the most part. At first it feels satisfying enough to Funko pop the enemy Funko heads off their little Funko shoulders, but it quickly becomes tedious as you plough through these big-headed hordes in waves that are limited at certain times, and annoyingly neverending in others. The only substantial difference to each encounter is that some enemies you need to shoot, some you need to whack with your sword, and some you need to shoot until they’re stunned so that you can whack them with your sword. It gets old pretty Funko fast.</p><p>Puzzle solving fares a little better, at least in parts. There’s still plenty of basic timed switch-shooting and crank wheel-turning to be done, but there are some standout moments like the portal-heavy He-Man sections and using guitar amps to blast through fragmented glass windows in Scott Pilgrim vs. The World. That is, provided these puzzles work as they should – but more on that later.</p><h2>Vinyl Fantasy</h2><p>Credit where it is due, the team at developer 1010 Games has done an admirable job at recreating the super deformed vinyl idols and placing them in some attractive little toy towns to roam around in. I was initially delighted to follow that meddling swan through the quaint village streets of Sandford when I started the Hot Fuzz campaign, and round up the huskies scattered amidst the cold steel surfaces of Thule Station in the Antarctic surrounds of John Carpenter’s The Thing. A vibrant bowling alley battle in The Umbrella Academy was particularly dazzling (even though that’s the series here I’m least personally familiar with) and the swirling cartoon explosions in Masters of the Universe’s Eternia were also a welcome touch. There’s clearly been a lot of work poured into crafting the look and feel of Funko Fusion, and plenty of Easter eggs to hunt for in its various worlds, too.   </p><p>Yet while Funko Fusion is absolutely teeming with recognisable characters and locations, it possesses surprisingly little of its own personality. Whereas I’ve regularly chuckled through the likes of LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga or LEGO Marvel Super Heroes in the past as a result of the many clever comedic touches they bring to each adventure, I can recall laughing at Funko Fusion precisely once during its entire campaign – when the Cylons from Battlestar Galactica nod in approval at Knight Rider’s KITT after noticing the strobing red light on its grill mirrors the one on their visor lenses. For the most part, the absence of character voices and complete lack of facial expressions makes it very hard for these figurine fighters to seem like anything but charmless empty vessels in place of where some of my favourite fictional characters should be. When Adam raises the Power Sword with a completely nonplussed look on his face, it’s the accompanying He-Man theme song that’s really doing all the heavy lifting.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Mission objectives are incredibly obtuse and lack signposting.</p></div><p>Outside of the odd static speech bubble its cast of characters don’t really speak at all, and Funko Fusion itself is equally poor when it comes to communication. Mission objectives are often incredibly obtuse and lacking in any signposting. This often led to copious amounts of backtracking, especially since some of its environments, like the Jurassic World shopping district, are quite sizeable, yet you’ve got no minimap to assist in navigating them. I found myself routinely retracing my steps purely in order to find one of the vending machines to craft health potions and bits of puzzle-solving equipment like jump pads and gas cannisters with. In fact, I think I visited more virtual vending machines in Funko Fusion than I have in every Like a Dragon game combined. It’s also a little annoying that to change character you have to schlep all the way back to find a Funko Pop display box – I don’t see why we couldn’t have been given a menu button to just swap characters on the fly with.</p><p>It’s also not particularly good at giving feedback as to why some of your shots inflict damage on larger enemies and others don’t. I spent ages blazing away at the glowing red weak spot on the back of a big samurai mini-boss in The Umbrella Academy, continually registering as ineffective red X’s onscreen, only for it to suddenly change to hit point numbers flying off him with zero change in my approach. That was baffling, and not the only case of this unintuitive quirk with Funko Fusion’s combat.   </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Worse still, Funko Fusion doesn’t make it clear early on that you need 45 golden crowns in order to unlock its final story battle. After completing the seven main story quests, I had only accrued 38 of them, which meant that I had to turn heel and go back through levels I’d already completed searching for special cameo quests to harvest the extra crowns from, which put my story progress on pause for a full three hours. Then, when I did trigger the final encounter, I was forced to slog through an overly long final boss fight that had the audacity to make me pump round after round into its eight different forms for around 45 minutes before cutting to an unexpected and entirely anticlimactic endgame cutscene that closed the story with less of a Funko Pop and more of a burst bubble. </p><p>Arriving just a week after the launch of Astro Bot, a masterfully crafted adventure overflowing with invention and playful surprises at every turn, Funko Fusion’s rigid adherence to backtracking, bog-standard escort missions, plodding horde mode blast-a-thons, and bullet-spongey boss fights makes it seem instantly and disappointingly out of date by comparison. That’s to say nothing of the absolutely obnoxious invisible walls that make exploring its environments regularly mystifying, if not downright irritating. Just because you can use a jump pad to successfully leap above the height of a gate that’s blocking your path in the Shaun of the Dead bonus stage, doesn’t mean that Funko Fusion is going to allow you to clear it. What’s the matter, Funko Fusion? Never taken a shortcut before?</p><h2>Go Funk Yourself</h2><p>While most serious collectors like to keep their Funko Pops pristine, Funko Fusion has unfortunately arrived in stores a bit box-damaged, at least if the launch PlayStation 5 version that I played is anything to go by. In addition to relatively minor presentational problems like cutscenes freezing while the audio continued to play or background music just dropping out entirely for long stretches of a level, I’ve had puzzles break and prevent me from progressing, vending machine screens freeze up and not let me leave, and multiple crashes during boss fight loading screens, among many other annoyances. </p><p>At one point in a Masters of the Universe stage I needed two portals in order to solve a certain puzzle, however after crafting the first portal I was told by the vending machine that it was out of stock. After trying for about half an hour in vain to somehow solve the puzzle using just one portal, I ended up restarting the level only to find there were now multiple portals available, which was utterly infuriating. During the aforementioned Shaun of the Dead-based level, I was completely baffled as to why the car I was escorting just completely refused to move while I was bombarded with endless waves of zombies, only to eventually determine that a zombie had glitched inside a piece of scenery within the danger radius of the car, which was preventing it from getting a move on. Naturally, it was aggravatingly immune to my attacks and the level had to be restarted from the beginning.  </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>A lack of checkpoints makes game-breaking bugs hard to bear.</p></div><p>What makes a lot of these game-breaking bugs particularly hard to bear is the lack of any checkpoints in each chapter. If you meet a progress-halting glitch or even just lose your three lives towards the end of a stage, then you have to start that chapter all over again. Of the 20 hours it took me to complete Funko Fusion’s story, I’d estimate that close to a quarter of that time was just me redoing the levels that managed to break during my first time through. </p><p>The developers have assured me that they’re working on patch fixes to remedy some of the issues I encountered during my playthrough, yet even with these rough edges smoothed out, I can’t really see Funko Fusion appealing to any particular audience because it’s so hard to figure out exactly who it’s intended for. Its button-mashy combat and cutesy characters make it seem like it’s targeted towards more junior players, but some of its most prominently featured licenses like Hot Fuzz and The Thing makes it seem far more skewed towards adults who’ve actually seen those mature movies. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3>Tristan's Favourite Games Based on Toys</h3></p></div><p>Unlike the LEGO video games that typically take the darker moments of Harry Potter or Star Wars and spin them into a cheeky moment of slapstick, Funko Fusion just presents the grisliest moments of these licenses, more or less as-is. The villainous Simon Skinner impales himself on a miniature church steeple at the end of Hot Fuzz, while Copper’s hands get violently bitten off by Norris’ teeth-filled torso in The Thing. The only difference is that they’re dead-eyed doll versions of these well-known characters, but the blood still sprays the same – which doesn’t exactly seem appealing for youngsters. Additionally, I don’t know too many grade school kids who are into the 2004 Battlestar Galactica, let alone the 1978 original which has been curiously reproduced here.</p><p>The absence of any cooperative play at launch means Funko Fusion can’t even be tag-teamed by a parent and a child, which is how I’ve enjoyed many of the LEGO games with my kids in the past. While co-op functionality is promised to be rolled out in piecemeal, starting with Jurassic World in October, according to the developers it will be online-only and therefore won’t facilitate families playing it on the couch together anyway. I’m really struggling to figure out exactly who Funko Fusion is for, but what I do know for certain is that it’s definitely not for me.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Following a difficult year for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/immortals-of-aveum">Immortals of Aveum</a> developer Ascendant Studios, a "core team" of around 20 employees has now decamped to Rockstar co-founder Dan Houser's Absurd Ventures, establishing a new studio that'll be known as Absurd Marin.
</p>
<p>
Immortals of Aveum, a "single-player first person magic shooter", launched to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/immortals-of-aveum-review">mixed reviews</a> last August, and it failed to make much of an impact commercially. As a result, just a month later, Ascendent Studios announced it had made the "painfully difficult, but necessary" decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/immortals-of-aveum-studio-lays-off-45-of-staff-following-poor-sales">lay off 45 percent of its staff</a>, equating to around 40 employees.
</p>
<p>
And things didn't get much better from there; earlier this year, it was reported a "large portion" of the remaining team <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/immortals-of-aveum-developer-furloughs-majority-of-staff-report">had been furloughed</a>, leaving the future of Ascendant in doubt. But now, Houser's Absurd Ventures has announced it's taken at least some of the studio under its wing, with a "core team" of around 20 former employees forming new developer Absurd Marin.

<p>
Based in San Rafael, California, Absurd Marin will be led by Ascendant Studios' founder and game director Bret Robbins, with its team set to expand as development of its new game - described as a "story driven action-adventure title set in another, as-yet-unannounced Absurd universe" - continues.
</p>
<p>
Since its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-co-founder-dan-houser-returns-with-new-media-company-absurd-ventures">unveiling</a> last June, Absurd Ventures has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-co-founder-dan-housers-new-studio-reveals-graphic-novel-and-audio-drama">announced</a> two "universes" - American Caper and A Better Paradise - intended to form the basis of multiple transmedia projects, beginning with a graphic novel and podcast respectively. Meanwhile, a job advertisement spotted in May confirmed Absurd's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-co-founder-dan-housers-new-company-is-creating-an-open-world-action-adventure">first video game project</a> is also in the works. Referred to as an "open-world action-adventure" that's aiming to deliver "best-in-class combat and third-person action across multiple game modes", no further information has been revealed. It's unclear if this is the same project now in Absurd Marin's hands.
</p>
<p>
As for Ascendant Studios, no official notice of its closure has been shared, so its current status remains uncertain. But having lost its founder and 20 employees from an already substantially diminished team, it seems doubtful it'll have much of a future.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-404-media-subscription-journalism<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nothing is more important than learning from your elders. As part of <a href="https://aftermath.site/category/back-to-school" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Back To School week</a>, we decided to swap notes with the best: <a href="https://www.404media.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">404 Media</a>, a website that’s an entire three months older than ours. Please enjoy this very special crossover episode of Aftermath Hours, which is also inside-baseball-y enough that it could probably have qualified for <a href="https://aftermath.site/category/inside-baseball" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our previous theme week</a> as well. An incredible value!</p><p>We’re joined by 404’s Emanuel Maiberg, who tells us about the site’s first year of existence and all the highs, lows, and scoops that entailed. The short version? <a href="https://www.404media.co/what-we-learned-in-our-first-year-of-404-media/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">404 is doing great</a>, and other independent outlets can achieve similar success if they have a firm idea of what they’re going for and a willingness that borders on demonic to just gun it for a year or so.</p><p>Then we discuss Back To School week more broadly, with a special focus on Luke’s piece about game developers who – faced with unprecedented layoffs and grim future prospects – are leaving the industry entirely and <a href="https://aftermath.site/video-game-industry-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learning how to do something, anything else</a>. After that, we touch on the news of the week: PS5 Pro? <a href="https://aftermath.site/ps5-pro-700-dollars-looks-bad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Looks bad</a>! More Microsoft layoffs? <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-lays-off-another-650-people" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Also bad</a>! Lastly, we extol the virtues of sleeping on the floor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that in the distant future of three months from now, we can <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-2024-finances-subscription-plans" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pay ourselves real grown-up salaries</a> just like 404.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>We learned how we went from just writers to [being] literally everything. What were some of the growing pains in that process for you?</p><p><strong>Emanuel: </strong>Vice was obviously very dysfunctional, so it’s not as if it was a near year and someone came over and was like “Here’s the budget. Here’s the number. This is what you have to work with.” That has never happened, right? We asked for that. We asked “What number are we working with, and what are we trying to hit?” We always sought that clarity and we wanted to meet our goals so that they’d let us have more hires instead of doing more layoffs. And whatever goals they gave us, we crushed because we wanted Motherboard to survive. And I think that’s the reason Motherboard lasted longer than others and why we had a bigger staff towards the end while other parts of the company were cut.&nbsp;</p><p>I personally at the moment don’t find [doing everything] that bad. It’s not fun. It’s not rewarding in the same way that publishing an article&nbsp; – and seeing people talk about it or having it go viral or having real impact on the world – is rewarding, but I find so much relief in the clarity of “This is what is coming in” and “This is what is going out.” We have to make hard decisions, and we have conversations constantly, and some of those conversations are difficult, but the whole idea for us was: Now we are in control. Because if Vice just let us grab the wheel, we thought, we would’ve been able to make it work. And what we would’ve done probably is go “You can’t have a $700,000 bonus, executive that does nothing. You have to publish articles, because that’s what we do here.”&nbsp;</p><p>So I really appreciate the clarity. This is kind of a tortured connection, but I’ve been flying a lot, and I’m a control freak, right? That’s what I don’t like about flying: just sitting in the back and not being in control. Now I’m in the cockpit. I have my hands on the wheel, and I’m like “Now I’m comfortable.”&nbsp;</p><p>We’re successful now. The idea of this being some sort of failed experiment or disaster is no longer a possibility. It’s definitely a big success. But [we said at the beginning that] if we make mistakes, at least we own it and we know what happens – as opposed to the way things were at Vice and the way they were at G/O and all these other media companies.&nbsp;</p><p>And by the way, I come from games media. I did video game writing for years and years.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> You served your time in the mines.</p><p><strong>Emanuel:</strong> Yeah, and I follow it, and I see what happens. It’s been such a terrible time for games media, also. But it’s not the thing where you’re sitting in the office or working from home and you think everything is going well; you had a big ad deal and you met all your goals. Then someone comes in, and they’re like “That’s all good, but something happened at this totally different, unrelated part of the company, and now you have to lay off five people.” That’s how things were [at Vice].</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Part of the company died in a yacht explosion.</p><p><strong>Emanuel:</strong> The Saudi Arabia deal fell through, so now five people have to go – or something like that.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> I loved waking up and checking union Slack and being like “We did not know about this Saudi Arabia deal” and then months later being like “And it fell through!”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Emanuel: </strong>Some billionaire in Turkey that you’ve never heard of walked away from the deal, so now all your friends are unemployed.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> The experience of Jason [Koebler] firing me in an airport was one of the worst things ever, because we were both crying, because neither of us wanted to do it. Neither of us wanted to be in that Zoom meeting. It just sucked. I knew it wasn’t something that he was personally responsible for. Someone else in some other company had to balance numbers on a sheet because some executive that has no idea who I am made a choice.</p><p>It’s infuriating, and there is a lot of freedom in being like “OK, well if I’m gonna make a decision that is not 100 percent what I want to have happen with the business, at least I know what the numbers are, and I’m in some level of control over my own fate.”</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> And you can wake up whenever you want to!</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>That’s true. I do wake up at a gentleman’s 10 AM every single day.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> But that’s another hard part: How do you balance [those elements]? Because in some ways it’s your dream job; you can do whatever you want. And in other ways, I think it’s not. You know, doing math is definitely not my dream job. How do you set your own boundaries? How do you rein yourself in? What are the expectations you form together? And how do you not recreate negative patterns while also recognizing that some things exist for reasons?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Emanuel: </strong>So first of all, I have a baby, and I wake up when the baby says so. The baby is the boss.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>Boss baby!</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> A <em>real </em>boss baby.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Emanuel:</strong> Baby is life, baby is boss, I do whatever baby says. It’s hard, but I don’t get to choose if I sleep in late. But we’re definitely having that conversation now. We just closed out a year, and this year has definitely been a sprint. We launched the company, and we very much wanted it to succeed. We put all the energy that we have – and some that we don’t – into the company, and we got it to a pretty good place, and we’re happy. It’s pretty stable.</p><p>And I think now we’re having a conversation of, OK, the sprint is over, and the company is a success. Now it’s about sustainability. Now it’s about the marathon. How do we balance how much energy we can put into this without killing ourselves and each other? I don’t have a good answer. It’s one of the great questions of our age regarding burnout and how much of your worth are you taking from your job? All these things come to the surface when you’re talking about this.</p><p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://aftermath.site/category/back-to-school" target="_blank"><em>Back to School</em></a><em>&nbsp;is a week of stories about changes, nostalgia, and learning new things.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/persona-tokimeki-memorial-coming-of-age<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This doesn’t mean I think that the dungeon crawling or turn-based combat in <em>Persona</em> games are bad. Despite how many cheap one-hit KOs I’ve gotten in <em>Persona 3</em>, I still find it deeply satisfying to unlock the many layers to the combat system’s buffs, debuffs, resistances and status effects that can allow you to completely bulldoze a tough boss. It’s just that I love stories about young adults approaching the first blush of adulthood, and video games just don’t have enough of those kinds of stories.</p><p>Growing up, I so longed for games about being in high school that I taught myself emulation so I could play <em>Tokimeki Memorial Girl’s Side</em>, the girl-centric spin off of <em>Tokimeki Memorial</em>. <a href="https://youtu.be/xb-DtICmPTY?si=93xZaOFuq3hzMX5c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">At least half a day’s worth of words</a> have been said about the unique pleasures of the original game, but I have always kind of preferred <em>Girl’s Side</em>. Some of it is just wanting to date cute anime boys, but it’s also because of the way it gamifies juggling school, hobbies, a part time job and a social life. From <em>Persona 3</em> onward, the games in the <em>Persona</em> series would borrow quite a few of these game mechanics for their dungeon crawling RPGs.&nbsp;</p><p>During each “day” of <em>Tokimeki Memorial Girl’s Side </em>and its sequels, you have to schedule out what activities you’ll participate in. If you join a club, that takes up time that can’t be used to hang out with friends or study, and your character’s stats will go up and down depending on what you do. Depending on how you spend your time, you’ll meet different boys, and you’ll also meet different girls who can become your friends, but also possibly rivals for the boys you go on dates with.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Persona 3 Relaod</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of the loveliest things about this series is that it doesn’t encourage you to compete with the girls you befriend; having healthy friendships with other girls actually helps your dating life overall. In fact, if you don’t meet the parameters to get the ending with the anime boy of your choice, you can also have a platonic ending with one of your female friends. And even if one of the girls does end up mad at you for dating the guy you like, you can actually win her back by spending a lot of time with her. I remember sitting in my childhood basement—before my parents let my brother and me put computers in our bedrooms—moved to tears when I triggered a cutscene with a female friend in <em>Tokimeki Memorial</em> where she told me she just couldn’t stay mad at me. It was a kind of experience I badly wanted to have in high school. I wanted what Blair and Serena had in <em>Gossip Girl</em>: a best friend who would choose you, even if you fought. Many years later, the closest I’ve come to having that kind of a "best friend" is still this video game.</p><p>There are <em>some </em>games that portray coming of age stories. The first <em>Life Is Strange</em> is a kind of story that would feel right at home on the CW, allusions to <em>Catcher in the Rye</em> and all; I’m also a huge fan of <em>Oxenfree</em> and <em>Gone Home</em>. Some of the issue with telling coming of age stories is that they often have to do with subject matter that video games are nervous to touch. In <em>Gossip Girl</em>, the characters all drink, do drugs and have sex. This was controversial in <em>Gossip Girl</em>, and the idea of a video game portraying underage sex or drinking feels laughable.&nbsp;</p><p>Video games are often a scapegoat for all manner of social ills. Frequently, “violent video games” are mentioned after school shooting, but I’m also old enough to remember when <em>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</em> became a subject of national news because modders found a sex minigame that was cut from the final release. That minigame depicted sex between two adults and was unplayable without modding, but it caused a recall of the game and led then-Senator Hilary Clinton to ask the FTC to investigate how the ESRB rated games. Even in <em>The Sims</em>, a simulation game series that you can play as a coming of age story, Sims don’t have sex or drink alcohol. They “woo-hoo” and drink “juice” so that they can be rated T for Teen and be played by teenagers who are coming of age in real time.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Persona 3 Reload</span></figcaption></figure><p>But what the <em>Persona </em>series and dating sims like <em>Tokimeki Memorial</em> capture are the small, quiet moments—the drudgery and waiting that define teenage life just as much as drama and misadventure. In <em>Persona</em>, as you attend classes and go to club meetings, you meet characters who are just on the cusp of their adult life. Sometimes I think about the subplot with the track and field club <em>Persona 3</em>. As you attend club meetings, you get to know Kazushi Miyamoto, who is training for a big race but also hiding a knee injury. He learns that he very literally can’t run away from his problems, unable to finish track practice because his knee is too injured. When you visit him in the hospital, where he tells you that he’s skipping the race to have surgery on his knee, you can tell him that he's really grown up.</p><p>Stories about adolescence are fascinating to me because they’re all about something dying and then being reborn. The ending of <em>Persona 3</em> takes this very literally by having the character you play die on graduation day. He’s surrounded by his friends who don’t want to see him go—they, too, are changed forever by his passing. But this is growing up: learning to cherish the people close to you, mourning when you lose them. Having those experiences again, being given a window to look back on my own past by playing a character going through it for the first time, is why I play and re-play the games in the <em>Persona </em>series. I want to join every club, befriend every character, be born and reborn as I keep growing older and my own memories of my distant childhood start to fade.</p><hr><p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://aftermath.site/category/back-to-school" target="_blank"><em>Back to School</em></a><em>&nbsp;is a week of stories about changes, nostalgia, and learning new things.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/mina-the-hollower-preview-small-mouse-big-world<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Mina the Hollower</em> is one of my most anticipated games, and it's been that way for several years now. Ever since its successful <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/yachtclubgames/mina-the-hollower">Kickstarter</a>&nbsp;campaign, I've been waiting, and I will continue to do so for as long as it takes. After all, Yacht Club Games has done <em>Shovel Knight</em> for over a decade now, so who doesn't want to see how they can follow up on that franchise's massive success?</p>
<p>Thankfully, Yacht Club Games gave us the opportunity to check out an in-development build of <em>Mina the Hollower </em>during PAX West 2024. I was able to play it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/mina-hollower-feels-like-its-straight-from-cartridge">several years ago</a>, and seeing how it improved since then was an enlightening experience. Years of development were not wasted on <em>Mina the Hollower</em>.</p>
<p>And after our preview on this latest build, be sure to read below for an interview with Yacht Club Games' Sean Velasco!</p>

<h2><em>Mina the Hollower</em>:&nbsp;Refined Look and Feel</h2>
<p>If you haven't heard of <em>Mina the Hollower</em> until now, let's get you up to speed: It's a 2D adventure title where players take the role of a mouse named Mina. This Gothic-inspired, pixel art adventure has an almost top-down feel to it, and players can dig into the growth, leap out, and attack enemies with various weapons and items.</p>
<p>The most immediate change from the original build is an improved art style. Yacht Club Games are masters of their craft, and that's creating authentically retro games for the modern era. <em>Mina the Hollower</em> is just that, taking great inspiration from Game Boy Color titles.</p>
<p>Everything in <em>Mina the Hollower</em> is more detailed, creating a polished look. The palette still has its Gothic undertones, but looks a bit more colorful. I loved how <em>Mina </em><em>the Hollower</em> looked back then, but I could see it was still a work in progress. Now, it definitely appears as though we're approaching the final product.</p>

<p>Besides that, though, I was given the choice of three different weapons. The original demo used a whip a la Simon from <em>Castlevania</em>, but the other two inclusions proved to add some spice to the mix. One weapon, a hammer, is slower, but much more powerful. You can charge it up and, after several seconds, you start to flash. Unleash that attack and you'll do tons of damage to enemies.</p>
<p>And enemies in <em>Mina the Hollower</em> are tough, with attack patterns meant to get the better of you. This hammer allows you to flip in various directions to avoid attacks, but you're not as nimble when charging. It's a playstyle that should cater to those who love power over all else.</p>

<p>But my preferred weapon, or rather <em>weapons</em>, were Whisper and Vesper. Dual-wielding these daggers was so much fun, especially because of how fast they are. Compared to the hammer, you can unleash attacks in a frenzy, and even toss a dagger. The dagger works as a projectile, of course, but once it's thrown, you have to go back and grab it. It's a neat way to balance things out.</p>
<p>Beyond the fresh new art style and weapons, the main dungeon from the original demo I played seems a bit more refined, but more or less has the same feel. I'm just very excited to see what else this game has to bring to the table -- even more weapons, items, enemies, dungeons, and of course, its charming and quirky cast of characters.</p>

<h2><em>Mina the Hollower</em>:&nbsp;A Brief Chat with Yacht Club Games' Sean Velasco</h2>
<p>For years now, <em>Shovel Knight</em>'s been Yacht Club's thing -- after all, it's this armor-clad hero that propelled the studio into stardom. Still, it's "a breath of fresh air" to work on something brand new, outside of <em>Shovel Knight</em>, said Yacht Club Games Founder Sean Velasco.</p>
<p>It's still retro in feel, sure, but the intent was to make something different -- a departure from the <em>Shovel Knight</em> norm. Still, <em>Mina</em> has a lot to live up to, right?</p>
<p>"And as far as big shoes to fill," said Velasco, "sure, it's like, scary if <em>Mina </em>-- but you're only as good as your last game, right? Like, if <em>Mina </em>doesn't sell, then we'll have to figure something else out. And we always have more ideas for more games and more genres, and we still love <em>Shovel Knight</em> and we will want to keep making<em> Shovel Knight</em> stuff forever.</p>
<p>"I guess a lot of times when I was working on this, I thought, man, that sure would be fun to make some side-scrolling platforming, you know? So it's like, even when I'm doing this, I'm looking over at the other stuff. So, yeah, I guess I have a lot of feelings about it, but most of them are good."</p>

<p>One thing that stood out to me -- perhaps resembling that of <em>Shovel Knight</em> -- were various quirky characters in <em>Mina the Hollower</em>. The different knights in <em>Shovel Knight</em> as well as notable NPCs all have a lot of life and character to them. It seems <em>Mina the Hollower</em> will follow this precedent in its characters, and somewhat so in its story, too.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I mean, <em>Mina </em>is a game that is a little bit more scary than <em>Shovel Knight</em>, and has some more horror, horror-y elements," said Velasco, "And I think part of this, part of the development of this game, has been trying to not be goofy, like King Knight, and it's like, no, hey, come on, this is like, kind of got to be a serious game, kind of -- but we, I think we totally failed at that. It ended up being, it's like a fun, family-friendly horror."</p>
<p>More on the gameplay side of things, <em>Mina</em> <em>the Hollower</em>'s scope has evolved to become a more ambitious, larger game. What had me intrigued was the mention of an interconnected world, sort of in the vein of <em>Dark Souls</em>. Looking at <em>Mina the Hollower</em>, one might not be able to see that element of gameplay right away, so I wanted to learn more.</p>
<p>Initially, this open world was conceived to be more like <em>The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask</em>. Velasco described it as a world "linked together like a web" in a ring or donut shape.</p>

<p>"But as we developed the game and all the characters that I was talking about were getting more integrated," said Velasco, "and all these, like missions and quests, and you're having to crisscross back and forth across everything, it became evident that there was more, like there was, we needed more meat around in the middle to form it as you go between the areas.</p>
<p>"Yeah, we basically put the whole game together," Velaco later adds, "and now we're tweaking and polishing each bit of it to make it one cohesive package."</p>
<p>The release date for <em>Mina the Hollower</em> is still up in the air, but Yacht Club Games is putting every ounce of creativity they have into this one. It's hard to follow up to a massive success like <em>Shovel Knight</em>, but if anyone can one-up themselves, certainly Yacht Club can.</p>

Why? Well, to be blunt about it: I want a better PlayStation and I’m willing to spend $700 on it.</p><p>I know that sounds ludicrous to some people. And that’s fine. In reality, every video game console is a wild luxury that a lot of people in this world can’t afford, and some are just more luxurious and expensive than others. I acknowledge that $700 is a lot of money to ask for a game console, but what Sony is offering for that price seems like a fair trade to me, a person who owns a big dumb fancy 4K TV in his basement. </p><p>I want to be sure that when a new game comes out in 2025, I’ll have the most powerful console option available to play it. (Assuming said game arrives on PS5.) I want higher resolutions and framerates. I want cleaner images that are less fuzzy. I want raytraced lighting and shadows. I want increased draw distances. I want <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> to look as sharp and run as perfectly as possible. I care about that stuff. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-reaction-framerate-graphics-60fps-performance-1851644758&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-reaction-framerate-graphics-60fps-performance-1851644758">Even if you can’t tell the difference or don’t care</a></span>, which is fair, I notice these things. And I’m willing to spend $700 to get all these improvements. </p><h2 id="h176230"><a id=""></a>I already have a gaming PC, too!</h2><p>“But why not just buy a high-end PC?!” I hear some folks scream. Well, I have one already. And I play a lot of games on it. It’s great. But I also spend every day of the week working in my home office on my PC. The last thing I want to do once I’m done working is continue to sitting at that desk in order to play a game. For me, playing games on a console offers a more comfy, laid back experience that doesn’t feel like I’m at work. </p><p>And yes, I can run an HDMI cable from my PC to my TV and play games on the couch. I know. I’ve done that before. But sometimes I’m tired and I want to crawl onto my comfy loveseat and play a video game on my big dumb TV. I don’t want to mess with drivers, or cables, or multiple launchers. I just want to hit play on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kotaku-review-playstation-5-1851640280&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kotaku-review-playstation-5-1851640280"><em>Astro Bot</em></a></span> and feel good for two hours or so. With a PS5 Pro, I’ll be able to do that and the games will look and play better in ways I appreciate and care about. Seems good to me? </p><p>As someone who grew up not being able to buy new consoles due to money being tight, I love buying the latest PlayStation, Xbox, or Nintendo device because it feels good. It’s a little treat for myself, a way to say, “Hey, good job saving your money and being responsible. Enjoy this dumb new tech thing.”<br></p><p> I understand that not everyone can afford a PS5 Pro. I don’t have kids. I live in Kansas. My cost of living is low. So I have savings and “fun money.” Not everyone does and if you can’t afford a PS5 Pro I’m not shaming you or saying you can’t be sad about it. I’m just explaining that I can afford this. It won’t screw me over or hold me back from paying other bills. I’m a responsible (more or less) adult who has decided that I want a more capable console and I’m going to buy it and enjoy it. You can yell at me on Twitter, but I’ll probably just block you. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hasbro-ceo-chris-cocks-expresses-support-of-ai-in-dungeons-dragons<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Another generative AI controversy has arrived in the tabletop community. Except this time it isn't in its use in <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/games-workshop-imposes-golden-demon-ai-ban-preventing-its-use-in-miniature-painting" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a miniature painting competition</a>. It is an official statement by Hasbro's CEO on using generative AI for future <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> products. And the reasoning is tenuous at best.</p>

<p>According to a report by Christian Hoffer for <a href="https://www.enworld.org/threads/hasbro-ceo-chris-cocks-talks-ai-usage-in-d-d-updated.706638/">EN World</a>, Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks spoke at a Goldman-Sachs event about how AI products could support <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> and other Hasbro brands.</p>
<p>Cocks was asked if the implementation of AI could "bend the cost curve" in terms of entertainment development. Cocks' response was the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Inside of development, we've already been using AI. It's mostly machine-learning-based AI or proprietary AI as opposed to a ChatGPT approach. We will deploy it significantly and liberally internally as both a knowledge worker aid and as a development aid. I'm probably more excited though about the playful elements of AI. If you look at a typical D&amp;D player....I play with probably 30 or 40 people regularly. There's not a single person who doesn't use AI somehow for either campaign development or character development or story ideas. That's a clear signal that we need to be embracing it. We need to do it carefully, we need to do it responsibly, we need to make sure we pay creators for their work, and we need to make sure we're clear when something is AI-generated. But the themes around using AI to enable user-generated content, using AI to streamline new player introduction, using AI for emergent storytelling, I think you're going to see that not just our hardcore brands like D&amp;D but also multiple of our brands."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even when taking into account Cocks' intended audience, this statement seems to go against the central appeal and joy of playing TTRPGs. The hobby is, at its core, a deeply creative communal experience. One where the product complements the inherent human experience.</p>

Even if a table uses generative AI at their table, that is in a private personal context. It is a far cry from using it to develop a commercial product that involves paying artists for their work.</p>
<p>This tension between the creative and business implementation of generative AI has been ongoing with Hasbro. Wizards of the Coast had to restate a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-clarifies-stance-on-ai-artwork-in-their-books" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ban of AI artwork</a> in their <em>D&amp;D</em> books, There was even hand-wringing over Hasbro posting a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-release-statement-regarding-ai-engineering-role" rel="noopener" target="_blank">job listing for AI Engineering</a> on Linkedin.</p>
<p>There is even pushback within Wizards of the Coast's own staff. Greg Tito, Wizards of the Coast's Communications Director, posted <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gregtito.com/post/3l3ywft6sxf2d">on Bluesky</a>, "I'm deeply mistrustful of AI and don't want people using it anywhere near my D&amp;D campaigns."</p>

The Lego version of this iconic city includes all the buildings and landmarks you’d expect, from the player character’s farm, to the beach, the rundown community, and all the resident’s houses. Jensen even recreated the <em>Stardew Valley </em>title screen using Lego bricks, too. </p><p>When asked by the outlet which part of the <em>Stardew Valley</em> project was his favorite, Jensen mentioned the Wizard’s Tower, as he feels he perfectly nailed the shape and color of the building. Another favorite is his Lego version of the game’s Hat Shop. </p><p>“I was able to make [it] almost entirely hollow, so you can look through the cracks and broken parts, and see through to more such openings on the other side.

The game never penalizes you for going in a different direction. Leaves should be green, right? Well if you want them to be blue, <em>Chicory </em>won’t tell you otherwise. Grass can be orange, and otherwise earthy rocks can be red. The world is quite literally your canvas, and the game never polices what can and cannot be drawn on, nor does it chastise you if you choose to leave the world blank in many places. Story advancement will require you to engage with the mechanic at some point, but for the most part, you’re allowed to be as creative as you <em>want </em>to be. For folks who doubt their creative abilities (like me), <em>Chicory </em>is a very freeing experience and I found myself constantly grateful for its willingness to meet me on my terms rather than the other way around.<br></p><p>Its story follows Pizza, an anthropomorphic dog that comes to possess a magical brush passed down to Wielders, a select few individuals tasked with the coloring of their respective lands. Chicory is the wielder of the Picnic Province where the game takes place, only she’s stopped coloring and fallen into a depressive bout. She doubts her ability to color and cracks under the pressure of having to bolster the Picnic Province, at which point Pizza, and the player, unceremoniously assume the role in her absence.<br></p><p><em>Chicory</em>’s primary gameplay mechanic is the brush, which is tied to your mouse or one of your thumbsticks. You can hold down the paint button to fill in a certain element of the world or you can flick the brush around and physically paint every bit of it. There are puzzles to be solved, including filling pathways with paint to light up paths through dark caverns, or coloring in a vine so that you can use it to quickly travel between spots. 90 percent of the time, <em>Chicory </em>is the world’s most adorable puzzle game, though the solutions are rarely ever so dense that you perplexedly stare at your screen trying to figure it out.<br></p><p>Otherwise, <em>Chicory </em>is an adventure that is as heartfelt as it is painfully honest. It<em> </em>is obviously a game that presents itself as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/best-cozy-games-disney-dreamlight-valley-chill-relaxing-1848255535&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/best-cozy-games-disney-dreamlight-valley-chill-relaxing-1848255535">cute and cozy</a></span>, but it’s also a deeply empathetic look into the creative struggle and the hardship of believing in oneself. You will take on drawing challenges sometimes, and while you’re encouraged to do your absolute best, the game refuses to judge you. <em>Chicory </em>isn’t interested in establishing a hierarchy of art, or trying to define good and bad examples of it. It welcomes your attempts and claps you on the back for even trying. It’s the most accepting game I’ve ever played,a piece of work so utterly driven by the belief that art, and whatever shape it takes, is one of the best things we do.<br></p><p><em>Chicory</em>’s boss fights, which are the only instances of combat in the game and include <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-PhpHZ76QA&amp;list=PLBO2h-GzDvIZdm61SfbYuYUi-vWPmkr9W&amp;index=20&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-PhpHZ76QA&amp;list=PLBO2h-GzDvIZdm61SfbYuYUi-vWPmkr9W&amp;index=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this banger of a track</a></span>, build off of some of these notions. During each one of them, you are faced with the manifestations of deep-seated insecurities. They are sometimes gnarly fights against distorted versions of familiar characters and creatures that devolve into bullet hells. Our psyche is often our most damning critic, and unlike most people in the real world, our negative thoughts are rarely sparing. The only way to overcome them is to express yourself through your art. In practice, it’s as simple as simply using the brush to paint over your opponent in most situations, but in real life it could be any number of things. It’s going outside and taking some pictures or picking up a guitar and strumming till you break through that wall impeding your progress.<br></p><p>I’ve rarely played a game in which themes and mechanics were tied together <em>this </em>well. <em>Chicory </em>is an absolutely breathtaking game, and one that feels bound to strike some kind of chord, no matter what walk of life you come to it from. If you want a game that feels like a warm and understanding hug, grab <em>Chicory </em>now and thank me later.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/enotria-the-last-song-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Enotria: The Last Song is quite like most games inspired by From Software-style action RPGs. You patiently adventure through dungeons, put weapons of various shapes and sizes into monsters, and try not to die terribly in the process. It’s all pretty familiar by now, but all the other stuff around that core is where developer Jyamma Games really tries to spice up this recipe. The ideas that work, like taking the setting out of dank caves and swampy bogs into the shimmering light of sunny mountainsides and colorful cities, really work. The things that don’t, like the overwhelming amount of unintuitive things to unlock and equip and the janky performance issues, keep Entoria’s name from gracing the growing list of games that become more than just another soulslike.</p><p>The most striking way Enotria escapes the dark and gloomy shadow of the big games it’s inspired by is its livelier setting and art direction. Where most soulslikes are dedicated to the dank caves and dungeons that are staples of the genre, Enotria gets the sun involved in a big way, beyond simply praising it. Striking skies, rolling fields of golden sunflowers, and clean, sandy shores are front and center. Even places where things go bump in the night still have bold colors and radical environmental aspects like huge, twisting trees. Similarly, many enemy and NPC character designs are covered in little details that make them pop, even when the textures can sometimes feel flat.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Enotria: The Last Song - May 2024 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>This more vibrant world is suffering from a dark corruption that has trapped everyone in it in a constant state of monotony and repetition. There’s lots of metaphor to stage plays and everyone playing a role like an actor, especially early on, but I found my interest waned in the plot as I progressed. Individual interactions with some characters can be interesting, but in true soulslike fashion, much of this story is hidden in mystery, and I was not all too keen to unravel this one.</p><p>Each area is filled with enemies that vary greatly from each other, but within each region they can get pretty repetitive over time. That doesn’t mean they can’t be dangerous the whole way through, but I saw most of what I could expect from a given region pretty early into it, and it takes about five or so hours to get through one. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>A region's enemies can get repetitive, but I did enjoy most bosses.</p></div><p>I did enjoy most of the bosses I encountered, the best of them providing unique challenges that broke up the dungeon skulking. They aren’t all hits, though: Sometimes I fought cool stuff like a big, gnarly hermit crab or a golden conquistador who could moonlight as a Final Fantasy dragoon, while other times I fought the same knight with the same sword combos but different colored armor on four separate occasions.</p><p>It all gets slightly undermined by some inconsistent performance, too. Even my reliable combo of an Intel Core i9-9000 processor and an RTX 3070 GPU struggled to keep the frame rate smooth, usually when entering new zones or fighting outside in very sunny spots. It was always a bummer to see such pretty spaces chug so dramatically, regardless of the combination of settings I tried.</p><p>Even so, there’s a lot of worthwhile exploration to do in each of Enotria’s three zones. Areas like the eerie yet bustling city of Quintia are dense with lots of branching paths that lead to loot or shortcuts. Occasionally, these shortcuts can help you bypass whole sections of a castle or crypt, but very few turn out to be paths to whole new locations. There were plenty of nooks and crannies to despite the relative linearity of each zone , but there were some gimmicks that seemed like they would be a bigger deal early on that showed up very scarcely after, like white glyphs that can be activated to make temporary platforms and structures to open up new locations.</p><p>Much more common are the red glyphs all over the world that unleash combat challenges which range from pushovers to absolute menaces – I was happy to see they were optional after I went knocking on their door and got knocked on my ass. It was sort of strange and jarring, then, when I would stumble into rooms that also included bosses that I would later learn were not necessary to beat just lingering around without that same kind of action to opt in, so to speak. It’s like Enotria identified surprise bosses as a problem with soulslikes and made red glyphs to address that, and then in the same game shunned their own solution. It’s not a huge issue – this kind of pushback is par for the course in these games – but it’s a head-scratching moment of inconsistency.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Finding new enemies to beat up is always a good experience.</p></div><p>I’m willing to forgive things like that because combat is pretty strong, so finding new enemies to beat up is always a good experience (framerate issues notwithstanding). Anyone familiar with these sorts of games will be at home with the basic light and heavy attacks being governed by stamina. There is no blocking, and parrying doesn’t stun enemies outright, instead building up a gauge that eventually opens bad guys up for big attacks. Entoria’s parry window is more forgiving than in games like Lies of P, which similarly wraps its defensive strategy around counters, and therefore it felt way more approachable in the early game. Around midway in to this 30ish hour campaign, expect to get that deflect button tested regularly by enemies with longer attack strings, or encounters with multiple baddies at once. I liked the gradual easing into this kind of challenge, but sometimes I felt like the claustrophobic camera and the lock-on with a mind of its own felt like they were working for the enemies. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The risk/reward of the parry system extends to the four status ailments you can afflict on enemies (or be afflicted by), each having a dual set of conditions that help and harm. Causing dizziness on opponents reduces their defenses, but also makes them stronger and lets them recover stamina more quickly. Sick is your standard poison that does damage over time, but if you get too close to a sick enemy you can get sick yourself. It does sometimes feel counterintuitive or regressive on some bosses especially; using the fatuo element against enemies weak to it will do more damage – but it will also put the wicked status on them, which makes all of their elemental power way more destructive. Overall, though, I think the ailment system does encourage staying vigilant even when you have the advantage.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The four status ailments each have dual conditions that help and harm.</p></div><p>On the other hand, Entoria’s seven weapon types aren’t all as distinct from one another, mechanically. Ultra greatswords and colossal hammers are <em>technically</em> different on paper, but in practice I found no need to dedicate my two weapon slots to both of these where one big stick would do. There are around 120 weapons across all of these types, and while I didn’t find nearly as many as that, the ones I did find covered just about every base possible when it came to the four types of elemental damage they could do, those corresponding status ailments, and how they scale with your stats. Interestingly, different weapons can hide some additional abilities that are only be activated when using the right light/heavy combos. I didn’t spend too much time testing which ones do what, but more than once the decision to choose between two similar weapons with similar traits came down to the fact that one of them did extra elemental damage when I hit the right button and the other didn't, and I enjoyed having that opportunity.</p><p>As far as building your character goes, masks are as close to classes as Enotria gets. Besides changing your look, they offer passive bonuses like doing more damage with heavy attacks or increasing stamina and defense. To get an effective build going, you need to use their boons as a baseline and layer on additional modifications in the form of roles and perks. The former are aspects of enemies you defeat that alter your stats in positive and negative ways, while also giving you more passive bonuses; I beat up a big crab and its aspect raised three of my stats but lowered two others while also raising my health by a percentage. On top of that, perks can add even more passive quirks to all of the attacks, dodges, parries, and abilities you'll use. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3>Jarrett Green's Soulslike Samba</h3><p>A definitive, completely correct list of the best Soulslikes around</p></div><p>Mixing and matching mask lines – Enotria’s version of offensive and defensive skills and spells – can be fun. Most of them are pretty impactful, even if the only real difference between many of them is the special elemental or status effects they cause. They must be charged up by hitting enemies before they can be employed, meaning they can’t be used to get you out of binds reactionarily. This isn’t so bad when adventuring through dungeons because you’ll have plenty of opportunities to hit things and fill up your meters. The problem appears when you pull up to a boss fight, which empties your meters fully before you start, meaning you have to work up to these powerful attacks from scratch against the tough challenges where you’d likely need them the most. I can understand why the designers would want to level the playing field, but it always felt needlessly punitive and I’d have liked to have been able to take advantage of preparing for a fight in that way. Mask line gauges also drain every time you rest at a bonfire, which felt more annoying than bad.</p><p>This is a lot of character tweaking to do, and perhaps too much for all but the most dedicated build hounds. I enjoy that myself, but what’s irritating is that none of the impacts of this lasagna of layered RPG systems are well communicated before testing things live against enemies. A list of all the bonuses being applied by everything in my loadout would have done wonders for measuring my build’s potential while still in the menu screen, for example. Charging speeds for lines are in Italian, which isn't an issue for me and Google translate’s powers combined, but when “presto” and “vivace” both mean fast, theres no telling which one is faster without just figuring it out on the fly. Being able to set up three separate loadouts, each with their own masks, weapons, lines, perks, etc, that you can switch through on the fly means you can be ready for anything, but after settling on two builds I liked, I almost never made use of the third. In fact, I didn’t have to interact much with any of these systems after finding a good build early, which both highlights how ineffective it is at creating diverse play styles naturally, and how strong the combat is without all of that noise.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>Aside from the fundamentals of combat, Enotria: The Last Song really tries to step outside of the box when it comes to dressing up the standard soulslike. The sun-drenched environments and wild, Italian folklore-inspired character designs are a real breath of fresh air straight from Italy’s Alps. Combat is fun, even when the difficulty spikes unexpectedly (since most of those fights are optional anyway) and despite the bloat of many, many systems that govern all of the more nuanced abilities and stats. The unapproachability of its RPG systems, and the wonky performance when a smooth frame rate matters the most are what really prevent Enotria from taking center stage.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-interview-with-jun-furutani-discussing-the-series-return-game-modes-netcode/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-launches-on-october-11th-new-trailer-released/">Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO</a> is the long-anticipated return of the Budokai Tenkaichi series, which, from the very first entry in the series, set itself apart from most games based on the series created by Akira Toriyama with its explosive gameplay that well represented the intense fights filled with energy blasts and all sorts of other explosive combat techniques.</p><p>During Gamescom 2024, we had the chance not only to try out the game but also to speak with the game's producer Jun Furutani, discussing the return of the series, the available game modes, the netcode, and the possibility of high framerate options. Enjoy!</p><p><em>The interview was conducted via an interpreter and has been edited for clarity.</em></p><div>
<p><strong>Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO is releasing a long time after the previous entry in the series. Why did it take so long, considering how Dragon Ball's popularity continues to be immense?</strong></p>
<p>When we released Dragon Ball: Budokai Tenkaichi 3, I thought the game was almost complete. At the same time, I had a lot of plans for other games. However, with the advancement of new technology, new game engines, and current-generation consoles, we had become able to deliver new surprises over the previous entry in the series, so it felt the right time had come to bring back the series, and we went ahead and developed Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO.</p>
<p><strong>Earlier today, I tried out the game, and it felt familiar and very accessible right from the start. However, I noticed the game had some additional accessibility options. Why were these added, considering the series has always been quite accessible?</strong></p>
<p>The previous entries in the series featured very fast gameplay, which made it difficult for a lot of beginners to play them. When I played the series for the first time, I had some trouble controlling my character, and I lost to my friends. <em>(laughs)</em> Nowadays, with games like Dragon Ball FighterZ and other competitive games, it is possible to perform combos with just a single button, which makes it a game that's easy to play at the most basic level, something that's great for beginners.</p>
<p>I wanted to do something similar with Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO and make the action feel good for every sort of player, providing options that would make the game enjoyable, no matter the skill level. Advanced players can perform the most complicated inputs manually, have more options, and can reach a higher level, so there's still the motivation to turn off these assistance options, as they are meant to help players who have never played a game in the series before.</p>
<p><strong>Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO is powered by Unreal Engine 5. Why did you go with it? Has it allowed you to do things not possible otherwise?</strong></p>
<p>The game focuses on letting the player feel like a Dragon Ball character, so immersion is extremely important, and Unreal Engine 5 allowed us to improve it with more real-time graphics, such as visual effects when a character powers up, when the sky darkens, and so on. Additionally, during the game's high-speed, high-power battles, characters can be launched towards buildings or mountains, whose destruction is in real-time. All this has been possible by using Unreal Engine 5, making battles even more exciting.</p>
<p><strong>Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO has a lot of characters. How did you pick characters? Is there any character that was originally considered but was later dropped?</strong></p>
<p>Being the new entry in a long-running series, it was natural to start off with characters featured in the previous games. Budokai Tenkaichi 3 had 161 characters, and we are aiming to go even higher in Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO. Like the previous games, there are character variants from different eras, which is something fans loved to see in the older games, so by doing the same in the new game, players will be able to feel familiar with the experience right from the start. As the Dragon Ball story has evolved since the release of the previous game, we have added characters from Dragon Ball Super on top of the existing roster.</p>
<p>As for characters that did not make it into Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO, I cannot talk about it, as we have a strict policy on the matter and do not want to spoil anything. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>How did you approach balancing with such a huge roster? Have canonically weaker characters been balanced so that they can hold their own against stronger ones?</strong></p>
<p>Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO is not a competitive game like Dragon Ball FighterZ, where there must be some balance between characters. The game is all about providing a Dragon Ball experience, so characters who are strong in the anime and manga are just as strong in the game. For example, a character like Gogeta is going to be very strong, while others like Mr. Satan will struggle a lot. It's all part of Dragon Ball and, thus, the game.</p>
<p>At the same time, however, we do have a system that balances the power of every character. In tournaments, for example, each character has a cost, so players will not be able to pick the five strongest characters for their team, forcing them to balance things out and still providing a reason for a player to pick a weaker character.</p>
<p><strong>Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO features a single-player mode called Episode Battles. How many of them are there? Is there any secret scenario to unlock?</strong></p>
<p>Episode Battles cover the Dragon Ball story from the battle with the Saiyans until the Dragon Ball Super Power Tournament. However, there will be a different number of battles, depending on the character. Of the playable characters, which include Goku, Gohan, Piccolo and Vegeta, Goku will have the most battles, starting from his battle against Raditz until the Power Tournament. Additional Episodes can also be unlocked while playing.</p>
<p><strong>Any other single-player mode?</strong></p>
<p>Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO also features a custom battle mode that lets players create their own scenarios, pick among a selection of pre-set battles, and share their custom battles online. There's also a local Tournament Mode where eight players compete for the top spot using different rules. While this is primarily a local and online multiplayer mode, it can also be played in single-player mode against opponents controlled by the AI.</p>
<p><strong>Besides Tournament Mode, which modes will be available for online play?</strong></p>
<p>Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO's online modes include a ranking mode, a player match mode where players can freely create a room and invite their friends to play, and the aforementioned Tournament mode.</p>
<p><strong>Which type of netcode will the game feature?</strong></p>
<p>Delay-based netcode.</p>
<p><strong>Speaking about multiplayer, Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO will launch with a local multiplayer mode that will support only a single map. Are there any plans to expand the map selection over time?</strong></p>
<p>I can't comment on this yet. Please wait for more information in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Modern fighting games support high refresh rate monitors to reduce input delay. Will Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO follow suit?</strong></p>
<p>There are no plans to offer a high refresh rate mode on any platform. The game will run at 60 frames per second across PC and consoles.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time!</strong></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/100-thieves-cdl-superteam/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/report-100-thieves-to-build-cdl-%E2%80%98superteam%E2%80%99-based-on-scrap-and-hydra.980700/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/100-thieves-cdl-superteam/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has been claimed that 100 Thieves, which is represented in the Call of Duty League by the LA Thieves, is looking to assemble a so-called ‘superteam’ for the new season. In a report online published by Breaking Point, it was claimed that HyDra, Envoy, Scrap, and Ghosty are exploring this option ahead of the CDL 2025 season.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-mightiest">The Mightiest</h2>



<p>Per the report published on social media by Breaking Point, Toronto Ultra’s Scrap and Cloud9’s HyDra are eager to team up in the new season. It was also claimed that the remaining two slots would be occupied by Envoy (Ultra) and Ghosty, who already owns a spot on the LA Thieves roster.</p>



<p>There’s no doubt that this would represent one of the nastiest power squads in the Call of Duty League.</p>



<p>HyDra is often considered one of the best Call of Duty players of all time in terms of raw skill and gunny. He’s known as the French Phenon for a reason, and in the 2023 season, he was instrumental in the New York Subliners winning two Majors and COD Champs.</p>



<p>In 2023, Thomas ‘Scrap’ Ernst won Rookie of the Year, going on to become a force to be reckoned with and earning some of the highest and most consistent ratings out of any pro COD player <strong>ever</strong>. He’s a bit inflammatory, but the fans love it.</p>



<p>Envoy, who has been dubbed ‘The Prince’, and Dan ‘Ghosty’ Rothe are both stellar competitors with plenty to offer any team in the CDL. Envoy and Scrap have teamed for an entire year, which gives them valuable chemistry, and Ghosty has been serving as a fine IGL for a long time.</p>



<p>There are a few blockers, though. Per <a href="https://x.com/GGBreakingPoint/status/1834667387872030828" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Breaking Point</a>, the budget to arrange this move would be ‘challenging’ at best, and it would of course require several buy-outs, some of which (HyDra and Scrap) might be exorbitant.</p>



<p>This is the reality of rostermania – you never know what’s going to happen next.</p>



<p>Do you think this team could win COD Champs? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming Forum</a>.</p>

Blizzard has shared more on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a>'s previously announced <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> collaboration - which arrives as part of the MMO's 20th anniversary celebrations - confirming the event begins next Tuesday, 17th September.
</p>
<p>
Word of its start date arrives alongside a nifty new trailer featuring a first-person ride through a theme-park-style attraction called Blizzard World. As the trailer unfolds, a number of unseen Overwatch 2 characters comment on the ensuing crossover mayhem, and we're given a glimpse at the hero shooter's new World of Warcraft collaboration skins.
</p>
<p>
Those skins include Sylvanas Windrunner Widowmaker, Lich King Reinhardt, Thrall Zenyatta, and Diamond Magni Torbjorn. Whether Blizzard has anything more planned for Overwatch 2's big World of Warcraft event beyond a handful of skins remains to be seen, but all will likely be revealed when the event gets underway next week.

<p>
Overwatch 2's World of Warcraft collaboration arrives as part of its 12th season, which introduced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/overwatch-2s-new-hero-is-space-ranger-juno-and-shes-available-to-play-today">new support hero Juno</a>, Clash mode, new maps, and more back in August. It also comes as Blizzard plots <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/overwatch-2-exploring-reintroduction-of-6v6-in-a-series-of-upcoming-tests">potentially major changes</a> for Overwatch 2, with director Aaron Keller having recently confirmed the team is considering - if not guaranteeing - the return of 6v6 matches, after player counts were downsized to 5v5 when <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> transitioned to its sequel.
</p>
<p>
It was also recently reported that Activision and Microsoft have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-has-reportedly-set-up-a-smaller-team-to-create-aa-games-based-on-its-franchises">established a new "smaller" team</a> within Blizzard to develop "AA" games based on its existing properties.

		<p><em>It feels like Star Wars is better known for its controversies than the stories it's telling. That's less true when it comes to Star Wars games, at least, but while we seem to have more Star Wars-centric games than we've seen in years, doesn't it sometimes feel a little same-y?</em></p><p><em>Part of the reason Star Wars Outlaws feels like such a breath of fresh air is because it feels a bit like a trick? Ubisoft funded a AAA Star Wars video game that cost tens of millions of dollars and you don't throw a lightsaber around? You're a thief who sneaks around a bunch?</em></p><p><em>Sure, Outlaws is not without its issues, but it harkens back to a different era of Star Wars video games, when a universe that is both specific and intriuiginly undefined could support all kinds of different video games.</em></p><p><em> Could we capture that again? </em></p><p><em>That's what Rob and Patrick are here to figure out. </em></p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@lhgerona?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Lyman Hansel Gerona</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Patrick: </strong>So Rob, I’ve been thinking about how you’ve fallen a bit for Star Wars <em>Outlaws</em>. We have some scattered data <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/despite-high-hopes-for-star-wars-outlaws-and-xdefiant-ubisofts-share-price-is-now-sitting-at-a-10-year-low/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>suggesting the game has not been a massive hit</u></a>, but we aren’t privy to Ubisoft and Disney’s expectations, so who knows? What we do know is that <em>Star Wars Outlaw</em>s is a good game, but your mileage may vary based on how you take to the stealth, and how much simply being in a gorgeously realized <em>Star Wars </em>world is enough to make you happy.</p><p>What it got me wondering about, more broadly, is the state of Star Wars video games. If this <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/upcoming-star-wars-games/?ref=remapradio.com"><em><u>Games Radar</u></em></a><em><u> </u></em>article is correct, here’s what has been announced for the future of Star Wars:</p><ul><li>Untitled Respawn Strategy Game</li><li><em>Star Wars: Eclipse</em> (Quantic Dream)</li><li><em>Knights of the Old Republic</em> Remake</li><li>Untitled Amy Hennig Star Wars Game</li><li>Star Wars Jedi 3&nbsp;</li></ul><p>It’s a predictable spread, with a big emphasis on splashy, action-centric games where, inevitably, the player is likely to be at the center of events that Could Destroy Everyone. It’s missing some of that weird spice that helped define Star Wars gaming’s best runs in the past.</p><p>I wouldn’t describe myself as a Star Wars kid growing up, but when you look over the list of Star Wars video games released in the past, you suddenly realize “well, I sure as hell was a Star Wars <em>video game</em> kid.” <em>Super Star Wars. Star Wars Episode I: Racer. Rebel Assault. X-Wing and Tie Fighter. Rogue Squadron. Shadow of the Empire. Knights of the Old Republic. </em>Hell, I think I even loaded up that weird<em> Yoda Stories </em>because it came bundled with something else.</p><p>What makes <em>Outlaws </em>interesting, and perhaps risky (?), is how it ditches force powers and lightsabers. I mean, that stuff <em>exists</em> in the world of <em>Outlaws</em>, but you are not a secret demi-god.&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe it only feels risky because of how modern Star Wars revolves around Luke Skywalker, which then inherently limits the kinds of stories you can tell and the gameplay supporting that?</p><p>And while it’s true many, many <em>Star Wars</em> video games in its long history have involved players getting to cosplay as Luke Skywalker or someone with the same power set, many of my favorite Star Wars games are where you’re more of a grunt! You get to inhabit a space in this weird, vaguely familiar world. What’s cool about, say, X-Wing is being adjacent to all the space magic.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s easier to role-play because if our own world suddenly had such fantastical things, it’s far more likely that you or I would be witnessing it from the sidelines, not getting to wield it around.</p><p>You’ve played much more <em>Outlaws</em> than me. You’ve also thought about <em>Star Wars </em>storytelling way more than me. Where do you think <em>Outlaws </em>fits within <em>Star Wars’ </em>gaming history?</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@sushioutlaw?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Brian McGowan</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Rob: </strong>I think you’ve already touched on it: <em>Outlaws </em>fits within this tradition of <em>Star Wars </em>games existing on the margins or in the backdrop of that universe… but it’s a major AAA release of the kind that didn’t even exist when LucasArts / Lucasfilm Games were at their peak. That might highlight why success with the license has proven to be so elusive. The universe has always lent itself to games that let you inhabit the setting… but not necessarily take part in the main action of the plot. You get access to the setting’s toybox, and that’s always been the part of the universe that lends itself most readily to video games.</p><p>So you had a really perfect overlap in the 90s between the stuff the video games excelled at, the stuff people wanted from a <em>Star Wars </em>game, and the costs of developing games in those genres relative to their prospective audience. Four of those games you mentioned are basically, “You wanna sit in the cockpit of a <em>Star Wars </em>ship or race car and blast away?” I might even argue <em>Shadows of the Empire </em>counts for those purposes because the flight stages loom so large in the memory for that game.</p><p>I think it helped that in those days Lucasfilm’s games operation was really creatively-led. I mean this is a company that decided (correctly!) that Indiana Jones was a point-and-click adventure hero, not an action hero. Part of that’s because other genres couldn’t support the kinds of interactions that define Indy, and the adventure genre was a bigger deal back then, but I also think it highlights the way Lucasfilm made decisions that were right for its stories rather than just optimizing for broad appeal. Flight games, racing games, shooters, adventures, D&amp;D-based RPGs… they were all viable genres for a major publisher and <em>Star Wars </em>lends itself to all of them. Except you wouldn’t be Luke or Han, you’d be “pilot who might have flown with Luke” or “race car driver who might have been a rival of Sebulba’s.”</p><p><em>Outlaws </em>has a lot of the spirit of those games, I think. It’s nerdy about the background details of the setting in a way that exactly understands how and why various segments of the fandom could thrive on technical manuals for made up hardware, video games that took place almost entirely away from the main plot of the films, and really uneven books and comics. You’re not Han Solo or Lando Calrissian… but you’re the kind of dirtbag they certainly <em>seem </em>like they might have been at some point (which is probably why so much of <em>Outlaws </em>takes its cues from <em>Solo</em>). You want to be Luke Skywalker and face down the Emperor? Then go play something else, because what we’re going to let you do is ante up at the sabacc tables.</p><p>But… it’s an open world action stealth adventure of the kind that seemed entirely impractical in the 90s, something that hardware could never possibly support. I happen to think it does a great job of building the game’s texture from the setting, but the very nature of that kind of game tends to muddle the pitch. Games like this are kind of like quilts made from different scraps of genres, which gives them a measure of variety but also tends to mean there is no one thing that really distinguishes them except how much you like the characters and the setting. Is <em>Outlaws </em>a stealth game? Yeah, in the way that <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>is a stealth series, but not in the way <em>Dishonored </em>or <em>Hitman </em>is a stealth series. Is it a space shooter? Well, it has some pretty well-done space shooting in it but, no, not in the way that <em>TIE Fighter </em>is or <em>Everspace 2 </em>are. How about a regular shooter? Well it’s perfectly fine when it “goes loud” but, no, it’s pretty pointedly not trying to evoke <em>Gears </em>or <em>Wolfenstein</em>.</p>

<p>According to a new report, Microsoft is banking that Call of Duty will help to increase its game pass subscription numbers.</p>



<p>That’s according to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ffwv5v/microsoft_is_banking_on_call_of_duty_on_game_pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Verge’s Tom Warren</a>, who has reported that sources have said that Microsoft is hoping that Call of Duty coming to Xbox Game Pass will help to grow its gaming revenue numbers. According to Warren, the company had a long debate as to whether or not they should put this year’s Call of Duty title, which will be Black Ops 6, into the subscription server. He continues to report that the “company is now gambling that it will help improve Game Pass subscriber numbers amid a busy holiday season for new Xbox games and a promising year ahead.”</p>



<p>Xbox announced that Black Ops 6 will be coming on day one for Game Pass subscribers in May 2024, making it the first Call of Duty title ever to go to a subscription service on the same day as its launch. Two months later, the company announced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-is-raising-xbox-game-pass-prices-by-as-much-as-25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">increases to its Game Pass subscription by as much as 25%</a>. As of February 2024, the company reported that Xbox Game Pass had a total of 34 million paying customers across its three pricing tiers.</p>



<p>It’s evident that Microsoft wants Call of Duty to increase its Game Pass subscriptions and revenues; after all, it is a business, but the question is, by how much and for how long? Call of Duty is a mammoth franchise, but hoping that one game can substantially increase subscription numbers seems a bit of a reach. </p>



<p>The news comes following another round of layoffs at Microsoft, in which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-650-people-lay-off/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">approximately 650 employees were laid off</a> from its gaming division. According to an internal memo by Phil Spencer, these were mostly corporate and support functions, with reports online suggesting that mostly Activision Blizzard employees were affected. </p>



<p>Microsoft fully acquired Activision Blizzard in October 2023 for a total cost of <a href="https://microsoft.gcs-web.com/node/32336/html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">$75.4 billion</a>.</p>

But once the price tag was revealed, sticker shock took over and largely drowned out more nuanced conversations about the new device.</p><h2 id="h183418"><a id=""></a>How much better will games look on PS5 Pro?</h2><p>It’s easy to understand why. $700 is a lot to spend on a video game console, and adjusted for inflation is the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamefile.news/p/sony-to-sell-a-more-powerful-700&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/sony-to-sell-a-more-powerful-700" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">third-highest price</a></span> Sony has charged for a new console. And the company’s presentation did it no favors in trying to sell players on the virtues of making a PS5 Pro their next big gaming purchase. Cerny’s presentation showed old games, including the next-gen port of <em>The Last of Us Part II</em> which originally came out on the PS4. There was no new game running in 4K at 60fps to wow fans, and the differences with smoothness and background detail were hard to detect over the internet. Weirdly, only one outlet, <em>CNET</em>, seemed to have been invited to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/exclusive-hands-on-i-played-sonys-all-new-ps5-pro/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/exclusive-hands-on-i-played-sonys-all-new-ps5-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">test the new hardware in-person</a></span>.</p><p>It wasn’t until some experts started looking at direct, lossless renders of the PS5 Pro gameplay footage that the improvements left a larger impression. “Wow, yeah, FF7R looks a LOT better on PS5 Pro,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/dark1x/status/1834165882039271867&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/dark1x/status/1834165882039271867" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a></span> <em>Digital Foundry</em>’s John Linneman a couple of days after the initial reveal. “Night and day difference. I actually put off playing it due to other things happening at the time of release but the Pro will finally push me to enjoy it. Image quality was just too awful on normal PS5.”</p><p>The lowkey comment ignited a firestorm of replies and quote-tweets slamming the PS5 Pro and the critique of <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>’s existing graphics on the base PS5. Which was weird, because the way that Square Enix’s sprawling RPG looked gorgeous when static but choppy in motion was widely covered at launch. If anything, it’s an ideal test case for the PS5 Pro upgrade: a third party game struggling to hold things together within the current limitations of the launch hardware.</p><h2 id="h183419"><a id=""></a>A comparable PC is more expensive than people think</h2><p>  <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em> is also the type of game that will be coming to PC in the future, where on higher-end machines it will likely look even better than on PS5 Pro. But how much will those gaming rigs cost relative to what Sony’s offering? We don’t have the full official specs for the PS5 Pro yet, but builds on sites like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pcpartpicker.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pcpartpicker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PCPartPicker</a></span> run the gamut from a little more expensive to a <em>lot </em>more expensive. </p><p>For example, a barebones PC build by <em>IGN</em> trying to match the SSD storage and GPU power arrived at an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/you-can-build-a-pc-equivalent-to-the-ps5-pro-heres-how&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/you-can-build-a-pc-equivalent-to-the-ps5-pro-heres-how" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">estimated cost of around $930</a></span>. Not bad for a machine that has access to Steam sales, Epic Games Store freebies, and doesn’t require you to pay a monthly subscription for online multiplayer. But other more conservative estimates put the price much higher. A custom build by<em> Techradar</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.techradar.com/gaming/pc-gaming/how-to-build-a-ps5-pro-pc-equivalent-gaming-rig&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/pc-gaming/how-to-build-a-ps5-pro-pc-equivalent-gaming-rig" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">estimated the cost at closer to $1,200</a></span>, and that’s not even including a DualSense controller to get the most out of first-party Sony games once they’re ported to PC. Even that number might be low-baling it, though. </p><p>“Probably a fair bit more,” <em>Digital Foundry</em>’s Richard Leadbetter told <em>IGN</em> in a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/videos/digital-foundry-on-the-ps5-pro-gta-6-others-unlikely-to-hit-60fps&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/digital-foundry-on-the-ps5-pro-gta-6-others-unlikely-to-hit-60fps" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent interview</a></span> when asked how much a comparable PC would cost. “If you consider the holistic view of all the different components, the enhanced ray tracing—no AMD GPU has that at the moment—the machine learning block—no AMD GPU has that—it’s almost like essentially an Nvidia-style feature set but made by AMD and the closest equivalent GPU you’ll be locking at would be the RTX 4070. The 4060 is quite close to base PlayStation 5, factoring out machine learning and ray tracing, so you’re looking at a 4070.” </p><p>The cheapest versions of those GPUs often run over $500, with costs “ramping up” from there after including the 2TB SSD, motherboard, case, and other required PC parts.  Leadbetter stressed that the PS5 Pro price is still “crazy,” but that the math is a little more complicated, in addition to the product being largely pitched at existing PlayStation users who are unlikely to want to jump to PC and leave their existing game libraries behind. He also noted that the hardware jump from the PS5 to the PS5 Pro is smaller this time around than when Sony showcased the move from PS4 to PS4 Pro, which he largely blamed on an industry-wide struggle to bring down the costs of higher-performing tech. </p><h2 id="h183420"><a id=""></a>What’s the PS5 Pro hate really about?</h2><p>Not everyone believes that Sony is putting its best foot forward with the PS5 Pro price. An<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FglPnj1eu2o&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FglPnj1eu2o" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> opinion video</a></span> on the reveal by LinusTechTips blamed it in part on a lack of competition in the high-end console space. With PS5 reportedly outselling the Xbox Series X/S two-to-one, and a Switch 2 still not ready for primetime, the YouTube channel argues that there’s less pressure on Sony to cut its profit margins on the PS5 Pro and try to bring it in at a more appealing price point. </p><p>There’s some analysis to back up this argument. “With no comparable mid-gen upgrade from Microsoft, and Nintendo’s upcoming console expected to be less powerful than the base PS5, Sony is positioning the PS5 Pro as a premium offering for console gamers seeking superior graphics performance at a somewhat accessible price compared to high-end PCs,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/zhugeex.com/post/3l3zxyxuinu2p&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/zhugeex.com/post/3l3zxyxuinu2p" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> Daniel Ahmad, director of research and insights at Niko Partners, in a recent thread on the topic. </p><p>With the console aimed squarely at existing PS5 owners locked into a living room gaming setup, the Pro offers Sony the chance to sell the most powerful console on the market at an audience of “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/ballmatthew/status/1833531529747960244&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/ballmatthew/status/1833531529747960244" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">price insensitive</a></span>” users willing to spend extra. “Manufacturing costs, including component prices such as for SSDs, continued to remain high post pandemic and have squeezed hardware margins,” Ahmad wrote. “The lack of overall console install base expansion from prior gens has also led to platform holders maximizing spend per user and expanding beyond console.”</p><p>Even if the Pro makes business sense for Sony, it doesn’t do anything to assuage the growing frustration with the PlayStation platform this console generation. While the PS4 era was typified by lower-cost debut hardware and the coming-online of a first-party studio system aimed at churning out one mega blockbuster after another, the PS5 era is synonymous with higher prices and a feeling of less innovation and experimentation.<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-playstation-ps5-references-characters-1851640150&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-playstation-ps5-references-characters-1851640150"><em>Astro Bot</em> is a shiny exception</a></span> in a sea of first-party sequels that felt impressive but bloated compared to the novelty of their PS4-era predecessors. </p><p>Where are the brand-new Sony franchises? Where are the PS5 blockbusters pushing the envelope not just on graphics but in terms of storytelling, mechanics, and design? Instead of a big 2024 PlayStation showcase blowing them away, fans got <em>Concord</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/concord-ps5-toxic-haters-heroes-shutdown-1851646309?_gl=1*i21kms*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNjIzNDQzMi4xMzAuMS4xNzI2MjUzNTI0LjU4LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/concord-ps5-toxic-haters-heroes-shutdown-1851646309?_gl=1*i21kms*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNjIzNDQzMi4xMzAuMS4xNzI2MjUzNTI0LjU4LjAuMA..">a live-service also-ran so out of sync</a></span> with the player base that Sony unceremoniously unreleased it inside of a month. In some ways Sony is a victim of its own success, and the lofty expectations that now accompany it. And so far the only thing that feels extraordinary about the PS5 Pro is its price. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Metro developer 4A Games is not leaving the Embracer Group for Saber Interactive after all. When Saber <a href="https://wccftech.com/saber-interactive-splits-embracer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> its split with Embracer six months ago, it also secured the rights to acquire the Ukrainian studio. However, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier confirmed today that the move won't actually happen.</p>
<p><em>Saber CEO Matt Karch told me in a statement this morning that "it was always our intention to exercise on 4A” but “we thought it would be better for all parties” for the studio to instead remain with Embracer.</em></p>
<p>The news didn't exactly sit well with fans, especially after Embracer closed down several studios and laid off many employees throughout the whole group. Perhaps they'll feel better when 4A Games finally unveils its next project. The publisher <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-new-metro-game-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> a new Metro installment as early as August 2019, but we still haven't learned anything concrete other than a generic '202X' release window.</p>
<p>This year, series fans are <a href="https://wccftech.com/metro-exodus-sold-10-million-units-in-5-years-next-mainline-installment-coming-in-202x/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">getting</a> a Virtual Reality game called Metro Awakening, but it's being developed by Vertigo Games (the maker of Arizona Sunshine) instead. According to the little info we have, it will be a prequel with a supernatural vibe:</p>
<p><em>The year is 2028. The survivors of nuclear Armageddon cling to existence in the buried subways of the Moscow Metro – civilization’s last refuge and tomb, where ghosts and spirits haunt the living in this man-made purgatory.</em></p>
<p><em>You are Serdar, a doctor braving the darkness, crippling radiation and deadly threats of the Metro in the search for your wife and the medication she so desperately needs. As your courage and sanity are pushed to the limit, you must learn to walk the line between life and death, the spirit and the material world, and awaken the being you will become…</em></p>
<p>The unveiling of the next mainline Metro title (which the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/metro-exodus-sdk-released-next-metro-influenced-by-russian-invasion-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said </a>will be influenced by their experience with the Russian war) could happen as soon as the upcoming The Game Awards event. It would be about time, certainly.</p>

Yet that game gives Penguin a lot of carpet to chew up in the Christmas-set story about Batman’s rogues gallery all seeking to kill him during the night.

Specifically, you should play the first entry in the series as The Penguin is one of the main antagonists of the story.

In addition to <em>Origins</em>, the entire <em>Arkham </em>trilogy is available for less than ten bucks!
