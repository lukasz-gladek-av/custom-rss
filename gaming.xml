			<p>Battlefield Studios, the collective name for the development teams working on Battlefield 6 (DICE, Ripple Effect Studios, Criterion Games, and Motive Studio), <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1977809244906037359" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that a few balancing tweaks were rolled out to the game without the need for players to download a patch.</p>



<p>You can find the changes below:</p>



<ul>
<li>Increased ticket count for some maps on the Rush game mode to the intended amount of 100 (up from 75).</li>



<li>Reduced the muzzle velocity of the M2010 ESR from 900 to 800 m/s</li>



<li>Reduced the muzzle velocity of the PSR from 750 to 720 m/s</li>



<li>Shotgun projectiles will now take drag into account.</li>
</ul>



<p>Of course, this is just the beginning of the balancing effort. While the game launched in a solid state, leading to <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-servers-hit-capacity-at-launch-steam-charts-747k-players/">concurrency records on Steam</a> and very positive reviews from critics (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/battlefield-6-battlefield-is-mostly-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including ours</a>), the community has already requested other changes and the developers will have to continue monitoring the live service situation.</p>



<p>In other news, Reddit users have started <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1o64hvu/cronus_zen_users_on_ps5_are_now_receiving/">reporting</a> that the developers' <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-dev-partnered-with-sony-microsoft-to-better-detect-cronus-zen-on-consoles/">partnership with Sony and Microsoft against the usage of Cronus Zen devices</a> for cheats is paying off. The first permabans have already been dealt, and indeed, the people behind the Cronus Zen have reportedly recommended avoiding using the device for now:</p>



<p><em>We're currently advising all Battlefield 6 players, especially those on PC using the Zen with any of our latest scripts, to pause usage for now. The team is actively testing to understand what's causing it and ensure everything remains safe and stable. Please avoid using the Zen in Battlefield 6 until we confirm it's fine to resume. We also ask that no one publicly shares or discusses any bans — this draws unnecessary attention to the community and makes testing more difficult. </em></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dissidia-duellum-final-fantasy</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dissidia-duellum-final-fantasy-might-not-be-the-dissidia-you-wanted.1324288/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix has revealed&nbsp;<em>Dissidia Duellum Final Fantasy</em>, a brand new entry in the&nbsp;<em>Dissidia&nbsp;</em>series of spinoff fighting games, but if you were hoping for a fully-fledged PC and console title, you're going to be disappointed.</p>

<p><em>Dissidia Duellum Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>is intended for release on mobile devices sometime next year, and there's no mention in the debut trailer of a PC or console version for the game, so it sounds like it'll be the usual free-to-play procedure for this one.</p>

<p>In the new trailer's description, Square Enix describes&nbsp;<em>Duellum&nbsp;</em>as a "3v3 team boss battle arena" game in which you'll be taking part in "exhilarating, action-packed battles" to defeat bosses faster than an opposing team.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dissidia-duellum-final-fantasy-3v3.jpg?itok=fU00VfcX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dissidia-duellum-final-fantasy-3v3.jpg?itok=l6OqV-Rl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dissidia Duellum Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>is a new mobile-oriented fighting game spinoff, and it's coming next year.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Dissidia Duellum Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>will sport modern redesigns of classic&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>characters; Square Enix has already confirmed the likes of the Warrior of Light,&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy IV</em>'s Kain Highwind, and&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy VI</em>'s Terra Branford, among <a href="https://www.square-enix.com/ddff/en/character/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">many others</a>.</p>

<p>The redesigns are intended to slot into a story that takes place in modern Tokyo, wherein warriors known as "Ghosts" appear to do battle with strange monsters born from a crystal. That sounds like a pretty typical&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>plot if you ask me.</p>

<p>With that said, many of these characters' classic looks can also be seen, so perhaps you'll be able to choose from various different costumes. I'd be astounded if Square Enix didn't embed those costume changes in microtransactions or a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/fortnites-battle-passes-how-did-they-take-over-gaming-industry" rel="nofollow">battle pass of some kind</a>.</p>

<p>The new game's <a href="https://www.square-enix.com/ddff/en/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official website</a> promises "simple controls", so you should be able to jump into the action quickly. Gameplay revolves around accumulating Bravery by battling monsters, then unleashing that Bravery to deal big damage to bosses and secure the win.</p>




<p>This isn't the&nbsp;<em>Dissidia&nbsp;</em>franchise's first foray into mobile gaming; it's preceded by the RPG&nbsp;<em>Dissidia Final Fantasy Opera Omnia</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dissidia-final-fantasy-opera-omnia-shutting-down" rel="nofollow">closed its servers for good last year</a>. Let's hope&nbsp;<em>Duellum&nbsp;</em>is a bit luckier.</p>

<p>If you want to get a chance to try out&nbsp;<em>Dissidia Duellum Final Fantasy</em>, then you can sign up for the game's closed Android beta <a href="https://www.square-enix.com/ddff/en/cbt/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a>&nbsp;(as long as you're in the US or Canada). It's due to take place between November 7th and 14th, and recruitment ends on October 28th.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-leak-2025-gen-10-more</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/huge-pokemon-leak-reveals-gen-10-info-new-projects-and-more.1324285/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Another huge&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>leak has revealed new information about what we can expect from the upcoming tenth generation of mainline games, as well as new projects in the works and more.</p>

<p>As spotted by ResetEra user <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-suffers-major-leak-all-upcoming-titles-up-to-2030-leaked.1323781/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Atheerios</a> (as well as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1o5qz6r/gamefreaks_plans_up_to_2030_just_leaked/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">others</a> around the <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1977869125147058256" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">web</a>), this leak, which appears to come from the same source as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-teraleak-online-co-op-battler" rel="nofollow">last year's so-called Teraleak</a>, reveals developer Game Freak's plans for the franchise through the next five years or so.</p>

<p>It goes without saying that this story will contain some spoilers for what's in the leak; we don't intend to reveal everything, but if you don't want to know anything about what's in store for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>, you might want to avert your eyes. I won't be mad, I promise.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-leak-2025-z-a.jpg?itok=W1poDr6i 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-leak-2025-z-a.jpg?itok=jVA-wZ5L 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A huge&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>leak has seemingly revealed what's coming next for the franchise.</figcaption></figure><p>With regards to Gen 10, the leak shows that the setting will be Southeast Asia-inspired, and that you'll not only be exploring a huge open world just like in&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet" rel="nofollow"><em>Scarlet and Violet</em></a>, but delving beneath the waves to explore underwater as well.</p>

<p>Not only that, but the game will supposedly feature a system of procedurally-generated islands you'll be able to wander around as well, in addition to a new graphics engine. The leaks refer to this generation as&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Wind and Wave</em>, although that name is far from official, and it's apparently set for release next year on Switch 2.</p>

<p>According to the leaks, a game known as "Project Seed" is <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1977803554770604239" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">also in development</a>, and it will apparently take the form of a multi-region&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>MMO in which you'll be able to travel seamlessly between the first four regions of the series (Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, and Sinnoh).</p>

<p>That's in addition to a new game in the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends&nbsp;</em>series that will take place in&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/pokemon-sword-and-shield" rel="nofollow"><em>Sword and Shield</em></a>'s Galar region, so if you were hoping for that Unova&nbsp;<em>Legends&nbsp;</em>title, you're out of luck, it seems.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-sword-and-shield-leak-2025.jpg?itok=qr4hYsP2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-sword-and-shield-leak-2025.jpg?itok=v6LiNxl- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Supposedly, a&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends&nbsp;</em>game set in the Galar region is being worked on at Game Freak.</figcaption></figure><p>It is worth noting that a lot of what's been reported in this leak could be inaccurate since it hasn't officially been announced. Not only that, but Nintendo and Game Freak could choose to kill the development of any of the projects that have been leaked, or alter their content significantly.</p>

<h2>This leak also reveals something about&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>budgets</h2>

<p>It's not just new&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games the leak reveals, either. There's also <a href="https://x.com/Stealth40k/status/1977787802646708402" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">some information</a> about the kind of money Game Freak and Nintendo spend on&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games, and if it's accurate, it could be very illuminating indeed.</p>

<p>According to the leaks,&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-release-date-pokemon-presents" rel="nofollow">due to launch on Friday</a>, was made for a budget of around $13 million, while the upcoming tenth-generation games had $20 million allocated to them.</p>




<p>If those figures are to be believed, then we can assume&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet</em>'s budgets weren't astronomically higher than the ones outlined above; if anything, the money spent on the last generation of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games may even have been lower.</p>

<p>That might go some way towards explaining why the games launched in such a messy state technically; $10-$20 million seems like a very low figure indeed for one of the highest-grossing media franchises in the world, even if we factor in extra money spent on the likes of marketing or publishing.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what comes of these leaks. If I know Nintendo, the company will be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-subpoena-request-pokemon-teraleak-identity" rel="nofollow">vicious in pursuing the perpetrator</a>, and much of what's been revealed might be thrown out or altered significantly in response to the leak. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple products can come a little pricier then some of its peers. Though, most users find them worth it for their reliability, ease-of-use, or, in some cases, because you bought an iPhone 4s over a decade ago and now have just gotten too used to the Apple ecosystem to migrate out of it. No shame, I’m describing myself too. Apple stuff is simple, it does what we expect them to too, and it integrates easily with all our other Apple crap. That’s why its always nice to see when some of these iPhones, Macs, or AirPods get hit with a big discount.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4755/">Right now, Amazon has the Apple AirPods Max over-hear headphones on sale for 22% off</a>. Now, 22% may not sound like a lot at first, but that shakes out to a savings of $119. It brings the price down from $549 to just $430 for a limited time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4755/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The Apple AirPods Max are a stylish pair of over-the-ear headphones which are capable of high-fidelity audio thanks to the help of the H1 chip alongside Apple’s dynamic driver. These headphones are able to produce sound that can adjust itself in real-time to follow along with you. It does so by tracking your head position so it feels like you are in the pit at your favorite concert venue. And with support for Dolby Atmos, you’ll be hearing rich and detailed audio for certain songs, movies, or shows.</p>
<h2>Active Noise Cancellation</h2>
<p>Enjoy pro-level active noise cancelling when using the Apple AirPods Max so you can focus on only the sound you want to hear. Turn off the distracting noises coming from your environment, whether that’s a loud roar of a plane turbine or a chatty office of co-workers.</p>



<p>Battery life is reliable. The Apple AirPods Max will grant you with a solid 20 hours of listening time off of a single charge. That should be enough to get your through your flight or day at the office, no problem.</p>
<p>The limited time discount isn’t available with all color options unfortunately. If you were eyeing either the orange or starlight versions of Apple’s premium line of headphones, you’re in luck. Those are the two seeing the full $119 discount. The other color options are all still on sale, just not for as much. You can pick up the black or blue model of the Apple AirPods Max for $49 off at $500 even or the purple version for $20 off at $529.</p>

<p>Rumours about Assassin’s Creed Shadows coming to Switch 2 have been popping up for a long time now. We first saw a PEGI rating for the Switch 2 port surface online, and then, recently, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-switch-2-version-appears/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">listing at a French storefront</a> was revealed with a placeholder image and product description. Now, we have the release date as well for AC Shadows on Switch 2. </p>



<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-shadows-arrives-for-switch-2-this-december">Assassin’s Creed Shadows Arrives for Switch 2 This December </h2>

The game will also receive a physical version, but it will be on a game key card, meaning players will have to download it to their console. </p>



<p>The pre-order date for AC Shadows on Switch 2 hasn’t been confirmed, but according to their data, it should begin by November 7. Lastly, the price for the Switch 2 port has been revealed, and it seems the game can be purchased for around €50, with some retailers offering promotional offers. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Assassin’s Creed Shadows is set in feudal Japan, where players step into the shoes of 2 heroes, Naoe and Yasuke, and experience the story from 2 perspectives. Naoe is a quick-witted shinobi who excels in stealth and shadows. At the same time, Yasuke is a formidable samurai with expertise in strength and steel. </p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows has also already received its Claws of Awaji DLC, which adds 10 hours of content to the game, along with a new weapon, skills, and abilities. Naoe and Yasuke embark on a new adventure to secure an object for Japan’s future. </p>



<p>In other news, Assassin’s Creed Shadows recently received <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-111-update-notes-awaji/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">update 1.1.1</a>, which added a new level, free legacy costumes, and more.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s hard to believe it’s been a year since Pokémon TCG Pocket launched. The mobile-only card-collecting experience has been a great imitation of real-life buying, collecting, and trading, and Pocket is undergoing significant changes as part of its first anniversary.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-devs-plan-to-release-a-major-update-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> is a much cheaper alternative to collecting physical Pokémon cards. It has proven to be another money-making phenomenon, with regular updates adding new sets and features. While the community is still divided over Deluxe Pack ex, more updates are being prepared in the background.</p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-tcg-pocket-updating-trading-amp-wonder-picks">Pokémon TCG Pocket Updating Trading &amp; Wonder Picks</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Coming soon. Image via The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket’s first anniversary is set to bring three major changes and improvements: A new Share feature, an upgrade to Trading, and improved Wonder Picks.</p>



<p>Firstly, the new Share feature allows you to gift one of your friends a card between one and four-Diamond rarity once a day. A quick one-off gift that should allow you to fill any collection gaps much faster.</p>



<p>The second change is the range of tradeable cards you can choose from. Recent booster packs will now be eligible for trading, and you’re no longer restricted to the old-school rarity limits.</p>



<p>The game will allow you to trade the following rarities:</p>



<ul>
<li>One-Diamond</li>



<li>Two-Diamond</li>



<li>Three-Diamond</li>



<li>Four-Diamond</li>



<li>One-Star</li>



<li>Two-Star</li>



<li>One-Shiny</li>



<li>Two-Shiny</li>
</ul>



<p>Finally, the Wonder Pick mechanic is getting a decent overhaul. The only meaningful change since the game’s launch has been the Sneak Peek bonus that appears every now and again—and it doesn’t even activate that often.</p>



<p>According to the official <a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pokémon Pocket</a> channel: “Cards from the latest expansion you have not obtained will appear more often,” and “The number of cards you currently own will be displayed on each card in Wonder Pick.”</p>



<p>The anniversary announcement doesn’t say when any of these features are dropping. We’ll have to wait and see on this.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It’s clear the team is listening to the fanbase. Do you think these changes address key areas of the game? Is there anything else that needs to be tweaked or added? Let us know through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forum</a>.</p>

            <p>A new job listing has been spotted at Bluepoint Games, fuelling speculation over the studio's next project.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.bluepointgames.com/career-board?gh_jid=5600969004">job in question</a> is for a senior combat designer, to "refine engaging combat systems and mechanics" for its "next great title". More specifically, the qualifications require "solid understanding of combat systems and mechanics for third-person melee action experiences".</p>
<p>It's not much to go on, for sure, and there are plenty of third-person action games out there with melee combat.</p>

<p>Still, it's been a while since the studio released a new game and fans are eager to know what it's working on.</p>
<p>The studio is known for its remakes and remasters, with its PS4 remake of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadow-of-the-colossus">Shadow of the Colossus</a> really putting it on the map. This was followed by the PS5 remake of FromSoftware's Demon's Souls for the console's launch in 2020, and a year later the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-buys-demons-souls-remake-developer-bluepoint-games">studio was acquired by Sony to become part of PlayStation Studios</a>.</p><p>Since then? Nothing. Back in 2024, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/demons-souls-developer-bluepoint-games-still-working-on-an-original-title-for-playstation">studio was said to be working on an original title</a>, but earlier this year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">Sony cancelled two live-service games</a>, one of which was from Bluepoint and reportedly based in the God of War series.</p>
<p>As a result, it's unknown what the studio is currently working on, though this job listing is certainly leading to plenty of speculation.</p>
<p>There's long been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/original-god-of-war-trilogy-is-rumoured-to-be-getting-remastered">rumour of a remake of the original God of War trilogy</a>, for instance, and after the cancellation of that live-service game, perhaps Bluepoint is now back on some form of remake.</p>
<p>The other big speculation - though it's more fervent fan desire at this point - is a remake of Bloodborne, FromSoftware's beloved PS4 exclusive that would certainly follow Bluepoint's work on Demon's Souls.</p>
<p>FromSoftware's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-boss-discusses-bloodborne-remake-benefits-of-waiting-for-new-hardware">Hidetaka Miyazaki himself told Eurogamer that remakes and remasters can certainly benefit from new hardware</a>, while admitting Bloodborne is "a title we hold very dear and just as much as our fans".</p>
<p>"I think having new hardware is definitely a part of what gives these remakes value," he said. "Things you weren't able to achieve on previous generations of hardware, ways you weren't able to render specific expressions - [new hardware] sometimes makes it possible.</p><p>"However, I wouldn't say that's the be all and end all," Miyazaki continued. "I think purely from a user perspective, modern hardware also allows more players to appreciate all the games. And so, it ends up being a simple reason, but as a fellow player, I think that accessibility is important. I think that can be the driving force between bringing an old game to a new platform."</p>
<p>Still, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-is-now-fromsoftware-owner-kadokawas-largest-shareholder">Sony became FromSoftware owner Kadokawa's largest shareholder</a> last year (even though that's predominantly to scoop up anime rights more than anything), could the two companies have struck a deal for Bloodborne to return? And if so, is Bluepoint the right studio to make it happen?</p>

            <p>Since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> rolled onto the, er, battlefield late last week, a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-launch-day-patch-notes-are-here-and-nearly-2800-words-so-whip-out-your-reading-specs-private">huge patch having been smashed against its hull</a> to see it off, EA and their Battlefield Studios have understandably only put out a few more tweaks. Their latest little round of changes are server-side rather than being a proper patch, and enact a bit of balancing clearly deemed too important to wait for the next big patch's deployment.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This is the point at which I'm going to ask you to hold the hands of any mates of yours who use sniper rifles, specifically the M2010 ESR and PSR. The muzzle velocity of both long-range skull-deleters has been toned down. For the ESSER, it's gone from 900 to 800 meters a second. For the PISSR, a smaller tweak from 750 to 720 meters a second has been made.</p>
<p>Thus, esserers and pisserers will have to compensate for the slower speed of bullets leaving their barrels by leading shots on moving targets a bit more. If it's any solace, they've opted to use some of the longest guns out there, so odds are they're used to compensating for things.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Today we've rolled out a few backend changes across our servers, which should now be live across all platforms. The changes are as follows:</p><p>◼️Increased ticket count for some maps on the Rush game mode to the intended amount of 100 (up from 75).<br>◼️Reduced the muzzle velocity of…</p></div>— Battlefield Comms (@BattlefieldComm) <a href="https://twitter.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1977809244906037359?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 13, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>Also among the tweaks is one which'll force <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-m87a1-loadout-guide">shotgun</a> projectiles to take drag into account. Odds are that abiding by the laws of physics will amount to a nerf of some level. Maybe a support group which excludes the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-m433-loadout-guide">assault rifle</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-l110-loadout-guide">machine gun</a> lot should be formed.</p><p>Finally, in non-weapon tweak news, Battlefield Studios have increased the ticket count for some rush maps from 75 to 100. So, there'll be more reinforcements on offer if you suddenly find your gun of choice isn't packing enough oomph to save you from regular murder at the hands of faceless strangers who may or may not tastelessly pause to crouch atop your corpse.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, another post-release tweak Battlefield Studios made over the weekend was a <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1977388909471338958">fix for jumping momentum being mucked up</a> when certain weapons were equipped. I assume that being rectified elicited an uninterrupted bounce of joy.</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ninja-gaiden">Ninja Gaiden</a> series of action games are notoriously challenging, but ahead of the release of Ninja Gaiden 4 its directors have emphasised the importance of fairness.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/interviews/ninja-gaiden-4-creators-say-fairness-in-dying-is-what-sets-apart-a-challenging-action-game-from-an-unreasonable-one/">Automaton</a>, directors Yuji Nakao (PlatinumGames) and Masakazu Hirayama (Team Ninja) discussed their approach to balancing the game's difficulty.</p>
<p>"What really stands out throughout the Ninja Gaiden series," said Nakao, "is how enemies are on equal footing with the player. They guard, and they even use throws."</p>

<p>He continued: "We focused not only on making the action feel satisfying, but also on offering the cathartic release of overcoming disadvantageous odds, that was a core part of development."</p>
<p>Hirayama added that fairness between the player and enemies is "crucial", maintained by whether death feels like the player's fault.</p>
<p>"If the player gets killed unreasonably," he said, "it's hard for them to reflect and think about what they could’ve done differently. But if they die because they made the wrong choice among several options, they'll think, 'Okay, let's try this instead'. That kind of trial-and-error cycle requires a fair dynamic between offense and defense to work. That's something we talk about a lot at Team Ninja, and it's something we've always valued throughout the series."</p>
<p>Ultimately, said Nakao, Ninja Gaiden 4 is "not a game you'll be able to breeze through" and has "hardship…scattered throughout". "That sense of catharsis you feel when you overcome those challenges is something I truly value," he said.</p>
<p>Debate around difficulty in games has raged for years, particularly with regards to Soulslike action-RPGs. While action games like the Ninja Gaiden series are known for their difficulty, the Dark Souls games certainly popularised high levels of challenge, especially after the success of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>.</p><p>Most recently, the debate has resurfaced in the wake of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, Team Cherry's long-awaited sequel. For many players, it's proven an incredibly steep challenge, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-devs-admit-it-has-moments-of-steep-difficulty-but-also-a-higher-level-of-freedom-to-avoid-getting-stonewalled">the studio's Ari Gibson noted</a> players "have ways to mitigate the difficulty via exploration, or learning, or even circumventing the challenge entirely, rather than getting stonewalled."</p>
<p>After Ninja Gaiden 4's initial reveal, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-ninja-gaiden-4s-two-protagonists-will-honour-the-series-legacy">Nakao spoke to Eurogamer about honouring the series' legacy</a> with its dual protagonists, as well as its difficulty.</p>
<p>"Ninja Gaiden is known for its intensity, especially that back and forth between offence and defence, and that dynamic ebb and flow of the combat," said Nakao. "With Ninja Gaiden 4, we are making sure it inherits those qualities and that the high speed action and the gameplay feel that longtime players have come to expect from Ninja Gaiden games - including the challenge and the difficulty - are present in this new entry."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at the Tokyo Games Show last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-announced-at-the-xbox-tokyo-game-show-broadcast">Xbox detailed the difficulty options in Ninja Gaiden 4</a> for newcomers and experts alike ahead of its release later this month across Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/sucker-punch-will-stick-making-one-game-at-a-time/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sucker-punch-suggests-it-will-stick-with-making-one-game-at-a-time-after-ghost-of-yotei.1324225/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In a post-mortem Ghost of Yotei interview <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sucker-punch-will-remain-a-single-project-studio-after-ghost-of-yotei-boss-suggests/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with VideoGamesChronicle</a>, Sucker Punch Studio Head and Co-Founder Brian Fleming suggested that the Bellevue-based developer will keep focusing on one game project at a time instead of attempting to juggle more than one.</p>



<p><em>The truth is that whatever we do next, whether it’s continuing Ghost or going back to Sly, the decision is really more limited by, again, our cherishing of focus and time to iterate, which means that we really can only do one thing at a time. If we were good at juggling four projects, yeah, we’d have a remaster, and let’s go do one of those, and one of those, and do some fan request, that would be really popular… But we only get to do one thing.</em></p>



<p><em>So it kind of has to be your best idea, right? And that’s really clarifying. It’s not like there aren’t 15 good ideas. But you only get to do one. And by the way, you only get to do one about every five years. So that choice is really important. </em></p>



<p>Interestingly, Fleming also hinted that Sucker Punch has to deal with internal pressures from employees as well as external pressure from fans when it comes to potentially diversifying its output.</p>



<p><em>At 30 years, we now have employees who are kids of former employees. We have employees who weren’t born when the studio was founded. And you also have had enough changes from Sly, to InFamous, to Ghost that part of those changes, when they happen, is that it means not just you’re walking away from Tsushima, and not just that you’re walking away from the actors in Tsushima, but you’re walking away from employees who’ve been a part of the studio for the last decade, because they don’t want to do a game set in a historical setting.</em></p>



<p>As much as I'd love a new Infamous game, though, the Ghost of franchise has simply gotten too big. Beyond <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-yotei-exploring-the-price-of-vengeance-in-17th-century-ezo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the excellent Ghost of Yotei</a>, which seems to be selling almost as quickly as its predecessor <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-sold-over-1-6-million-units-only-slightly-slower-than-tsushima/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">based on initial estimates</a>, Sucker Punch owner Sony has also invested on a live action film that is being directed by Chad Stahelski and an anime based on the multiplayer mode, Legends. Chances are the developers will be put on Ghost-making duty for at least one more installment.</p>



<p>In related news, we've <a href="https://wccftech.com/discussing-ghost-of-yoteis-lord-saito-with-actor-feodor-chin-he-and-atsu-are-really-two-sides-of-the-same-coin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently published an interview with actor Feodor Chin</a> about his role as the main villain of Ghost of Yotei, Lord Saito.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon Go's new level cap requirements have leaked, and some fans say the fresh XP total required, as well as the some of the extra tasks involved, are too easy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> will raise its current level 50 cap for the first time in five years, and allow players to reach level 80 for the first time. But this change will come alongside an overall rebalancing of XP — meaning many players will find themselves transported to a much higher level, and potentially far beyond the XP needed to instantly hit level 80.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, players won't simply log on and find themselves at the finish line. As is the case currently, a fresh set of additional tasks will need to be completed to progress through the game's final tier of levels (from 70 to 80, replacing similar tasks required to move from 40 to 50). But even these — which have been datamined by fans — have been dubbed as rather straightforward.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Last night, a <a href="https://pokemongo.com/post/pgo-leveling-update-details-2025" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a> on the official Pokémon Go blog listed out the new XP requirements needed after the game's level cap increases tomorrow, October 15.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Pokémon Go rebalanced XP requirements:</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>Level 10: 48,000 total XP</li><li>Level 20: 258,000 total XP</li><li>Level 30: 1,083,000 total XP</li><li>Level 40: 3,953,000 total XP</li><li>Level 50: 12,753,000 total XP</li><li>Level 60: 34,353,000 total XP</li><li>Level 70: 85,853,000 total XP</li><li>Level 80: 203,353,000 total XP</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">It's interesting to compare these fresh totals with the amounts of XP needed to hit the game's level 50 cap now. Currently, hitting level 50 requires a lifetime total of 176 million XP. (This week, following the game's rebalance, level 50 will require just 12.75 million XP.) This means the new level 80 cap requires just 27 million more XP than the current level 50. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While it's been clear for a while that Pokémon Go's new level cap will come alongside an overall smoothing of the game's overall XP requirements, hardcore fans have still been surprised to discover that many of them will once again be in Pokémon Go's new endgame, with little to no actual XP grinding required.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Pokémon Spin-off Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Moving on to those level up tasks, fans examining a <a href="https://x.com/thepokemodgroup/status/1977819506060759314" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">datamined list</a> of what will be needed have judged the requirements as rather straightforward. Each level requires players hold an increasing number of platinum in-game medals, though these can be earned in a way that reflects your playstyle. Some will take time — Purifying 100 Shadow Pokémon — but with planning there's nothing here which should hold up hardcore players for too long.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, there is also palpable relief among fans at the lack of any artificial timegating here — such as requiring a Pokémon be caught on 30 days, holding progress back a month — something which has been found in other challenges previously. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Pokémon Go Level 71-80 level up tasks</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Level 71</strong><br>Earn 15 platinum medals<br>Power up Legendary or Mythical Pokémon 20 times<br>Make 999 Nice Throws<br>Catch 100 Pokémon in a single day

As the game approaches its 10-year anniversary next year, its developers will likely want to ensure Pokémon Go continues to welcome fresh blood to its userbase, without giving them too steep an XP mountain to climb. But some veterans are less impressed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"These are all so easy," wrote Old_Indication_4379 on top Pokémon Go fan <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/1o5tu5q/level_up_requirements_datamined/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a> TheSilphRoad.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'm disappointed beyond disappointment," added another fan, avaible17. "I'm sitting at 352M xp and I doubt that it is very impressive number for most of the old players. I hoped for a challenge and motivation to play, I've got easy and repetitive tasks, that most of them can be done in a day (except walking ofc).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I was hoping for introduction of new type of medals, that would make my grind beyond capabilities of human flesh," they continued. "Now I'm writing this and thinking, that they just make it easier for beginners, not more challenging for old dogs."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/14/unnamed-1-1760437722216.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Pokémon Go's new Daily Adventure Egg and Incubator.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fresh incentives to climbing levels will include permanent boosts to Pokémon, inventory and gift storage, and an improved chance at gaining Lucky Friends status when players are level 70 and above. Finally, and most mysteriously, there's a new 1km Daily Adventure Incubator for players over level 15. Alongside the game's current Daily Adventure Incense item, which rewards players with extra spawns for 15 minutes, this is designed to reward players who walk at least 1km per day. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Exactly which Pokémon the Daily Adventure Incubator will hatch, however, remains unknown — though fans are already speculating that the mechanic will eventually include an ultra-rare Pokémon (Manaphy and Phione seem a good bet!) similar to how the Daily Adventure Incense has a rare chance at spawning a Galar Legendary bird.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overnight, Pokémon Go's development team fixed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-go-pulls-new-weekly-challenge-feature-within-hours-after-completion-bricks-game-fuelling-concern-over-this-weeks-level-80-update">yesterday's major bug which bricked the game for anyone who completed its first Weekly Challenge</a>.

                <p>It's understandable if Xbox users feel a little skittish about the future of the console, given the recent price increases for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-raising-xbox-prices-in-the-us-again/1100-6534892/" data-ref-id="1100-6534892">Xbox consoles in the US</a>, as well as formerly exclusive titles heading to PlayStation 5. Over the holiday weekend, there were so many anecdotal rumors about Target, Walmart, and other US retailers pulling Xbox consoles and games that Microsoft decided it was necessary to debunk these reports.</p><p>"Target and Walmart, among other retailers, remain committed partners for Xbox consoles, accessories, and games," a Microsoft spokesperson told <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/no-target-and-walmart-are-not-removing-xbox-products-from-their-stores-as-xbox-misinformation-reaches-new-levels" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a>. The outlet went on to suggest that the rumors may have been born out of Costco's apparent decision to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/costco-drops-xbox-us-and-uk" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">remove everything Xbox-related</a> from its digital storefront ahead of the price hikes.</p><p>Microsoft has previously fielded rumors that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-has-no-desire-to-make-hardware-anymore-founding-team-member-says/1100-6532825/" data-ref-id="1100-6532825">Xbox is abandoning hardware</a>, as exemplified by Asus handling the release of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-rog-ally-windows-handheld-revealed-releases-holiday-2025/1100-6532245/" data-ref-id="1100-6532245">ROG Xbox Ally handheld devices</a>. However, Xbox VP Jason Ronald told the press that the company remains committed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-gen-xbox-console-aims-to-put-players-first-says-microsoft/1100-6534059/" data-ref-id="1100-6534059">to its next generation hardware</a>.</p><p>The increasing cost of the Xbox consoles comes just as Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-price-hike-announced-now-costs-30-month-for-ultimate/1100-6535138/" data-ref-id="1100-6535138">raised prices on Game Pass</a>. Former Microsoft employee and a founding member of the original Xbox team, Laura Fryer, went on to call those increases <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-co-founder-calls-game-pass-price-hike-a-betrayal/1100-6535337/" data-ref-id="1100-6535337">a "betrayal" of the trust</a> that gamers placed in the company. Microsoft subsequently announced that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-prices-not-going-up-for-everyone-just-yet/1100-6535288/" data-ref-id="1100-6535288">price hikes won't immediately go into effect</a> for all players. But the more expensive version of Game Pass is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-ultimates-price-hike-was-quietly-paired-with-another-downside/1100-6535197/" data-ref-id="1100-6535197">losing a fan-favorite Call of Duty perk</a>.</p><p>Some analysts also believe that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-ad-tier-could-come-next-expert-says/1100-6535154/" data-ref-id="1100-6535154">an ad-supported Game Pass service</a> will be added in the future. But for now, that remains speculation.</p>

            <p>New content updates for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> have been pushed back so developer Arrowhead can prioritise improving performance first.</p>
<p>In a new video, game director Mikael Eriksson acknowledged the current state of the game and the "many things" not working at the moment, which the studio's "top brains" are working to fix.</p>
<p>Issues include the need for smoother framerates across each platform, as well as crash rates and bugs leading to overall jankiness, and balance problems.</p>

<p>"After the last big update, Into the Unjust, we experienced more issues than what we were comfortable with," said Eriksson. "Players felt it, we felt it, and I would say the feedback that we've got has been very justified.</p>
<p>"We're taking this very seriously and we are focusing way more now on addressing these issues to make sure this sort of thing doesn't happen again. We have made the decision to push some of our content and feature updates a little bit into the future while we're addressing these things to make sure that we can get to a much more stable state that we can believe in."</p>
<p>Further, those future updates will be implemented in such a way to make the game more stable.</p>
<p>Some issues are quick to address, such as bug fixes, while others can be "tricky", such as fixing framerates.</p>
<p>"We are already making really big improvements and I'm confident that we will get there and we will be able to talk in more detail about this hopefully quite soon," Eriksson added.</p>
<p>Helldivers 2 has been a phenomenal success that recently made its way to Xbox Series X/S, in addition to PS5 and PC. But as the game has ballooned in size and scope, performance issues have reared their head.</p>
<p>At the least, it's great to see Arrowhead acknowledge these flaws and commit to rectifying them, even if that means delaying future content.</p>
<p>Indeed, it seems to be part of a strategy for improved communication from Arrowhead, following a blog post earlier this month explaining <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-developer-explains-why-its-so-big-to-install-on-pc-and-why-that-wont-be-changing-anytime-soon">why the install size for Helldivers 2 is so big on PC</a>.</p>
<p>In short, it's due to some players using older storage devices instead of SSDs, as the studio aims to accommodate a wide range of setups.</p>

		<p>With nDreams looking to revolutionise VR action games once more with the release of Reach on Thursday this week, and following <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/17/hands-on-reach/">my hands on session with the game</a>, I had a chance to sit down with Glenn Brace, Head of the studio to chat about Reach and find out exactly why those death defying leaps don’t make you want to reach – aha! – for the sick bag.</p>
<p><strong>TSA:</strong> Please introduce yourself and explain how you came to be working on Reach.</p>
<p><strong>Glenn:</strong> My name’s Glenn Brace, and I’m the head of studio for Elevation, and a living, breathing VR evangelist. Long story short, I’ve been in games devs for like 20 years but there’s only so many generations of platforms you can go through with the same IPs, so when VR arrived, that was for me the true next-gen. This is a new frontier, there’s new things. It doesn’t matter if you’re a mega studio or a little studio. The innovation is just there for the sake of it.</p>


<p>More recently, I wanted to get back closer to development, back to what is the best for VR. So nDream Elevation was born. The studio was created to look at the future, work on the sort of tech leading to VR innovation and where VR is going. We are the driving core tech, leading that core tech in the rest of the business. The rest of the business can use that and elevate themselves from that, but we are pushing that. We’re making the new stuff.</p>
<p><iframe title="Reach - Gameplay Trailer | PS VR2 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lOuzzp4V9HQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>When we started the studio for this game, we started with the goal of reinterpreting action adventure for VR. That was the goal. We had a hypothesis, which was that we believe through one-to-one physical action simulation, you will have more immersion and therefore more presence. And more immersion presence means it’s more emotional. The more emotional games, the more memorable, the more fun. So, that was the hypothesis.</p>

<p>We set off and set ourselves a task, “Right, let’s discover one-to-one control and prove to ourselves if it truly is agency granting”. So, we tried different jumps, we tried running, how you fail and fall, what is the believability of you as a character. There’s so many metrics to discover.</p>

<p><strong>TSA:</strong> Give me the Elevator pitch for Reach.</p>
<p><strong>Glenn:</strong> Essentially, it’s action-adventure reimagined for VR. And the root of that is absolute agency-granting, second-to-second role play. What does that mean? That is a translation from the famous genres that we love, such as Tomb Raider. All those games out there that we’ve loved before in the past, but brought into VR, how does that work? We know there will be challenges doing it, but we’re going to fix those challenges and bring the essence of role play to that genre for VR. It’s run, jump, swing, fling. It’s action adventure in the true sense and giving that power to the player.</p>
<p><strong>TSA:</strong> Where did the original idea come from? You mentioned Tomb Raider.</p>
<p><strong>Glenn:</strong> So it’s definitely an influence of what we’re trying to capture, but I think what’s really important about our game is aas a translation of the action adventure genre. So I wouldn’t go into it thinking we’ve made a Tomb Raider – we haven’t – it’s very much what needs to be, different. For starters going first person is in itself a big change. Historically, cinematics have played a large part in that genre, but we don’t want to break the immersion, so even the nature of that format needs to change.</p>

<p><strong>TSA:</strong> I played a good hour and a half and it felt like half the time, and not once did I feel any sort of motion sickness or dizziness despite all the running and jumping, how on earth have you managed that?</p>
<p><strong>Glenn:</strong> So, comfort was a big thing, and we set out to tackle that. One of the key factors of that was ‘FBA’, full body awareness, one of the key components. It’s not just to render the body and see it in game, although that’s cool, it’s that we have more than the tracking points. We simulate the wrist, the arm angle, we simulate the elbows, we simulate the body, the hips, the shoulders, the neck. When we have all that information, it makes things like mantling so much smoother and more reliable. That allows flow, it allows proper parkour, player-driven you’re-in-control flow.</p>
<p>That extends into jumping as well. If you get a motion that you’re not in control of it can send you over the edge. So for jumping, you actually move your arms as if you are about to take leap in real life to start the jump in-game, and this fools your body in to thinking your are actually doing it.</p>
<p>Another natural thing is when you jump over an edge, you look where you land, you look down, and you can tune the arc of the land specifically on that tight pillar. It feels natural; you do it in a very natural way. So, again, it’s more comfortable. Suddenly, we’ve got a level of parkour and jumping platforming that is super cool.</p>
<p>We also simulate body mass and weight, and that comes back to how you play traditional platforming. Once you familiarize yourself with your body mass and weight, how you use it, you can become skilful in platforming, and therefore in control. When you put those things together, the realization of it, the sense of weight, the sense of mass, the physics of it, the aftertouch, you’ve got a new experience in VR.</p>
<p>One of the goals I always wanted, and I always say this, was to make someone role-playing act in the interest of self-preservation. Faced with a giant leap, will you stop and think, “I’m not going to jump on that. No way. I’m going to do this”? In a standard game you’d do it anyway, you will die, start again, do it, die, start again. We wanted the players to be in the moment and think, making them prioritise their sense of survival in that world.</p>

<p><strong>TSA:</strong> So, given that every action adventure game these days gets a TV show or film, who would direct the Reach movie?</p>
<p><strong>Glenn:</strong> Well, I can tell you, not Michael Bay! We started Reach with the idea that it’s going to be action-packed, but the reality is the emotions and the moments, they’re a lot smaller, a lot more contained. So, I think it’s a more intimate experience now than when we first set out. So, I need to find a director that’s kind of in touch with the emotional side. Who did the Star Wars film everyone really liked?</p>
<p><strong>TSA:</strong> Rogue One? Gareth Edwards.</p>
<p><strong>Glenn:</strong> Yeah, I’ll go with Gareth Edwards. He did also Monsters which could have been a big loud film but it was actually quiet and poignant. So, yeah, I would go with Gareth Edwards.</p>
<p><em>Thanks to Glenn for speaking to us about this fascinating project.

<p>There's even a new ? silicone case</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Remember Nintendo's collaboration with Fujifilm? The one that let you add all kinds of Switch-relevant frames and stickers to your screenshotted polaroids* via the instax mini Link 3? Don't worry, we had forgotten about it too, but the company has just released a new update to help add an extra bit of Mushroom Kingdom flare to your physical snaps.</p>
<p>The main addition in this update is the instax AiR Studio. As the capitalisation on the former suggests, this new 'studio' lets you take photos with some Mario AR effects to boot — so, if you need a pic of your friend hitting a ? Block, holding a Red Shell, or popping out of a Warp Pipe, you're in luck!</p>
<p>Similarly self-explanatory is the new Click to Collage feature, which takes snaps at three-second intervals and lets you throw in some familiar Mario faces for good measure. With the collection snapped up, you can then print out the full series, photobooth style.</p>
<p>Of course, it wouldn't be a Mario update without some fresh merch to boot, and Fujifilm revealed that a new limited edition instax mini Link 3 bundle featuring a sweet ? Block silicone case will be launching later this month for <strong>$149.95</strong>.</p>

<p>Fujifilm launched a similar bundle for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon 3</a> update back in 2023, where the arrival of new in-app stickers and frames was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/01/ink-your-polaroids-with-splatoon-3-frames-and-stickers-in-new-instax-mini-link-app-update">accompanied by a squid-shaped case</a>.</p>
<p>The advantage this time around is that we have the Switch 2 to make <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-how-to-transfer-screenshots-from-switch-2-to-smartphone-pc-or-mac">transferring images from your console to mobile</a> <em>much</em> easier. The instax mini Link 3 works with both Switch 1 <em>and</em> 2, we should add, but if you want to get snaps of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> like the cool kids in the above trailer, you'll obviously need the latest hardware.</p>
<p>*Okay yes, they're <em>technically</em> 'mini prints' since Polaroid isn't directly involved here. Sorry, everyone!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The additional content of the War of the Lions release may at very least have been considered for Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles at some point, judging from some recent findings.</p>



<p>Using a Cheat Engine table to alter in-game values, YouTube user <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GusPagan">Gus Pagan</a> discovered that the remaster of the classic tactical role-playing game released last month on PC and consoles features hidden in its files evidence that the War of the Lions content, or at least part of it, may have been considered. This includes the Dark Knight and Onion Knight Jobs and the extra characters Balthier and Luso.</p>



<p>As the implementation of these extra Jobs and characters is clearly incomplete, however, they could simply be leftover data that was carried over from the War of the Lions version code. Still, this could definitely bode well even if the extra content isn't officially released for the remaster, as modders could use this data to port the content themselves, <a href="https://ffhacktics.com/smf/index.php?topic=12951.0">something that has already happened for the original PSX version of the game.</a></p>

</p></figure>



<p>While having the exclusive War of the Lions content would make Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles the true definitive edition of the tactical role-playing game, in no way does the remaster need it to be an excellent game. Check out my review to learn <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-classic-strategy-modern-upgrades/">how choice improvements like voice acting and a tweaked user interface enhance an already excellent game.</a> </p>

            <p>Sometimes the simple life is the one I crave when I fire up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a>. Go away, warring rulers, meddling mages, and otherworldly elven harbingers of the apocalypse, let me concentrate on being medieval pest control. A <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-pc-mods-the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">modder</a>'s seemingly heard my protestations, having just released a standalone monster hunting mode for the game, which comes with an optional extraction shootery twist if you fancy an extra challenge.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This modded mode's dubbed <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/9426?tab=description">Wild Monster Hunt</a>, and is the work of REDkit-armed developer Aeltoth. Drawing inspiration from the hunting grounds of Capcom's monster hunting series, the mode whisks you off to a new region that's "roughly the size" of Toussaint from the base game's Blood and Wine DLC. Here, you find a witcher camp that'll serve as an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkMG_igY3QY">upgradeable base</a> to rest at between the procedurally-generated monster hunts which populate the area.</p>
<p>As Aeltoth outlines in this <a href="https://modspot.dev/library/8qreyt51iq5d3hnubq5s/u8dtqlnmizrkg2suldq6">intro doc</a>, starting from the camp, you can take on up to five regular contracts on monsters ranging from Wraiths to Wights at once. After gearing up and exiting the camp, you're off into the hostile wilds, with the goal of taking down as many beasts as you can or fancy via sword or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0oPCJ1BL2c">trap</a> before returning home to collect rewards and prepare to head out again. Every departure sees the landscape refreshed, down to any loot or herbs you've picked up.</p>

<p>Finding your targets won't always be a walk in the park, with factors like the time, weather, and different biome requirements for monsters influencing when and how you can encounter them. Aeltoth's worked in a levelling system for the hunts dubbed reputatation, which'll see you dished out more important milestone contracts every so often. These are tougher, but are the only way of progressing up the mod's totem pole and earning gear diagrams.</p><p>If that's not enough challenge for you, the modder's created a "Merciless Path" option, which "turns the mod into a sort of extraction game where gear is lost upon dying. The mod adjusts the rewards when this mod is enabled for somewhat faster progression."</p>
<p>Regardless of which you pick, these monster hunts are an alternative way of earning crowns and experience you'll then be able to take back into the base game, though it does look like some of the witcher camp's various vendors and special forge are designed to act as a semi-closed economy. I assume this is to ensure you do earn the mod's bounties by taking on its hunts. It might get old fast if the story-free hunts aren't varied enough, but as a pocket dimension for those who just want to test their fighting skills, it sounds ideal. The modder also has plans to expand it with the likes of new dungeons, regions, and mechanics like a spot of on-the-go distilling in the future.</p>
<p>Wild Monster Hunt requires you to start a new playthrough upon installing, and you can either hop directly into it from the main menu or warp into the region anytime via a signpost in White Orchard. That said, the former option does look to be causing crashes early doors, so the sign might be the better option. Installing looks as simple as dropping the files into your game directory.</p>

              <p>No one likes to deal with low storage, and sometimes even a terabyte or two just isn’t enough to keep up with everything you need to save. If you’re after a long-term fix and your storage needs have outgrown the usual upgrade options, the Seagate Expansion 14TB external hard drive might be just what you need.</p>
<p>It usually runs you around $300, but right now, you can grab it for $230 on Amazon, after a 16% discount from its regular price. This is the lowest price we have seen it go for in a while, but the offer is going to end soon. Get your orders in before the price shoots back up!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4757/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Massive Storage for All Your Old and New Files</h2>
<p>14 terabytes is no joke. That’s enough capacity to house hundreds of movies, a million photos, and numerous work documents for years to come. If your storage needs are consistently growing (as everyone else’s) and you don’t want to find yourself in the same situation every few months, this is a nice long-term solution. Think having your entire digital library – both old and new stuff – in one portable build that goes wherever you do.</p>
<p>Getting started is simple. Plug in the adapter it comes with, connect the USB 3.0 cable, and it’s ready to go. File transfers are quick as well. Grab all that you need to transfer, drag it over it, and drop. It works well with both Windows and Mac, but Mac users will need to reformat it for use with Time Machine. There are no complicated drivers or setup procedures to worry about. It literally takes a few minutes to get everything going, even if it’s your first time with an external drive.</p>



<p>You’re also getting Rescue Data Recovery Services with the purchase. In case of water damage or a natural disaster, Seagate’s team can help recover your important files in no time. Included in the box are a Seagate Expansion desktop drive, an 18-inch USB 3.0 cable, an 18W power adapter, and a quick start guide.</p>
<p>All in all, if you’re looking for a storage solution that can take care of all your old and new data, this 14TB SSD will be a great addition to your work setup. The storage capacity is massive, so you won’t have to worry about running out of space again for years to come. The offer ends soon, so be sure to act fast to grab it for less.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A popular way to get better items and abilities in Demonfall quickly is to make use of the many October 2025 Demonfall codes. This makes Demonfall codes extremely popular among newer players of the game, as it allows them to bridge the gap between themselves and the competition fairly fast.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Are you a fan of the popular anime series Demon Slayer? If yes, we suggest that you take a couple of minutes to check out this riveting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-roblox-type-soul-codes-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> game—Demonfall. Inspired almost entirely by Demon Slayer, Demonfall drops players into the role of a demon hunter, responsible for fighting against various characters in the game. This then helps players progress through the game’s story, while also helping improve their own abilities—and you can progress faster with Demonfall monthly codes and rewards.</p>

<p>Redeeming Demonfall codes is a straightforward process and doesn’t require any specific criteria to be met before the code redemption feature gets unlocked. It’s as simple as navigating through the menus and finding the codes section. For players who may be unfamiliar with the Roblox ecosystem, here’s a simple step-by-step guide to redeeming Demonfall codes:</p>



<ol>
<li>Launch Roblox and open up Demonfall</li>



<li>Click on the Tab button to open up the menu</li>



<li>Click on the Cog (Settings) button</li>



<li>Input one of the active codes given above into the text box</li>



<li>Hit the ‘Enter’ key to receive your rewards</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-more-demonfall-codes">How To Get More Demonfall Codes</h2>



<p>Although there is currently only one working code in the game, players are urged to wait patiently, as new Demonfall codes are surely on the horizon. Considering the popularity that Demonfall has gained since its release, the developers are almost certainly working on new content for the game, and new content updates usually mean new codes.</p>



<p>Although there’s no set timeline for code drops, they usually come out along with updates, so players would be smart to keep their eyes peeled. While tracking the game’s socials and <a href="https://discord.com/invite/eAUgs3PvD9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official Discord server</a> for new codes is an option, a simpler and more hassle-free way to stay ahead of the curve would be to simply bookmark this page. We update this article as soon as any new codes drop, so checking in every now and then would be the best course of action.</p>

            <p><a href="https://x.com/subonekd/status/1977237126850003005">As spotted by members of the Battlefield 6 community online</a>, reports from users of the Cronus Zen getting temporary bans for using the cheating hardware are circulating online, but the full scope of how effective the game is at banning users of this hardware remains unclear.</p>
<p>For those unaware, the Cronus Zen (and prior Cronus products) allow for the use of scripts and macros in games it's used with, and is usable on consoles including the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. These macros can be harmless in single player games, sure (back when I was younger people used it as an arcade stick adapter for the Xbox 360, which was cool). However, in multiplayer games the device has become infamous due to the ability to enable additional aim assist, recoil reduction, automatic drop-shotting, and more. <a href="https://www.cronusmax.com/">All of these specific macros and more are listed outright on the Cronus Zen website</a>.</p>

<p>However, players are questioning the validity of these temporary bans <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1o64hvu/cronus_zen_users_on_ps5_are_now_receiving/">due to an odd screenshot circulating online</a>. Initially, the screenshot seems real enough, but closer inspection reveals suspect details. For example, in the bottom right corner of the screenshot, the A and B buttons (which you'd expect from a console ban page) look incorrect, with the A looking more like an H. Very odd.</p><p>Heading to the Cronus Zen Discord, discussions are kept largely from public channels and hidden inside those only registered Cronus Zen users can access, but even there brief discussions about bans can be found. It looks as though the impact of these bans are in doubt, with Cronus users stating as long as you don't overuse these macros so as to be easily spotted by other players and cheat detection software, users won't be banned.</p>
<p>The flip side of the coin is prior statements made by EA, which mention Cronus specifically. <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/features/interview-we-dont-consider-this-a-port-battlefield-6-dev-on-why-it-built-the-ps5-version-concurrently-with-pc">In an interview with Push Square</a>, technical director on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> Christian Buhl stated: "Yeah, it's unfortunate that cheating has become a problem within the console space, especially with Cronus Zen machines and everything. So we've partnered with PlayStation and both Microsoft in this regard to kind of do detection. We actually have our own level of macro detection and everything.</p>
<p>"So if players are doing rapid with Javelin on the PC side. That's why we've enabled Secure Boot to help us combat the never-ending cheater problem. And we are aware of the console cheater issue, and we're going to be taking cheating very, very seriously here."</p>
<p>We know that EA intends to strike at Cronus users in Battlefield 6, but without a public statement from either EA / Battlefield Studios or Cronus itself, it's hard to  ascertain the scale of the impact on Cronus users. Cronus users have likely been put on notice though,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-players-on-ps5-and-xbox-can-block-pc-users-from-crossplay-as-studio-takes-cheating-extremely-seriously"> as the war on cheaters rages on</a>.</p>

But now, it seems, the floodgates are open for everything else obtained from Game Freak detailing the franchise's future — and its product roadmap for the rest of the decade.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The largest cache of information relates to the franchise's highly-anticipated "Gen 10" games that are expected to launch next year, in time for Pokémon's 30th anniversary. Details now being shared online include the titles' planned name, early animation tests, in-engine footage and word of several planned gameplay ideas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond this, there's information relating to a separate, ambitious-sounding Pokémon MMO project, as well as concept art for a third Pokémon Legends spin-off title. And beyond that, there's the suggestion that Pokémon's Gen 11 will follow at the start of the next decade. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a frankly astonishing leak of information, seemingly from the same source which yesterday revealed details derived from beta builds of Pokémon Legends: Z-A, and last year leaked a vast treasure trove of development data on pretty much every previous Pokémon project launched to date.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Pokémon Spin-off Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon fans are already poring over the purported plans and discussing several eye-opening gameplay mechanics. There's even early fan art for a new Pokémon species spotted in one of the new pieces of conceprt art. But it's worth pointing out that some or indeed much of what has been shared may not ultimately come to pass. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As yesterday's Pokémon Legends: Z-A beta build leak showed, gameplay features get cut in development. And nothing in the Teraleak can be relied upon as reflecting Game Freak's current plans — as the hack itself took place back in August 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo previously attempted to track down the culprit behind the Teraleak, and launched a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-requests-subpoena-of-discord-to-track-down-user-behind-last-years-pokemon-teraleak">legal bid to subpoena Discord</a> to divulge the hackers' identity back in April this year.

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Pokémon developer Game Freak has suffered another huge leak of data, revealing the studio's purported planned projects until 2030.</p>
<p>The leak comes a year to the day after a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-developer-game-freak-reels-from-unprecedented-gigaleak-of-significant-internal-data">"teraleak" of "significant internal data" that revealed unannounced Pokémon games</a>. Game Freak later acknowledged it was hacked, admitting personal employee information had been obtained. Then, in April this year, Nintendo filed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-lawyers-want-to-force-discord-to-reveal-pokemon-teraleak-source">request to subpoena Discord</a> for the hacker's identity.</p>
<p>This new leak, revealing alleged future projects and concept art from new and old games alike, arrives mere days before the release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, amid suggestions the same hacker was holding back this information.</p>

<p>The budget for Pokémon Legends: Z-A was reportedly just 2bn yen (around $13m). Typically, Japanese game development budgets are smaller than those we see in the West (for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to lower staff salaries), but this still feels like a very small amount for what is considered one of Nintendo's most significant series. What's more, as recent Pokémon games on Switch have suffered from poor performance, there's concern among the fanbase of a lack of investment to ensure future games run more smoothly.</p><p>Across the internet, there's notable commentary on this aspect of the leak, specifically. The <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1o5wqxi/massive_pokemon_leak_purportedly_covers_nextgen/njcd9ef/">top comment</a> on a reddit thread discussing the leaks simply jokes that the whole leak is "just a Post-It note that says, 'even lower budget for next game'." <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1o5wqxi/massive_pokemon_leak_purportedly_covers_nextgen/njcg4mv/">Another comment</a> reflects: "A lot of people are going to complain about the money budget and not enough people will complain about the time budget of these games." Another poster notes: "The only leak I would care about is that they suddenly get a better engine, and actually treat Pokemon as a modern game with a high budget."</p>
<p>Within the leak itself, details have been shared purportedly covering the next four games planned until 2030.</p>
<p><strong>Spoiler warning!</strong></p>
<p>The first of these is the next mainline game, the tenth generation, which reportedly has the codename Gaia and will be known as Pokémon Wind and Waves. It's seemingly set for release next year, followed by DLC in 2027, and will be set in Southeast Asia. Leaked screenshots of concept art show open, jungle areas, while budget-wise it's reportedly costing 3bn yen - another surprisingly small budget, but hitting roughly $20m, this time, a marked bump over Z-A's $13m (probably thanks to a series of planned improvements, such as a new engine, which commenters hope will improve performance on console hardware).</p>
<p>This will reportedly be followed by another Legends game, to be set in the Galar region of Sword and Shield - with the fitting codename of Ringo.</p>
<p>Then there's project Seed, which will reportedly combine multiple regions from past games. Lastly, the eleventh generation is reportedly aiming for a 2030 release.</p>
<p>Of course, it's worth questioning the validity of this information. Even if the reported details are true, the documents could well be outdated and plans may have changed since. There's also plenty of fan speculation wrapped up around the details.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted The Pokémon Company and Nintendo for comment on the validity of the leaks.</p>
<p>The news <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/psa-pokemon-legends-z-a-spoilers-are-out-in-the-wild-ahead-of-its-release-this-week">follows leaks of Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> ahead of its release this Thursday, 16th October. Copies of the game are already out in the wild, are being streamed on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>, and illegal ROMs are already available, meaning spoilers are abundant.</p>

There doesn't seem to be any major tweaks to the gameplay or difficulty with this one, so we're mainly looking at bugs and whatnot that have been kindly stamped out.</p><div><figure data-videoid="8PPa7JzGiQE" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8PPa7JzGiQE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8PPa7JzGiQE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8PPa7JzGiQE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed61a957gkisxw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>
