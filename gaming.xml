			<p>It’s taken Killing Floor sixteen years to reach its third mainline entry, and with Killing Floor 2 now nearly a decade old, hopes and expectations for this long-awaited sequel were understandably high. Personally, I only dipped into the second game briefly—thanks, PS Plus—but I know <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/08/killing-floor-3-delayed-until-later-in-2025-just-weeks-before-launch/">fans weren’t exactly thrilled</a> after February’s closed beta with Tripwire Interactive pushing back release to address some of their complaints. So, what exactly have they delivered after all this time?</p>
<p><iframe title="Killing Floor 3 - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YUiT0fAExKU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Let’s start with the plot, or rather, the lack of one. There’s no introduction, no cinematic, not even a text crawl to set the scene of the techno zombie apocalypse you’re facing. You’re simply dropped into a home base for a quick tutorial, and then it’s straight into the action. The core gameplay loop remains unchanged: pick from one of six character classes—Commando, Sharpshooter, Firebug, Medic, Engineer, and a stereotypical Japanese ninja—and then fight through five waves of increasingly aggressive “Zeds” on one of eight maps, culminating in a boss battle.</p>


<p>Between waves, there’s a short break—maybe the Zeds are having a KitKat?—and during this time you can spend any dosh you’ve earned on new guns, ammo, and supplies. As you progress, you’ll automatically collect items like brain matter and eyeballs, which can be used to modify weapons. Don’t think too hard about it, but somehow an eyeball gives you a better magazine, and brain matter improves your gun grip. It is complete nonsense.</p>
<p data-start="1840" data-end="2131">Zed Time, the signature slow-motion combat mechanic, is still here, triggered when your team racks up enough kills. It’s a double-edged sword: it looks great and lets you line up stylish shots, but if it activates while you’re reloading, you’ll burn half the slo-mo watching your character load a new magazine rather than do anything useful. The game attempts to inject a bit of narrative by issuing mid-battle objectives (“Go here,” “Find this”), but it’s largely lost in the chaos of combat.</p>


<p>The maps are all slight variations on the same theme of futuristic apocalyptic ruin, but they are all structured differently. There’s Convoy with its long tunnels and turret placements, and another leans into verticality, but while layouts differ, the visual design is samey, somewhat drab. Environmental destruction is minimal: coffee mugs shrug off shotgun blasts like they a cool summer breeze, though you’ll get to destroy the odd security camera.</p>
<p>And… that’s about it. There’s eight maps to run about and shoot enemies over fives waves and then one of three final bosses, you’ll slowly grind through upgrades to weapons and skills, and repeat.</p>
<p>You can play Killing Floor 3 solo or with up to six players. I tried solo first, and it was about as fun as being repeatedly slapped with a frozen haddock. The game simply isn’t designed for lone wolves. Maps lack safe zones, and enemies attack from every angle. With no one to watch your back, it quickly devolves into frustration. Multiplayer, however, is where the game shines.</p>

<p data-start="3211" data-end="3723">Teaming up with a mix of classes transforms the experience. You don’t even need voice chat as the matchmaking usually ensures a balanced squad. With just a mildly competent team, the Normal difficulty becomes a joyful romp of bullets, blood, and teamwork. The gunplay is excellent, with satisfying heft to larger weapons, and the visual feedback is spot-on; headshots trigger geysers of gore, leg shots trip enemies, and dismemberment remains as gloriously grisly as ever. Zeds move fast, vaulting over obstacles and swarming with intent, but the pacing is tuned just right—you feel under pressure without being overwhelmed.</p>
<p data-start="3211" data-end="3723">After a few sessions, you’ll have gathered enough crafting components to start customising weapons. This adds a new layer of gameplay which allows you to work on your play style. I went with a freezing grenade launcher which let me immobilise the enemy so my team mates could smash the frozen Zeds at their leisure. Fully upgrading a weapon can actually make it more effective than some shop options, so the grind actually feels worthwhile.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Killing Floor 3 is riddled with strange interface decisions. On the Skills screen, you’re prompted to press Square to upgrade, but that only takes you to another menu where you then press X to actually do it. The Supply Pass is also awkward to navigate and you can scroll the focus off the screen and lose it, and while some items are labelled “Free,” they still require a token to unlock. It’s very confusing,</p>

<p>Priced between £25 and £35 depending on your platform, Killing Floor 3 is half the cost of a typical AAA release, and that price point sets expectations and allowances. There are no flashy CGI cutscenes, no celebrity voice cast, and some glaringly rough parts: enemies vanish mid-death and bosses clip through walls so they can barrel down corridors that are clearly to small for them. Sure, they have added new elements such as mantling, but it is 2025 and this is running on PS5. Enemies should not just vanish before your eyes like a PS2 game. Even the map names are telling. One is literally just called Office. That’s it.<em> Office</em>. It’s perfunctory and basic, and that sums up Killing Floor 3.</p>

Sure, it's more of an addendum to 2024's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_party_jamboree">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a>, but we consider the original the best entry in the entire series, and Jamboree TV only adds cherries on top of that cake.</p>
<p>PJ gave the updated game a sparkling 9/10 <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">in his review</a> last week. In fact, the silly title is pretty much the only thing we're not quite on board with. We would have loved to hear the folks on the old Nintendo Power podcast saying "<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV</a>" <em>every single time</em> it's mentioned. Rumours that the unwieldy NS2 Edition names are the reason they stopped the 'cast are entirely spurious. Probably.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, it's sitting on a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2/critic-reviews/">"Generally Favorable" Metascore of 78</a>, so not everybody enjoyed it <em>quite</em> as much as PJ - and we're keen to hear what you think.</p>
<p>If you haven't gotten around to it just yet (hey, we get it, it's been a busy — and <em>expensive</em> — couple of months!), no sweat. Remember, you can come back at any time and score the game from 1-10 as you see fit, either here on Jamboree TV's game page, and it'll count towards the poll.</p>
<p>If you've already rated the game in our database, you're a <em>particularly</em> lovely person and we salute you. If not, we still think you're lovely - feel free to drop your mark below. You know, if you like.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-announces-gamescom-2025-lineup-including-a-playable-demo-of-hollow-knight-silksong-hands-on-with-rog-xbox-ally-and-more.1255014/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Xbox has debuted its Gamescom 2025 lineup, which includes more than 20 games featured across what will be two days of broadcasts, and for those in attendance at the show, the first opportunity to go hands-on with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-prices-leaked/">ROG Xbox Ally/ROG Xbox Ally X</a>, and Hollow Knight Silksong, which will be at the show with a playable demo.</p>



<p>It's the first major chance players have had to try out Hollow Knight Silksong, which is due to release sometime this year after having been announced in 2019. Developer Team Cherry isn't exactly a giant outfit, so it has <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-delayed-as-development-is-still-continuing/">taken the studio some time</a> to get the game ready to release. Even now, at the time of this writing, it is without a release date, though it looks like it should be ready to go this year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/you-can-play-hollow-knight-silksong-in-september-2025-at-a-museum-in-australia-that-is/">since a playable build of it will also be stored in an Australian museum this coming September</a>.</p>



<p>Xbox will also have games from its first-party studios featured at its booth, including a demo of the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-the-order-of-giants-dlc-announced-launches-in-september-2025/">Order of Giants DLC</a> for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle that's coming on September 4, 2025. Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 will also have a demo for its new city update, and Grounded 2 will also have hands-on demos on the show floor. Though in the case of Grounded 2, Xbox Game Pass subscribers can just <a href="https://wccftech.com/grounded-2-wuchang-fallen-feathers-robocop-xbox-game-pass/">check it out at home as of tomorrow</a>, if you're not making the trip to Cologne.</p>



<p>There will be two days of Xbox broadcasts, the first on Wednesday, August 20, starting at 6am PT / 9am ET / 2pm BST / 3pm CEST, with the ROG Xbox Ally and Ally X handhelds, Grounded 2, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, and others being the highlight for the day's broadcast. Then on Thursday, August 21, beginning at the same time as the day before, Xbox will showcase Ninja Gaiden 4, Overwatch 2, and The Outer Worlds 2. </p>



<p>Here's the full list of games Xbox will have featured at Gamescom 2025 in its booth and during its broadcasts, per<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/28/xbox-gamescom-2025/"> Xbox Wire</a>:</p>



<ul>
<li>Grounded 2</li>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hollow-knight-silksong-gamescom-demo-coming-as-release-window-looms.1255011/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Xbox has revealed its plans for this August's Gamescom show, and among them is a playable demo of&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>, although unfortunately, the demo is only for show attendees.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/28/xbox-gamescom-2025/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement post</a> on Xbox Wire, Xbox reveals it will be giving Gamescom ticket holders a chance to check out <i>Silksong</i>&nbsp;on either PC or the new ROG Xbox Ally X handheld, which was revealed during <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">this summer's Xbox showcase</a>.</p>

<p><em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>isn't the only game attendees will be able to play, either; they'll also be able to check out upcoming games like&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em>,&nbsp;<em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em>, among others.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hollow-knight-silksong-gamescom-demo-hornet.jpg?itok=F4A3aIM1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hollow-knight-silksong-gamescom-demo-hornet.jpg?itok=YgPj0Snu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>will be playable at this year's Gamescom event.</figcaption></figure><p>Xbox is also promising a new "theater presentation" for its upcoming RPG&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>, which, it turns out, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-outer-worlds-2-70-dollars-xbox" rel="nofollow">won't cost $80 as previously announced</a>, but a far more sensible $70. That's alongside "a couple more surprises at the show".</p>

<p>If you're somehow not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>, it's the long-awaited followup to Team Cherry's acclaimed 2017 Metroidvania&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight</em>. This sequel will focus on Hornet, a character who featured prominently in the original game, as she explores a brand new kingdom.</p>

<p><em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>has become something of a meme in the gaming community; it was announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-is-hollow-knight-sequel-youve-been-waiting-for" rel="nofollow">all the way back in 2019</a>, and since then, Team Cherry has been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-still-tba" rel="nofollow">evasive</a> regarding the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-delayed" rel="nofollow">release date</a>, as well as further details about its story or specifics for its gameplay.</p>

<p>However, during the aforementioned Xbox summer showcase this year, Team Cherry's Matt Griffin confirmed that&nbsp;<em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>was due to release sometime before Christmas this year. Hooray!</p>




<p>If&nbsp;<em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>doesn't get a release date in the next couple of weeks, I'll be very surprised indeed. Far more pertinent is the question of whether Team Cherry's next game will have been worth the six-year wait. We'll have to wait (a little longer) and see, I suppose.</p>

                <p>After several years of development, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/god-of-war/">God of War</a> TV series at Amazon is starting to gain momentum. This live-action adaptation of the iconic PlayStation IP won't be a remake of the games, but like other projects based on popular video game IP, you can expect it to cherry-pick the best elements from its source material and remix them into a new adventure.</p><p>At San Diego Comic-Con, series showrunner Ronald D. Moore spoke about how Sony Santa Monica's 2018 God of War game is serving as the primary inspiration for the series. "This world and this universe are really rich, and it's interesting, and it's really been fun to adapt," Moore said to <a href="https://collider.com/god-of-war-series-adaptation-prime-video-update-ron-moore/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Collider</a>. "It's an adaptation, so it's an adaptation-slash-interpretation as you go into live-action, and it's been really fun to sort of go, 'Wow, there's a lot here we can play with. Okay, we want to keep the story. We want to keep the characters and the spirit of it'. There's all this stuff that you can keep turning to for inspiration."</p>

<p>Moore added that God of War game director Cory Barlog is also actively involved with the series, and he referred to the developer as having an impressive and encyclopedic knowledge for all things God of War-related. "I usually pride myself about, as a showrunner, I can hold the season in my head," Moore said. "I know what the 10 episodes are, and I can tell you about them. Cory can tell you the whole thing in every possible way--all the mythology, how it connects one to the other, what the puzzles were, why they did this, and what that artifact did. It's really impressive."</p><p>God of War is just one of several video game adaptations under development at Amazon, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/god-of-war-tv-show-already-has-two-seasons-in-the-works-apparently/1100-6530165/" data-ref-id="1100-6530165">and it could run for two seasons</a>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-season-2-has-officially-wrapped-production/1100-6531410/" data-ref-id="1100-6531410">A second season of Fallout</a> is on the way and it was recently announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wolfenstein-tv-series-in-the-works-from-same-company-behind-fallout-show/1100-6533457/" data-ref-id="1100-6533457">Wolfenstein is also in the early stages</a> of being adapted for TV. On top of that, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-fallout-tv-show-writers-room-board-the-andromeda-for-mass-effect-show/1100-6533296/" data-ref-id="1100-6533296">Mass Effect</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazons-warhammer-series-with-henry-cavill-could-finally-be-entering-development/1100-6528340/" data-ref-id="1100-6528340">Warhammer 40K TV series</a> are also in the works. As for God of War, the last game in the series was 2022's God of War Ragnarök, which brought the story of Kratos to a satisfying end.</p><p>Sony Santa Monica is currently working <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/god-of-war-studios-next-game-reportedly-going-well-may-not-be-a-sci-fi-new-ip/1100-6533167/" data-ref-id="1100-6533167">on its next big project</a>, and similar to 2018's God of War, it sounds like the studio might be busy putting a fresh spin on a familiar IP.</p>

                <p>No, there's still no proper release date in sight for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong/" data-ref-id="5000-493311">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, but European players will soon get the opportunity to find out for themselves if the elusive Metroidvania is actually real or not. Xbox has <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/28/xbox-gamescom-2025/" rel="nofollow ">released its lineup</a> for games it will be showing off during this year's Gamescom, held between August 20-24, where it shared that attendees will be able to try out the upcoming ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X. While the handhelds will include games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/roblox/" data-ref-id="5005-152">Roblox</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sea-of-thieves/" data-ref-id="5000-438508">Sea of Thieves</a> to try out, a demo for Hollow Knight: Silksong is the big one here that will likely draw in some big queues.</p><p dir="ltr">There's no more details about the demo outside of that, but if you do get to try it out, don't expect a particularly long one given how busy the event can be. Notably, it's also the first time it will be playable publicly since 2019. Silksong is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-will-be-playable-in-september-at-this-one-location/1100-6531268/" data-ref-id="1100-6531268">also slated to be playable</a> at Australia's National Museum of Screen Culture in September.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Glen Schofield - known for Dead Space and more recently as founder of Striking Distance Studios and its debut title,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-callisto-protocol">The Callisto Protocol</a> - has suggested he could be done with game development after struggling to secure funding for his latest project.</p>
<p>"Game industry, it's tough out there," Schofield wrote on<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/glenschofield_game-industry-its-tough-out-there-activity-7354611327878774785-mvzk/?utm_source=social_share_send&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop_web&amp;rcm=ACoAABcgUKYBbJX-MSb5OokNbeoXtezYCmgR3EM"> LinkedIn</a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/maybe-ive-directed-my-last-game-dead-space-creator-glen-schofield-says-a-new-aaa-game-feels-a-long-ways-away/">VGC</a>), revealing over the last eight months he had been working with his daughter on a new game idea. "She came to me with it, and I immediately loved the idea. Something I hadn't seen before. We've been calling it a new sub-genre of horror - not just horror, but something more," Schofield wrote. </p>
<p>However, the duo failed to obtain the financial backing which would have allowed them to continue with their project.</p>

<p>"We pulled the budget down to $17m, built a prototype with a small, talented crew, and started taking meetings. People loved the concept. We got a lot of second and third meetings. But early feedback was 'get it to $10m'. Lately, that number's dropped to $2-5m," Schofield continued, stating he and his daughter had ultimately decided to "walk away" from the project.</p>
<p>"Some ideas are better left untouched than done cheap. We had a team of six here in the States and a full crew in the UK. Now, everyone's looking for work. They're all talented folks - if you're hiring, let me know," the game developer wrote. "As for me - I've worked on games of every size. From two of us to over 300 devs. Spent the last 15-20 years making big AAA titles with great teams. That's what I do. That's what I love.</p>
<p>"But with the industry on pause, AAA feels like it's a long ways away."</p>
<p>Wrapping up his post, Schofield wrote: "I miss it all; the team, the chaos, the joy of building something for fans. I'm still around, making art, writing stories and ideas and still cheering the industry on. But maybe I've directed my last game. Who knows? If so, thank you for playing my games."</p>

And yes, you’re right, those figures are all <em>incredibly</em> close.</p><p>$218 million for <em>Fantastic Four </em>to <em>Superman</em>’s $217 million means both Marvel and DC can be feeling pretty good about things right now. It also does put a lot of the last couple of weeks of handwringing about Supe’s international performance in a different perspective</p><p>Post <em>Superman</em>’s release, James Gunn has given a bunch of comments about why the film may not have performed as well overseas as hoped, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2025/film/news/james-gunn-superman-woke-anti-america-box-office-1236465776/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/james-gunn-superman-woke-anti-america-box-office-1236465776/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most recently claiming</a></span> that “anti-American sentiment around the world” could be behind the discrepancy, as well as suggesting Superman isn’t as well known in some foreign territories as names like Batman. But given both superhero flicks have made almost identical amounts, it seems that it could be a lot less about Superman specifically, and perhaps more about superheroes themselves.</p><p>Things are still going well for <em>Superman</em>. After three weekends of release, it’s now crossed the half-billion point, with a reported total of $502,701,478, with percent of that domestic. In contrast, 54 percent of <em>Fantastic Four</em>’s opening total is from the U.S. So, again, rounding errors, but the same pattern.</p><figure id="" data-id="69d291abf7f3fc913134b32f16353b4b" data-recommend-id="image://69d291abf7f3fc913134b32f16353b4b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1380" data-height="776" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="HERBIE the robot." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="HERBIE the robot." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="69d291abf7f3fc913134b32f16353b4b" data-recommend-id="image://69d291abf7f3fc913134b32f16353b4b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1380" data-height="776" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="HERBIE the robot." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The reason anyone cares about this is the implication that the perceived lack of overseas sales means these films might not be making as much money as they “should.” Looking through this years’s biggest movies, the normal proportion of total box office to come in domestically is between 32 and 50 percent. <em>F1: The Movie</em>, the extraordinary advertising feature starring Brad Pitt, made just 32 percent of its $510 million in the U.S. <em>Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning</em> is on $592 million, with 33 percent coming in from American audiences. Even <em>Captain America: Brave New World</em> got more than 50 percent abroad, and the same for <em>Thunderbolts*</em>.</p><p><em>A Minecraft Movie</em> teeters shy of the big one billion at $995 million, 44.4 percent domestic, while the biggest American movie of the year so far, <em>Lilo &amp; Stitch</em>, got 42 percent of its $1 billion from home shores. (The biggest movie of 2025, the Chinese animated film <em>Ne Zha II </em>which has pulled in an eye-watering $1.9 billion, got just one percent of that in the U.S.!)</p><p>So, given all this, producers and distributors will be wondering why international audiences aren’t showing up to skew the stats in a similar way for these two superhero movies. While sitting on thrones made of diamond-encrusted gold bullion.</p><p>It’ll be interesting to see if <em>Fantastic Four: First Steps</em> has the same legs as <em>Superman</em>, especially given it’s a somewhat more obscure property among the non-comics-reading public. Still, it’s already the 13th biggest film of the year after just a couple of days.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/fantastic-four-first-steps-opening-weekend-superman-1851787100]]></content:encoded>

                <p>As announced yesterday during the Middle-earth: The Adventure Ahead panel at San Diego Comic Con, the survival crafting game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria/" data-ref-id="5000-566000">The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria</a> is getting a brand new expansion. This new expansion, titled Durin's Folk, is very light on details though. It's currently slated for release in Q4, 2025, and a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2933130/view/545615719765639778?l=english" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam post</a> explains that you'll "continue the fight to restore Moria with an expanded end-game story, exciting new game mechanics, plus many unrevealed secrets!"</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dR3nlac_v90" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dR3nlac_v90" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>A small teaser trailer was also released, showing off a big empty hallway with a massive door being opened by a group of dwarves. Various characters speak over the trailer too, with one notably saying "Khazad-dum is the home of Durin's Folk." For some context, Khazad-dum is another name for Moria, so it sounds like this end-game focused expansion might actually be living up to the base game's subtitles. Durin is also one of the seven fathers of the dwarves, the original group of dwarves that founded the dwarven race, for any non-Lord of the Rings loreheads out there.</p><p dir="ltr">Return to Moria didn't receive an outstanding reception when it launched back in 2023, averaging a critics' score of 59 on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria/">Metacritic</a>, and a user score of 6.8. The game appears to be doing better on Steam these days, with a very positive rating across all of its reviews.</p><p dir="ltr">The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria is available to play now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p>

<p>Total Digital Eclipse of the heart</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/18dac4deea960/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Digital Eclipse</em></figcaption></figure><p>We've been eagerly anticipating more news on Digital Eclipse's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection">Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection</a> since it was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection-comes-to-switch-and-switch-2-in-2025">revealed</a> last month with a 2025 release window, and while nothing has been <em>officially</em> shared, it looks like a more specific release date might have accidentally leaked — via the Xbox App, no less (thanks for the heads up, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection-release-date-looks-like-its-been-leaked-early-by-xbox">IGN</a>).</p>
<p>As noted on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/">r/GamingLeaksAndRumours</a> Reddit forum, the Xbox App briefly had the upcoming collection listed for <strong>29th/30th September</strong> (thanks to the magic of time zones) over the weekend, though there was no official word from Digital Eclipse. The app listing has since reverted back to the 31st December 2025 placeholder that we so often see deployed for titles awaiting a specific date, but not before more than a handful of people clocked the change.</p>
<p>Speculation quickly ensued on the Reddit thread, with folks theorising that the devs might formally reveal the release date at EVO 2025 next weekend, or perhaps even that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/prominent-youtuber-doubles-down-on-belief-that-a-nintendo-direct-is-due-this-month">rumoured Nintendo Direct</a>. Either way, the specification of the app's date and its subsequent removal has made us a little less sceptical of this leak than we normally would be — even if we are still treating things with a pinch of salt.</p>

<p>For those who missed the Legacy Kollection reveal in last month's State of Play, this one sees Digital Eclipse hit up the "interactive documentary" format once again, with interviews, commentaries and interesting materials about some of the biggest games in MK history. That accompanies "over 20 different versions" of iconic Mortal Kombat titles, with the current lineup including the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/mortal_kombat_ii">Mortal Kombat II</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/ultimate_mortal_kombat_3">Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/mortal_kombat_advance">Mortal Kombat Advance</a> and many more.</p>

			<p>Not every game, but some games, like Tripwire Interactive's Killing Floor 3, deliver exactly what you'd expect by looking at the cover. You shoot Zeds (read: zombies), and when you're done shooting Zeds in one level, there are more Zeds for you to shoot on another. In between the shooting, you'll level up your weapons, refill on ammo and gear, and then go back to shooting Zeds. Oh, and there are also a few narrative-driven tasks to complete, but the main course is shooting Zeds.</p>



<p>That's fine, really. I love a strong narrative, but I can just as easily get behind a game where the story is nothing more than a reason for the gameplay to happen. Or at least it would be, if shooting Zeds was worth the rest of the game's failings. It's not a bad thing for a game to be streamlined against everything else, but it's bad for those games to not even get their core pitch right.</p>



<p>Which is the unfortunate case Killing Floor 3 finds itself in. It's not about much more than shooting Zeds, and the shooting, along with the Zeds and everything else, is fresh from the 'just fine' section on the shelves of video game stores.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Image credit: Tripwire Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>In some ways, it's not a bad shooter. There's a solid amount of Zeds that chase after you each wave, and their heads pop with enough satisfying zeal. Zeds are also varied enough, and present an interesting enough challenge as you try to deal with the different variants that'll shoot you, charge you, and jump you from every direction. Also, it's not the only issue I have with the sound mixing, but these have to be the quietest zombies I've ever not heard the way I've been caught off guard. Maybe that's just a me problem, and I have to get my ears checked, but it's come up enough times and like I said, it's not the only problem with how the game sounds.</p>



<p>There's a good deal of weapon variety, you can run around each map half-decently, and I appreciate that in a game so focused on bodily mutilation, you can drop the firearms and flamethrowers altogether and just enter the fray with a couple of swords. </p>



<figure><figcaption>Image credit: Tripwire Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>It's a solid mix, and can help make the gameplay feel a little more engaging than it does when you stick to more tried-and-true combos, with my preference being a classic assault rifle/shotgun loadout.</p>



<p>There's also a good amount of synergy to be found with the six currently available classes to choose from. Between weapon, build and special ability coordination, there's a lot that you can combo up between teammates with a little communication and preparation. Unsurprisingly, it's better to hop into matches with others instead of try to run through any of these maps on your own. Playing solo is an option, but it's a huge grind to get anywhere compared to playing with others.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Killing Floor 3 boss Queen Crawler</figcaption></figure>



<p>And a grind is the only thing more plentiful than Zeds in Killing Floor 3. The amount of objectives there is to grind for is perfectly set up for new players to make Killing Floor 3 their new forever-game. Or at least that's clearly Tripwire Interactive's hope with how everything is already set up for it.</p>



<p>Not narrative objectives - there's only 10 main story-focused missions, through which Nightfall's director, Cordelia Clamely, narrates your way through as you jump back and forth between the Army Depot, R&amp;D Lab, Horzine Factory, Radar Station, Convoy, City Streets, and Offices. When they're done? </p>



<figure><figcaption>Killing Floor 3</figcaption></figure>



<p>Head back to all those same maps, plus one more (Sewers), and kill some more Zeds and the same three 'just fine' bosses, chasing after daily and weekly challenges, along with a random new challenge each week to mix things up a bit more if you are already getting tired of the base challenge the game's only core mode offers. Hear each of the characters rattle off their one-liners, and of course, there's also a battle pass with cosmetics for your character and weapons to work through. And then ramp up the difficulty when you get bored of running through each of the maps on the default 'Normal' setting.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Image credit: Tripwire Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>Which, again, there's nothing inherently wrong with. I like a zone-out game as much as the next person, but Killing Floor 3 doesn't just feel like a surface-level game that you can zone out to. It feels like a game that's not totally there. That's not exactly complete, almost like the early access version of Killing Floor 3 before it's packed to the brim with DLC and actually chock-full of stuff to do and see. That's all on its way, of course. There's a<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1430190/view/517468222093525040"> first-year roadmap</a> already laid out, with a new specialist, new map, new Zed type to mow down, new bosses, weapons, mods, and more campaign-focused missions coming before the end of the year. In 2026, there's another map coming, more weapons, mods, a new Perk, which is what the classes are called, and then whatever is unannounced as part of the second year roadmap.</p>



<p>It all feels as hollow as the weapons unfortunately do, which is my other problem with the sound mixing and quality. Weapons don't sound satisfying on the trigger pull, and getting weapons to sound satisfying to fire is pretty much the whole game in shooters. Sure, there's a bunch of window dressing around that one aspect of the game, but how a gun sounds is the key element to how much fun it is to press the trigger. When that's lacking, practically nothing in the window dressing can make up for it.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Image credit: Tripwire Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>There are more weapons, maps, specialists, perks, and everything else coming, but how much is tomorrow's promise worth today? In a game like Killing Floor 3, not much, thanks to the fact that you'll run out of things to do before the day is done, and then tomorrow the new content that's promised won't be out yet.</p>



<p>It's been nearly a full decade since <a href="http://wccftech.com/review/killing-floor-2-review-zombie-killing-never-looked-so-good/">Killing Floor 2</a>, which has been supported with a lot of content to work through in that time. Now, after some <a href="https://wccftech.com/killing-floor-3-has-a-july-release-date-after-unexpected-march-delay/">delay</a>, Killing Floor 3 has arrived, asking a full-price entry fee with nowhere near the kind of content Killing Floor 2 has. If you're brand new to the series, then it's easy to get in now on the ground floor (pun intended), but it's difficult to think that anyone who wasn't bored of Killing Floor 2 wouldn't just keep playing that instead of jumping into the third act of this trilogy.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Image credit: Tripwire Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>And there's all of this before mentioning the fact that the game does not run particularly well at the moment. Tripwire Interactive is surely going to be putting out patch after patch to fix things, but its 'Mixed' review rating on Steam, with a good chunk of the 4,000+ reviews that players have left citing technical problems and a game that runs poorly, which it does, is another sign of a game released in an unfinished state.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Killing Floor 3 isn't a bad game, but at launch, it's a shell of the game that it's promised to be, a promise made by the fact that its predecessor is filled to the brim and then some with DLC. In the meantime, what we have is a game that doesn't fulfill the one ask I have of every shooter, where you can see everything you need to see in an afternoon, and where the rest of the time you're spent running around chasing giant objective lists that boil down to busy work. It's all just fine, and even knowing that the technical issues will hopefully be the first ones to get sorted, the bar is on the floor with Killing Floor 3. With the technical issues, you could say that it's not even hitting that minimum. Come back in a year and/or when it goes on sale to see if anything has changed.</p>

						<section>
				<p>Killing Floor 3 isn't a bad game in a lot of ways. The base pitch of killing Zeds can be fun, and when you get some friends together to properly line up different Perks, it can be a good time to pull different abilities together and get some good teamwork flowing. But there are better games you can play to accomplish all the things that Killing Floor 3 accomplishes, and with the flat sounding weapons and so little to do, on top of the early technical problems, Killing Floor 3 is not the kind of game you should run to your computer to check out at launch. Maybe in a year, though.</p>
				<div>
												<ul>
							<h6>Pros</h6>
							<li>Killing Zeds is a good time, even better and more chaotic with friends
</li><li>There's plenty of weapons and build variety to shake things up</li>						</ul>
																		<ul>
							<h6>Cons</h6>
							<li>It's a shell of a game with very little to do
</li><li>Guns sound hollow and aren't satisfying to shoot, even if Zeds still fall in a satisfying way
</li><li>Poor technical performance makes it a chore to run
</li><li>Progression is a grind, and an even worse one if you try to play the game solo</li>						</ul>

			<p>Once known for their experiential horror titles focused on surviving rather than fighting, Bloober Team has slowly shifted their focus into a more combat-centric survival horror experience. After the success of last year’s remake of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/">Silent Hill 2</a>, the Polish developers recently unveiled a science fiction title they’ve been developing in tandem with The Medium. We and a small number of other journalists were recently invited out to Oakland, California, to get an early look at the first few hours of <a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-dev-diary-outlines-combat-mechanics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>.</p>



<p>Sometimes it’s about writing what you know, and Bloober Team has taken that old adage to heart with Cronos: The New Dawn being set within a very familiar backdrop for the developers. Some of their earlier titles, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/observer-system-redux-dystopian-fear/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Observer</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-medium-silence-of-the-damned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Medium</a>, were also set within the country’s borders, but Cronos: The New Dawn represents a particular moment in time for the citizens. Following the aftermath of World War II and the Soviet occupation, the city of Nowa Huta was idealized in real life as a monument to the power of the Soviets and a utopian society centered around the city’s steelworks. It’s here, set many years in the future from the city’s intended groundbreaking, that Cronos: The New Dawn takes place. As one of the developers said, putting an authentic piece of the world into a horror story makes it more attractive because you can identify with it even if you’ve never been there.</p>



<p>As a Traveler, the player is tasked with venturing back into key moments of time and extracting a target before they are killed. This is done by piloting into time rifts and exploring the world with only a rough idea of where the intended survivor is. From there, the Traveler is largely on their own, taking over in the footsteps of where their predecessors might have fallen.</p>



<p>Cronos: The New Dawn takes a lot of inspiration from the development of Silent Hill 2 in how the game flows, from the intimate camera angles to inventory management and opening locked doors. What sets this science fiction horror apart from the more psychological traumas of James Sunderland are the enemies known as Orphans. These grotesque and often indescribable masses of flesh and tentacles seek out the player with indiscriminate focus, chasing them down and even coordinating their attacks to sneak up on the player while their back is turned. Something unique that Bloober Team has introduced in Cronos: The New Dawn is the ability for these creatures to merge into one another and combine attributes from a fallen comrade, making them more deadly and more difficult to put back down. Having to deal with one Orphan that can spit acid is bad enough, but once they get reinforced armor, fighting them face to face becomes a struggle.</p>



<p>The most efficient way of dispatching these Orphans once they’re knocked down or slain is by using fire. The Traveler can use accelerants scattered around the environment, like discarded jerry oil cans or conspicuously marked barrels, to fill the area with fire. The player can also restock up to a single fuel cell (at least this early on in the story) that can be used to shoot out a small flamethrower and engulf those around in flames. As Cronos: The New Dawn doesn’t feature your traditional dodge or evasion movements, the developers showed off that this flamethrower ability is their way of giving players a way to escape from enemies or mitigate an incoming attack. While the player can only hold one unit of fuel at a time, I did make an effort to see if the game would let me store one in the Item Box that litters many save rooms; the game already knows if you have any fuel in hand, even if it’s in one of these boxes, so there isn’t a way to break the game and carry around more than intended.</p>



<p>Inside these save rooms are a number of terminals that can be used to upgrade The Traveler themselves as well as their different weapons they pick up. From your modest pistol to a stronger shotgun and others, each gun can use the currency that The Traveler picks up on their mission to upgrade the various parameters, giving weapons more damage, a faster reload speed, or also giving the player more health to stand a better chance at surviving. There’s also a crafting table in most locations and the same materials used to make bullets are also used to craft healing supplies, so players must make a conscious decision as to which would give them a better chance of surviving.</p>



<p>The gunplay in Cronos: The New Dawn is largely similar to what players saw in Silent Hill 2 or even EA’s Dead Space series. Played in an over-the-shoulder perspective, players can freely target limbs on an enemy to knock them down or aim for the head for increased damage. Out of all the weapons that I picked up during my two-hour session, the shotgun was the only one that felt like it was properly effective. The pistol was little more than a deterrent unless you were willing to unload the better part of a full magazine into a single enemy to take them out. Of course, you could just as easily try to run around some of these enemies and save your bullets, but the tight corridors of Nowa Huta’s apartment buildings don’t give The Traveler much room to run past an enemy. Once they’re downed, you can always give them a good head stomp just to be sure, but that won’t stop enemies from merging. Only fire gives players that certainty.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Cronos_Hospital-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>My experience culminated in a boss fight against a writhing mass of tentacles that would form itself into a hulking black humanoid that would either chase me down and swing indiscriminately in my direction or start throwing parts of itself at me when I tried to shoot it at range. I was rather thankful that this was at the end of the demo, as I had used up all of my healing items and bullets that I brought with me and was limited to the ammo that I could scavenge from the enclosed arena to do the final bits of damage. It was a bit of a low point to the experience, not just because it took me multiple attempts before I could dispatch the boss and get to my final destination, but also at how spongy some of the enemies can be and just how many bullets they’d take to go down.</p>



<p>If you take a step off the beaten path and explore around Nowa Huta in Cronos: The New Dawn, there are multiple small side paths that often lead to lost artifacts that can be cashed in for currency or those essential few bullets or healing items necessary for survival. There are also a variety of collectibles, from your usual gamut of audio logs and written notes to comic books. Backtracking to a much earlier section of the demo with the wire cutters I picked up rewarded me with a quiet respite filled with collectible supplies and a single cat that was added to my lorebook, seemingly one of the various collectibles to scour and find throughout neofuture Krakow.</p>



<p>Cronos: The New Dawn merges a familiar take on the developer’s homeland with the science fiction of time travel and trying to divert a catastrophe from taking place. With an estimated runtime of sixteen hours, this will be longer than your usual survival horror trip. I am curious to see how Bloober Team intends to pace the story and how rescuing these survivors (or not) will affect how the narrative plays out.</p>



<p>Cronos: The New Dawn is tentatively set for a Fall 2025 release across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and PC/Mac.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Heartworm Review - Retrovertigo]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/heartworm-review-retrovertigo</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/heartworm-review-retrovertigo.1254945/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ironically, humanity’s eternal fascination with the end of their lives always has them living outside of the moment. Memory’s the mission, of course, but this worry about whether there’s a reception after the end of everything is, rightfully, a massive roadblock, one which can be considered one of those final hurdles before you can comfortably exist. It’s a conundrum which <em>Heartworm </em>tackles head-on.</p>

<p>This is the debut commercial title spearheaded by Vincent Adinolfi: a survival horror tribute which initially received warm hype when it debuted alongside other titles in the first <a href="https://hauntedps1.itch.io/demodisc2020" rel="nofollow">Haunted PS1 Demo Disc in 2020</a>. Since then, <em>Heartworm </em>has become a labor of love which has seen resistance in the form of delays and, most unfortunately, <a href="https://filmstories.co.uk/news/developer-puts-out-a-call-for-help-as-ps1-style-horror-game-heartworm-loses-its-publisher/" rel="nofollow">a publisher drop-out in 2023</a>. Thankfully, DreadXP are here to save the day, hot on the heels after the runaway success of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/white-knuckle-early-access-preview-falling-from-cloud-9" rel="nofollow"><em>White Knuckle</em></a>.</p>

<p>You play as Sam, a young woman who is suffering from the effects of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder after her grandfather passes away. Unable to cope with the grief, Sam comes across a message board composed of users who’ve heard of a house in the backcountry which has a connection to the void beyond the void. Desperate and with seemingly no other options, Sam enters the house to find out for herself.</p>



<p>One thing that’s going to be immediately obvious about <em>Heartworm </em>– maybe even potentially off-putting – is how unapologetic it is about what came before it. Stylistically and mechanically, it’s punching towards the PS1’s entries of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/resident-evil-20-years-later" rel="nofollow"><em>Resident Evil</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/where-can-i-play-silent-hill-this-october" rel="nofollow"><em>Silent Hill</em></a>. Narratively, it seeks to execute the same environmental storytelling depth of something like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/genre-advancing-shooters-half-life" rel="nofollow"><em>Half-Life</em></a>, but in Adinolfi’s own words, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/22-years-later-half-lifes-influence-is-still-being-felt/" rel="nofollow">a more personal touch</a> has been embossed across the entire package.</p>

<p>Gameplay in <em>Heartworm </em>will consist of the usual type of survival horror shenanigans, that being logistically fantastical puzzles, fixed camera angles which sway between artistic, obstructing, or both, and very, <em>very </em>light combat. A lot of the puzzles can be considered “milquetoast” in a capacity: you find a sequence, memorize the sequence, use the sequence to continue, and this will be <em>Heartworm</em>’s main brain tester.</p>

<p>How it presents those sequences does vary, and <em>Heartworm </em>encourages making your own notes, but I was never challenged enough to go that far. There are never enough pieces or wrong answers to mentally take into account, and the answers are never far enough away from the question to be considered a burden. At the very least, they stay consistent, which is necessary for a story aiming to contort the space around you.</p>



<p>Still, it fares a hell of a lot better than what the combat offers over time. It’s described as “limited”, but contextually, it’s because there’s only one option, and that’s using your camera to stun them into oblivion, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/fatal-frame" rel="nofollow"><em>Fatal Frame</em></a>-style. Pop a few candid shots of your own inner fears, and watch them disappear before your eyes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this case, enemy variety is important, and how you interact with them in the heat of battle. <em>Heartworm </em>responds firmly with a fat handful of enemies, each of them unique in their lethality, the highlight of which will be your most common encounter: a walking spectre made of TV static. With its glitchy screams and wails calling for help, your first couple of encounters with them will be nail-biting, but this is where the intensity starts and ends.</p>

<p>As time goes on, combat doesn’t just become an intrusion, but it’s entirely recommended you avoid it entirely, and that’s not in <em>Heartworm</em>’s advice or favor. Enemies become less of a statement on the horror's intuition, but obstacles that speak to be nothing more than such, especially in the latter half of the game, where <em>Heartworm </em>is extremely stingy with ammo for your camera.</p>



<p>Does this feed into the sensibilities of survival horror? Intrinsically, yes, but at the same time, <em>Heartworm </em>is terrified of the player finding frustration in its mechanics of old – no checkpoints, spread-out save room locations, etc – that health items practically rain from the sky. Enemies will only ever deal physical damage to you over time, so don't worry about poison, crippling effects, so on and so forth.</p>

<p>As for the boss fights, you’ll find yourself in tricky situations, but the fights themselves suffer from a terrible case of waiting. There’s never much fortitude on display from the offerings of a giant spider, regardless of whatever game possesses them, but here, the giant spiders and the other looming bookends of each individual act will play similar roles of "they attack, you stun, they run, repeat".</p>

<p>Still, going to a horror game for the bosses is like going to a pizza place for a salad, and <em>Heartworm</em>’s aesthetic is the meal you're looking for. Where <em>Heartworm </em>picks and chooses to let its visual design and art direction fly free are when the game peaks, shimmering depictions of surrealist architecture and stress-inducing set pieces. How it envisions Sam in these environments does become a bit of an issue, especially when it zooms out and shows the full scale of the twisted psyche on display, and Sam becomes a black speck on the horizon -- this can happen even when you have the retro filters turned off.</p>



<p>I played through <em>Heartworm </em>twice, once for the gameplay, and once for the narrative, finding myself at the same conclusion both times in that Sam isn’t even the main character of her own story. Fairly quickly, her context, her reasoning, her history and presence, get snubbed in favor of a larger collective, one that also isn’t given the breathing room to justify considering how much time has been spent, and consecutively wasted on her.</p>

<p>When Sam’s story does return to the spotlight, it's done with such violent strokes of theming and messaging that it's painted in harsh juxtaposition with everything else. Every revelation and turn of the page is set up in implications, never a set statement that wants to mean something, or make you feel something. This is saved for the ending, which, without spoiling, sets up an entirely new implication which throws the entire message out of the water.</p>

<p>It’s a far cry from the previous demo’s of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/heartworm-preview-authentic-survival-horror" rel="nofollow"><em>Heartworm</em></a>, which establish her as more of a team player in terms of how she co-exists with the world presented, and those decisions are muted, but still present. In the full game however, she’s become a tourist to her own turmoils, her trials and tribulations seemingly ineffectual to the alarmingly blurry precedent on display. What messages exist in <em>Heartworm </em>are steeped in sympathy, but it’s hard not to feel apathetic towards a protagonist who, now, has had her resolution dismantled in the name of something I’m still not sure of.</p>

<h2><em>Heartworm&nbsp;</em>Review | Final Verdict</h2>

<p><em>Heartworm </em>is gorgeous. It’s so easy to fall in love with how it ticks and trickles its intricacies towards the player, but when the stakes ramp up, so much of its promise is dropped for too many ideas, that none of them get their proper chance to shine. It fades before you even get a chance to drink it in, and the memories it leaves behind are only able to become mere footnotes.</p>

<section><p>Bloober Team's follow-up to its successful remake looks to be similarly nerve-racking.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">After a few hours with Bloober Team's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hill-2/" data-ref-id="5000-574201">Silent Hill 2 remake</a>, it became clear to me that the oft-derided developer had made something special, and the conversation about the studio was about to change. After a few hours with Bloober Team's next game, the sci-fi horror <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/cronos-the-new-dawn/" data-ref-id="5000-647672">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, questions about the studio's capabilities are virtually an afterthought for me. I'm no longer wondering if the team can set and achieve lofty goals. Cronos has impressed in the two hours I've played it so far, and though I still have questions and will reserve my final judgment for the full game later this year, it's clear the team has found its secret weapon in how it has designed Cronos' combat gameplay.</p><p dir="ltr">When I previously saw Cronos during a hands-off showing in June, I likened its "merge system" of combat encounters to Dead Space, only played almost in reverse. Rather than strategically "cut off their limbs," like the famous bloody wall scrawl once instructed Isaac Clarke to do, Cronos delivers its own desperate plea: "Don't let them merge!" Enemies can absorb their defeated comrades, creating towering monstrosities that may well combine multiple classes into something more threatening.</p><p dir="ltr">For example, if one of the stalking husks of biomass that has blade-like appendages merges with one of the others that spews toxic bile at you, well, now you've got yourself a third, worse thing, offering the most horrific of both worlds. Sometimes the stakes are heightened from the get-go, with no shortage of motionless husks lying around any momentary battlefield you might find yourself in, and it may cross your mind to first burn away those buffs with a flamethrower--and maybe with a nearby fuel recharger, you can even accomplish this at times.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4538463-cronos_nest.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4538463" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4538463-cronos_nest.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4538463"></a><figcaption>By merging, enemies combine their strengths and become much more fearsome.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4538463-cronos_nest.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">But the real tension of any encounter comes when you're trying to manage not just how you'll kill enemies, but where. With an area-of-effect blast of your flamethrower that shoots out toward the ground in a small circle, you can permanently burn the bodies and prevent them from merging into a still-active enemy. This left me constantly worrying about where defeated enemies would fall, forcing me to sometimes purposely evade, but not yet kill, the game's monsters, or "orphans."</p><p dir="ltr">Flamethrower fuel was extremely limited in my demo, so the best practice was to get a few of them to die almost on top of each other, then light them ablaze like a big sci-fi viking funeral. But that's easier said than done, so inevitably I'd be faced with the choice to kill an enemy outright, whether its place of death was advantageous to me or not...which would then feed this felled monster back into my path as I'd watch it merge with other monsters still pursuing me.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a really clever wrinkle that once more gives Bloober Team an exceptionally tense combat system to lean into. In my <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/silent-hill-2-remake-review-born-from-a-wish/1900-6418296/">Silent Hill 2 remake review</a>, I wrote abou how I'd often make it out of a fight for my life and "observed my breathing return to normal, and felt my shoulders release their tension." Similar feelings defined my Cronos hands-on preview. Initially, I was quite proud of my smart combat decisions that did just what I was instructed to do: I wasn't letting them merge. However, as encounters became more complicated, <em>some</em> merging felt like an unfortunate inevitability. I couldn't be everywhere at once, and I didn't have enough fuel to burn away all the bodies, so I saw more than a few merged, ambulating nightmares, which always provided the healthy kind of stress and anxiety that horror games should offer.</p><p dir="ltr">With a gun that slowly charges to fire off its most powerful shots, ammo scarcity went beyond just the fuel, too. I could quickly fire off multiple, weaker rounds, using up more ammo, or I could try to nail more powerful single shots, but they were sometimes very difficult to land on target, and the enemies would charge toward me in the meantime, of course. Combined with the merging enemies, this created combat encounters that demanded I constantly consider my moment-to-moment choices. Lining up shots on one particular boss' weak points was difficult enough, and supplies were low enough, that it took me about four or five tries to finally kill the thing. Since my demo started from the game's opening, I understood this to be the first boss of the game. Future bosses are not likely going to be more forgiving, I assume.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4538464-cronos_hospital.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4538464" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4538464-cronos_hospital.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4538464"></a><figcaption>The slimy world of Cronos sets the stage for a time-travel horror story I'm eager to see for myself.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4538464-cronos_hospital.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">With gunplay and exploration taking plenty of cues from the genre's long history, I now find myself a few months out from Cronos' launch without much to worry about when it comes to gameplay. Upgrading my suit and weapons provided hard-fought and welcome buffs, I was constantly rewarded for going off the main path--like when I rescued a cat tied to a side quest that tasks you with saving many of them over the course of the story--and I especially loved the downbeat vibes of safe rooms, made whole with their own theme song like one of Capcom's finest.</p><p dir="ltr">There's still so much more to see before I know how the whole experience comes together. Bloober Team says the game will take about 16 hours to beat on a typical playthrough--more if you plan to see everything it offers. Cronos comes from a team of people within Bloober Team that is different from those responsible for Silent Hill 2. Naturally, the Silent Hill 2 remake enjoyed the blueprint of Team Silent's effort, so Cronos is the studio's chance to show it can do it all on its own. For now, at least, it seems the studio has found a way to make combat compelling and put its own original spin on the horror genre.</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> modder behind a bunch of the game's most popular romance mods is set to make NPC showering an optional extra in two of their works, with the hopes that these "non-sexy mods" will no longer be "hidden unnecessarily".</p>
<p>Their decision comes as a response to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nexus-mods-are-set-to-introduce-adult-mod-age-verification-for-uk-and-eu-users-soon">recent changes Nexus Mods have made</a> regarding creations that're classed as "adult", something the modding site's done as a result of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/online-safety-act">Online Safety Act</a> coming into force in the UK. The legislation's seen the likes of social media and porn sites also have to adopt new age verification checks before allowing users to access a range of content deemed unsuitable for children.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Naturally, this has meant that mods which tinker with or add to how romancing characters works in the likes of 18-rated <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> Cyberpunk have been flagged as adult by Nexus. This currently includes <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4508">Judy Romanced Enhanced</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4626">Panam Romanced Enhanced</a> by prolific modder Phil 'Deceptious' Wright, as of writing the fifth and sixth <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/games/cyberpunk2077/mods?categoryName=Gameplay&amp;sort=downloads">most downloaded mods of all-time</a> when it comes to CD Projekt's Bladerunnery adventure.</p>
<p>While you might think from their names that these mods would be obvious candidates for age-restriction, the situation's a bit more complicated than that. You see, unlike plenty of <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/9573?tab=description">Wright's other works</a>, these Judy and Panam mods don't actually add in new sexual encounters, instead simply giving the two affected NPCs more detailed daily schedules and the ability to be quickly hugged/kissed. Less x-rated smut fest, more just helping make it easier for you to roleplay as boyfriend, girlfriend, or partner.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://x.com/DeceptiousPhil/status/1949479630517551124">Twitter post</a> from Deceptious - which ironically ended up being briefly hidden from me by one of the Musk platform's new adult content blocks - the thing that's seemingly led these two pretty innocent works to be pinged as NSFW is the fact they make Judy and Panam have regular, non-sexy showers as part of their schedules. To be fair, the mods don't lock their respective bathroom doors, though the Panam one does look to include optional opaque shower curtains in the name of privacy.</p>
<p>So, in order to avoid having "these non-sexy mods hidden unnecessarily", Wright's currently putting together new "family friendly" versions that'll see the two ladies permanently barred from having a wash, unless you download what'll either be optional plugins or separate mods that give them the ok to pick up a sponge.</p>
<p>It looks to be a pretty unique case as far as Cyberpunk mods that've been flagged as adult go. It's also exactly the kind of strange situation that folks had envisioned might happen with the new rules, given the notoriously unprudish nature of games like Cyberpunk. After all, mods with Sims-style shower blurring wouldn't really fit with the rest of the game. Though I guess you could spin it as a bit of cyberware V's secretly had installed, so that they aren't permanently scarred by the sight of a nipple or two during their breaks from brutally murderdeathing goons.</p>
<p>Anyway, it's good to see Deceptious has seemingly found a solution that works for him, in terms of both keeping the mods highly visible on Nexus and ensuring 90% or so of the stuff they include stays as is. Plus, it's <a href="https://x.com/DeceptiousPhil/status/1949536999766966593">helped him</a> unearth a bug that was trapping Panam in the shower.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-modder-makes-npc-cleanliness-optional-in-order-to-avoid-popular-non-sexy-mods-being-hidden-unnecessarily]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Australian pressure group Collective Shout has claimed responsibility for the recent Itch.io and Steam developments that have seen the platforms change how they deal with - and in some cases remove - NSFW games and content from their respective platforms.</p>
<p>The group had already been closely linked with the situation, which has seen <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-introduces-vague-new-rules-banning-certain-kinds-of-adult-content-to-appease-credit-card-companies">Itch.io and Steam scramble to appease payment providers like Visa</a> as they suddenly took an interest in the kind of games available on the platforms, especially those which contravened rules and "standards" the payment providers apparently had. It led to Itch.io deindexing all NSFW content from its browse and search pages, and Steam introducing vague new rules about adult content, while removing a slew of games.</p>
<p>"In response to false claims and misinformation about our campaign, we're setting the record straight," <a href="https://www.facebook.com/collectiveshout/posts/pfbid0To1Tp69DJ3P39utywXrMbFwGERcnWmcSBmQMZoUhL9EDu9sZjXBgAgrMDRJFs46Kl">wrote Collective Shout in a Facebook update</a>. "Some have asked why we involved payment processors, and others have claimed we are responsible for Itch.io removing all NSFW content.</p>

<p>"We raised our objection to r*pe and incest games on Steam for months, and they ignored us for months. We approached payment processors because Steam did not respond to us.</p>
<p>"We called on Itch.io to remove r*pe and incest games that we argued normalised violence and abuse of women. Itch.io made the decision to remove all NSFW content. Our objections were to content that involved s*xualised violence and torture of women."</p>

The group's actions - a mixture of petitioning, emailing, and lobbying - began in early April and led to the game being removed from sale later that month.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>The group continued to send hundreds of emails to Valve about problematic games that remained on Steam, but said it wasn't until it began lobbying payment processors such as Visa, PayPal and MasterCard that change began to happen.</p>
<p>This rush to appease payment processors has met with pushback from parts of the gaming community. There have been collective efforts, for instance, to counter-lobby payment companies like Visa in an effort to turn them around.</p>
<p>An open letter template to Visa, shared on Reddit (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/steam-gaming-industry-visa-payment-processors-adult-games-banned/">TheGamer</a>), reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I am concerned customer about Visa's recent efforts to censor adult content on prominent online game retailers, specifically the platforms Steam and Itch.io. As a long-time Visa customer, I see this as a massive overreach into controlling what entirely legal actions/purchases customers are allowed to put their money towards.</p>
<p>"Visa has no right to dictate my or other consumers' behavior or to pressure free markets to comply with vague, morally-grounded rules enforced by payment processing providers. Unless these Draconian impositions are not reversed, I will have no choice but to stop dealing with Visa and instead swap to competing companies not directly involved in censorship efforts, namely Discover and AmericanExpress."</p></blockquote>
<p>Some people have reportedly had responses from Visa to this letter, which insist the company is not moderating content, does not make "moral judgements" about content, and supports the sale of all content considered "legal". Visa's alleged response reads (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1m9ly2j/so_i_got_a_response_from_visa/">via Reddit</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"While we explicitly prohibit legal activity on our network, we are equally committed to protecting legal commerce. If a transaction is legal, our policy is to process the transaction. We do not make moral judgements on legal purchases made by consumers.</p>
<p>"Visa does not moderate content sold by merchants, nor do we have visibility into the specific goods or services sold when we process a transaction. When a legally operating merchant faces an elevated risk of illegal activity, we require enhanced safeguards for the banks supporting those merchants."</p></blockquote>
<p>No one will lament the removal of No Mercy from sale on Steam, but whenever a net like this is thrown over an entire area of perceived problematic content, there will be well-intentioned games caught in the net too. Specifically, LGBTQ+ games are under threat - games that don't align with the Christian values underpinning the pressure group Collective Shout.</p>

            <p>PlayStation 5 owners are reportedly getting two more Xbox-published titles added to their roster.</p>
<p>According to a report by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-gears-of-war-e-day-and-state-of-decay-3-are-coming-to-ps5">MP1st</a>, both Gears of War: E-Day and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/state-of-decay-3">State of Decay 3</a> will be coming to PS5.</p>
<p>The publication cited resumes of developers working on each game, with both listing the PS5 as a target platform for their respective titles.</p>

<p>Xbox has been steadily adding more of its games to additional platforms. Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/four-xbox-exclusive-games-heading-to-ps5-and-switch-according-to-phil-spencer">Microsoft confirmed its plans to bring four previously Xbox-exclusive first-party titles to PlayStation 5 and Switch</a>, with more to follow. And follow, they have.</p>
<p>Following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-published-sea-of-thieves-reportedly-surpasses-1m-sales-on-playstation-5">successful release of Grounded, Sea of Thieves and Hi-Fi Rush across additional platforms</a>, Microsoft has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-xbox-console-exclusive-forza-horizon-5-is-ps5s-highest-selling-game-of-the-year-so-far-says-analyst">since released the likes of Forza Horizon 5</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-selling-faster-on-ps5-than-steam-and-xbox">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on PlayStation</a>. Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-of-war-coming-to-playstation">original Gears of War has been confirmed to be coming to PlayStation later this year</a>, as part of the revamped "Reloaded" edition of the game.</p>
<p>It therefore would not be surprising to see Gears of War: E-Day pop up on PlayStation 5, even if not as a day one release. The next new entry in the series is a prequel title <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marcus-fenix-returns-in-gears-of-war-prequel-e-day">set 14 years before the events of the original game</a>. Gears of War: E-Day is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bulletstorm-studio-confirms-project-maverick-is-a-gears-of-war-game">being co-developed with People Can Fly</a>. Late last year, it was revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-is-so-back-as-original-voice-talents-are-confirmed-for-gears-of-war-e-day">John DiMiaggio and Carlos Ferro will be reprising their roles as Marcus Fenix and Dominic Santiago</a> in Gears of War: E-Day.</p>
<p>As for State of Decay 3, this leads one to wonder whether the first two games in the series may eventually arrive on PlayStation as well. State of Decay 3 was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/state-of-decay-3-announced">initially announced</a> during Microsoft's 2020 Xbox showcase. Things went dark for a little while, and there were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/state-of-decay-3-report-details-troubled-development">reports alleging sexism and mismanagement at developer Undead Labs in 2022</a>. The game subsequently reappeared last year, with a new trailer.</p>
<p>To accompany the trailer, studio head Philip Holt teased some of the ideas driving State of Decay 3's development. "The first thing that I hope people pick up [from the trailer] is that there's four player characters we're highlighting," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/state-of-decay-3-resurfaces-after-four-years-with-new-cinematic-trailer">he explained at the time</a>, "three of them start in different places in the world - so we're implying this idea of a shared world experience, not just a ride-along, and that the boundaries in which you can go off independently are going to be much, much greater than they were in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/state-of-decay-2">State of Decay 2</a>."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/xboxs-state-of-decay-3-and-gears-of-war-e-day-heading-to-ps5-report-claims]]></content:encoded>

<figure><a title="﻿Pokémon Friends Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157641/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>It seems like every <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/pokemon-presents-july-2025-every-announcement-full-livestream">Pokémon Direct</a> spends more than half its runtime detailing updates for or announcing casual <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-pokemon-spin-off-games-of-all-time">Pokémon spin-offs</a>. From <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_cafe_remix">Pokémon Café ReMix</a> to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_sleep">Pokémon Sleep</a>, we’ve gotten so many Pokémon-themed experiences that any new announcements outside of the Generation X games feel as tired as a Snorlax after a large meal. This gives the most recent release — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_friends">Pokémon Friends</a> — an uphill battle to gain the attention of an increasingly broad Pokémon audience.</p>
<p>Pokémon Friends features a collection of simple puzzle-style minigames that reward you with different types of yarn that you can then throw into a Plush-O-Matic to pop out a collectible Pokémon Plush. From Sparky Yarn to Creepy Yarn, each corresponds with Pokémon types. For example, you’ll get Ghost and Poison-type Pokémon from Creepy Yarn like Gengar and Croagunk, while Sparky Yarn yields only electric critters like Pikachu and Pachirisu.</p>
<figure><a title="﻿Pokémon Friends Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157643/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Yup, Pokémon Friends is more or less a gacha game, albeit not a punishing one. Most yarn types have a rare Pokémon to pull at about a 2% rate compared to the other ‘mons at around 8%. You can place these plushies off in little room dioramas or give them to NPCs looking for a specific type to complete daily quests in order to collect more furniture for your rooms, and that's about it. There's no online functionality like a trading system or a way to share your rooms.</p>
<p>The plushies are definitely cute, but as there are only about a dozen to collect of each type of yarn, pulling your favourites doesn’t feel quite as exciting as pulling an Immersive card in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_trading_card_game_pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> or another comparable gacha game. I don’t count this as a negative, necessarily. TCG Pocket is far more 'predatory' while Pokémon Friends maintains a much less stressful vibe; that said, if you’re looking to grind out the full Plush Dex, you likely won’t find it all that rewarding an experience.</p>
<p>Actual problems begin to pop up like Digletts when you start playing the puzzles. These aren’t designed for 35-year-olds like myself who have played Pokémon since they were 9 years old; rather, they’re simple puzzles made with children in mind that were clearly created for mobile play and not the Nintendo Switch.</p>
<figure><a title="﻿Pokémon Friends Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157635/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>This is seen in the puzzles themselves — which we’ll get to — and the way they’re presented. In the free mobile version of Pokémon Friends, you need to drop $9.99 USD otherwise you’re locked to just a few puzzles each day. In turn, this means you’ll get to pull way fewer plushies, making the entire experience far more drawn out.</p>
<p>On Switch, you have to pay $9.99 to even download the game with two $15 puzzle packs available to purchase that add an additional 10 puzzles and 40 plushies each automatically into the pools. This means that with the initial purchase you can play as many sets of puzzles as you want and pull as many plushies as you want in a given day, unless you restrict yourself with an in-game setting.</p>
<p>As we purchased the Pokémon Friends Combo Bundle that comes with the two puzzle packs for the slightly discounted price of $35, we had a total of 50 puzzles to experience. Each time you play, Pokémon Friends throws at you three random puzzles with around three to six stages of that specific puzzle to complete.</p>
<figure><a title="﻿Pokémon Friends Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157648/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>They start off incredibly simple but level up in difficulty after each completion. Many of them focus on shapes, like Pumpkaboo’s Shadow Show, where you have to judge what the 2D silhouette of a 3D <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/tetris">Tetris</a>-like block will look like when Pumpkaboo casts light upon it. In others, like Lotad’s Ferry Service, you guide a cute little Bulbasaur across a pond by figuring out the correct Lotads to ride on.</p>
<p>Despite how much I enjoyed seeing some of my favourite Pokémon star in their own minigames, I grew tired of several of the puzzles rather quickly – even with all 50 puzzles unlocked. I can only imagine how tired I’d grow of Pikachu’s Power Line and Greninja’s Secret Shapes if I only had the base 30 puzzles to play, especially when those puzzles sometimes repeat the same stages at higher difficulties and you can't pick which ones you'd like to play or block the ones you're bored of.</p>
<p>Pokémon Friends was clearly designed with the mobile version’s daily restriction in mind, which makes playing for more than a couple of hours at a time a detriment to the experience.</p>
<figure><a title="﻿Pokémon Friends Review - Screenshot 5 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157637/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>And as you’d expect in a mobile-first title, most puzzles greatly benefit from the Switch’s touchscreen controls. You see, the quicker you solve the puzzles, the better quality yarn you receive, giving you a chance to pull an extra plush and to reach new high scores. If you want to play docked with a controller, you’ll still be able to clear every puzzle, but you’ll definitely lose a few seconds here and there.</p>
<p>On the other hand, trying to organise your plushies in a room with both the controller and touchscreen is an exercise in frustration; the drag-and-place function simply doesn't work all that well with room depth, which makes placing your Flygon next to your Salamance plush an annoying endeavour.</p>
<p>Despite starting off simple enough that toddlers can take them on, the puzzles begin to show some bite around level six or seven, with a max level of nine. Mind you, they never reach <strong>Professor Layton</strong>-levels of mind-straining difficulty, but even those 35-year-olds that grew up with Pokémon will have to pause and think every so often at higher levels.</p>
<figure><a title="﻿Pokémon Friends Review - Screenshot 6 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157638/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>I certainly preferred some puzzles over others. Think Outside The Box had me rotate a box crammed with squares and rectangles to free a Rowlet or Slowpoke from within, providing a lot of thoughtful challenge at later levels. And I enjoyed most puzzles where I controlled a Pokémon directly, such as Topsy-Turvy Espeon that uses blocks and gravity in clever ways.</p>
<p>At the same time, I didn’t enjoy guessing the amount of hidden crates behind the visible ones in Blocked Boxes, nor did I find Square Solver and Tricky Triangle appealing when they popped up; both simply require you to connect-the-right-dots to make the required shape and have no relationship with Pokémon other than some background art.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether I enjoyed specific puzzles or not, they were all responsive and smooth on the Switch 2 I played on. That said, Pokémon Friends still seems out of place on Nintendo's handheld hybrids. The entire package has a 'freemium' mobile feel that would be easier to digest if it were, for example, a free-to-download title with $5 puzzle packs instead of a $9.99 base purchase with more expensive DLC.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In the end, even the fun puzzles began to grow stale after only a few hours of play as they're so quick to complete and pop up so often, which dampened my enthusiasm for unlocking Mudkip and Jirachi plushies to decorate my rooms with.</p>
<p>I have no desire to boot up Pokémon Friends daily for a few quick puzzles like how I rip packs in TCG Pocket, leaving me with the sense that this puzzle package will fade into the background with other casual spin-off titles, forgotten about until the next Pokémon Direct that announces a handful more overpriced puzzle packs instead of Generation X.</p></section>

			<p>The codenames for the APUs that will power the PlayStation 6 and the PlayStation handheld have been revealed by prominent leakers, effectively confirming that another leaked APU from AMD will power the next-generation Xbox console.</p>



<p>Following the release of a new video providing some new information on the leaked AMD Zen 6 Magnus APU, Moore's Law Is Dead provided <a href="https://www.youtube.com/post/Ugkx5bPPRXBb7iDre4lkQXKdfzbg0mY6x77d">an update</a> on the APU codenames for next-generation systems that have been circulating online in the past few days, revealing that Orion is the codename for the APU that will power the PlayStation 6 and Canis is the codename of the APU that will power the new PlayStation handheld. While no other known leaker confirmed if Orion is indeed the APU of the next-generation console by Sony, known AMD leaker Kepler L2<a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/grain-of-salt-moores-law-is-dead-ps6-soc-codenamed-orion-ps6-portable-soc-codenamed-canis.1686673/post-270660157"> confirmed</a> that Canis is indeed the APU of the PlayStation handheld, adding that it has a <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/grain-of-salt-moores-law-is-dead-ps6-soc-codenamed-orion-ps6-portable-soc-codenamed-canis.1686673/post-270662745">monolithic design.</a></p>



<p>As there were some doubts regarding the Magnus APU being the PlayStation 6 APU, now that it is known that Orion will be the system's APU, the AMD Zen 6 APU leaked <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-next-xbox-amd-zen-6-magnus-apu-11-cores-384-bit-memory-bus/">earlier this month</a> has been confirmed to be the one that will power the next-generation Xbox. In the video mentioned above, Moore's Law is Dead revealed some additional details on the APU, which will have a 3nm RDNA "AT2" GPU die, can go up to 70 CU, but it is expected to get 68 CU yields, and it will have a 192-bit memory bus, and not a 384-bit bus as previously revealed. Looking at the leaked specs, AMD leaker Kepler L2 <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/mlid-zen-6-magnus-leak-amds-massive-apu-for-next-gen-console-medusa-point-specs.1686433/post-270660139">speculates</a> Microsoft may use a split memory model again, as a 192-bit bus is considered too little to feed both CPU and GPU. </p>

<p>With the first information on the PlayStation 6 and the next-generation Xbox leaking online, it will likely not take much longer to learn more about what the two systems will be capable of. With machine learning having made its proper debut in the console space with the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution Upscaler, it will be very interesting to see what these systems will offer besides better specs than their predecessors.</p>
