			<p>It's not long until the <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-multiplayer-trailer-revealed/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Open Beta</a> is available, with Early Access being available to those who pre-ordered the game and Game Pass subscribers accessing the Early Access period between August 30 and September 4. However, those who don't fit that criteria will be able to access the Open Beta, which is available on September 6 through September 9. If you plan on getting stuck into the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 open beta, you'll need to know the PC requirements.</p>
<p>Luckily, those on console won't need to worry about requirements. However, if you're a PC user, you must ensure your computer can run it. It's pretty well known that Call of Duty games can be quite a burden on your system, especially with how big the downloads are for Call of Duty games. This is something that they are planning on working on so that download sizes are smaller and more tolerable for players. However, we are still a way off of that.</p>
<p>Below are the minimum and recommended PC requirements to be able to get stuck into the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Open Beta.</p>

<p>The minimum requirements listed for the Black Ops 6 Open Beta will most likely be to run the game at 30 FPS consistently throughout gameplay with settings on low or medium at a push.</p>
<p>The recommended requirements are for those who want to play the game consistently at 60 FPS on high settings. However, they have noted that in some situations, the FPS may drop, so your settings may need to be tweaked to make the Black Ops 6 Open Beta run smoothly.</p>
<p>In addition to these settings, you'll need at least 149 GB to download the Open Beta. Considering it's most likely gated content, that is a hefty download size, and doesn't account for the full download size of the actual game upon release date. Currently, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2933620/Call_of_Duty_Black_Ops_6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Steam page</a> doesn't even have the system requirements available other than players needing to have a phone number linked to their Steam account to play the game.</p>

			<p>The latest game in the Call of Duty franchise is due to release on 25 October 2024. As the date looms closer, more details about the game are surfacing, including a new trailer showcasing Black Ops 6 multiplayer. So far, there have been mixed responses regarding what players got to see in the two-minute trailer. However, there are plenty of fun ways to kill people in the game, which is garnering a lot of attention from Call of Duty fans.</p>
<p><iframe title="Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 - Multiplayer Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GYG_h-L-K2E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Even those who have sworn off the franchise for years are now considering making a comeback from what was revealed in the trailer. It showed off a lot of intense action, from barging through the doors and sliding across the floor while aiming at your opponent to receiving a hatchet to the chest. There are many different ways to execute your opponents, with Treyarch speaking out about some of the features of Black Ops 6, <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-direct-omnimovement-campaign-zombies-release-date/">such as omnimovement</a>. For those who prefer a solo experience, there is also the promise of an open-ended campaign or zombies for those who want a more nostalgic experience.</p>
<p>Black Ops 6 now provides the option to use fallen soldiers as a meat shield when on the battlefield, allowing you to rest your gun on their shoulder and take aim at your opponents. As with previous Call of Duty games, there will be helicopters that you can shoot at lower ground targets from, as well as calling in an airstrike to a chosen location.</p>
<p>Those eager to get stuck into the Black Ops 6 multiplayer can expect to see 16 new maps to battle on, as well as the classic prestige system and a Gunsmith for you to customize your weaponry.</p>
<p>If you have pre-ordered Black Ops 6 or have an active Game Pass subscription, you'll be able to get stuck into the Early Access period from August 30 through September 4. Don't panic though, if that group of people doesn't include you. You'll also be able to get a glimpse at what to expect from Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 in the Open Beta which runs from September 6 through September 9.</p>
<p>While Black Ops 6 takes place in the Gulf War, the multiplayer is separate from that setting, with the setting looking significantly more modernized. Instead, the battles take place <a href="https://screenrant.com/black-ops-6-multiplayer-zombies-campaign-details/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">between factions</a> named Rogue Black Ops and Crimson One, respectively. There will be 12 Operators for players to choose from, with six Operators being available per faction.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/where-to-get-grumpy%E2%80%99s-key-in-escape-from-tarkov.963984/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/grumpys-key-escape-from-tarkov/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Any long-time veteran of Escape From Tarkov will tell you that it’s a game less focused on PvP and more on the loot. When you engage in PvP, it’s because you want their loot. When you scour the map for hidden rooms and keys, it’s because you want loot. Well, there’s one loot location throwing people for a loop. Here is where to get Grumpy’s Key in Escape From Tarkov!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-grumpy-s-hideout-key">How to Get Grumpy’s Hideout Key</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>To acquire Grumpy’s Hideout Key, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-ref-in-escape-from-tarkov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you must first unlock Ref</a>, raise his trader level to two, and then barter with him. To reach level two, you must raise his level to 0.25 and reach level 15 yourself. </p>



<p>Once you’ve met these requirements, interact with Ref and trade him x1 Lega Medal for Grumpy’s Hideout Key, which has five uses. Use them wisely!</p>



<h2 id="h-where-to-find-grumpy-s-hideout">Where to Find Grumpy’s Hideout</h2>



<p>Once you obtain the key, head to Interchange. Once there, you can find Grumpy’s hideout inside the power station to the northeast of the map, near the Power Plant Extract. </p>



<p>Head inside the Power Plant on the main floor to the back corner of the room. There, you’ll spot a white door leading into a small square shack-like structure against the wall. You may unlock this door using the key.</p>







<h2 id="h-loot-you-ll-find-in-grumpy-s-hideout">Loot You’ll Find in Grumpy’s Hideout</h2>



<p>Inside Grumpy’s Hideout, you’ll find a Green Keycard, odd loose loot, x2 Jackets hanging on the walls, and x1 Sports Bag. Furthermore, there’s a chance for:</p>



<p><strong>Weapons</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>CMMG Mk47 Mutant</li>



<li>Desert Tech MDR</li>



<li>Lone Star TX-15 DML</li>



<li>SIX MCX Spear</li>



<li>AWS VAL</li>



<li>SIG MXC .300</li>



<li>FN SCAR-H</li>



<li>HK416</li>



<li>FN P90</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Armor</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Altyn Bulletproof Helmet</li>



<li>Crye Precision AirFrame Helmet</li>



<li>Ops-Core FAST MT Super High Cut Helmet</li>



<li>Peltor Tactical Sport Headset</li>



<li>Walker’s XCEL 500BT Digital Headset</li>



<li>Peltor ComTac IV Hybrid Headset</li>



<li>LBT-6094A Slick Plate Carrier</li>



<li>HighCom Trooper TFO Body Armor</li>



<li>BNTI Zhuk Body Armor</li>



<li>BNTI Ghzel-K Body Armor</li>



<li>DRD Body Armor</li>
</ul>



<p>While armor will keep you alive, the weapons make this hidden loot room worthwhile. Many come with various modifications, allowing you to strip them for parts to sell or customize your gun. Better yet, add the whole kit to your stash!</p>



<hr>



<p>Now that you’re stockpiling loot for the latest season, let’s ask the tough questions. For instance, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-ever-coming-to-steam-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when is Escape From Tarkov coming to Steam</a>?!</p>

All your current <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> characters sheets are once again safe with the publisher no longer forcing updates to newer versions of spells, weapons, and magic items.</p><p>Last week, as a part of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/18/24180843/dont-call-it-6th-edition-though-well-all-probably-do-that">the updates to <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Fifth Edition</a> — collectively known as the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23728470/dnd-dungeons-dragons-6e-5e-changes">2024 revision</a> — the publisher announced that it would update D&amp;D Beyond, the tabletop RPG’s official digital toolkit that players use to reference content and create characters using a host of official and third-party sources. The update would add the new 2024 rulebooks to the toolkit, mark outdated content with a “legacy” badge, and change players’ character sheets to reflect all the new rules and features. </p><p>That last part is critical to understanding why some <em>D&amp;D </em>players (including my own dungeon master) spent the last 72 hours in a state of panic. Though some of the 2024 revisions are essentially cosmetic in nature — for example, “races” will be updated to “species” — other updates like the ones to weapons, spells, and magic items fundamentally alter the game. Wizards of the Coast would have essentially overwritten every user’s character sheet with the new information whether they wanted it or not. </p><p>“All entries for mundane and magical items, weapons, armor, and spells will also be updated to their 2024 version,” Wizards said in its initial announcement.</p><p>The publisher did say that players would have the option to continue to use the 2014 version of spells and magic items. But doing so requires using the game’s homebrew rules. which aren’t known for being user-friendly. </p><p>To put this in perspective, think of it like owning a car. Imagine that after 10 years with one car, learning its ins and outs, the manufacturer decides that when it rolls out the latest model of your car, it’s going to magically change your car to the new model, too. Now, though your car is essentially the same, it doesn’t work like you’re used to. And when you ask the manufacturer if you can go back to your old car, it says you can but that you’ll have to manually restore it yourself.</p><p>Thankfully, Wizards of the Coast isn’t in the car business, and after a weekend of backlash on social media, the company will no longer force the new changes on players.</p><p>“We misjudged the impact of this change, and we agree that you should be free to choose your own way to play,” <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/1806-2024-d-d-beyond-ruleset-changelog-update">Wizard’s said in its latest announcement</a>. Current character sheets will only be updated with new terminology while the older versions of spells, magic items, and weapons will be preserved. Also, players who have access to both the 2014 and 2024 digital versions will have the option to use both when creating new characters.</p><p>Essentially, Wizards of the Coast is doing what it should have done in the first place: simply adding the new content and giving players the choice to opt in. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-factions-future/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-factions-future/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Last week, I had the opportunity to sit down at Gamescom with Ian Proulx, Co-founder and CEO of 1047 Games, to talk all things Splitgate 2. We’ve <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-new-details-anti-cheat-esports/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">compiled some of that interview here</a>, in which Proulx discussed Esports, Anti-cheat, and other updates. </p>



<p>But now that I’ve returned home after walking almost half a marathon a day at Gamescom, I’ve listened back to our interview again. </p>



<p>1047 Games is very focused on making Splitgate 2 the best game it can be (as it should be), and the sentiment conveyed in our interview was that this will be achieved through community feedback. Several times, Proulx mentioned a ‘Community First’ approach, which was refreshing and comforting to hear. You see, I am a massive fan of the original Splitgate. Its simplicity and mechanics made it fun, and after the announcement of the second game, I was somewhat perplexed about the game’s new direction. </p>



<p>Fortunately, I did have the opportunity to play the game a couple of weeks ago. Although my initial concerns have been squashed, I still wanted to ask those all-important questions that the community has expressed concerns about since the game’s initial announcement. </p>



<p>One of the most significant changes in Splitgate 2 compared to its predecessor is the introduction of Factions. After my <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-is-a-solid-sequel-but-with-a-big-esports-influence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-on time with the game</a>, I found that the Faction-based system worked well, but I did want to know about Splitgate 2’s live-ops model and when, or if, that live-ops model includes the addition of more factions in the future. We often see live service games with characters, heroes, factions, or whatever you want to call them balloon into an unnecessary amount after a couple of years. For example, Apex Legends has gone from eight characters to launch to 25, and sometimes, such additions feel like they are implemented just for monetization rather than gameplay and quality. On this and on the addition of more factions, Proulx said,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I don’t think we want to go to 10 factions [for example], you know? I think like one of the problems, and one of the problems we’ve thought through is, how do we prevent bloats from happening? You know, you play a lot of games where just over the years, it gets crazy and unsustainable, and so I think that’s part of the motivation for going classes versus heroes. Is there a world where we add more classes, like sure, is there a world where we don’t? Yes.</p>



<div><p>Genuinely we don’t know which direction we’re going to take it. I think a lot of it is like, let’s launch this game and let’s see with the community wants you know? If adding a new faction is what the community wants, we are in a position where we could do that, but maybe they just want new guns, and they don’t want new abilities or equipments or anything.</p><p>So maybe we’re just building on these three factions and that’s a great thing about how we’ve structured our company and just our mindset, like we’re very nimble. Were very ready to pivot, we’re very ready to take feedback and roll with it.</p></div>
</blockquote>



<p><br>So there you have it: if the Splitgate 2 community wants more Factions, it’ll happen. I did try to squeeze Proulx a little further to ask if they’ve already considered or thought about future Factions and their abilities, but for now, he said the team is entirely focused on the core game for launch. </p>

<p>I like knowing precisely how well my system will run upcoming games. Numerous benchmarks are available to test performance, but nothing beats information straight from the developer. In this, we finally have the Black Ops 6 system requirements on PC, including the long-rumored storage size!</p>



<h2 id="h-the-black-ops-6-system-requirements-on-pc">The Black Ops 6 System Requirements on PC</h2>



<p>To prepare for the upcoming beta for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, Activision finally unveiled the PC system requirements for the game. They align with what we expected, and thankfully, the overall storage space requirements are somewhat more manageable!</p>



<h3 id="h-minimum-system-requirements">Minimum System Requirements</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10 (64-bit)</li>



<li><strong>Processor</strong>: Intel Core i5-6600 / AMD Ryzen 5 1400</li>



<li><strong>Graphics</strong>: Nvidia GeForce GTX 960 / GTX 1650 / AMD Radeon RX 470</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 8 GB RAM</li>



<li><strong>Storage</strong>: 149 GB (SSD Recommended)</li>



<li><strong>Internet</strong>: Broadband Internet Connection</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-recommended-system-requirements">Recommended System Requirements</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10 (64-bit) / Windows 11 (64-bit)</li>



<li><strong>Processor</strong>: Intel Core i7-6700K / AMD Ryzen 5 1600X</li>



<li><strong>Graphics</strong>: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 Ti / RTX 3060 / AMD Radeon RX 6600XT / Intel Arc A770</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 16 GB RAM</li>



<li><strong>Storage</strong>: 149 GB (SSD Recommended)</li>



<li><strong>Internet</strong>: Broadband Internet Connection</li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-how-big-is-black-ops-6">How Big is Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>Now that we have official PC system requirements available for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, we know the game doesn’t weigh in at over 300 GB, as initially rumored. Instead, you require just 150 GB of space for the game. Unfortunately, it’s still absolutely massive, but that’s how many AAA titles are heading these days.</p>



<p>That said, if you already have Call of Duty HQ and Warzone installed on your computer, you can download Black Ops 6 for a measly 78 GB! Impressive!</p>

It's a little surreal to watch a company that once </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/game-platforms/capcom-shuts-down-i-dead-rising-i-developer-capcom-vancouver">stumbled badly with its North American operation</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> now seem like a pillar of stability.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What is it doing right? According to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilds</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> game director Yuya Tokuda, executive producer Ryozo Tsujimoto, and art director Kaname Fujioka, there isn't one practice propelling the studio along. But as they explained in a conversation at Gamescom 2024, there's a unique culture of communication across development of the widely-used RE Engine, among game developers on different games, and between developers and sales teams across the globe, that make its blockbuster strategy stand out in a turbulent 2024.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="RE Engine is made to serve many games">RE Engine is made to serve many games</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The technical Swiss Army Knife at the heart of Capcom's development process is RE Engine. Though the name references the long-running Resident Evil series it was first created for, it's been used since in games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dragon's Dogma 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Street Fighter 6</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Devil May Cry 5</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and even </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ghosts 'n Goblins Resurrection</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The engine follows in the footsteps of MT Framework, Capcom's first studio-wide game engine that debuted in 2006's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dead Rising</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Framework's legacy lives on in other ways too, according to Tsujimoto. "We're greatly focused on multiplatform releases at Capcom, and we need an engine that can work across multiple [types of] hardware," he said. MT Framework was a "great porting engine," and its strengths there were replicated for RE Engine's development.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Today, the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Monster Hunter Wilds</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> teams and other Capcom developers work "right alongside" the RE Engine engineers, and benefit from a "fast feedback loop" to request features or bugfixes slowing down development.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That seems simple enough on its face, but Capcom isn't the only game company to mandate use of a single internal engine. At companies like EA, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/frostbite-labs-is-ea-s-new-skunkworks-for-developing-future-tech">the practice</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/the-frostbite-engine-was-too-hard-to-manage-according-to-former-bioware-gm/">been blamed</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for slowing down development on games not in based in the genre the engine was created to support. The difference, Tsujimoto explained, is that no single game or franchise has the final say on updates to RE Engine.</span></p><p>Image via Capcom.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We have the flexibility to work with them on a priority list," he said. If the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Monster Hunter Wilds</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> team makes a request that the team can't immediately accommodate, they aren't told "no," they're brought into a conversation about the pipeline—one they can participate in because they're aware of every other game in development and their technical needs.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In fact, having developers at Capcom in constant conversation with each other is a common practice. From the way he described it, there doesn't seem to be a habit of siloing teams away from each other on secret or need-to-know projects. "Our teams all work closely together, even across different titles," he said. "We're able to share ideas and discoveries and technology with each other."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That sense of cooperation extends as far out as the sales teams in Japan and across the globe. Tsujimoto seemed to nod at the fact that the Monster Hunter series' massive sales numbers come from regions outside the US and Japan, saying the company has developed a "tight-knit" relationship with the teams marketing and distributing the game across those regions.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Close relationships between game developers and salespeople are slightly unusual—but the series' ever-growing popularity seems to be shaping the production process in a number of impactful ways.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Is five years too long to make a game like ">Is five years too long to make a game like <span>Monster Hunter Wilds?</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Though not all of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Monster Hunter Wilds</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">' developers have been on the project for all 5-6 years of its development (Fujioka, the art director, said the team also worked on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Monster Hunter Rise</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and its expansion </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sunbreak</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in that time period), that's still an eye-popping amount of time to work on a single game. Fujioka told Game Developer that its expanded development was driven in part by the series' growing playerbase, whose existence increased the amount of time spent on research and development.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The more people came on board the series, the more we had to think about how we actually meet our users' needs when we start a new project," he said. "There's so many more players now, and they [possess] a broader level of skill levels and experience with the [series]."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That's especially worth calling out with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilds</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">' </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/monster-hunter-wilds-open-world-leap-is-thanks-to-growing-global-popularity">major shakeups</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to the Monster Hunter formula. The game is set in a series of open worlds where players can take on more open-ended hunts, tracking different monsters and mimicking the role of a hunter in a real-world ecosystem. Not every player can smoothly navigate the jump from one type of gameplay to another, and accommodating them (seemingly with insights from the global sales teams) was a key part of the process.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As game director, Tokuda was the one who "felt" the long years developing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilds</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Tsujimoto joked. Tokuda told us he's been creatively invested of exploring the "monster ecosystem" at the heart of the series ever since he first saw the first game's trailer over 20 years ago.

<p>PC gaming has become increasingly popular over the years. With the ability to upgrade your equipment at any time, many gamers have begun to prefer gaming with a PC. </p>

<p><strong>Here is a list of the best cheap graphics cards:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 Super ($240.00 USD)</li>

<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-best-low-budget-graphics-card-in-2024">The Best Low-Budget Graphics Card In 2024</h2>



<p>Only one card from our list of the best cheap graphics cards can stand out as the best low-budget card for gamers to buy. That card is the <strong>NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060</strong>. This card is a huge upgrade from the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070, which can handle pretty much any video game. </p>

			<p>Starfield: Shattered Space, the first expansion for the single player sci-fi RPG released last year by Bethesda Game Studios, is now just about a month away from <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-shattered-space-releases-in-september/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launching</a>.</p>
<p>At Gamescom 2024, the developer opened up slightly on what will be featured in the premium DLC. In an <a href="https://gamingboulevard.com/2024/08/interview-starfield-shattered-space-with-tim-lamb-gamescom-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview</a> with Gaming Boulevard, Lead Creative Producer Tim Lamb said:</p>
<p><em>We've added a few new mechanics that we're really excited about. For example, there are new zero-gravity combat scenarios that really change the dynamics of how you approach fights. It adds a layer of strategy that wasn't there before. We've also introduced new ship customization options, which allow players to really tailor their vessels to their play style. And on the exploration front, there are new tools and gadgets that will help players interact with the environment in deeper, more meaningful ways.</em></p>
<p><em>The new sector we've created is pretty substantial. It's not as large as the entire galaxy, obviously, but it's densely packed with content. We focused on making sure that every corner of this new area feels alive and has something for players to discover. Whether it's hidden side quests, unique encounters, or just the sheer beauty of the landscapes, there's a lot to keep players engaged. It's less about sheer size and more about the depth of the experience.</em></p>
<p>Lamb also said that the expansion content is integrated seamlessly into the game, so the content will seem like a natural fit for players in the middle of a playthrough. Artistically, Starfield: Shattered Space will offer vibrant colors and more diverse landscapes, and the story will feature several twists and turns that should surprise players.</p>
<p>Starfield: Shattered Space is out on September 30 for PC and Xbox Series S|X. However, with Microsoft porting more Bethesda games to PS5 (such as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-to-release-as-timed-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upcoming</a> Indiana Jones and the Great Circle), it may be only a matter of time before PlayStation players get to fly the stars as well.</p>

Some of it was small, such as posting <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@sonicmovie/video/7407107236167699742&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sonicmovie/video/7407107236167699742" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a TikTok</a></span> seemingly referencing <em>Matrix</em> actor <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-shadow-keanu-reeves-reaction-1851414208&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-shadow-keanu-reeves-reaction-1851414208">Keanu Reeves’ casting as Shadow the Hedgehog</a></span>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-state-of-play-is-likely-coming-in-late-september-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.963837/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/september-2024-state-of-play/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Giant Bomb’s Jeff Grubb has claimed that a PlayStation State of Play will likely be released by the end of September.</p>



<p>The rumor came during today’s Game Mess Mornings, when after speaking on the PlayStation 5 Pro, Grubb said, “There is probably going to be a PlayStation State of Play by the end of September.” Unfortunately, Grubb didn’t dive into what could be announced during the event. Still, both he and his co-host guest theorized that it could be something akin to a PS5 Pro announcement followed by a miniature games showcase on the new console.</p>



<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro was reportedly heavily talked about at Gamescom this year, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-was-an-open-secret-at-gamescom-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wccftech</a> and the Italian website <a href="https://multiplayer.it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Multiplayer</a>&nbsp;both hearing from developers that the console is on its way. </p>



<p>It remains to be seen when the PlayStation 5 Pro will be announced. Unfortunately, such information is hard to pin down due to how PlayStation segregates its departments from one another in an effort to stop leaks. However, logically, it makes sense to announce the console ahead of the Tokyo Game Show, which starts on September 26, 2024. </p>



<p>According to our developer and manufacturer sources, the PlayStation 5 Pro is still on track to release around mid-November. </p>



<p>Will you be buying the PlaySation 5 Pro on release? And are you looking forward to another PlayStation State of Play? Let us know in the comments below.</p>

That direction helped establish the visual language of the game, but developer Massive Entertainment wanted to take things a step further by making Star Wars Outlaws look like it had been shot with the same film lenses as the classic movies.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzR8Rg-4840" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/lzR8Rg-4840" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>To achieve this technical feat, the studio developed its own digital "camera lens" in the Snowdrop Engine, which was used to give Star Wars Outlaws a more cinematic presentation. While this is an optional mode, players can enable a widescreen presentation in the game that adds black bars to the bottom of the screen, a period-accurate film grain, and other small cinematic touches.</p><p>"We developed a lens, a camera lens within Snowdrop, our game engine, that allows us to replicate the sort of, lenses of the '70s and 80s," creative director Julian Gerighty explained in a new GameSpot Insider documentary. "So you have barrel distortion, chromatic aberration, film grain, and vignetting all wrapped up in an ultra-widescreen presentation. All of these things you can turn on and off individually, but the whole impact is that it really pulls you into a cinematic presentation."</p><p>According to technical art director Stephen Hawes, the lens project was challenging but worth pursuing as it harkened back to how the original films were shot and helped create a cinematic experience for Star Wars Outlaws. Massive Entertainment was able to render technical effects like lens breathing and film grain that ran at 24fps independent of the game's chosen frame rate, and other small touches like CRT screens, a slight barrel distortion, and a soft focus helped create a "grounded, cinematic" atmosphere, Hawes explained.</p><p>Star Wars Outlaws launches on August 30 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-preorder-guide/1100-6522523/" data-ref-id="1100-6522523">but if you're looking to play a few days early</a>, you'll be able to do so if you have a Ubisoft Premium+ subscription. <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/star-wars-outlaws/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">On GameSpot's sister site Metacritic</a>, Star Wars Outlaws currently has a "generally favorable" metascore of 77 from 59 reviews.</p>

            <p>
A new Nintendo Direct broadcast will air tomorrow, Tuesday 27th August, at 3pm UK time. 
</p>
<p>
For those across the pond, that's 7am Pacific, or 10am Eastern.
</p>
<p>
Lasting roughly 40 minutes, the show will feature upcoming games and announcements for Nintendo Switch, from both major third-party developers as well as indie studios. Just don't expect any news on Nintendo's own games - such as the upcoming Zelda: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">Echoes of Wisdom</a> - or <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>.
</p>
<p>
Tomorrow's broadcast is a combined Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase, which focuses on big games from non-Nintendo developers, and an Indie World Showcase, which spotlights projects from smaller creative teams. 
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoUK?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">post</a> on X this afternoon, Nintendo also gave it's now-familiar statement that it would not be revealing any new information on Switch 2 tomorrow. (The company is set to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-makes-first-switch-2-announcement">detail its upcoming new hardware at some point before March 31st 2025</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hopes-fade-for-switch-2-launch-in-early-2025">launch it later next year</a>.)

			<p>Despite the system having yet to be announced, the PlayStation 5 Pro is apparently still coming this year, according to a report from a reliable insider.</p>
<p>During the latest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8TqCntkFPg&amp;t=1s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Game Mess Mornings</a>, Jeff Grubb discussed Sony's yet-to-be-revealed system, saying that, last he heard, the console is still coming out this year. In addition, the insider heard that there will probably be a State of Play presentation by the end of September. The insider doesn't know if the PlayStation 5 Pro will be at the State of Play, but there's a good chance it will be.</p>
<p><iframe title="Game Mess Mornings 08/26/24" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o8TqCntkFPg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>At this point, the PlayStation 5 Pro has become an open secret, and almost everyone in the video games industry seems to know about it. <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-was-an-open-secret-at-gamescom-2024/">During this year's Gamescom</a>, Alessio was told by a developer that they have been informed about the system specifications and are sure Unreal Engine 5 games will run better on the system. Given that it wasn't a big developer, it definitely seems like Sony shared the system specifications with a wide range of developers to gear up for the system's announcement and release.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro has yet to be officially announced. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as more come in on it, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

It won’t be long till you can try her toolset out for yourself, but while you wait here’s everything we know about Vyse, including her backstory, abilities, and release date.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197209" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Boys Star Karen Fukuhara On Kimiko’s Character Arc, Karate, And More" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="319" data-playlist="197209,196923,196922" data-current="197209"><div><p>The Boys Star Karen Fukuhara On Kimiko’s Character Arc, Karate, And More</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22759.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h1188"><a id=""></a><strong>When does Vyse release for <em>Valorant</em>?</strong></h2><p>Good news! Vyse joins the roster as part of <em>Valorant </em>Episode 9, Act 2, which releases on August 28 at 9:00 a.m. EST. That means you only have a couple of days before you’ll be able to test out the latest agent for yourself. </p><h2 id="h1189"><a id=""></a><strong>What is Vyse’s backstory?</strong></h2><p>As part of her reveal, Riot dropped a cinematic titled “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btpWg1gDXIE&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btpWg1gDXIE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">All Paths End Here</a></span>” that gives us some insight into who exactly Vyse is. In the short video we see a team of current agents led by Jett embark on a mission in South Korea to take down a mysterious new combatant. That combatant is, of course, Vyse, who manages to hold her own against the strike team thanks to a series of abilities like laying traps and summoning metal thorns out of nowhere. Before the battle gets out of hand, Omen suggests they talk, hinting that Vyse will join the <em>Valorant </em>protocol. </p><p>The cinematic doesn’t reveal too much about the mysterious masked agent. We do hear her talk and she sounds American, so maybe she has some history with Viper, but only time will tell. The cinematic does make the new agent out to be a cold and calculating force of nature, one that <em>Valorant </em>is lucky to have on its side.</p><h2 id="h1190"><a id=""></a><strong>What are Vyse’s abilities?</strong></h2><p>Vyse takes on the sentinel role in <em>Valorant</em>. Agents in the sentinel role typically have a toolset that focuses on defensive play and supporting the rest of the team. Vyse will become the sixth sentinel in <em>Valorant</em>, joining Killjoy, Cypher, Sage, Chamber, and Deadlock. Vyse’s skills center around manipulating metal, sort of like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fortnite-chapter-5-season-3-unlock-magneto-1851585011&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-chapter-5-season-3-unlock-magneto-1851585011">Magneto</a></span> from the <em>X-Men</em>. Here is the full list of Vyse’s abilities.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Arc Rose</strong>: Equip an Arc Rose. Target a surface and fire to place a stealthed Arc Rose, or alt fire to place the Arc Rose through it. reuse to blind all players looking at it. This ability can be picked up to be redeployed.</li><li><strong>Shear</strong>: Equip filaments of liquid metal. Fire to place a hidden wall trap. When an enemy crosses, an indestructible wall bursts from the ground behind them. The wall lasts for a brief time before dissipating.</li><li><strong>Razorvine</strong>: Equip a nest of liquid metal. Fire to launch. Upon landing, the nest becomes invisible. When activated, it sprawls out into a large razorvine nest which slows and damages all players who move through it.</li><li><strong>Steel Garden</strong> (ULT): Equip a bramble of liquid metal. Fire to send the metal erupting from you as a torrent of metal thorns, jamming enemy primary weapons after a brief windup.</li></ul><p>Vyse’s toolset positions her as a great agent for zone control and laying traps for opponents seeking to flank you and your team. With abilities that blind enemies or activity on command it really seems like Vyse will thrive on letting your opponents walk into traps that turn them into fish in a barrel for your teammates.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
