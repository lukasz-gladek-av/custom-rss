            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>On January 29, <em>Ashes of Creation</em> maker Intrepid Studios was promising big updates to the recently launched, long-awaited fantasy Steam MMO. <a href="https://kotaku.com/ashes-creation-refund-kickstarter-steam-mmo-layoffs-2000665006">Less than a week later</a>, the game has been review-bombed, removed from Valve’s storefront, and seen all of its developers suddenly fired, according to a new post from the studio’s communications director.</p> <p><span>“I waited until today to share this because I wanted to be sure I was communicating from a place of clarity,” Intrepid Studios head of marketing Margaret Krohn <a href="https://x.com/MargaretKrohn/status/2018794224276377819">wrote on X</a> on Tuesday. “Intrepid Studios has shut down in a way that I did not expect. What I can share is what I experienced. On January 28, toward the end of the workday, I was informed that we would be laying off 100 developers. I was devastated – these are hardworking people who were going to lose their jobs. Still, I believed it was something we could face together and find a path forward from.”</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I waited until today to share this because I wanted to be sure I was communicating from a place of clarity.</p> <p>Intrepid Studios has shut down in a way that I did not expect. What I can share is what I experienced.</p> <p>On January 28, toward the end of the workday, I was informed that…</p> <p>— 𝕸𝖆𝖗𝖌𝖆𝖗𝖊𝖙 𝕶𝖗𝖔𝖍𝖓 🌱💕 (@MargaretKrohn) <a href="https://twitter.com/MargaretKrohn/status/2018794224276377819?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 3, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>That was the day before an unsigned “<a href="https://ashesofcreation.com/news/a-director-s-letter-to-the-citizens-of-verra-336">director’s letter</a>” was posted to<em> Ashes of Creation</em>‘s players promising a February 13 update on the game’s roadmap for the first few months of 2026. But according to Krohn, the mass firings at the studio were already moving forward. She said she received confirmation of which members of her team would be laid off by the end of day on January 29, and the remaining employees began working on “ways to move forward” the following day. But by January 31, it became clear that no one at the studio was safe.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“On January 31, we were all informed via a confusing email that we would be laid off, along with a WARN notice,” she wrote. “It is still shocking. The entire studio gathered to try to understand what had happened and what it meant for our future. In the end, none of us are receiving our final paychecks, the 60 days notice and pay outlined under the WARN Act, PTO payouts, or other compensation owed.”</span></p>

 <p>That’s the same day that <em>Ashes of Creation</em> director Steven Sharif announced on Discord he was no longer in control of the company and was resigning in protest.&nbsp;“I can make a limited statement in my personal capacity and not on behalf of the company, regarding the situation,” he wrote on January 31. “Control of the company shifted away from me, and the Board began directing actions that I could not ethically agree with or carry out. As a result, I chose to resign in protest rather than lend my name or authority to decisions I could not ethically support.”</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000665514" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000665514"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000665514">Valve / Intrepid Studios</figcaption></figure> <p><span>That was the first public mention of the turmoil Intrepid was facing and it immediately ricocheted across Steam, where<em> Ashes of Creation</em> entered Early Access back in December, and Kickstarter, where backers raised $3.2 million to bring the MMORPG to market starting way back in 2017. The game was quickly review-bombed on Valve’s storefront with warnings to other players to stay away of what soon might become a dead game, while backers on Kickstarter demanded refunds over the game never hitting a proper 1.0 launch. It’s since been removed from sale completely on Steam.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“What matters most to me now are the people – both the players and developers,” Krohn wrote today. “To the players: the entire development team was working extremely hard, pulling long hours, and wishes with all our hearts that we could give you <em>Ashes of Creation</em>. There are no words that fully express how sorry we are that this journey ended this way. You should pursue a refund, you deserve it. To my colleagues: this team is truly a family. The culture we built together is something I have never experienced anywhere else. In the midst of heartbreak and uncertainty, we have come together to review resumes, help with portfolios, share job leads, and support one another emotionally.”</span></p>

 <p>As of now, it’s unclear who remains in control of Intrepid Studios as a company, which is based out of San Diego, or what will happen to <em>Ashes of Creation</em>, whose potential for a comeback seems increasingly unlikely. Who funded the game’s development? How did the studio’s finances suddenly get wiped out overnight? And what recourse do developers who worked on it have to be made whole? <em>Kotaku</em> tried reaching out to the studio’s email address but we haven’t heard back. Sharif declined to comment before clearing it with his legal counsel.</p> <p>When we reached out to <span> Krohn she responded with the following: “I made my statement. I can’t really talk more than that, I think I might have even said too much as is, but people need to know what happened.”<br> </span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/next-gen-xbox-on-track-for-2027-launch-says-amd-ceo-2000665496</link>
            <guid>1424758</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) CEO Lisa Su shared some interesting information about two upcoming video game devices, <a href="https://kotaku.com/16-cool-details-valve-new-steam-machine-console-controller-vr-headset-2000643572">Valve’s Steam Machine</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-xbox-microsoft-phil-spencer-new-console-1851700253">Xbox’s next-gen console</a>, both of which are powered by her company’s chips.</p> <p><a href="https://gamesbeat.com/amd-spills-the-beans-on-next-gen-xbox-launching-in-2027/">As reported by <em>Gamesbeat</em></a> on February 3, Su shared some new info about when to expect Valve’s upcoming console-like PC gaming box, the Steam Machine, and further teased a possible launch window for Microsoft’s previously confirmed-to-be-in-development next-generation Xbox.</p> <p>“From a product standpoint, Valve is on track to begin shipping its AMD-powered Steam Machine early this year,” claimed Su in prepared remarks ahead of a financial call.&nbsp; “And development of Microsoft’s next-gen Xbox featuring an AMD semi-custom [System on Chip] is progressing well to support a launch in 2027.”</p>

 <p>This isn’t a confirmation that the next Xbox will launch in 2027, but Su did point out that both the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S will be entering their seventh year on the market at that point, and that’s a good time for a refresh.</p> <p>Valve’s Steam Machine has a confirmed release date of 2026, but nothing any more specific. Valve says the Steam hardware family will expand in early 2026, but didn’t specify if that was all three recently announced devices, just one, or some other combo like the VR headset and new controller. Su’s comments seem to indicate that Valve could start selling and shipping Steam Machines to customers within the next few months. Meanwhile, we’ve known for some time that Microsoft is trying to get the next Xbox out <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps6-next-gen-xbox-price-specs-leak-release-date-2000635303">around 2027</a> or <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-x-s-game-pass-gen-10-release-date-microsoft-1850849528">possibly 2028</a>. Microsoft execs have also teased that the next-gen Xbox will be <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-next-gen-xbox-pc-windows-rog-ally-2000638181">a “very premium, very high-end” device</a>, so it doesn’t sound cheap.</p>

 <h2>The next generation of game consoles will be expensive</h2> <p>While Su didn’t talk about prices, it’s pretty clear to anyone paying attention that any video game consoles or console-like devices arriving in the near future are going to cost quite a bit. President Trump’s tariffs have led to increased prices on many goods made overseas. Meanwhile, AI hyperscalers and tech giants are <a href="https://kotaku.com/intel-cpu-production-pivot-ai-data-centers-shortages-increase-price-ram-memory-pc-2000663095">scooping up more and more PC parts, like RAM and GPUs</a>, to help build out massive AI data centers. <a href="https://kotaku.com/target-employee-shows-pc-game-memory-part-price-increases-shortage-ram-ssd-2000663863">This has led to memory prices skyrocketing</a>, and Nvidia is even reportedly looking to start making old GPUs again as the parts needed to make newer cards are routed toward making high-end cards for data centers.</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-increase-nintendo-ram-shortage-2000658946">Existing consoles, like the Switch 2</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-prices-dram-amd-ai-shortage-2000646851">Xbox Series X/S,</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-increase-tariff-ai-ram-stock-price-2000661382">could also see price increases</a> in the future due to memory shortages and the rising cost of PC parts. <a href="https://kotaku.com/amd-gpu-prices-radeon-ps5-xbox-steam-machine-2000645803">Even AMD’s cheaper GPUs are reportedly going to see price increases</a>. Meanwhile, when we’ve seen new gaming-adjacent tech launch in the last 12 months, the prices have been high, as in the case of Xbox and ROG’s handheld PC which <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-handheld-rog-ally-x-price-preorder-2000629161">costs $1,000.</a> And it looks like the <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-valve-console-price-ps5-pro-2000643554">Steam Machine will possibly cost $800 to $1000</a> or more when it launches later this year.</p> <p>What does all of this mean for the PlayStation 6 and next Xbox? It means you probably need to start saving now if you want to afford one of these devices when they launch in the next 24 months or so. And maybe be prepared to go without one for a while, as it’s likely there will be shortages for a long time following either console’s future launch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 players aren't happy after EA and Battlefield Studios' changes to two of its most controversial cosmetics failed to live up to expectations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-update-to-alter-2-controversial-cosmetics-after-fans-accuse-ea-of-ai-generated-content-and-call-of-duty-ghosts-inspiration"><u>promises to address fan feedback</u></a> last week, the Battlefield community was quick to see how update 1.1.3.6 adjusted the Objective Ace skin and Winter Warning sticker when the patch went live this morning. The problem is the changes are almost too small to notice.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— DETONATED (@DETONATEDcom) <a href="https://twitter.com/DETONATEDcom/status/2018712937670627367?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 3, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s first take a look at Objective Ace. The skin drew criticism through Season 1 when players noticed it bore a striking resemblance to the Call of Duty: Ghosts logo, with both sharing even a few finer details, such as cracks and paint streaks. The Assault skin also caught flak related to the large white armor piece located on its chest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The updated version of the cosmetic received the more noticeable facelift of the two impacted, with its updated look now featuring new details and a slimmer design overall. Still, it’s not enough for the players who were expecting more significant changes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“[I] think the damage has already been done,” one <a href="https://x.com/BABYBLUBERRYZ/status/2018723941251256755?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>player commented</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Why did they copy COD in the first place?” <a href="https://x.com/Negan259/status/2018713351526748283?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>another added</u></a>.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">AI Sticker Before VS After Patch <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Battlefield6?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Battlefield6</a> <a href="https://t.co/Srfjhp7ZHj" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Srfjhp7ZHj</a></p>— Battlefield Intel (@BattlefieldInte) <a href="https://twitter.com/BattlefieldInte/status/2018666389972902043?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 3, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The Winter Warning sticker, on the other hand, was the center of controversy when players noticed details that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-fans-accuse-ea-of-selling-ai-generated-image-after-spotting-what-looks-like-an-m4a1-with-two-barrels"><u>suggested it may have been created using generative AI</u></a>. Battlefield 6 update 1.1.3.6 seems to have brought no change to its design, with its soldier finger placement and double-barreled M4A1 still plainly in view despite being two of the bigger talking points amongst fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s been cause for concern for those who feel EA and BF Studios may have misled fans. However, the developers have since <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/2018746377569013844?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stepped in</a> to say the timing relayed in last week’s patch notes, which promised to adjust Winter Warning with the February 3 update, was “incorrect.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The latest update notes communicated that a change would be made for the Winter Warning Player Card Sticker to bring it more in line with Battlefield’s visual identity,” a message shared today says. “This timing was incorrect. Winter Warning will be updated when Season 2 launches on February 17th.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s unclear what the new version of the sticker will look like when it launches with Season 2 in about two weeks. For now, players have taken to social media to call attention to both the delay and the relatively small changes to the cosmetics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Show what ur doing with it," one <a href="https://x.com/DANNYonPC/status/2018746669802692706?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fan suggested</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Stop using AI generated Art and cosmetics and we will trust this statement and future ones," <a href="https://x.com/LordVonTiger/status/2018747014855430637?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another added</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 saw <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-was-the-best-selling-console-of-2025-in-the-us-and-is-still-outpacing-the-nintendo-switch"><u>a strong start</u></a> when it released October 10, 2025, for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S but has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/losing-steam-3-months-after-launch-its-time-for-a-check-in-with-battlefield-6-and-its-community"><u>faced backlash in recent weeks</u></a> as players hope for fundamental changes to how BF Studios is handling post-launch content. The fallout from a disappointing end to Season 1 reached a boiling point in early January, with the team eventually announcing that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-season-2-delayed-to-february-as-ea-tackles-community-feedback-with-an-extended-season-1"><u>Season 2 had been delayed</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following an extended Season 1, Season 2 will launch February 17.

So it's wild that this week, out of nowhere, Adobe announced that they're basically killing it off by ending support for the program.</p><p>On a page morbidly-titled "<a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/animate/kb/end-of-life.html?ref=aftermath.site"><u>End of Life FAQ</u></a>", the company writes:</p><blockquote>Adobe Animate will no longer be available to download for new customers, beginning&nbsp;<strong>March 1, 2026.&nbsp;</strong>Enterprise customers can access the application, download their content, and receive technical support until&nbsp;<strong>March 1</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>2029</strong>.&nbsp;For all other customers, technical support, application access, and the ability to download content will be available until&nbsp;<strong>March 1</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>2027</strong>.&nbsp;</blockquote><p>This is not normal! Companies usually make this move when a product has become obsolete, not when it's <a href="https://aftermath.site/windows-11-nope/"><u>still in use</u></a> by millions of people (and tons of popular shows) around the world. And even then, if there was any kind of recognition or awareness for the community/industry making use of something the company no longer wants to invest in, a reasonable expectation would be that Adobe would open source the code.</p><p>But of course these are not normal times we're living in; Adobe isn't interested in its traditional business model anymore, because like most tech companies, it's<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/02/adobe-animate-is-shutting-down-as-company-focuses-on-ai/?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>more interested in cramming AI bullshit and subscription programs down our throats instead</u></a>.</p><p>Animation site Cartoon Brew<a href="https://www.cartoonbrew.com/tools/adobe-animate-software-sunset-258612.html?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>are able to put how disruptive this move is to studios and creators in context</u></a>, saying:</p><blockquote>Animate projects are not static assets. They are complex environments that integrate timelines, bespoke symbols, reusable libraries, scripts, export presets, and countless other factors, often built and refined over years or decades. Exporting files does not preserve that larger environment. This is more than just a case of going out and buying another wrench. The entire toolshed is being demolished.</blockquote><p>If you're a user and are now frantically looking for alternatives,<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DigitalArt/comments/1qu46y4/adobe_animate_alternative/?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>this Reddit thread has some good ones</u></a>.</p><p><strong>UPDATE 7:10pm</strong>: Following sustained user backlash Adobe has tonight <a href="https://community.adobe.com/announcements-539/update-on-the-status-of-adobe-animate-1548459?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">issued a second statement</a>, saying the initial announcement "did not meet our standards and caused a lot of confusion and angst within the community". In response, and contradicting the clear terms and dates laid out in the original post for the program's sunsetting, they now say that Animate is <em>not </em>being killed off, only that further work and support for the program will end. The full statement is below:</p><blockquote>Yesterday, Adobe shared an email with Adobe Animate customers on the future of Animate. What we shared did not meet our standards and caused a lot of confusion and angst within the community. On behalf of Adobe, I want to apologize.</blockquote><blockquote>While an email to all Animate customers will go out shortly, we&nbsp;wanted to quickly share a few things: 1) our standard approach for applications in maintenance mode, 2) changes to our plans for Adobe Animate and its status, and 3) our commitments to ensuring that you always have access to your content, regardless of the state of development of an application.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Standard Approach for Applications in Maintenance Mode</strong></blockquote><blockquote>If we deprioritize active development of an application, our approach is to move that application into maintenance mode with continued support. Under maintenance mode, the application will continue to be available, will continue to receive security and bug fixes, but will not get new features.</blockquote><blockquote>If we decide to go a step further and discontinue a product, we will work closely with the community to ensure they have adequate time to plan in order to minimize disruption and will take steps so that the community continues to have long-term access to their content.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Current State of Adobe Animate</strong></blockquote><blockquote>Adobe Animate is in maintenance mode. While we are no longer adding new features to Animate, we will continue to support it and provide ongoing security and bug fixes. More importantly,&nbsp;<strong><em>Animate will continue to be available for both new and existing users</em></strong>.&nbsp;<strong><em>This is a change</em></strong>&nbsp;from what we communicated in the email yesterday for the status of Adobe Animate, its time-frame, and availability.</blockquote><blockquote>To be clear,&nbsp;<strong><em>we are not discontinuing or removing access to Adobe Animate and it will continue to be available to both existing and new customers</em></strong>.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Commitments for long-term content/file access</strong></blockquote><blockquote>For Adobe Animate, our commitment is to work with the community to ensure users continue to have long-term access to their content, regardless of the state of development of the application.</blockquote><p><strong>BONUS</strong>: Here's Mike Chambers, part of Adobe's community team, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adobeanimate/comments/1qv5yju/updates_on_the_status_of_adobe_animate/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">on Reddit earlier tonight</a>:</p><figure></figure>

            <p>
I have a strange affinity for brutalism. It sucks you in, engulfs you in its stature, kills your spirit in such blunt, obvious ways, that I can't help but be wowed by in all its oppressiveness. As an architectural styling, it is also supremely opportune for sick parkour tricks, something Léonard Lemaitre (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/babbdi">Babbdi</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/straftat">Straftat</a>), Nathan Grange and Niels Tiercelin all deeply understand with the volumetric VHOLUME, a "first-person parkour adventure set in a dystopian brutalist city where bureaucracy turns a simple task into an odyssey," which now has a demo.
</p>
<p>
The demo isn't a massive one, so there's not all that much I can say about its supposed story ("In the derelict capital of Afro-Eurasia, ruled by an all-controlling Ministry, Robert embarks on a bureaucratic quest to restore his family’s revoked ration tickets" sounds juicy and suitable for the setting), but what is there is more than enough to get a strong feel for its "movement-centric gameplay."
</p>
<p>
As previously noted by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mirrors-edge-players-with-a-taste-for-brutalism-should-bookmark-vholume-the-new-parkour-game-from-a-babbdi-dev">news overlord Edwin</a>, there is an obvious Mirror's Edgeness to the game given that it is sort of the gold standard for parkour games. I would probably describe VHOLUME as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mirrors-edge">Mirror's Edge</a> Lite, not because it's watered down or worse, just simplified. All you can do is run, jump, and slide, all three of which can be mixed and matched into wall running, clamournig up walls, and gaining such a great whoosh of speed as to feel dizzy.
</p>
<p>
Simple the inputs may be, but the complexity is there. The brutalist setting works incredibly well for route devising, as every single wall surface you can see can be run across. There are obvious main paths to take in the pair of levels present in the demo, and there are a plethora of shortcuts for you to figure out for yourself (some of which I wouldn't advise as I did find a couple of sealings that I fell partially through).
</p><p>
It is a game very obviously prepped for speedrunning - you can race against the ghosts of others who have played the game, some of whom already seem too good for me to feel proud of my times. There is an oldschool quality to it in this sense, and it works wonders to push you to pull off risky maneuvers. Games like this live and die by their movement tech, and I think this one has the potential to live a thousand lives. I will gladly wait for its inevitable appearance at GDQ.
</p>
<p>
You can wishlist VHOLUME and try out the demo for yourself right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4131730/VHOLUME/">here</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[GTA 6 Doesn’t Mean The End Of GTA Online: ‘We’ll Continue To Support It’]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/gta-6-gta-online-support-2027-november-post-launch-take-two-ceo-strauss-2000665489</link>
            <guid>1424722</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>During today’s Take-Two Interactive quarterly financial call, the CEO of Rockstar’s parent company was asked about the future of <em>Grand Theft Auto Online</em> after the release of <em>G<a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-still-confirmed-for-november-with-summer-marketing-blitz-planned-2000665452">rand Theft Auto 6</a> </em>in November. And he seemed pretty confident that the popular multiplayer game would keep receiving updates into 2027.</p> <p><em>GTA Online</em> first launched all the way back in October 2013 on Xbox 360 and PS3. It has since received hundreds of updates and expansions and been ported to many other consoles, where it continues to be incredibly popular and makes Take-Two a lot of money. So it’s not surprising that Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick confirmed the gravy train isn’t likely to shut down after <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-multiplayer-one-detail-leak-court-docs-player-count-32-rockstar-2000659780"><em>GTA 6</em>‘s multiplayer mode arrives,</a> presumably, later this year.</p>

 <p><span>“Look, Rockstar Games is the locus of information about, you know, where the titles go content and marketing, and generally, we have a pretty light touch when we talk about the label’s creative activities,” said Zelnick during Tuesday’s earnings call. </span><span>“At the same time, I have every reason to believe we’ll continue to support </span><i><span>GTA Online. </span></i><span>There’s a great community that loves it, that stays engaged. And again in this quarter, Rockstar has shown that when you deliver great additional content, despite how long [</span><i><span>GTA Online</span></i><span>] has been at market, people show up.”</span></p> <p>Back in 2025, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-its-shown-a-willingness-to-support-legacy-titles-amid-questions-about-the-future-of-gta-online-post-gta-6">Zelnick told <em>IGN</em></a> that Take-Two supports games as long as people are still playing them.</p>

 <p>“As an example, we launched <em>NBA 2K Online</em> in China, I think originally in 2012, if I’m not mistaken,” Zelnick told the outlet last year. “And then we launched <em>NBA 2K Online 2</em> in China in 2017. If I’m not mistaken. We did not sunset <em>Online 1</em>. They both are still in the market, and they serve consumers, and they’re alive, and we have this massive audience. So we’ve shown a willingness to support legacy titles when a community wants to be engaged with them.”</p>

 <p>That last part is key. Take-Two and Rockstar Games are more than happy to keep making content and updating old games, as long as there are enough people playing those games and spending money in them to financially justify it. And, at least for now, <em>GTA Online</em> definitely seems to qualify; <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/032e3067-32cd-4c82-b4dd-2bd20a153a6a">it saw a 27-percent increase in consumer spending last quarter</a>, according to Take-Two. When you have a money-printing machine, well, it’s hard to convince anybody to turn it off.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Cyberpunk 2 Director Explains Why First-Person Was Perfect For The Original RPG: ‘You’re A Mind Trapped In A Decaying Body’]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-first-person-geralt-witcher-2000665486</link>
            <guid>1424719</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>When </span><i><span>Cyberpunk 2077</span></i><span>’s first-person perspective was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-is-a-first-person-rpg-1826775323"><span>revealed</span></a><span> back in 2018, quite a few fans were worried. For CD Projekt Red enthusiasts who were used to staring at the back of Geralt’s gorgeous little ponytail all day in </span><i><span>The Witcher 3</span></i><span> and for others who just wanted to be able to see their painstaking customizations of protagonist V, the decision sparked its fair share of skepticism. However, it ended up working out pretty well, and now one of the game’s leads has taken to social media to explain why.</span></p> <p><span>On Sunday, Igor Sarzyński, who worked as </span><i><span>Cyberpunk 2077’s</span></i><span> Cinematic Director before being bumped up to Creative Director for </span><i><span>Cyberpunk 2</span></i><span>, elaborated on the team’s decision to use a first-person perspective in </span><i><span>2077 </span></i><span>via </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/srznsk.bsky.social/post/3mdsstc5lpk22"><span>a thread on Bluesky</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Purely from narrative design pov I think subjective FPP [first-person perspective] works well with ‘</span><i><span>77</span></i><span> story, genre and world. You’re a mind trapped in a decaying body with only means of leaving it being through technological consciousness processing,” he wrote (thanks, </span><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/cyberpunk/cyberpunk-2-lead-says-first-person-pov-was-better-for-cyberpunk-2077-as-third-person-is-for-more-defined-characters-like-the-witcher-3s-geralt-and-god-of-wars-kratos/"><i><span>Games Radar</span></i></a><span>).</span></p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:nkkdls4c67lfagg735y7ywpq/app.bsky.feed.post/3mdsstc5lpk22" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreidsrjfslaek5rghf5w24nehi35lxqnu22rim5xbxljyb7blmba3na"> <p lang="en">Purely from narrative design pov I think subjective FPP works well with '77 story, genre and world.

Third-person perspective, he feels, “is better for more defined characters – Geralt, Kratos, Ellie – where you play-replay someone else’s story. FPP lends itself to more avatar-like player characters. V exists somewhere in the middle of this spectrum but for reasons stated above ^ i feel FPP was better for </span><i><span>‘77</span></i><span>.”</span></p>

 <p><span>He also added that the camera lets the game’s visions of “digital ghost” Johnny Silverhand, which he described as a “thing existing only in your subjective perception – rather than both of you being seen equally by an external, objective TPP cam,” feel more immersive.</span></p>

 <p><span>Sarzyński clarified that his comments aren’t meant as a hint at the perspective that will be used in </span><i><span>Cyberpunk 2</span></i><span>, or anything else about the game for that matter. “It might be a play-doh stop-motion RTS for all we know,” he joked. It’ll likely be a long time until we hear more news about </span><i><span>Cyberpunk 2</span></i><span>, but I’m just happy to hear from one of its leads. It’s always neat to hear about the thinking behind a design decision, especially at a massive studio that could, if it wanted to, be a lot more cagey about its development process.</span></p> <p><i><span>Cyberpunk 2077’s</span></i><span> sequel is still a ways away, but we do know that it’ll be </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-orion-night-new-city-chicago-cdpr-1851781566"><span>set in Night City once again</span></a><span>, alongside a second city that’s “like Chicago gone wrong.” CD Projekt Red also apparently began </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2-online-multiplayer-witcher-4-sequel-cdpr-2000627198"><span>toying</span></a><span> with some form of online multiplayer for the game shortly after it </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2-release-date-witcher-4-rpg-cdpr-1851782750"><span>moved into pre-production</span></a><span> last year, but it’s unclear if that’ll even be implemented.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Grand Theft Auto VI's November 19, 2026 release date is drawing nearer. And while the game has now suffered multiple delays, Take-Two Interactive is starting to sound more confident than we've ever heard them that this time, it's really happening. So confident, in fact, it's announced that Rockstar will be spinning up its marketing beats this summer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from Take-Two's Q3 2026 earnings results, which were just released. In those earnings, Take-Two reaffirms that GTA 6 is indeed still planned for November 19, 2026. That on its own would be exciting news after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-may-2026">two</a> separate <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-is-delayed-again-until-november-2026">delays</a>, but even better is a sentence at the bottom of the release sent to IGN. "Our execution throughout Fiscal 2026 has been extraordinary and we are highly confident as we approach Fiscal 2027 – which promises to be groundbreaking for Take-Two and the entire entertainment industry – led by the November 19th release of Grand Theft Auto VI with Rockstar’s launch marketing set to begin this Summer. "</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That's sounding pretty confident, to me! Speaking to Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick earlier today, I asked him how he felt about the release date at this time, to which he replied, "I feel good about it. Very good about it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, we've asked Zelnick this before, and he said he felt "<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-still-set-for-fall-2025-take-two-ceo-insists-we-feel-really-good-about-it">really good</a>" about the fall 2025 release date that was originally announced, ahead of two delays. So I asked him if this time was different in some way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Of course," he said. "Because any time you're getting closer to marketing beats, you're obviously in a place where your confidence level is as high as it can be."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GTA 6 is one of the most anticipated games of all time, with many already suggesting it as a potential Game of the Year contender despite us not having seen any gameplay footage of it yet, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/increasingly-convincing-ai-generated-gta-6-gameplay-leaks-are-getting-millions-of-views-on-social-media">leaks and AI fakes</a> going viral all over social media late last year, and its delays having <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/could-the-gta-6-delay-also-delay-next-gen-consoles">potential industry-shaking impacts</a>. So far, we've seen two cinematic trailers for the game, which have shown the dual protagonists Duval and Lucia Caminos, and the setting of Leonida, Florida, including the infamous Vice City.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Even without GTA 6, GTA as a franchise had a great quarter. It "vastly outpaced" Take-Two's forecasts, with GTA+ membership levels nearly doubling year-over-year. We asked Zelnick for insight as to the cause of GTA 5's excellent quarter, and he pointed to the Safehouse in the Hills update for GTA Online doing especially well. GTA 5 has now sold over 225 million units.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, Take-Two brought in net bookings of $1.76 billion for the quarter. The company is raising its expectations in light of a better-than-expected quarter on multiple fronts, with total annual net bookings expected to range between $6.65 billion to $6.7 billion, representing around 18% growth year over year. Take-Two expects that nearly half of its full-year earnings, which it will report next quarter, will come from its mobile business, Zynga.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A strange rumor that popped up online last month claimed that, to avoid early leaks, Rockstar Games and Take-Two Interactive were going to delay the physical release of <em>Grand Theft Auto 6 </em>and the game would only launch digitally. That’s not the case.</p> <p>On February 3, as part of Take-Two’s Q3 fiscal results, the company’s longtime CEO Strauss Zelnick <a href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/borderlands-4-switch-release-paused-take-two-ceo-gta-online-1236651227/">told <em>Variety</em></a> bluntly that the online rumors swirling around <em>GTA 6</em>‘s physical launch were nothing to worry about.</p> <p>“That’s not the plan,” Zelnick told the outlet.</p> <p><a href="https://www.ppe.pl/news/397290/gta-6-a-wersja-pudelkowa-sprzedawcy-zwiastuja-smutna-wiadomosc-dla-fanow-fizycznych-wydan.html">This odd rumor popped up in January</a> after a Polish site reported that a Rockstar insider had heard that <em>GTA 6′</em>s physical and digital releases could be split up. Once the rumor popped up in January, it quickly spread and was reported by sites like <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/gta-6s-physical-release-could-be-delayed-to-2027-because-of-leaks-3309757/"><em>Dexerto</em></a> and was posted across places like Reddit, Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook. Here is the original, now debunked, claim:</p>

 <blockquote><p>“We are getting more and more information that the box version will not be released simultaneously with the digital version to prevent leaks.”</p></blockquote> <p>However, <em>Kotaku</em> was unable to verify the rumor with any of its sources. And to be honest, it always seemed odd, especially when you consider digital games have leaked via pre-loads. In fact, that happened with <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/634490-grand-theft-auto-v/67072105"><em>GTA V</em> over a decade ago</a>. And now that Zelnick has weighed in officially to call the rumor false, hopefully that’s the end of it. Now, <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-trailer-breakdown-secrets-spf-sunscreen-reddit-1851144759">GTA</a></em> fans can go back to figuring out the SPF rating of an NPC’s sunscreen via wild math and trailer screenshots.</p> <p><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> launches November 19 for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-still-confirmed-for-november-with-summer-marketing-blitz-planned-2000665452">Take-Two has confirmed that marketing for the game will begin sometime in the summer</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-switch-2-release-date-canceled-2000665470</link>
            <guid>1424674</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-the-kotaku-review-bugs-pc-performance-ending-gearbox-ps5-2000627149"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> was supposed to be one of the Nintendo Switch 2’s big fall 2025 releases but was indefinitely delayed amid a race to address performance issues for the PC version. Many fans hoped it might end up launching in early 2026 instead, but the Switch 2 port of <em>Borderlands 4</em> is now officially being paused.</p> <p>“We made the difficult decision to pause development on that SKU,” Take-Two spokesperson Alan Lewis <a href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/borderlands-4-switch-release-paused-take-two-ceo-gta-online-1236651227/">told&nbsp;<em>Variety </em></a>on Thursday. “Our focus continues to be delivering quality post-launch content for players on the ongoing improvements to optimize the game. We’re continuing to collaborate closely with our friends at Nintendo. We have <em>PGA Tour 2K25</em> coming out and <em>WWE 2K26</em> [for Switch 2], and we’re incredibly excited about bringing more of our titles to that platform in the future.”</p>

 <p>What’s especially odd about the last-minute reversal is that<em> Borderlands 4</em> was already publicly demoed running on Switch 2 last summer at shows like PAX West. Assessments varied, with some players saying it looked surprisingly good while <a href="https://twitter.com/EpicNNG/status/1958920625600569844?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1958920625600569844%7Ctwgr%5Ef902f1abb49199769f6600e5bad50cb760a1d61f%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thegamer.com%2Fborderlands-4-performance-issues-nintendo-switch-2%2F">others said</a> it suffered from surprising performance hang-ups, even when docked.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Okay I’ll just put it bluntly:</p> <p>Borderlands 4 on the Switch 2 could barely run at 30fps with 4 enemies on screen in docked mode. It had horrendous input delay, and the render resolution was seemingly turned all the way down.</p> <p>I’ll talk more about it in a video maybe tomorrow 😬</p> <p>— EpicNNG (@EpicNNG) <a href="https://twitter.com/EpicNNG/status/1958920625600569844?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“We need to share that the release of<em>&nbsp;Borderlands 4</em> on Nintendo Switch 2 is being delayed,” the studio wrote <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-switch-2-delay-cross-save-performance-2000628055">in a surprise announcement</a> last September less than two weeks before it was set to launch. “We do not take this decision lightly, but are committed to ensuring we deliver the best possible experience to our fans, and the game needs additional development and polish time to do that.”</p>

 <p>Gearbox Entertainment recently <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-2026-road-map-updates-cross-save-new-loot-dlc-level-cap-increase-2000664254">doubled down on big plans for the looter shooter’s 2026 content roadmap</a>. That includes a new rarity of gear, raising the level cap, and fresh story content in paid DLC packs. The roadmap even called out the addition of a new photo mode. The Switch 2 port, on the other hand, was conspicuously absent. Publisher 2K Games has yet to reveal how many copies the latest sequel has sold.</p>

 <p><em>Borderlands 4</em>‘s absence from the Switch 2 will be a bummer for fans hoping they’d eventually be able to jump in, but it’s not the only port that players have been patiently waiting on. <em>Elden Ring</em> was also announced for Nintendo’s new console last year and also remains MIA. Demos last summer suggested it was having framerate issues as well. Other heavy hitters like <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> and <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em> have performed well enough though.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[More Grand Theft Auto VI “Marketing Beats” Coming in Summer 2026, While GTA V Has Sold Over 225M Copies]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/more-grand-theft-auto-vi-marketing-beats-coming-in-summer-2026-while-gta-v-has-sold-over-225m-copies/</link>
            <guid>1424632</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Take-Two Interactive's</strong> <a href="https://www.take2games.com/ir/quarterly-earnings">third-quarter financial results have been published</a>, which means there's plenty of information to glean from the company behind <strong>2K</strong> and <strong>Rockstar's</strong> latest numbers. What everyone wants to hear about, though, is <strong>Grand Theft Auto VI</strong>, which may just be the most anticipated video game ever, and in the meantime, <strong>GTA V</strong> has hit yet another astronomical sales milestone.</p>



<p>While Take-Two's chief executive officer, <strong>Strauss Zelnick</strong>, didn't get too deep into what's coming for <strong>GTA VI</strong>, he did confirm in an interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/take-two-ceo-googles-project-genie">The Game Business</a> and during the call with investors that we can expect more "<em>marketing beats</em>" for the game during <strong>Summer 2026</strong>. He also reaffirmed the game's release date, which is, as of the time of this writing, still set to be <strong>November 19, 2026</strong>.</p>



<p>"<em>We feel great about it</em>," Zelnick told The Game Business. He added, "<em>You know me pretty well, for me to even say we've got marketing beats coming this summer, is a huge departure from what I usually say, which is that our labels will make marketing announcements</em>."</p>



<p>Last month, on GTA VI's release date, we heard that its <a href="https://wccftech.com/although-not-content-complete-yet-fall-2026-is-a-more-real-release-window-than-fall-2025-for-grand-theft-auto-vi/">November date is a "<em>more real</em>" release window than its previous 2025 date</a>. Before that, Zelnick said <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-ceo-very-high-conviction-grand-theft-auto-vi-wont-be-delayed-again-rockstar/">his confidence level that the game would not be delayed was <strong>"<em>very, very high</em>."</strong></a> Everything Take-Two is projecting in this report supports that it will indeed be launching this coming November. Hopefully, that's still the case the closer we get to the date, though a lot can always change in the coming months. </p>



<p>Regarding GTA V's new sales milestone, Take-Two reports that the game has sold an astounding <strong>225 million copies</strong> over the last decade plus. It adds that the <strong>Grand Theft Auto</strong> series has, overall, sold a whopping <strong>465 million copies</strong> in its lifetime, which means that on its own, GTA V accounts for almost half of all copies of a Grand Theft Auto game that have been sold since the series launched in 1997.</p>



<p>Overall, Take-Two reported <strong>$1.76 billion</strong> in net bookings, well above its projected $1.6 billion for its third quarter, with Grand Theft Auto contributing its fair share to the increase in revenue. <strong>GTA Online,</strong> for its part, saw a <strong>27% increase</strong> in revenue.</p>



<p>While everything is coming up roses in Take-Two's financials, its subsidiary and Grand Theft Auto VI developer, Rockstar, continues to be under pressure from unions over the firing of <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/uk-prime-minister-keir-starmer-calls-grand-theft-auto-vi-developers-allege-union-busting-deeply-concerning/">31 workers in the UK</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/cwa-canada-toronto-game-developers-protest-at-rockstar-toronto-in-solidarity-with-fired-workers/">three workers in Canada</a></strong>. Rockstar continues to claim that these workers were leaking confidential information, while the IWGB union representing the fired workers continues to refute those claims and accuses Rockstar of union-busting.</p>



<p>The most recent update in that case was <a href="https://wccftech.com/uk-judge-denies-fired-rockstar-employees-interim-pay-iwgb/">a UK judge denying the fired workers' interim pay</a>, though the case itself is far from over.</p>

            <p>
It's undeniable that for throwback 3D retro aesthetics, the original PlayStation and Nintendo 64 are the consoles that most people try to emulate. So I'm always quite chuffed to see a game that takes its visual cues from more recent consoles, like, say, Bel's Fanfare, a very 3DS-era looking Zelda-esque game where you play as a little demon girl who works as a cleaner on a strange, massive ship.
</p>
<p>
Armed with nought but a funny-looking shield, Bel is specifically tasked with aura cleaning, aura being a mysterious substance that comes from impurities of the soul, i.e. globs of glowy stuff that comes out when people get anxious, or sad, or traumatised. She has to go around cleaning different rooms on the ship, all inhabited by "otherworldly beings," and in turn she has to help them deal with their problem.

<p>
Bel's Fanfare very much inspired by early 3D Zelda games, the devs say as much on the game's <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/chibig/bels-fanfare/description">Kickstarter page</a> - by the way, it's on Kickstarter, and already funded - though to me it's look is particularly reminiscent of the 3DS Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask remasters. Combat wise, you do more blocking than attacking, which I find to be a neat twist on the genre (the genre being "Zelda-inspired RPG"), absorbing aura with it in bullet hell battle rooms, this part seemingly drawing inspiration from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/undertale">Undertale</a>.
</p><p>
The environments are all quite varied and charming, you can gossip with the game's cast of characters, you can set people up on dates and catch fish, and "???" whatever that might be. I'll certainly be quite curious to check out the full thing whenever it launches, but in the meantime, you could join me in wishlisting it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4317460/Bels_Fanfare/">Steam</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>In 2015, </span><i><span>Gawker </span></i><span>published an article titled “</span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150124104133/https://gawker.com/here-is-pedophile-billionaire-jeffrey-epsteins-little-b-1681383992"><span>Here Is Pedophile Billionaire Jeffrey Epstein’s Little Black Book</span></a><span>.” It included a link to a redacted copy of Epstein’s alleged address book listing contact info for a range of famous, wealthy, and powerful people. One of them was <a href="https://kotaku.com/activision-blizzard-ceo-bobby-kotick-halves-pay-still-1846789618">then-Activision-Blizzard-CEO Bobby Kotick</a> who ran the publisher behind industry-defining hits like<em> Call of Duty</em> and <em>World of Warcraft</em>. The latest trove of Epstein files released by the Justice Department last week shows more than a dozen emails allegedly exchanged between the two men.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Several emails dating from November 2012 show Epstein trying to set up an alleged dinner with Kotick while the latter was visiting New York. Epstein had asked the gaming executive if he’d be willing to come a day early when the actor and director Woody Allen would be available, but one of the emails shows Kotick writing back to say that wasn’t possible.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Epstein’s itinerary for that month listed a dinner with Bobby Kotick on November 18, 2012. “bobby Kotick came over last night„ hes great,” Epstein wrote to Next Model Management co-founder Faith Kates on November 19, 2012. Kates unexpectedly retired last month after her name surfaced </span><a href="https://pagesix.com/2025/12/01/society/next-model-management-co-founder-faith-kates-retires-after-jeffrey-epstein-e-mails-resurface/"><span>in a previously reported</span></a><span> batch of Epstein emails.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>A representative for Epstein proceeded to send information about his private island in the Caribbean, Little St. James, to Kotick on November 21, 2012. In a follow-up exchange on December 9, 2012, Epstein asked Kotick how the Caribbean was. Kotick allegedly wrote back, “Great, wished would could have stopped by the island.”</span></p> <p><span>Emails between the two were allegedly exchanged multiple times in 2013 as well. A February 24, 2013 email stated that Epstein was in LA planning a visit to SpaceX that week and was trying to link up with Kotick while in town. “Thanks , but rather see you,” Epstein wrote in one email. “Taking girls after to bel air.” Kotick at one point allegedly wrote back, “Come with your friends to my house at…Bev Hills, 10 min=tes from Bel Air.”</span></p> <p><span>Several emails also show Epstein trying to arrange a tour of Activision. The company did not respond to a request for comment.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Epstein again tried to arrange a meeting with Kotick at the end of April 2013. “great… see you then i will bring 3or 4 . also I understand that Brian Grazer, like me ,searches for smart interesting people„ do you know him?” Epstein emailed Kotick on April 29, 2013. “Yes I do,” Kotick allegedly wrote back. A follow-up email from Kotick was allegedly sent later that day. “Can we meet at 6? I am running late,” it read.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The two allegedly exchanged more emails the following day. “great house, great art, i am in ny 1-6 if you have time when you come,” Epstein wrote to Kotick on April 30, 2012. “Thanks. Great guests,” Kotick allegedly wrote back.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Rockstar’s parent company, Take-Two Interactive, reconfirmed that <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> is set to launch this November during its quarterly earnings report and conference. Take-Two’s CEO even revealed that marketing for the long-awaited crime sim will start this summer.</p> <p>On Tuesday, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-marketing-will-kick-off-this-summer-as-take-two-confidently-reaffirms-november-release-date?utm_source=bluesky,threads,twitter">as spotted in a press release about Take-Two’s Q3 2026 earnings results by <em>IGN</em></a>, the company confirmed that it plans to start marketing <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> sometime in the summer, which seems to indicate that the game, which has been delayed a few times now, is actually (for real) getting close to launching later this year.</p>

 <p>“I feel good about it. Very good about it,” said Zelnick when asked by the outlet how he felt about <em>GTA 6</em>‘s November 19 release. “Of course, because any time you’re getting closer to marketing beats, you’re obviously in a place where your confidence level is as high as it can be.”</p> <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/take-two-ceo-googles-project-genie">Zelnick told newsletter <em>The Game Business</em></a>&nbsp;this when asked about the confirmation that<em> GTA 6</em>‘s marketing blitz was just a few months away: “You know me pretty well, for me to even say we’ve got marketing beats coming this summer is a huge departure from what I usually say, which is that our labels will make marketing announcements.”</p>

 <p>In an earnings call later in the day, Zelnick was asked how much marketing a game like GTA 6 even needs. He assured investors that Take-Two and Rockstar weren’t going to “sit back and relax.”</p> <p>“I think the opposite is true,” said Zelnick. “We are in the business of eating red meat for breakfast. I think we’ll be having a lot more red meat in the coming months. We are very fortunate that the consumer anticipation for <em>GTA 6</em> is huge. And one does have to be judicious with how one markets such an extraordinary product. Rest assured, I think you’ll be pretty astonished by the creativity that Rockstar’s marketing team brings to consumers in the coming months.”</p>

 <p>Normally, Take-Two doesn’t provide details like this, opting to let Rockstar provide those details later, so this is a good sign that <em>GTA 6</em>‘s development is on track. You don’t start committing to expensive marketing plans and telling the press about them unless everyone involved is very confident in the game’s development status. And yes, <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-release-date-delay-borderlands-4-fall-2025-1851757501">in the past, Zelnick has told investors and the public he felt good about <em>GTA 6</em>‘s release date</a>, and then it was delayed. <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-delay-strauss-zelnick-ceo-take-two-interview-rockstar-games-2000617237">But in those cases</a>, he and Take-Two hadn’t committed to a marketing timeframe like this before. And while things can always change, at least for now it seems <em>GTA 6</em> is finally, for real, actually launching as planned on November 19.</p> <p><b>Update: 2/3/26, 5:35 p.m. ET: </b>Added quote from Zelnick about <em>GTA 6</em> marketing.</p>

<p>The Grand Theft Auto 6 (GTA 6) marketing train is getting ready to get into full gear. </p>



<p>As part of the company’s <a href="https://www.take2games.com/ir" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">quarterly earnings report</a> on Tuesday, Take-Two Interactive confirmed that marketing for GTA 6 will begin this summer. </p>







<p>On top of that, CEO Strauss Zelnick address concerns about a lack of a physical version of the game when it launches in the fall. </p>



<p>In speaking with Variety, Zelnick was asked about the claims that Take-Two Interactive was going to withhold from a physical release of GTA 6 until 2027 in order to prevent leaks before launch. To that notion, Zelnick bluntly said that it was<strong> “not the plan”.</strong></p>







<p>GTA 6 is scheduled to launch for Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5 on November 19, 2026. Take-Two <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-release-date-earnings-call/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reaffirmed the release date</a> as part of the same earnings report. </p>
