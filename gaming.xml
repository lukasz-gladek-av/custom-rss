		<p>Given that the game has recently been delayed no one was expecting <del>the Spanish Inquisition</del> a second official Grand Theft Auto VI trailer, but here it is!</p>
<p><iframe title="Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VQRLujxTm3c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Grand Theft Auto VI takes us all back to Vice City for another crime story. The announcement trailer introduced us to Lucia, the series’ first female protagonist, and an unnamed male counterpart. Lucia seemingly starts off the game getting out of prison after a bit of “bad luck”.</p>
<p>The new trailer names that male counterpart, he’s called Jason, and seems to be working as a handyman. After that its exactly what you would expect from a GTA game: Car chases, gun fights, boats, planes, and a bit of sexy stuff on the side. It’s all sound tracked by the brilliant “Hot Together” by the Pointer Sisters, a nod to the relationship between Jason and Lucia.</p>
<p>Rockstar has announced the release date for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gta-6">Grand Theft Auto VI</a>, but the game won’t be coming out in 2025. Instead GTA 6 will launch on 26th May 2026.</p>

<p>The statement on <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/258aa538o412ok/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-now-coming-may-26-2026">the Rockstar site</a> reads:</p>
<p>:Grand Theft Auto VI is now set to release on May 26, 2026. We are very sorry that this is later than you expected. The interest and excitement surrounding a new Grand Theft Auto has been truly humbling for our entire team. We want to thank<br>
you for your support and your patience as we work to finish the game.</p>
<p>With every game we have released, the goal has always been to try and exceed your expectations, and Grand Theft Auto VI is no exception. We hope you understand that we need this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and<br>
deserve.</p>
<p>We look forward to sharing more information with you soon.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br>
Rockstar Games</p>
<p>This is both good and bad news for the rest of the games industry. Many companies were looking at late 2025 with trepidation, given that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/17/gta-6-targets-late-2025-release-date-as-take-two-narrows-launch-window/">Take Two had constantly been stating that GTA 6 was on target for this year</a>, so even big budget games like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/05/the-next-battlefield-is-set-to-release-before-april-2026/">the next Battlefield were being tentatively given a movable release window</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, that might have given developers the sense that they could easily slip back to 2026 if they needed the time, and there will suddenly be pressure to try and push for a 2025 release instead. Thankfully, with GTA 6 not coming until May 2025, there’s still a good window from late February through to early April 2026 that could still look like a good launch window for a game.</p>

			<p>Rockstar Games has just dropped the second Grand Theft Auto VI trailer. This one is heavily centered on Jason Duval, whereas the <a href="https://wccftech.com/watch-the-first-gta-6-trailer-live-trailer-now-available/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first trailer from December 2023</a> was arguably focused more on Lucia Caminos. We see her again, too, and it's clear the two are very much meant to be GTA's version of Bonnie and Clyde - two robbers very much in love. As for the rest, it's classic GTA to its finest - car chases, explosions, and larger-than-life characters briefly introduced to the fans.</p>
<p>The brief YouTube description of the video says:</p>
<p><em>Vice City, USA.</em></p>
<p><em>Jason and Lucia have always known the deck is stacked against them. But when an easy score goes wrong, they find themselves on the darkest side of the sunniest place in America, in the middle of a conspiracy stretching across the state of Leonida — forced to rely on each other more than ever if they want to make it out alive.</em></p>

<p>Rockstar Games has also launched the <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/VI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official Grand Theft Auto VI website</a>, which has already crashed due to excessive load. Thankfully, the developer also sent the press a copy of the first details on the game's characters and locations, as well as a boatload of new images.</p>

<p><em>Jason wants an easy life, but things just keep getting harder. </em><em>Jason grew up around grifters and crooks. After a stint in the Army trying to shake off his troubled teens, he found himself in the Keys doing what he knows best, working for local drug runners. It might be time to try something new. Meeting Lucia could be the best or worst thing to ever happen to him. Jason knows how he'd like it to turn out, but right now, it's hard to tell.</em></p>
<p><em>Lucia’s father taught her to fight as soon as she could walk. Life has been coming at her swinging ever since. Fighting for her family landed her in the Leonida Penitentiary. Sheer luck got her out. Lucia’s learned her lesson — only smart moves from here.</em></p>
<p><em>More than anything, Lucia wants the good life her mom has dreamed of since their days in Liberty City — but instead of half-baked fantasies, Lucia is prepared to take matters into her own hands. A life with Jason could be her way out. Fresh out of prison and ready to change the odds in her favor, Lucia’s committed to her plan — no matter what it takes.</em></p>

<p>Vice City is described as offering something different in each neighborhood: Ocean Beach, Little Cuba, Tisha-Wocka, and VC Port. There's also the tropical archipelago of Leonida Keys, the 'primordial expanse' of the Grassrivers, the forgotten coast of Port Gellhorn, the industrial area of Ambrosia, and the wild country of Mount Kalaga.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the game was just <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delayed</a> to May 26, 2026. We still have a year and 20 days of wait left.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/second-grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-released-following-delay.1182084/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/second-grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rockstar has released a second&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI&nbsp;</em>trailer just a few days after announcing that the game would, in fact, no longer make its intended release window of fall 2025.</p>

<p>Last week, Rockstar announced that&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI&nbsp;</em>will be launching on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-vi-release-date-delay" rel="nofollow">on May 26th next year</a>, acknowledging that the date is "later than [fans] expected" but reaffirming its desire to "try and exceed [players'] expectations" with the game.</p>

<p>Now, the developer has released a brand new&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI&nbsp;</em>trailer in which we get a closer look at the lives of protagonists Jason and Lucia, although the trailer still doesn't contain any actual "on-the-ground" gameplay, so to speak.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-2-lucia-jason.jpg?itok=jbwGECVF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-2-lucia-jason.jpg?itok=lZTJt_Bt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A new&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI&nbsp;</em>trailer is here, but it doesn't say much about the game's gameplay.</figcaption></figure><p>In the trailer, we're reacquainted with our two main characters, both of whom were first introduced as part of the original&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto&nbsp;</em><em>VI&nbsp;</em>trailer all the way back in December 2023 (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-released-early-following-leak-coming-in-2025" rel="nofollow">yes, it really has been that long</a>).</p>

<p>At the outset of the trailer, we see Lucia getting out of prison, with Jason at the gates to greet her. What follows is a fairly typical montage of&nbsp;<em>GTA</em>-style debauchery, with heists, partying, and over-the-top action setpieces all playing out against a backdrop of 80s music.</p>

<p>Over the course of the trailer, we hear Zenglen's "Child Support", Wang Chung's "Everybody Have Fun Tonight", Tammy Wynette's "Talkin' to Myself Again", and the Pointer Sisters' "Hot Together", all of which will presumably be on&nbsp;<em>GTA VI</em>'s soundtrack alongside Tom Petty's "Love Is a Long Road" from the debut trailer.</p>




<p>We also get to meet a number of the characters who will populate&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em>'s fictional state of Leonida, and it looks like everyone's favorite gun-toting maniac Phil Cassidy will be making a return from his&nbsp;<em>GTA: Vice City&nbsp;</em>glory days, too.</p>

<p><em>Grand Theft Auto VI&nbsp;</em>launches for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S on May 26th, 2026. You can find lots more info about the game, including details about its characters and story, <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/VI" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">via the official website</a>.</p>

Simply not showing footage gets the entire industry talking. So, it’s something of a (fantastic) surprise that a brand new trailer should appear in the wake of the game’s delay into next year.</p><p>Originally intended to release this fall, with multiple games changing their launch plans to try to avoid it, Rockstar said the game needs another six months development time to be up to the standard it wants. Hence, the new release date of May 26, 2026.</p><p>Those who were disappointed, or even worried about the state of the game, should have their mind put slightly at ease by the new trailer. It’s definitively a <em>GTA </em>game, with no big surprises or twists, but rather a bunch of Miami-like vibes and a lot of butts.</p><p>The return to Vice City looks stunning, although it’s not entirely clear from the trailer what’s in-game and what’s cutscene, albeit that it’ll all be made in the same engine.</p><p>The official description for the new trailer reads,</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Jason and Lucia have always known the deck is stacked against them. But when an easy score goes wrong, they find themselves on the darkest side of the sunniest place in America, in the middle of a conspiracy stretching across the state of Leonida—forced to rely on each other more than ever if they want to make it out alive.</p></blockquote><p>Don’t expect to see any more of the game for a good long while now. Rockstar will likely go back into its bunker and get on with completing the game, not worrying itself about producing any more ads. The game’s going to sell a billionty-million copies either way, if only it gets finished.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That good games, whether they come from Microsoft or otherwise, top the sales charts. That’s perhaps no surprise. It’s also no surprise to see these games do well on PlayStation. The PS5 was screaming out for a game like Playground’s wonderful racer, Forza Horizon 5, so its April launch on the console was hotly anticipated. Then there’s The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, which is scratching that Bethesda itch across PC and console, and the eternally popular Minecraft, even more popular now with the Minecraft movie going viral and breaking records.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This is now the new normal for Microsoft, which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gears-of-war-reloaded-coming-in-summer-even-on-playstation">just announced Gears of War: Reloaded</a> for PC, Xbox, and PlayStation coming in August. It seems inevitable that Halo, what was once the flagship Xbox exclusive, will also make the jump.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-gaming-boss-phil-spencer-wont-rule-out-any-xbox-exclusive-making-the-jump-to-playstation-including-halo"><u>Microsoft’s gaming chief Phil Spencer said there were no “red lines” in its first-party lineup when it comes to going multiplatform</u></a> — and that included Halo.

It's a piece of intellectual property. It's bigger than just a game. And how do you leverage that? Those are the conversations that always happen with, how do you leverage it in everything that we would do?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's had its ups and downs, but look, Xbox wouldn't be what Xbox is without Halo. But yeah, I'm sure those conversations are happening. Whether they come to fruition, who knows? But they're definitely happening, I'm sure.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft does face a potential backlash from hardcore Xbox fans who are already disgruntled after what they feel is a devaluing of the Xbox as a console, the lack of exclusives, and Microsoft’s marketing strategy for its gaming business. Losing Halo to PlayStation could spark yet another angry response, but Moore told IGN that won’t deter Microsoft from doing what’s right for its business.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The question would be, ultimately, is that reaction enough not to make a fundamental business decision for the future of not only Microsoft’s business, but gaming in itself?” Moore said. “Those hardcore are getting smaller in size and older in age. You've got to cater to the generations that are coming through, because they're going to drive the business over the next 10, 20 years.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-hits-2-million-copies-sold-after-12-days-on-sale<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> has now sold an impressive 2 million copies after 12 days on sale. That’s up from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hit-rpg-clair-obscur-expedition-33-tops-1-million-sales-in-just-3-days">the 1 million sold three days after launch</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth remembering that Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was, alongside Bethesda’s Oblivion Remastered, a day-one Game Pass title. That makes this sales milestone all the more impressive for French developer Sandfall Interactive and publisher Kepler Interactive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’ve watched in awe as so many of you began your journey,” reads <a href="https://x.com/expedition33/status/1919701863491838316" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a post on social media</a>. “Feeling every step, every emotion, every revelation alongside you. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“To those just joining us: welcome.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Tomorrow comes.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When Bethesda shadow-dropped <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered"><u>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</u></a> amid the launch of fellow role-playing game Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, most thought there could be only one winner. However, it turned out that there was plenty of room for both games to succeed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, according to Kepler, not only did Oblivion <em>not</em> harm Clair Obscur, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-publisher-says-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-shadow-drop-actually-benefitted-the-game-by-drawing-attention-to-quality-rpgs-that-week">Clair Obscur actually benefitted from Oblivion’s release because it boosted excitement for the RPG genre</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kepler Interactive’s senior portfolio manager Matt Handrahan told <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/expedition-33-publisher-elder-scrolls" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The Game Business</u></a> last week: “We always knew that Expedition 33 had a very specific identity. When I was in the press, I saw the Western-style RPG and the Japanese-style RPG as having quite different appeals and audiences. I knew plenty of people that would play an Elder Scrolls game that wouldn't necessarily play Final Fantasy and vice versa.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Also, by the time that we rolled around, we had momentum of our own and we felt pretty confident that we could stand beside it. I think there were other aspects, like the price point we were at and the inclusion in Game Pass… so we knew we would have a lot of interest around the game. We were confident in that. And it went as well as it possibly could have done in our eyes. And, actually, proximity to Oblivion didn't seem to harm us at all. In many ways, I think it just drew attention to quality RPGs that week and everybody was thinking and talking about the genre.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has done so well that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/french-president-macron-congratulates-clair-obscur-expedition-33-developer-for-creating-one-of-the-best-rated-games-in-history"><u>French President Macron has praised the development team</u></a>.

    <p><span>From Ether One and The Occupation developer White Paper Games.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><em>Ether One</em>, <em>The Occupation</em>, and <em>Dahlia View</em> developer <a title="Companies > White Paper Games" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/white-paper-games">White Paper Games</a> has announced <em><a title="Games > I AM RIPPER" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/i-am-ripper">I AM RIPPER</a></em>, a British thriller set in the brutality and economic decline of the 1980s. It will be available for <a title="Platforms > PC [23,067 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3218100/I_AM_RIPPER/" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/i-am-ripper-031b47" target="_blank">Epic Games Store</a>. A release date was not announced. <span id="more-962952"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via White Paper Games:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>Step into the world of Ripper.</p><p>It’s 1988, a small north-western dock town in Britain has witnessed multiple victims by a single killer who have been confirmed through forensic analysis.</p><p>Throughout the game, you will be faced with critical decisions which will change the outcome of your investigation.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>You must confront a series of gut-wrenching challenges placing the fates of others in your hands.</p><p>Find the forensics, reveal the secrets and pursue the person responsible.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li>Branching narratives Players will be forced to confront choices that’ll ripple through their timelines and change story outcomes in distinct ways.</li><li>Tactile gameplay We love to create gameplay mechanics with high interactivity and this game will be no different. You can see an example of our tactility taken to a new level with the stitch-cutting sequence on our announce trailer.</li><li>Award winning storytelling <em>I AM RIPPER</em> is a fast paced thriller told from multiple perspectives. White Paper Games is known for its performances, storytelling and world building and this game will build upon these traits.</li></ul></blockquote><div id="carousel_962958"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Message from White Paper Games</strong></p><p>Each White Paper game we design is a reaction to our past work. To know this game, it’s useful to know how <em>Ether One</em>, <em>The Occupation</em>, and <em>Dahlia View</em> were brought to life.</p><p><em>Ether One</em> (2014) was an <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,254 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> through the brain exploring what it’s like to live with dementia and the fragility of our core memories. The experience was deeply meaningful to us and taught us that we don’t need to be explicit with story. Instead, respect player input and they’ll place the pieces in order. In <em>The Occupation</em> (2019), the emergence of headlines, and not knowing what was true, whilst also being constrained by the ticking clock, forced the player to make choices about paths they were uncertain about. <em>Dahlia View</em> (2021) brought us a tragedy of how a missing child can impact a community of people and how to weave incredible characters into a thrilling experience. </p><p>The Ripper will create horrific circumstances forcing you to choose a path. The path will have consequences for someone, you just don’t know who. You have to figure out where your moral judgments lay. Power is all around us and how power is used relates to the scenario you’re placed in. </p><p>The thriller genre is underserved. We have media on TV, in movies, documentaries and podcasts, but we have few game examples. We want <em>I AM RIPPER</em> to cater to all those people who love gritty thrillers, but don’t have an interactive way of exploring the themes, situations and challenges in a non-linear way. </p><p><em>I AM RIPPER</em> builds upon everything we’ve learnt about story delivery, tactile gameplay and meaningful consequence. It’s not a puzzle game, or a horror game, or a detective game, but it has all the key components of those genres to create something that feels rewarding, explorative of core themes and characters that feel real and grounded in their world.</p><p>We hope you resonate with our work and we’d love to chat to you more about our game if you have questions.</p><p>Thank you for your time,<br>White Paper Games</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

Developer Sandfall Interactive and publisher Kepler Interactive revealed the news in a social media post, thanking fans for their support thus far. "We've watched in awe as so many of you began your journey. Feeling every step, every emotion, every revelation alongside you. To those just joining us: welcome. Tomorrow comes," <a href="https://x.com/expedition33/status/1919701863491838316" rel="nofollow ">the message reads</a>.</p><p>The game has also been popular on Steam, and on May 4, it reached a new peak with 145,063 concurrent players (via <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1903340/charts/#max" rel="nofollow ">SteamDB</a>). What makes this even more noteworthy is that Steam only accounts for a portion of the playerbase, as the game is also available through the Epic Games Store and the Xbox storefront for PC, as well as Xbox Series X|S, and PS5. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was a day-one launch for Game Pass on PC and Xbox Series X|S, arriving shortly after Oblivion Remastered.</p><p>Kepler Interactive's Matthew Handrahan recently commented on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remastered-didnt-steamroll-expedition-33-publisher-says/1100-6531269/">the two games launching so close to each other</a>, explaining that the publisher always believed in Expedition 33's "very specific identity" as being a key factor that would help set it apart.</p><p>The game--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-director-came-up-with-the-game-while-bored-at-ubisoft/1100-6531305/">which is partly the product of boredom</a> and wanting to put a fresh spin on JRPGs--has been critically acclaimed for its exquisite design, emotional storytelling, and fusion of turn-based RPG combat with souls-like influences. "There are minor pitfalls in relation to its narrow exploration and some quality-of-life issues, but these missteps aren't enough to significantly detract from a game with all the makings of an RPG classic," Richard Wakeling wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-light-and-shadow/1900-6418358/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 review</a>.</p>

            <p>Rockstar has released a second trailer for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>.</p>
<p>"Jason and Lucia have always known the deck is stacked against them. But when an easy score goes wrong, they find themselves on the darkest side of the sunniest place in America, in the middle of a conspiracy stretching across the state of Leonida - forced to rely on each other more than ever if they want to make it out alive," reads the official trailer blurb.</p>
<p>Fancy a watch, you can check it out for yourself below.</p>

<p>Rockstar has also updated its <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/VI">official GTA 6 website</a>. Here, the studio has given us more information on its leads, Jason Duval and Lucia Caminos.</p>
<p>Poor ol' Jason just wants an "easy life", Rockstar has shared, but this isn't going to plan.</p>
<p>"Jason grew up around grifters and crooks. After a stint in the Army trying to shake off his troubled teens, he found himself in the Keys doing what he knows best, working for local drug runners. It might be time to try something new."</p>

<p>Lucia, meanwhile, was taught by her father "to fight as soon as she could walk", and "life has been coming at her swinging ever since". This has seen her landed in prison, even though she just wants to "live the good life" Lucia's mother once pictured for her.</p>
<p>"But instead of half-baked fantasies, Lucia is prepared to take matters into her own hands," Rockstar has said.</p><p>

Both Jason and Lucia hope that together, things will finally work out for them. However, at least as far as Jason is concerned, "meeting Lucia could be the best or worst thing to ever happen to him". Ooooh...

<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-delayed-to-2026">Rockstar announced it was delaying the release of GTA 6 from this autumn to May next year</a>.</p>
<p>"With every game we have released, the goal has always been to try and exceed your expectations, and Grand Theft Auto 6 is no exception. We hope you understand that we need this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve," Rockstar said at the time.</p>
<p>Publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-publisher-take-two-still-expects-record-revenue-this-year-despite-shock-delay">Take-Two went on to say the expectation is that "the company will achieve sequential increases in, and record levels of, net bookings in fiscal 2026 and 2027"</a> even with the delay of, let's be honest, one of if not the most anticipated upcoming games out there.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>According to reliable leaker <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/de-nouveaux-packs-ps5-inattendus-bientot-devoiles-avec-des-promos-a-la-cle-60148">billbil-kun on Dealabs</a>, PlayStation 5 console bundles with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-raining-fire/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> are due to be announced soon.</p>
<p>Billbil-kun doesn't list a specific release date, but speculates that they could be announced later on this month for PlayStation's upcoming Days of Play promotion. There's also no word of a PS5 Pro bundle coming, just standard and digital edition PS5s. They estimate that the standard PS5 with Black Ops 6 bundle will be $449.99 USD, while the digital edition bundle will be $399.99 USD.</p>
<p>It's not a big surprise that we're getting a PS5 console bundle with Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, especially considering that there was a PS5 bundle for 2022's Modern Warfare 2 and 2023's Modern Warfare 3.</p>
<p>Even though it's more business as usual between Sony and Activision, it does have the air of being another sign as to how committed Xbox is to continuing as a third-party publisher with a software-first approach. At the prices listed by billbil-kun, these bundles are much better deals than going out and buying a brand-new Xbox Series X/S. So you won't go out and get the Xbox hardware, but these bundles will come with Xbox-owned software.</p>
<p>Xbox-owned games also <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-dominate-ps5s-download-charts-for-april-2025-oblivion-remastered-already-the-uss-third-best-selling-game-of-2025/">dominated the sales charts for PlayStation games in April 2025</a>, and long-time Xbox exclusive series, <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-launches-on-pc-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-this-summer-with-full-cross-progression-and-cross-platform-multiplayer/">Gears of War</a>, will officially be coming to PlayStation this summer. All of these things feel like events you wouldn't believe if you were hearing it from someone in 2019.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/technology/reviews/dxracer-martian-series-review-premium-product-with-few-interesting-twists<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Racing chairs have become synonymous with gaming, with companies like DXRacer releasing a variety of models tailored for fans of these products. With the launch of their new high-end Martian series, we were able to get our hands on it, and we're not looking to go back.</p>

<h2>The Look and Style</h2>

<p>The Martian series is the new top-of-the-line model of DXRacer chair. This chair, sold in a black EPU Leatherette or Woven Fabric, is a more discreet racing chair. You won't find the flashy colors or branding to align with your favorite video game or energy drink of choice, but for a work-from-home lifestyle, I was extremely appreciative of its low-key design.</p>

<p>Unlike other racing chairs I've seen on the market the back of the Martian series has a far more open face, as a tall and large guy, this open face did a lot to combat the sometimes cramped feeling that other racing seat chairs may result in. It feels more like my back is being cupped, as opposed to compressed.</p>

<p>The key features of the DXRacer Martian Series is in the magnetic headrest that is able to be easily attached and detached while remaining in place and supporting your neck, and the various features of this powered chair.</p>

<p>The back piece is extremely firm, so if you enjoy a chair you can sink into, this definitely isn't going to be your first choice, but if you like feeling that firm support, then this will be more up your alley.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dxracer-backrest-airbag.jpg?itok=VQc4wxTC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dxracer-backrest-airbag.jpg?itok=zl0J9D-U 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Buttons on the side move your lumbar support into four different modes.</figcaption></figure><h2>Time to Plug In my Chair</h2>

<p>You heard me right, this chair has a built-in battery that powers the recline of the seat back, the airbag-like lumbar support, and the light up logo on the chair.</p>

<p>Much like you'd expect to have in a car, on the left side of the chair, where the seat meets the back, there is a toggle that you can tilt forward and back to control the rise and fall of the back. Unlike standard desk chairs where tilting up and down is done in increments, the Martian XL lets you smoothly raise and lower as you see fit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The level of precision is such a small thing, but it's extremely nice during the long hours of sitting at your desk when you want to be seated just right.</p>

<p>The other electronic feature of the Martian Series is an airbag lumbar support feature. Here, two thin airbags are situated in the lower-back area of the chair. Using four buttons on the right side of the chair, you can adjust whether the lumbar support is minimized, maximized, more pronounced at the top, or more pronounced at the bottom.</p>

<p>The large positive of this is that the lumbar support is built into the chair directly. It makes the experience feel more like you're just sitting in a chair, as opposed to having a chair and an addon. Unfortunately though, the lumbar support is far more situational. If one of those four presets aren't a good shape or height for you, then this feature will be good but not great.</p>

<p>While a chair with a headrest on elastic bands is going to be more frustrating for your head support, with so much movement, the adjustability of lumbar support on elastic bands gives more freedom of movement while being in a position that once you're settled, it will stay in place.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dxracer-martian-review-wheel-comparison.jpg?itok=vQ3p5uJB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dxracer-martian-review-wheel-comparison.jpg?itok=lhu7Na_E 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Left are the wheels that the DXRacer came with. Luckily, I could swap my rollerblade wheels to my new chair with ease</figcaption></figure><p>The most unfortunate aspect of the DXRacer Martian is the wheels. The wheels that the Martian comes with are unfortunately very basic desk-chair wheels. If you have a plastic mat or a carpet, it will be OK, but if you have wood floors, then you should replace these as soon as you can.</p>

<h2>Assembly Is Simple</h2>

<p>The DXRacer came in a huge box, one I was prepared to spend a lot of time digging through and putting together, but the chair was surprisingly easy to assemble. The large box was a side effect of just how large the seat and back of the chair was.</p>

<p>Opening up the box, you'll receive MASSIVE instructions on how to put it together that are extremely simple to follow. Each screw was pre-screwed into their destination, a very nice touch that allows the user to unscrew and then immediately re-screw the chair into place.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dxracer-martian-review-instructions.jpg?itok=dlxxFdNE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dxracer-martian-review-instructions.jpg?itok=bot3EEVZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Large and simple to understand.</figcaption></figure><p>Even hooking up the battery was an easy process with cables labeled clearly; A to A, B to B, etc. Once the battery and cables were slotted into place, you can cover it all up with fabric that snaps together under the chair.</p>

<p>As for battery life, I've got the chair's charger still sitting on my desk, but at over a month of use, I have yet to need to plug it in. The use of the battery is quite minimal, between the raising and lowering of the chair and altering the lumbar support, but even then I've been impressed.</p>

<h2>DXRacer Martian Series Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>DXRacer really has made a top-of-the-line chair with the Martian. The frame is firm but comfortable, not crushing you in but letting you comfortably sit. The headrest is extremely versatile to cradle your neck no matter where you're sitting, and the powered back lets you perfectly adjust for how you want to sit.</p>

<p>The lumbar support is nice, but isn't as exact in its positioning as the back or headrest, and unfortunately, the wheels are scraping the bottom of the barrel.</p>

<p>If you're going to be spending a long time at your desk and are OK picking up a set of rollerblade wheels to fit into this chair, this is going to be a fantastic and unassuming chair that you'll want to keep for years on end.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/661382/the-new-backbone-pro-could-be-the-one-controller-for-all-your-gaming<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Backbone’s new gaming controller looks like it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/6/24122784/iphone-emulators-great-ios-controllers">should have a phone inside</a>. The Backbone Pro has the same basic shape as the company’s previous device, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525741/backbone-one-iphone-ios-controller-gaming-portable-review">the excellent Backbone One</a> — its two oblong halves are connected by a strip of plastic and metal that expands enough to dock your smartphone into the exposed USB-C port. The Pro is heavier than the previous model, and feels a bit more solid both to use and to pull apart, but the idea is the same.</p><p>The key difference with the Pro, though, is that you don’t need to dock a phone to use the controller. The Backbone Pro can also connect over Bluetooth to lots of other consoles and devices — Backbone calls this Wireless Mode, and the phone dock is Handheld Mode. In Wireless Mode, Backbone CEO Maneet Khaira says, the Pro can connect to everything from a Steam Deck to an iPad to a smart TV. And there’s more in the works.</p><p>When Khaira first showed me the new controller, he practically gushed over how much work the Pro was, despite its physical similarities to the previous model. He says this is the controller Backbone has been trying to build for years. It has two full-size thumbsticks, one on each side of the controller, plus a D-pad on the left and A, B, X, and Y buttons on the right. There are two shoulder buttons on the top of each side, and a trigger button on the inside. There’s a headphone jack and a USB-C port, and apparently enough battery to last 40 hours on a charge. Khaira told me a few times about the three circuit boards on each side, and how hard it was to get all that stuff into such a small space.</p><p>This product is as much about software as hardware, though. Backbone’s app makes the system work: it aims to be a universal library of all your games on all your devices, and attempts to remember which consoles you’re connected to, the specific control layout for each one, and where you were in each game. (Backbone even built its own emulator for playing retro games inside the app.) When it all works, you should be able to pause a game on one screen and pick it up on another without putting your controller down.</p><p>The device is compatible with lots of game-streaming services, both major mobile platforms, and many consoles and devices. But it won’t work with everything: it’s not an officially supported PlayStation controller, for instance, because its buttons don’t match Sony’s. And it doesn’t work with the Nintendo Switch, either. These are obviously hugely popular platforms, and it has always been virtually impossible to build anything that works with all the big names. Backbone will likely end up making console-specific versions of those controllers, and Khaira points out you can technically use a Backbone for PlayStation remote play, but he also seems to hope he can eventually truly support everything in one place.</p><p>Khaira’s big idea, and the one that animates Backbone’s hardware and software teams, is that the controller should be the console. Before founding Backbone, Khaira worked on gaming at Google, which had a similarly cross-platform, controller-centric idea about the future. It was called Stadia, and it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23380140/google-stadia-ending-shutdown-latest-news-gaming-tech">is now, of course, dead</a>. Khaira thinks Backbone is going to pull it off.</p><p>The Backbone Pro is on sale now, but the price of the thing has been a moving target for tariff reasons. The current price is $169, but Khaira warned that that could change quickly as tariffs do. No matter what, it’ll be substantially more expensive than the $100 Backbone One. That one will still be for sale, too. But Backbone hopes the new one might eventually replace it — and every other game pad you have lying around.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Former PlayStation boss Shuhei Yoshida has discussed two hot-button issues in the video game industry, sharing his thoughts on rising video game prices and artificial intelligence.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://playstationinside.fr/interview-shuhei-yoshida-playstation-inside-english-version" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PlayStation Inside</a>, Yoshida said he expected video game prices to go up, but he was surprised to see Nintendo be the first-mover in the push to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/" data-ref-id="1100-6528874">$80 games with Mario Kart World</a>. After Nintendo confirmed a higher price point for the next Mario Kart, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/" data-ref-id="1100-6531257">Microsoft followed by announcing $80 games, too.</a></p><p>"It was going to happen eventually. We live in contrasting times, where inflation is real and significant, but people expect games that are ever more ambitious and therefore expensive to develop to cost the same. It's an impossible equation," he explained.</p><p>"Everything" related to video game development today is "more advanced and more technologically demanding than ever before," Yoshida added.</p><p>"Each publisher or manufacturer sets the price of its games, of course, but in the end the heart of the matter lies in production costs. And that's why industry actors are so keen to diversify their revenues, in order to continue producing the AAA games that the public buys before anything else," he said.</p><p>Due to these rising costs, Yoshida said it makes sense to see a "proliferation of remasters and remakes" due to their relatively lower cost. Companies are not remastering or remaking games just for the sake of giving older games a fresh coat of paint and a chance to reach a new audience, he believes. It's because remakes and remasters are "a kind of 'easy' solution to bring in profits," Yoshida said. These profits can then help fund new games, Yoshida said, and the same way of thinking applies to PC ports of older titles.</p><p>Yoshida went on to say he's not sure if <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-costing-100-could-reward-players-too-analysts-argue/1100-6529948/" data-ref-id="1100-6529948">Rockstar Games will price GTA 6 at $100</a> as some think the company might. That would indeed be the biggest step up so far in terms of a price increase for a new AAA game. When GTA 5 was released in 2013, it cost $60 to buy; that same $60 is about $80 today when factoring in inflation.</p><p>Whatever the case, Yoshida said "a balance must be found" between production costs and the the price of a game. He cited Expedition 33 as a "way forward" for the video game industry, mentioning how the game was developed by a relatively small team and sold for $50 (it also launched into Xbox Game Pass). Expedition 33 is an example of how a studio "can make excellent games with tighter teams and budgets without compromising quality."</p><h2><strong>"AI will become a very important tool"</strong></h2><p>On the subject of AI, meanwhile, Yoshida said he expects generative AI in game development to be "used creatively to improve games," but the first step is understanding how to best use the technology.</p><p>"The possibilities offered by AI are tools, not ends in themselves. AI will become a very important tool in the future if developers learn to use its good features. We're already seeing this today, and in any case it should be seen as a simple continuation of what has always been done in video games, because AI has been used in video games for as long as they have existed in reality," he said.</p><p>Some have cited concerns about potential job losses due to the rise in AI technologies. For his part, Yoshida said human developers themselves must stay "at the heart of the project," with AI systems and technologies deployed to "speed up processes and tedious tasks that don't impact on the artistic aspect of games."</p><p>Also in the interview, Yoshida praised the recent viral trend of people using AI systems to create "Studio Ghibli-style" versions of things, saying it was "very well done" and funny. Yoshida said he doesn't necessarily agree that AI systems could encourage plagiarism, but he does believe "imitation" issues are a genuine concern.</p><p>"I'm actually more worried about the imitation aspect of AI, because beyond plagiarism, AI can now imitate a work at a lower cost. Fortunately, these imitations never reach the level of the original games," he said.</p><p>Yoshida left Sony earlier this year after 30 years at the company. He's now advising publishers, including working with Bokeh Game Studios on Slitterhead. He also advises for Annapurna and Expedition 33 publisher Kepler Interactive.</p>

            <p>On its release, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>: Tarnished Edition will include two new classes for players to choose from when they set off for the Lands Between.</p>
<p>This upcoming edition of the game was first revealed last month, when developer FromSoftware announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-is-coming-to-switch-2">Elden Ring would be coming to Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>At this time, the team said new armour, a new Torrent appearance customisation feature and "more" would be available for Elden Ring players, and while this edition was announced for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>, FromSoftware confirmed the additional content will also be available on other platforms as DLC.</p>

<p>And now, we have a better idea of just what that previously teased "more" is, with the news that two new classes are coming to Elden Ring.</p>
<p>As shared by <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202505/41423">Famitsu</a>, these classes are Knight of Ides and Heavy Knight (via machine translation). At the present time, the developer hasn't said what kind of stats these two new classes will have, so something else to keep an eye out for. Heavy Knight suggests quite a burly class, though.</p>
<p>According to the publication, in addition to these new classes the Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition will also include three new looks for Torent, along with four new types of armour, weapons, and combat techniques.</p>
<p>As to when we will be able to get our hands on this edition of Elden Ring, we are still awaiting a release date. Later this month, though, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-eight-hours-with-elden-ring-nightreign-im-convinced-multiplayer-souls-is-an-exhilarating-rush">co-op spin-off Elden Ring Nightreign will make its debut</a>.</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Nightreign</a> will be released on 30th May across PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S and PC. You can check out the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/here-are-the-pc-requirements-for-elden-ring-nightreign">PC requirements for Elden Ring Nightreign here</a>.</p>
<p>The studio also has a brand-new title known as The Duskbloods in the pipeline. Announced as part of Nintendo's Switch 2 Direct, The Duskbloods is a PvPvE title with online multiplayer, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftwares-the-duskbloods-is-bloodborne-meets-sekiro-meets-dark-souls-with-jetpacks-and-dinos-thrown-in">our Matt noting it looked like "Bloodborne meets Sekiro meets Dark Souls, with jetpacks and dinos thrown in"</a>. </p>
<p>Last week, FromSoftware announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-sales-pass-30m">Elden Ring had shipped over 30m copies worldwide</a> since its release three years ago.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/06/drop-duchy-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Considering just how fundamental Tetris is to gaming history, it’s perhaps a little surprising that it isn’t featured more often in the merry-go-round of genre mashups that we so often see. Drop Duchy takes those iconic tetrominos and transforms them into land tiles, blending the block-dropping puzzle with deck building, roguelite progression and a theme that would feel fitting for a physical board game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Drop Duchy - Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n-1bVOl6iio?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The lands are under threat and/or tyranny from belligerent armies and cruel overlords, and only you can build up your duchy piece by piece to defeat them. Presented with an 8×13 grid, you drop tiles in those oh-so-familiar shapes into place until you either run out of blocks or breach the top of the grid. Unlike Tetris, completing a row doesn’t vanish it from view, but instead rewards you with resources for each of the tiles it contains, adding permanence to every decision you make.</p>


<p>Mixed in with the standard land tiles are buildings of several types. Production buildings will draw resources from their surroundings, often transforming the land at the same time – a farm will turn plains into wheat fields, there’s forestry buildings that can clear woodland or draw upon it, mining tiles, and more. But then there’s the military buildings for both yourself and, in a combat round, for your enemies, and they will also have various conditions and modifiers to determine how many troops they supply. A watchtower needs to be near plains and fields to supply you with archers, a siege camp can reduce the units on nearby enemy buildings, the alarm tower recruits when aligned vertically or horizontally with enemy buildings, and on and on and on.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there’s only very minimal time pressure applied to you during this. Yes, blocks left alone will slowly start to drop, but you have so much time to consider your plans and look at the next three tiles coming to decide what to do. Additionally, you can put a block in reserve (which can effectively remove an enemy tile from the action, if you hold it to the end of the round), and swapping in and out of reserve resets the block to the top of the grid, so again, you’ve got acres of time to make your mind up.</p>


<p>At the end of a round with enemies is the combat phase, adding yet another layer to the puzzling. You connect up all of the military units, simplistically adding allied units together and subtracting enemies, but the order in which you do these is important. Units recruited are either light (sword), heavy (axe) or ranged (arrows), and there’s a typical triangle of strengths and weaknesses between them, giving a 1.5x multiplier so that 12 archers can take out 18 axes, for example. Merging units together unites them all as one unit type, determined by whichever had the higher number. Once again, you can play this out in so many different ways, toying with the multipliers and how stacks are added together.</p>
<p>If you come out the other side with enemies left over, that number is chipped away from your duchy’s health stat, so a “loss” isn’t necessarily the end of a run.</p>
<p>Each area builds up to a boss battle, the first of which constrains you within a subsection of the grid while having a large health count for you to defeat. The second and third then start to put even more strictures on your placement, at the penalty of bolstering the enemy forces, and they all make for a refreshing change of pace. However, there’s only three of these bosses, and while they can force your hand into disadvantageous block placement, they’re easy to defeat on a good run.</p>
<p>You chart your own path through the overworld, heading down different branches to decide what to tackle next. You can often choose between rounds that have combat and that are peaceful –&nbsp;though this boosts the impending boss battle –&nbsp;and you’re also shown the split between terrain types which could advantage your deck at that time. You also have resource spots to dole out lump sums, trading posts and more.</p>

<p>Even in your first few runs, there’s so many variable that emerge as you go from round to round. Each round rewards you with a choice of three building cards, and you can then spend resources to level them up and increase their efficacy and range –&nbsp;a level 3 farm is something to behold and incredibly empowering to a level 3 watchtower that it envelops in fields.</p>
<p>However, you’ll start to complete tasks and missions (like recruiting a certain number with a particular military building) for the overarching progression, unlocking new buildings, river terrain and buildings, new technology cards that act as passive modifiers, and eventually two more factions that play very differently to the starting one. Shifting from being able to quite purely focus on military buildings to needing to build a town around a belfry changes the tone and how you tackle the puzzle.</p>
<p>There’s also increasing difficulty levels and modifiers to put further restrictions on you, like not being able to huddle enemy buildings together or their power is amplified, or having a smaller grid to play on. You do have that compulsive feel of wanting to play another run in Drop Duchy, and these added challenges will give more to those that want them, but at the same time, I’m fairly content after half a dozen successful runs and seeing what each faction has to offer.</p>

			<p>The latest PC games to receive support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation are MechWarrior 5: Clans, New World: Aeternum, and Spirit of the North 2.</p>
<p>MechWarrior 5: Clans is the Unreal Engine 5-powered single-player and co-op campaign focused spin-off of MechWarrior 5. The game launched in October 2024 <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-3-is-in-mechwarrior-5-clans-a-quiet-place-road-ahead-and-forgive-me-father-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with support for NVIDIA DLSS 3 Frame Generation</a>; tomorrow, with the debut of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3463200/MechWarrior_5_Clans__Ghost_Bear_Flash_Storm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ghost Bear: Flash Storm story-based DLC</a>, Clans will be updated to support NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, enabling much faster frame rates on GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards. Moreover, the NVIDIA app override functionality will be updated to allow users to manually upgrade the existing NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution CNN model to the newest transformer one for improved image quality.</p>
<p>In exactly a week from today, Amazon Games will launch Season 8 - Season of the Divide for its MMORPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-aeternum-officially-launches-today-on-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-and-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New World: Aeternum</a>. The new Season will introduce the new Outpost Rush map Coral Divide, Capture The Flag maps, a new 3v3 Arena map, seasonal events, limited-time world events featuring iconic bosses from the dungeons, the barbershop, and several combat updates included tuned aim assist for controller users. New World: Aeternum will also now default to using DirectX 12 on Steam, and the developers have improved visuals and performance on NVIDIA GPUs thanks to the addition of NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation.</p>
<p>In two days, the third-person adventure sequel <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1778840/Spirit_of_the_North_2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spirit of the North 2</a> will let players once again wander in a mysterious world as a lonely fox. This game will support NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation from day one.</p>
<p>There are also PC games that still adopt just the regular NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution. For example, the realistic multiplayer first-person shooter game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2406770/Bodycam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bodycam</a> was recently updated to support DLSS SR, and Frame Generation will be added soon. Bossa's cooperative open world survival game adventure,&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/bossa-games-upcoming-lost-skies-officially-due-to-arrive-in-early-access-later-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lost Skies,</a> recently launched on Steam Early Access with DLSS Super Resolution integration.</p>
<p>The side-scrolling action RPG <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1721060/Mandragora_Whispers_of_the_Witch_Tree/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mandragora: Whispers of the Witch Tree</a> also featured NVIDIA DLSS SR support when it launched on Steam, and the same goes for the first-person horror adventure <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2019760/Necrophosis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Necrophosis</a>. The latter game also offers a demo to check out ahead of the purchase.</p>

			<p>Among the many high games I checked out during Gamescom last year was&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/hordes-of-hunger-hands-on-preview-monster-survivors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hordes of Hunger</a>, a unique blend of mechanics lifted from Vampire Survivors, Hades, and hack-and-slash games. Though my test session was short, I was immediately captivated by the smoothness of the gameplay and the character-building possibilities the game seemed to offer right from the beginning. Though it seemed to lack a bit of polish compared to other similar games, I felt the game had a ton of potential with its relatively straightforward formula almost reminiscent of an arcade game that made it very easy to get into.</p>
<p>Following the release of a demo version that was generally very well-received, Hordes of Hunger is now available as an Early Access release on Steam. After spending a dozen or so hours with the very first public release of the game, I can only say that my expectations after trying the game for the first time last year were almost completely met.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250428121356_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The <em>"3D action survivorlike" </em>developed by Hyperstrange doesn't waste any time getting the player into the thick of the action. After starting the game, main character Mirah awakens in the Sanctum, the only safe haven for humanity after the Beast and its ravenous hordes have stripped the land bare, ready to take on these hordes and save the world. Much like in the aforementioned Hades, the story develops as Mirah completes quests set in several different locations and rescues other central characters that will also offer additional services to help the warrior overcome even more challenging enemies. These services are generally standard fare for the genre, such as purchasing permanent perks from the Father, buffing meals from the Mother, or crafting new weapons at the Workshop, and they are extremely easy to understand and take full advantage of.</p>
<p>This simplicity works quite well in the context of Hordes of Hunger, as the game wants the player to constantly be out and about to fight the hordes of the Beast, hordes whose strength changes depending on the location and how many quests have already been completed in it. For example, the Main Square will be the starting point for all players, as it features the easiest enemies, while the Watermill and the Forest feature from the very first Horde Extermination quest some advanced enemy types that require players to be at the very least familiar with the different weapon types, which range from the basic all-rounder sword to the hard hitting hammer and the mobile spear, their heavy attacks, which require Focus built by fighting enemies, special attacks and the general use of the skills learned as Mirah levels up during quests.</p>

<p>As I highlighted last year, the skill system, along with the smooth, fast-paced, satisfying gameplay, is the feature that best defines Hordes of Hunger. The first public version of the game features a nice selection of skills that range from simple stat buffs to unique abilities like auras that deal elemental damage, additional attacks with phantom weapons, dodge and parry enhancements and so on that can not only be enhanced multiple times, but that also synergize well, and unexpectedly in some cases. As Miriah levels up reasonably quickly, and can do so even faster by acquiring certain perks, it doesn't take too long for the warrior to get powered up and see all sorts of special elemental effects go off at once, which, to be honest, tends to be a little distracting and often makes it difficult to understand what is going on amidst all the chaos. This is, in my opinion, one of the biggest issues found in Hordes of Hunger in its first Early Access release, alongside the unpolished and somewhat clunky menus that don't feel designed for controllers, especially the weapon crafting interface, where it is difficult to see which element is highlighted.</p>
<p>With so many combat options at the player's disposal right from the get-go, varied quests that range from simple extermination of enemies to simple escort and target destruction quests, and the promise of bigger things to come down the line, Hordes of Hunger is a well worth purchase even in its current state for players looking for a game that is highly addictive, feels great to play and doesn't require tens of hours to get going. While the experience could become a little repetitive after a few hours, its solid direction is remarkable, and I hope developer Hyperstrange will continue to spice up the experience ahead of its 1.0 release, which has yet to be dated.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/backbone-pro-announcement<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Mobile controller company Backbone has announced the Backbone Pro, a new controller whose stated aim is to let you play on "any screen with a single device".</p>

<p>The controller, which is out now via Backbone's website, is designed for a world in which "more people are playing across platforms than ever before", the company says. It's got two principal modes: Handheld and Wireless.</p>

<p>In Handheld mode, you'll connect the controller to a mobile device via USB-C for "zero latency and no need to charge", while in Wireless mode, the Backbone Pro will connect via Bluetooth. It'll work with devices like phones, tablets, laptops and PCs (with Bluetooth functionality), and VR headsets, as well as smart TVs.</p>

<p>Backbone says it had to "rethink everything" to make the Pro work, "from industrial design to firmware". The company goes on to say that the controller constitutes "one of the most comfortable handheld gaming products ever built".</p>

<p>According to Backbone, the Pro will feature full-size console-style joysticks, and you can remap every single button on the controller, including its back paddles. You can also create specific game profiles and switch between them within the Backbone app.</p>

<p>Rather uniquely, the Backbone Pro also comes with its own "built-in emulator" that will feature a "rotating library of free games" if you sign up to the Backbone Plus subscription service. Backbone doesn't reveal what those games are, though.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/backbone-pro-controller-emulator.jpg?itok=-t-Vh122 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/backbone-pro-controller-emulator.jpg?itok=4uCMBzl0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A retro emulator is included with the Backbone Pro, although we don't know what games will come with it yet.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, since there's a USB-C port on the Backbone Pro, you can also hook it up to your PC for some good old-fashioned wired gaming. Naturally, though, the controller won't work as an Xbox or PlayStation peripheral, nor can you hook it up to your Switch or Switch 2.</p>

<p>The Backbone Pro is available right now via Backbone's website.</p>
