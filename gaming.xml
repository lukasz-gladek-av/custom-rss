            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/south-of-midnight-where-to-find-all-notes-chapter-6/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>More than 100 notes to collect and read in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/south-of-midnight-boring-combat-drags-down-a-beautiful-and-emotional-story/">South of Midnight</a> are scattered throughout its 14 chapters. That might seem like a lot, but if you follow this and every other chapter guide I've posted so far, you'll see how it's straightforward to pick each one up along the way as you play through the game.</p>
<p>And you'll want to grab them all because South of Midnight's storytelling, including these written notes, is by far the strongest part of the game.</p>
<p>There are another 10 notes to collect in Chapter 6. Here's where to find them all.</p>
<h2>South of Midnight - Where To Find All Notes - Chapter 6</h2>
<p>Chapter 6 doesn't give you much of a break compared to Chapter 5, as this chapter has 10, instead of 11, notes to pick up. As you'll see below, at least a few of them are clumped together.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Keep Out Sign Materials</strong> - A little ways into the chapter, after using an echo of a crashed boat to jump across a river; you'll find the first note of the chapter on a box to your right.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Abernathy's Lament</strong> - You'll find this note on the second level of the barn you go through to find the hole for Crouton to enter and get rid of the Stigma Knot blocking your path. To get there, you'll need to enter through the roof, which you can do by heading back the way you came through the barn, where an echo of a wagon is sitting and waiting to your left, behind a couple of trees trapped together with vines. Use the wagon to jump onto the roof of the barn, and through a hole in the roof you'll reach the second level which contains a health filament and the note.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Burn After Reading</strong> - Once you see Bunny's cottage, before you walk through the gates you'll see a path to your left that leads to a combat encounter. Once you've cleared it, as you head back to Bunny's cottage you'll find this note resting on a box between two rocks to your right.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Correction Requested</strong> - After walking through the gates to Bunny's cottage, walk around to the back of the cottage to find a large tree in her backyard and a small cabin to the right of the tree. Walk past the cabin and you'll see some sunflowers next to crates of honey, with the note resting on a honey crate.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Notes on the Rogarou</strong> - You won't find this note, or the next three, until after completing the three combat encounters to get into Bunny's cottage. Thankfully, this note and the next three are all inside the cottage, so you're clearing through a bunch quickly. This first one is on a table in the room to your right once you walk in the door.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Bunny's Journal - On Weavers</strong> - This note is in Bunny's bedroom on the second floor, on Bunny's left bedside table.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Notes on Dreams and Fog</strong> - This note is also in Bunny's bedroom on the second floor, on Bunny's right bedside table.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Missing Children List</strong> - You'll find this note in the secret room behind the bookshelf in Bunny's bedroom, on a desk towards the back of the secret room, to the left of where you'll see Huggin' Molly's red yarn.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Burrowers Hate a Liar</strong> - After the cutscene with Bunny, and once you're in your new duds, follow the path away from the cottage and beyond a few exploding mushrooms. You'll find this note in a dead tree on the right side of the path.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Huggin' Molly Sightings</strong> - After speaking to Catfish, follow the path beyond some more exploding mushrooms to the point where you'll see two paths. One that leads you to the tree Catfish was talking about by using your grapple, and the other to your left with the echo of a bridge. Take the left path to find another combat encounter, and once you've cleared it, you'll find this note on a box to your right as you exit the combat arena.</p>
<p>And that's all the notes in South of Midnight's Chapter 6. You should have 38 out of 103 by now. Only 65 more to go.</p>

            <p>
I feel like all I've been seeing the past few days is people asking if <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> will be the game that finally brings extraction <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooters</a> into the mainstream. No one seems to be quite sure, mostly because it isn't done or out yet. The thing is, it's not the only extraction shooter due out this year that'll put that question to the test, as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> is one the way still too. It comes from former Battlefield devs after all, who have found success with their other shooter, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-finals">The Finals</a>. And earlier today, developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/embark-studios">Embark Studios</a> announced that another playtest for Arc Raiders is on the way this month.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Signing up for the playtest is pretty simple on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1808500/ARC_Raiders/">Steam</a>, you just have to head to the game's page and request access to the beta. The test itself is running from April 30 to May 4. Not everyone will be able to try it out, I should note, it's luck of the draw, but if you're feeling lucky and you're curious as to whether extraction shooters can make it mainstream, it's worth a shot.

In a press release Embark shared that they've taken on a bunch of feedback from the last test, implementing a bunch of "tweaks and improvements." They've also added in more Arc enemies (evil robots that have taken over most of the world), as well as weapons and gear. Player progression and crafting systems are apparently "deeper" now too, and there'll be a preview of what the game's battle pass will be like.
</p>
<p>
I like the vibes of Arc Raiders a lot. Bit of a stereotypical "humans are in hiding in tiny settlements because robots have wrecked the planet" kind of premise, though it looks good <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpCooWm-PDs&amp;ab_channel=ARCRaiders">in motion</a>, and I'm digging its particular flavour of a post-apocalypse setting.
</p>
<p>
That's the thing though, Marathon looks good in motion too, and based on most previews, plays good too. There's some specific complaints people are having about Marathon (namely a worrying lack of content at launch) which raises further questions as to whether it'll be the one to make a notoriously tough genre like extraction shooters popular.
</p>
<p>
I honestly can't say how things will shake out. Games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hunt-showdown">Hunt: Showdown</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/escape-from-tarkov">Escape from Tarkov</a> are still trudging along quite well, maybe it doesn't need to be a massively popular genre. Guess we'll have an idea by the end of the year!

		<p>With rumours and reports of a The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remake having circulated for years at this point, the latest has come directly from developer Virtuos, with screenshots and details coming from their website.</p>
<p>Further to the screenshots, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remaster-is-real">Eurogamer has also now reported</a> that Bethesda’s plan is to shadow drop the game next week, launching it across PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC – and on Xbox Game Pass, of course.</p>


<p>The images were found in the backend of the Virtuos website, as enterprising Reddit users started to poke around. They include screenshots of the game, comparison shots between this version of the game and the 2006 original, and more. Having been hosted on the Virtuos servers in a publicly accessible fashion, they’ve now been <a href="https://imgur.com/a/oblivion-remake-OUg7kXu">copied across to imgur</a>, while the studio has taken their site offline. We’ll point you toward imgur if you want to see the full selection, but here’s one example:</p>

<p>There’s definitely an awful lot more detail on show in the 2025 version of Oblivion, with less of the hazy bloom effect from the early Xbox 360 days, in favour of a late afternoon glow and tons more grass.</p>

<p>Originally founded in Shanghai and now headquartered in Singapore, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtuos">Virtuos</a> is a huge company with thousands of employees and teams dotted around the world. The company has often provided co-development support on major projects, such as art for the Horizon series and co-dev for the upcoming Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, as well as a variety of ports and remaster projects big and small. Oblivion could be their most notable work yet, and it will be fascinating to see how it comes together and how closely it sticks to or diverges from the original.</p>
<p>I guess we won’t have too long to wait…</p>

			<p>Strong as<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/south-of-midnight-boring-combat-drags-down-a-beautiful-and-emotional-story/"> South of Midnight's</a> story is, reading every note along the way really does add to the storytelling in a special way. Which is why you'll want to read them all, even if you're just trying to find them for the achievement.</p>
<p>These guides will tell you where to find every note in the game, all 103 of them, across South of Midnight's 14 chapters.</p>
<h2>South of Midnight - Where To Find All Notes - Chapter 5</h2>
<p>If you've been following along with the rest of these guides, then you'll recognize that Chapter 5 has more notes than any level so far. Here's where to grab all 11 of Chapter 5's notes.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Burrower's Pieces of the Self—</strong>The first note of the chapter is found right after you've found Crouton, in the hollow tree immediately next to where you'll send Crouton to do away with the stigma.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Statue Flyer</strong> - After continuing further into the level, and completing the first combat encounter (which will also show you the first memory), you'll find this note on a broken fence post, just below the giant Auntie Belle's sign and statue.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Burrower's - Iron</strong> - You'll find this note just in front of Jolene's church, after the cutscene with Ms. Pearle and Jolene. It will be on top of a box that's next to the fence, which will be immediately to your right once the cutscene ends.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Hollow Dreamers</strong> - After grabbing the last note, follow the path the strands layout for you across the water towards a house that's covered in vines. The note will be on a couch that sits on the porch of the house.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Kids Need a Hand</strong> - After fighting your first Slug Haint (the big round enemy that digs underground) and seeing the second memory for the chapter, you'll find this note inside the house that'll be right in front of you, and on the table to your left when you walk through the door.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Jo's Penance</strong> - Before leaving the house, walk up the stairs to the second floor, and head to the room at the end of the hall, which will also be the only room left open for you to walk into. You'll find this note on a desk with a guitar leaning against it.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Yard Sale Notice</strong> - This note is a little further into the level, and you won't be able to get to it until you've reached Swopes Farm. To reach it, you'll first have to use an echo box to climb a high tower where you'll find a Floof knot. From this vantage, you'll also be able to see over a tall stack of hay bales. Jump over the hay bales to the other side, and turn left towards a trailer, then right towards a small cabin. You'll find this note resting on a folding chair.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Honor thy Father and Mother</strong> - Once you're back to where you climbed the high tower, head towards the big house on your right. The door will open when you get close, and you'll find this note in what looks like the family room immediately to your right when you walk in.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>A Bashful Farmhand in the Setting Sun</strong> - Before leaving the house, head up to the second floor, where you'll find a Floof knot in one room, and this note on a desk next to a typewriter in the other.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>The Pigs are a Loss</strong> - When you make it to the Pig Factory, inside the factory you'll enter a room with a Floof knot on top of a container to your left. The note, on the other hand, is on ground level, sitting on a table immediately to the right of the door.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Sutter's Will and Testament</strong> - After the Two-Toed Tom boss fight, and after you've been swallowed up by the giant gator, you'll find this note once you've made it to the other side of the pool the squealing pig from earlier is swimming in. It's on the wooden floor, next to a lamp.</p>
<p>That's all 11 notes in South of Midnight's Chapter 5. If you've been following along with these guides, then you'll have acquired 28 out of 103 now. Only 75 more to go.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/final-frontier-games-shuts-down-amid-financial-struggles<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Final Frontier Games is closing down. The Macedonia-based tabletop developer is closing after nearly a decade of producing board games. This closure results from five years of financial struggle, leaving three crowdfunded projects unfulfilled.</p>

<h2>The Closure of Final Frontier Games</h2>

<p>The news of Final Frontier Games' closure came from a backer update sent via their Kickstarter projects. That update was made public <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1jzorko/final_frontier_games_laying_off_and_declaring/" rel="nofollow">via post</a> on the r/boardgames subreddit.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-frontier-games-merchants-cove-cover-artwork.jpg?itok=nnBqFpVl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-frontier-games-merchants-cove-cover-artwork.jpg?itok=KQ5v1mRQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In the backer update, Final Frontier Games states that cash has been tight for a while and after a large order for Chinese localized copies of <em>Merchants Cove</em> fell through, they cannot fulfill the Kickstarter projects that have been fulfilled. The post continues, citing other compounding production issues behind the scenes that eroded their finances.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;We cannot understate the gravity of the situation and the suddenness of the fall of the company. We are emotionally devastated, sad, we are hurting, we are angry and there is a big hole in our hearts that will take a long time to overcome, if ever. Just recently we were tweaking ads for our next campaign, talking with reviewers, preparing for production on our other games, developing our future projects and entering a distribution partnership with QML, something that we had lacked for 4 years… hoping that the payment will come through.</p>

<p>All our dreams and hopes vanished. 10 families that put food on the table through Final Frontier Games that had stable, creative and good paying jobs are now faced with extreme uncertainty with no financial stability. We are truly living in the darkest timeline.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a result of these developments, Final Frontier Games' three current Kickstarter projects - <em>Merchants Cove: Master Craft</em>, <em>The Sixth Realm</em>, and a <em>Coloma </em>reprint, have remained unfulfilled despite funding of $1.39 million. This is the culmination of protracted financial struggles for the company going back to their first Merchants Cove Kickstarter suffering serious production issues during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>According to FInal Frontier Games, the order that fell through was with tabletop giant CMON. The update stated that CMON had initially agreed to pay 50% before production then the remainder after the process was complete. Allegedly, this deal was changed to paying the entirety once the games were ready to be picked up.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Final Frontier agreed to this change. But, according to them, the last possible day for payment came and went with no contact from CMON. Despite multiple emails being sent, no one at CMON got back to them regarding payment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>CMON has yet to make an official statement or comment at the time of writing.</p>

            <p>
It's been a little over a year since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/palia">Palia</a> had its proper launch, and its next big update, the Elderwood Expansion, received a little reveal today. This update is mostly focused on a new area, the titular Elderwood, and it'll be free for everyone. That doesn't mean everyone will be able to play it right off the bat though, as it's designed for higher level players that have already beaten the main story (you can still head there beforehand if you're impatient).
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Looking at the trailer I'd say that the big theme here is the colour purple. It's everywhere, that's just the vibe of the place I suppose. In terms of actual additions, outside of the new area itself, there's apparently a new story. There's some kind of essence infecting the area, but story details are pretty light right now.

You'll find a couple new creatures to track down like the Ogapuu and Smole (yes, these are their names), and there are hidden artifacts that can net you some strong relics, a "new equipment system that buffs you and your party." On top of that there's new fish, insects, and plushies too. It seems like a pretty sizable update, one that feels surprising to be completely free, but hey, the whole idea is that the game is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-free-pc-games">free-to-play</a>, so, no complaints here!
</p>
<p>
The update is arriving pretty soon too, on May 13, where it'll be launching on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. I mention this only because the game has cross-play, so if you've got some console buds that have been wanting to check Palia out, now might be the time to give them a nudge.

Let people own pieces of the servers they spent years of their lives on. Because while <em>ESO </em>and<em> WoW </em>might be successful now, eventually they will shut down or the world will move on or something else will happen and the games won’t be playable anymore.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ive-just-picked-up-a-pokmon-tcg-151-booster-bundle-direct-from-amazon-and-its-still-in-stock<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">But you'll have to pay a premium...</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I noticed Pokémon 151 booster bundles are back on Amazon, and I’d love to say that means good news for collectors. But when the price is more than double the MSRP, it's more of a raised eyebrow than a celebration. Amazon is listing the bundle for over $60, despite its actual retail price being $26.94. I guess we're calling that a "deal" now. Still, given how fast this set sells out, I can't entirely write it off.</p><p id="pokmon-tcg-151-booster-bundle"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG: 151 Booster Bundle">Pokémon TCG: 151 Booster Bundle Is Back In Stock For A Premium</h2></p><div catalogid="73e0a0eb-2c53-4af8-acce-e01289366c6e" id="218750"><div id="218750" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: 151 Booster Bundle</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Full Disclosure: MSRP is $26.94</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I think what keeps pulling me back to 151 is that it's not just banking on nostalgia. It actually delivers. The card art in this set goes way beyond the usual shiny-thing-on-a-blank-background look. Take the Illustration Rare Bulbasaur, for example. It’s hiding in a jungle of giant leaves like it wandered into a Ghibli movie, and it works. Then there's Alakazam ex, who looks like it's working on a psychic PhD in a cluttered study. It's oddly charming.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In my opinion, the strongest part of this set is how it ties art and gameplay together without feeling like it’s trying too hard. Cards like Blastoise ex have solid abilities and look like they belong in a gallery. Even Charmander got an upgrade. The new one has 70 HP, which might not sound like a big deal, but it’s enough to keep it alive against chip damage that would've knocked out weaker versions. Subtle but important, which kind of sums up a lot of this set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not everything hits. Zapdos ex is fine, but I wouldn’t frame it or build a deck around it. Still, the overall quality is high. Venusaur ex leans into both function and flair, while Squirtle’s artwork pulls off that rare trick of making a cartoon turtle look like it belongs in an actual ecosystem. It’s hard not to appreciate how much care went into these designs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I don’t love paying above MSRP, but I also don’t love pretending this set isn’t loaded. I think if you’ve been waiting for packs that are genuinely fun to open and have a real shot at high-value pulls, this is still one of the better buys. Assuming you're okay with the price of admission being whatever Amazon feels like charging today.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

Its presentation was packed with content to look forward to, but it’s Season 3: Guts and Glory that promises the land combat feature players have hoped to see included since Skull and Bones originally launched last February.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">During Season 3 this fall, Ubisoft will finally allow players to take the action away from the sea, meaning you’ll be able to swordfight and even draw your firearms against others. It’s all part of Season 3’s Rogue Warlord additions, which will see players setting foot on sandy beaches and damp caves to rescue skilled crewmembers known as Officers. A video teasing the feature showed a bit of what players can expect, but it’s clear we’ll have to wait until later this year to see how it all works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While land combat is by far the biggest addition coming with Skull and Bones Year 2, the presentation had plenty more to keep players digging throughout 2025. Season 1 sets sail today, April 15, with Ascent into Chaos, which adds a loot-enhancing item ascension feature, challenging World Tiers, a new Schooner medium ship, and the team-based Death Tides PvP mode. Season 2: Oaths of War, which launches summer 2025, includes highlights such as Megaforts and the gargantuan Frigate large ships, with Season 4: Eye of the Beast set to introduce the Kraken, Hunter’s Guild, and Corvette large ship this winter.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If everything you’ve heard sounds enticing enough to dive in, you’ll be happy to know Skull and Bones will launch a free weekend in just a few days. From April 17 – 21, players can raise sails to try out pirate PvP for themselves and also purchase the game at a reduced price (which has yet to be announced).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Skull and Bones launched February 16, 2024, for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X | S (we gave it a 7/10 in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/skull-and-bones-review"><u>our review</u></a>). Although Ubisoft has been reluctant to share official sales stats for its latest pirate adventure game, it did <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-says-skull-and-bones-has-record-player-engagement-but-fails-to-announce-sales"><u>tease that it managed to bring in “record player engagement” shortly after its release</u></a>. Interestingly, the launch of Skull and Bones also coincided with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-players-rise-200-upon-skull-and-bones-release"><u>a 200% increase in Assassin’s Creed 4: Black Flag players</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/" data-ref-id="5000-73990">Minecraft</a> will soon add the ability to leash together mobs to each other or objects, opening up new possibilities for how players engage with the game's voxel-based world.</p><p dir="ltr">As explained in a <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/unleash-your-imagination" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog</a> on the Minecraft website, the ability to lead a single mob with a leash has existed for some time.

While some leash functionality, like the ability to tie a leash to a fence, isn't new, changes to how they work are. It will be easier to add and remove leashes from knots, and players looking to remove one particular mob from a leashed group can use shears to do so. Keep in mind, players can't leash together other players or use shears to mess with someone else's leashes.</p><p dir="ltr">All the new leashing functionality is available for testing now for those using Minecraft: Java Edition, with testing coming to the Minecraft: Bedrock Edition realms on Xbox, Windows, Android, and iOS soon, developer Mojang said. A release date for when the feature would come to all users hasn't been announced.</p><p dir="ltr">To test the feature, players will need to enable snapshots for Minecraft: Java Edition and install it via the Minecraft launcher. For those looking to test on Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, players will need to opt in to preview/beta and download those specific test versions. Mojang notes that playing test versions can corrupt a player's world, so those interested in testing out the feature should backup their world or run them in a different save folder from their main world.</p><p dir="ltr">While Mojang continues to deliver new features to Minecraft, A Minecraft Movie is breaking records at the box office, recently becoming the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-minecraft-movie-is-now-the-no-2-highest-grossing-video-game-movie-of-all-time/1100-6530830/" data-ref-id="1100-6530830">second-highest-grossing video game film of all time</a> after The Super Mario Bros.

Well, there’s always some challenges to that, here are just some:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The long tail is not long.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There’s no way to go but down. We’ve learned this the hard way. Most dev graphs (which they will be very reluctant to show you) will mostly look like this. A spike and then a slow death.</span></p><p>Image via author.</p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Difficult moderation &amp; competition</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Publishing a new game on our platform of choice is getting more and more challenging. The growth of requirements and restrictions is mostly caused by the growth of competition. There are more and more games being uploaded to the platform every day, and our games are just getting squeezed.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You could say, “Well, I’m just going to build a new game, and I will keep building these new games, catching waves and capitalizing on them.” However, building a new game requires time and money. Even if you work alone, it’s still going to take time to do and there’s no guarantee your idea is going to work.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/niantic-is-laying-off-68-employees-after-selling-its-game-business-for-3-5-billion" target="_self" data-discover="true">Niantic is laying off 68 employees after selling its game business for $3.5 billion</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The fourth reason is that you don’t know what’s going to happen. You just don’t. Instead of placing all your eggs in one basket and hoping for the best, why not try to diversify, and help yourself make more money in new places.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Let’s sum up. You have a number of games, they are localized in English, and can work on the web. You know they are profitable, you know there’s enough retention and ad views, and you know people like them. So here comes the next question - What can you publish?</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Where can we publish?">Where can we publish?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I’m not going to waste air persuading you to build games for the web. However, I do want to give you some numbers to use as you see fit to figure out what to publish.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Time to develop: 1-3 months. Including testing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Cost: under $10 000.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Competition: Monkey Mart (300M plays), Level Devil (83M plays), Stickman Hook (574M plays), Subway Surfers (1B plays).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The last row of numbers were taken from the presentation done by Poki rep to the Defold community. Yes, Subway Surfers is there, but the other games on the list are much smaller. They do have good quality though, so remember, when you go big - try to keep up.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Where can we publish?">Where can we publish?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I think of the web game distribution market as an inverted pyramid.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sony-has-raised-the-price-of-the-playstation-5-in-some-markets" target="_self" data-discover="true">Sony has raised the price of the PlayStation 5 in some markets</a></p><p>Image via author/respective brands.</p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There’s the top tier that includes platforms like Poki and Crazy Games. Poki has about 30 million monthly active users (MAU) - this is the metric that is traditionally used to calculate the general audience of the platform. 700 billion gameplays/month on Poki. Crazy Games has similar numbers 30 MAU and 300 million games played monthly.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The middle layer is all kinds of other platforms. This includes the likes of Y8, Kongregate, and Newgrounds.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And then there are these aggregators, like GameMonetize, GamePix, Game Distribution. GameDistribution for example has over 2000 web publishers on their platform.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">However, this is just the tip of the iceberg. This inverted pyramid is what the platforms want you to think of the web game market, so you don’t move from that platform. The reality is that under that peak there’s a whole other space for web games that has remained invisible for years.</span></p><p>Image via author/respective brands.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Again, let me take one moment to break it down.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">First we have websites. Look at the graph from Statista below. In the year 2021, there were 1.88 billion website launches. All of these websites launch and die, with a large number of them growing, maturing, and slowly decreasing their influence. This last part of their journey is something that we are most interested in!</span></p><p>Image via author/respective brands.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When businesses understand that their website lifespan is close to its end, they need to find ways to revitalize their user base. Another reason to push them towards games— they need to find new ways to show ads. Games often become a perfect medium for this, attracting users and increasing the return on ad spend (ROAS). This is increasingly becoming part of the strategy for not only smaller websites, but also larger media platforms like The New York Times.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Social media platforms, chat platforms, streaming platforms—all of these spaces are embracing games! Discord has games, Viber has games, even Linkedin has games. This is possible thanks to the HTML5, and the way this content could be easily integrated into any online service. Even places like Wikipedia could potentially find a place for games.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Note about Mobile Stores">Note about Mobile Stores</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Apart from these general platforms, there are also web-app stores, like Chrome Web Store, where you can potentially distribute games yourself. For this, you can use packaging tools like Electron. You can also go to mobile stores like App Store and Google Play. Currently there are 250,068 mobile games on Google Play, with the top grossing backed by large publishers with deep pockets.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Here’s the math for you. If you publish on mobile, you need to invest at least 25% of the budget into marketing, plus pay a 15-30% service fee for each dollar of revenue. If you choose to sign up with a publisher, be ready for the 30/70 split, where 70% goes to the publisher’s pocket. For many developers this kind of spending is completely impossible.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With this in mind, the underlying opportunity seems to be humongous. With billions of websites all over the world and easy seamless integration, why do we keep limiting ourselves to chosen platforms, and not diversifying our distribution?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With that out of the way. How do you get to that sweet new audience on the web?</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Challenges of Self-Publishing">Challenges of Self-Publishing</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On paper it should be easy. You go to Poki and Crazy Games, they approve your game, and you reap the benefits. However, practitioners will know that almost immediately they will be hit with a refusal, or they will just ignore you and never get back. This happens mostly because of quality issues.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Moderation on these platforms is usually being done on two levels: technical compatibility and IP compatibility.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Technical requirements are usually fairly rigorous, and require important features like a save system, player progression, ad monetization (banner, interstitial, rewarded), in-game purchases, social features (share, invite a friend, add to favorites, etc.), leaderboards, language and device information, and remote configuration.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">IP compatibility is an overview of all the content you have in the game. The platform needs to make sure that there is no content that violates IP rights from their legitimate owners. This can be quite restrictive, especially for titles with no original content.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It is worth noting that even if you go through the moderation process on one platform, you will still have to do it for the competitors: big and small. The further you go, the lower the requirements become, but the higher the risk that the project will not be making any money.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Don’t miss out on the opportunity">Don’t miss out on the opportunity</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">No matter how you are going to address these challenges, I would encourage you to do it. The main reason being the longer you wait, the more opportunities you are going to miss. The way the web games are progressing today, they have the potential to become gateways to new markets and amazing new adventures for the industry.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">How to do it—that’s another question. I see three options so far:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You can do it yourself. Get a separate employee, or be that employee, who’s going to attack each and every platform, look at each and every store and aggregator, and try to get there yourself. It’s time-consuming, but you’ll learn a lot.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Publisher. Publishers are expensive, you will lose on a lot of money, but if they do pick you up, you will know for sure your game is worth it and you will be making money. But note that the publisher will probably take over 70% of it.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game distribution and monetization platforms. To operate in such a vast and fragmented market, new and efficient tools are essential. At Playgama.com, we're bringing to life this kind of vision—a unified platform that connects the entire web and serves as a gateway to the widest possible network of distributors and platforms worldwide (we talk thousands), both gaming and non-gaming. I believe this is the future, and it’s coming very soon.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We enter a new stage in the way entertainment is consumed. This new stage will disrupt not only the way we access games, but also ways we monetize and distribute them. We are at the brink of the huge explosion of opportunity for game developers and publishers. The pie is bigger than you think!</span></p><p>Image via author/respective brands.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Funcom, developers of the MMORPG based on Frank Herbert’s <em>Dune</em> sci-fi series, <a href="https://pr.funcom.com/An-important-update-regarding-Dune-Awakening">announced the news</a> saying the game will be pushed back from its May release date to June 10th. Players who have pre-purchased one of the game’s deluxe editions will get access a few days earlier on June 5th.</p><p><em>Dune: Awakening</em> takes place in an alternate universe where <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24086957/dune-part-two-movie-review">Timothee Chalamet was never born</a> and thus never fought Austin Butler in single combat. Your job, as a new arrival to the desert planet Arrakis, is to investigate the disappearance of the Fremen, the planet’s native inhabitants. To do that you’ll have to combat exhaustion, thirst, the blood thirsty Harkonnens, and the Shai Hulud, Arrakis’ big bad worm dudes.</p><p>The delay of the game is only a few weeks, which according to Funcom, gives developers “more time to cook.” Funcom wrote in its announcement that it intends to use the additional time to respond to feedback from the game’s ongoing closed beta testing.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
