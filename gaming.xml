            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shapez-2">Shapez 2</a> will launch in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shapez-2-gets-an-early-access-release-date-and-a-new-trailer-to-explain-how-itll-consume-all-your-free-time">Early Access on August 15th</a>, bringing the relaxing, shape-cutting factory builder into 3D.
</p>
<p>In a new post, its lead developer has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2162800/view/4357881096234065558">laid out what to expect from Early Access</a>. In the main: a polished, 40 hours-or-so experience with no known major issues, and a post-release roadmap waiting to be defined by player feedback.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We’ve spent a lot of time polishing the game already and are really happy how it turned out. We believe it’s in a great state and is meant to be played," says the post. "With 4 game modes, there’s plenty of content to be explored. There should be at least 40 hours of content but it’s easy to get over a hundred hours or more, as our playtesters have proven already."
</p>
<p>Tobspr Games - which has grown to eight people, rather than the mostly solo project of the original - has been working with patrons and the series' Discord community since development began. In that time they've run regular playtests, but also canvassed their players as to what features are most important to them, which proposed art style they prefer, and more. That relationship will continue into Early Access.
</p>
<p>"I don’t like launching with a roadmap immediately, especially not for early access. If the roadmap is already predetermined, what impact do players actually have?"
</p>
<p>There's also no pre-decided amount of time that Shapez 2 will spend in Early Access, because "it could be years in theory" and depends on how well it sells.</p>
<p>"Our dream goal would be to keep updating the game for many years while it finances the development. However, as the game industry is unpredictable, we don’t want to promise something we can’t keep."
</p>
<p>One of the central ambitions of Shapez 2 was to improve performance over the original, according to the post.
</p>
<p>"Performance was a frequent complaint [in Shapez 1], but there was nothing left to optimize. Shapez 1 is written in JavaScript, so it’s literally just a website. There is no support for efficient rendering, memory management or proper multithreading and the language itself is at least a magnitude slower than C++ or C#."
</p>
<p>Shapez 1 would begin to lag for players "starting at around 5,000 - 10,000 buildings". By comparison, in Shapez 2 "everything should currently run very smooth until 100,000 buildings, pretty smooth until 250,000 buildings and depending on your setup somewhat smooth with 500,000 buildings (30 fps on a higher end setup)."
</p>
<p>There's no hard limit on how many buildings players can create, and in testing some players have constructed factories with "1.25 million buildings and above", but experienced "significant lag."
</p>
<p>I played Shapez 1 for the first time last week, for a fun few hours. It's a factory builder in which resources are unlimited, buildings are free, and there's no threat or time pressure. That makes it pretty perfect for pairing with some dumb-as-rocks episodes of Criminal Minds on a second screen. My few hours with it were enough to make me certain that I wanted to try Shapez 2 when it launches next week. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>EA Sports released the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/college-football-25-gets-first-major-title-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first major title update</a> for College Football 25 on Thursday. Unfortunately, however, a couple significant bugs were uncovered after the update for College Football 25 released.</p>



<p>Within the game’s Dynasty mode, three main issues have been uncovered with one being the most problematic.</p>







<p>The two smaller, yet frustrating, problems involve incoming freshman not appearing in the position change screen during the offseason and annual non-conference games not rotating as they should. The big bug, however, involves the game’s schemes and playbooks.</p>



<p>“When using schemes and playbooks to change your coach playbook/scheme, your player archetypes and OVRs change based on the scheme,” the game’s developer account <a href="https://x.com/CFBDirect/status/1821621788906025060" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted on Twitter</a>.</p>



<p>The developers are actively investigating and working on a resolution to the problem, they said.</p>



<p>As far as what to do in the mean time, EA Sports says don’t use the schemes and playbooks screen to change them. Instead, you should make the changes you want within the Edit Coach screen until a fix is deployed.</p>



<p>Updates on the pending fix will come via social media.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Texas Chain Saw Massacre - Official Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Wes Keltner--CEO, designer, and director at Gun Media--provided a statement to GameSpot regarding TCM's time in Game Pass, as well as its forthcoming departure, in an effort to address the concerned fans. He also suggested the game may one day return to the subscription library, as some games have in the past.</p><div data-embed-type="breakoutBox"><p dir="ltr">"It’s hard to believe that it’s been one year since The Texas Chain Saw Massacre was released! We’ve had a blast creating new content and watching how the players engage and share the unique experiences our game creates. In a lot of ways we owe Game Pass and the team at Xbox for the awareness and success of the title so far. Now that our time with Game Pass is coming to an end, it’s time to focus on the future of Texas, and it looks very bright!</p><p dir="ltr">"Game Pass is a great program, especially for small teams like ours that are trying to push relatively new genres forward. It removes so many barriers to entry for players, and enables them to sample a variety of games and genres they may otherwise never touch. Some may not find horror multiplayer for them, but we found so many new players there. And while a great many subscribers use the program to "graze," we've got an active and loyal player base that's been there since launch on all platforms. And we'll see a lot of Game Pass players convert to paid--especially since they get a discount from Xbox to do so. That's a pretty cool deal if you ask me.</p><p dir="ltr">"We’ve enjoyed our time within the Game Pass ecosystem and who knows, maybe we’ll enter back into it again in the future. Being one of the most popular games in Game Pass this last year and winning the Xbox Excellence Award is usually a good sign that a game will not only return to that program, but also has a strong future full of new content and experiences. Bloody, gory, fun experiences. See you in Texas."</p></div><p dir="ltr">As for specifics on the "future of Texas," the TCM team has recently revealed the <a href="https://www.txchainsawgame.com/hub/content-pass" rel="nofollow">Content Pass</a>, which offers a bundle of upcoming DLC at a reduced price when compared to buying the content individually ($20 versus $45). The pass includes two new characters (one for each team), four upcoming cosmetic packs, a new execution pack, which is exactly what it sounds like--gruesome new kill animations--and early access to a free new game mode, Rush Week, coming in the future.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, more paid cosmetic packs are on the way, as well as several free updates, including a new map and weather variants for three of the game's existing maps.</p><p>Echoing Keltner's thoughts on the game's post-Game Pass roadmap, Gun's Matt Shotcha told a concerned player, "[G]ames come and go on Game Pass all the time. That's how the service works. It's been a year, and a great one at that [...] Don't worry, we still have all the content planned we always did. Support and content are not inherently tied to Game Pass."</p><p dir="ltr">In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-texas-chain-saw-massacre-review-thrill-of-the-hunt/1900-6418102/">Texas Chain Saw Massacre review</a>, I called it one of the scariest games I've ever played, giving it a score of 9 out of 10 and added, "When you hear that chainsaw revving, it's like nothing else in horror, no matter the medium."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Zombies Is Bigger Than Ever</p>

<p dir="ltr">As described in the official Call of Duty <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/08/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-deep-dive-terminus-map-intel#Horrors" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog</a>, the Vermin are "large, spider-like ravenous scuttlers with a central thorax that seems to take the form of a screaming human head." They are weak on their own, but are dangerous in groups, ripping themselves free from fallen zombie hosts. To attack, the Vermin sprint and leap at foes, and can even spew a corrosive substance to kill their prey. They can also evolve and transform into another insect-like creature, the flying Parasite.</p><p dir="ltr">These are some nasty-looking monsters, but Treyarch has confirmed (via <a href="https://x.com/ModernWarzone/status/1821574160176590923" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Modern Warzone on X</a>) that there will be an Arachnophobia setting in the game's options that will disable the Vermin's appearance.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a nice accessible setting to include, and one that has become more popular in recent years. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grounded/" data-ref-id="5000-504764">Grounded</a>, the Honey I Shrunk the Kids-like survival game from Obsidian that features various bugs as its primary enemy type, included an arachnophobia mode.

The shutdown is effective immediately.

A Meta spokesperson told Android Central that the cuts weren’t being made to “save money,” per se. Rather, these cuts are being made to ensure that Reality Labs stays within the new budgetary constraints and that Oculus Studios can make a “better long-term impact” in VR development.</p></blockquote></div><p>We tried to ask for more details, but Meta spokesperson Alaina Laszewski&nbsp;declined to comment. In its most recent earnings, Meta said that its Reality Labs division, which its VR efforts fall under, <a href="https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2024/Meta-Reports-Second-Quarter-2024-Results/default.aspx">lost nearly $4.5 billion</a>. </p><p>When Meta announced that it had acquired Ready at Dawn, it said that <a href="https://www.meta.com/blog/quest/welcoming-ready-at-dawn-to-facebook/?utm_source=www.readyatdawn.com&amp;utm_medium=oculusredirect#new_tab">the studio would</a> “continue creating memorable, immersive, and innovative VR content for gamers around the world as an independently-operated studio.” And while it did go on to release <a href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/pcvr/1711938725528735/?utm_source=www.oculus.com&amp;utm_medium=oculusredirect"><em>Lone Echo II</em> for the Rift and Rift S</a> — the game isn’t natively available for Meta’s standalone Quest headsets — Meta shut down the well-loved <em>Echo VR</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/31/23580356/meta-shut-down-echo-vr-oculus-quest-arena-ready-at-down">in August 2023</a>.</p><p>At the time, CTO Andrew “Boz” Bosworth <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/6/23588083/meta-shutting-down-echo-vr-john-carmack">said that</a> the resources to make <em>Echo VR</em> “could be put to other uses that I think will be useful to the now tens of millions of people who are in VR.” The Ready at Dawn team also said that it was <a href="https://medium.com/@EchoGames/an-update-on-the-future-of-echo-vr-7f074dca1ed1">working on its next project</a>, but now it seems that project won’t be released.</p></div><div><p>Most Popular</p><p>Most Popular</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/7/24211339/humane-ai-pin-more-daily-returns-than-sales"><h2>Humane’s daily returns are outpacing sales</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/6/24214471/google-chromecast-line-discontinued"><h2>Google is discontinuing the Chromecast line</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/7/24215275/google-tv-streamer-chromecast-gemini-interview"><h2>Why Google decided now’s the time to move on from Chromecast</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/7/24215440/intel-13th-14th-gen-crash-raptor-lake-integrator-warranty-lenovo-dell-hp-acer-asus"><h2>Will PC makers replace your crashing Intel chip?

Try as they might, console makers and game developers can't escape the weight of the Xbox One and PlayStation 4.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I've been slow to make any judgment calls on this generation of game and console sales because, however you look at it, this was the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>weirdest</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> generation shift in the game industry's history. It took place during the height of COVID-19 pandemic when more people spent time indoors, and amidst a technological shift that's made it possible to play triple-A games on portable devices like the Nintendo Switch and portable PC devices like the Steam Deck.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That's made direct comparisons with prior launches harder to make—but in the last week we got plenty of data to confirm an important fact: current-generation console sales are slowing down, and the last generation of consoles is partly to blame.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The three major data points are these: Xbox </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/xbox-hardware-revenue-is-in-decline-but-microsoft-says-subscriptions-and-content-define-success">reported a massive dip</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in game hardware sales that may mean Xbox Series X|S sales have peaked. Sony revealed that PlayStation 5 sales are going strong, but they're </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/playstation-5-hardware-sales-are-slipping-away">on track to miss projected targets</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that could weigh on their hopes for overall sales this generation.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These facts feel deeply intertwined with why Electronic Arts announced that the last-gen port </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/star-wars-jedi-survivor-double-jumps-to-last-gen-in-september">will arrive in September</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I’m delighted more people get to check out </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/game-developer-s-best-of-2023-bryant-francis-top-10-games">one of my favorite games from 2023</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. But this port undeniably shows how developers need the last generation of consoles to sell games.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Even a Jedi can’t run from the past">Even a Jedi can’t run from the past</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-earns-1-2-billion-from-live-service-titles-during-record-first-quarter">success</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> EA decided a last-generation port of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Jedi Survivor</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> could juice the game’s revenue. It would take an impressive cost/benefit analysis to make that decision, because it’s not like there was a button somewhere in EA that just said “push button to port game.” It’s challenging work to take a game optimized for newer consoles and optimize it for older hardware.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">EA was probably looking at data similar to what our colleagues at Omdia have been seeing. As you can see in the chart below, the active install base of Sony and Microsoft’s next-generation consoles only surpassed the previous generation in 2023—three years (really two and change, given how late the consoles launched in 2020) after their debut.</span></p><p>Image via Omdia.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That change has accelerated in 2024 but Omdia projects that in 2025, 25 percent of players will still be hanging out on older-generation consoles. Analyst James McWhirter pointed out to me that Sony reported in early 2023 that 30 percent of active PS5 users had never used a PS4, which is “good and bad” for the company.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“What we saw in the first half of the PS5's cycle was the adoption of PS5 outpaced the decline of active PS4 systems,” he said. “This tells us many PS5 purchasers never had a PS4. While positive in its own light it does shine a light on the prolonged cross-generation period we've seen continue into the second half of the cycle this year.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In other words, some PlayStation 4 players were happy to stay on their last-generation console.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Why? It’s not clear. An obvious answer might be that Sony and Xbox were both slow to roll out games that made the most of their new hardware—but third-party games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Jedi Survivor</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> could have convinced plenty of players to make the jump, and the excitement around new consoles seemed as strong as it was in prior years.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Other analysis indicates this slow adoption is due to games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Grand Theft Auto </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Online, Fortnite and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Minecraft</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Though both games have received graphical updates on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, their prior-gen versions look and play just fine. Younger audiences accustomed to playing these games with their friends may not see the need to upgrade if their online social spaces aren't dramatically impacted.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That’s probably partly true, but surely the number of players on mobile devices eclipsed console users for the latter two titles, and younger users wouldn’t have the purchasing power to drive that shift anyway.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s likely a combination of these and other factors that all were exacerbated by events no one could control: the economy and inflation got </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>weird</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> right in the window these consoles were rolling out.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I say “weird” and not “bad” because, on paper, the post-COVID-19 recovery (at least in the United States) has been strong. There’s a reason people have been calling this a “</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/23/opinion/biden-trump-vibecession.html">vibecession</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.” Inflation, “</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/greedflation-caused-more-half-last-100000899.html">greedflation</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">,” and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have all hit the market, but people still haven’t stopped spending money on entertainment.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Spending on travel, concerts, and Barbenheiemer exploded in the last two years, each driving knock-on economic stimulation for tourist attractions and areas around concert venues. Again, platforms like Ticketmaster drove prices upward to cash in on this interest—and are now reaping the rewards of allegedly gouging concertgoers for post-lockdown enthusiasm.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So if your household is shelling out hundreds for nosebleed tickets for Taylor Swift and buying custom Barbie outfits for repeat Barbenheimer outings, all while Kroger and other groceries twist your arm for basic groceries…upgrading your already-impressive game console may not look all that important.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What does this slow adoption mean for game developers?">What does this slow adoption mean for game developers?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I have no idea what the heck this slow adoption means for game developers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For now it’s clear developers are planning to launch last-gen and current-gen versions of their games. Just this morning Future Friends announced that it’s porting </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Vampire Survivors</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> onto PS4 and PS5. It’s a great title to span both generations. The already massively popular PC game doesn’t need fancy high-end graphics, so making a play for PlayStation is just all about making the game available for people anchored on that platform.</span></p><p>Image via Respawn Entertainment/Electronic Arts.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Some business brains in the industry are crossing their fingers for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Grand Theft Auto VI</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to drag players forward, as the series is liable to drive millions of dollars in sales within 24 hours of launch.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And it’s not like the spending shifts in 2022 and 2023 permanently dragged consumers away from games. Musicians are suffering from a massive economic hangover, with globally-popular acts canceling shows as tickets fail to sell. Disney’s Deadpool and Wolverine shot some life into the box office, but it’s still a bad summer for AMC and Regal. The economy is </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.npr.org/2024/04/25/1247253246/the-u-s-economy-slowed-down-in-the-first-three-months-of-2024-report-shows">slowing down a tad</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but we’re not anywhere near something like the 2008 financial crisis. Every end of the entertainment business is looking left and right, trying to figure out what the hell is happening.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For now, the best we can do is keep in touch with players on last-generation devices. Players don’t care about the economic needs of any particular company.

<strong>UPDATE 8.39pm:</strong> Following sightings of a new "definitive" <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/now%20surfaced%20on%20Steam">Doom 1 &amp; 2 bundle on Steam</a>, the same bundle how now surfaced on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/doom_doom_ii">GOG</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/doom-and-doom-ii-f5e089">Epic</a>, Switch's <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/doom-plus-doom-ii-switch/">eShop</a> (so far only in the US), the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/UP1003-PPSA21444_00-OSIRIS2000000000">PlayStation Store</a> for PS4 and PS5, and the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-gb/games/store/doom-doom-ii/9P46M5JQ2PTF/0010">Microsoft Store</a> for Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S.
</p>
<p>
All versions of the game cost $9.99 USD (around £8, with some variance depending on your platform of choice), and early reports - in lieu of an official announcement from id Software or Bethesda - are suggesting existing owners of either Doom 1 or Doom 2 will be upgraded to the new two-game bundle and its various expansion content for free.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>ORIGINAL STORY 8.23pm:</strong> As id Software's annual QuakeCon gets underway today, a new - and currently unannounced - Doom 1 &amp; 2 bundle has been sighted on Steam, promising "enhanced" versions of the classic shooters with a brand-new episode from Wolfenstein and Indiana Jones studio MachineGames.
</p>
<p>
As <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1821578978462699748">flagged by Wario64</a> on social media, a new listing combining 1993 FPS classic Doom and its illustrious 1994 sequel has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2280/DOOM__DOOM_II/">now surfaced on Steam</a>, seemingly replacing the individual listings previously available on Valve's platform. This new dual listing contains what are being described as the "definitive" versions of Doom 1 &amp; 2, complete with a lengthy feature list.
</p>
<p>
First and most expectedly, the new bundle contains the DOS versions of Doom 1 &amp; 2. That's alongside a number of additional campaigns, including TNT: Evilution and The Plutonia Experiment (two community created Doom 2 expansions later officially packaged together as Final Doom), plus Master Levels for Doom 2, Doom 2 expansion No Rest for the Living, and Sigil - John Romero's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/john-romeros-unofficial-fifth-doom-episode-sigil-is-finally-out">unofficial fifth episode</a> in the Doom saga.

<p>
There's also a brand-new campaign, Legacy of Rust, created by MachineGames and Nightdive Studios, as well as a new Deathmatch map pack featuring 25 maps. In total, that makes for 187 mission maps and 43 deathmatch maps across Doom 1 &amp; 2.
</p>
<p>
That, however isn't the end of things. Alongside the enhancements added in id's previous updates of Doom 1 &amp; 2 - which included upgraded visuals and modern controller support - this new version features the likes of online, cross-platform deathmatch and co-op for up to 16 players, and community-published mod support with an in-game mod browser.
</p>
<p>
It's also possible to select between the games' original midi soundtracks and Andrew Hulshult's IDKFA versions, with other enhancements including improved performance with multithreaded rendering supporting up to 4K resolution, BOOM source compatibility, new accessibility options, and expanded language support.
</p>
<p>
Notably, while Doom 1 &amp; 2's Steam page is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2280/DOOM__DOOM_II/">now live</a>, id Software hasn't yet formally announced this enhanced version of its classic shooters. It seems likely the full reveal treatment will come during QuakeCon, which runs from today, 8th August, until this Sunday, 11th June.
</p>
<p>
To coincide with the event, a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/quakecon2024">QuakeCon sale</a> is currently live on Steam, offering discounts on Bethesda and id Software titles until 21st August.

<p>When diving into the vast and wonderful world of esports, many end up wondering exactly who the best esports player of all time is. With so many immense players already in the industry, and many retired pros who have already cemented their names in the industry’s illustrious history, who among them can be truly classed as the top esports player ever?</p>



<p>Let’s hope this doesn’t disappoint too many people.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-greatest-esports-player-of-all-time">The Greatest Esports Player Of All Time</h2>



<p>To be the best esports player of all time, you need to tick more than just a few boxes. It’s not just about being solid at your game – you’ll also need to win tournaments, titles, and net a hefty stack of cash for your efforts. The best esports player needs to have an immense following made up of thousands – or even <strong>millions </strong>– of dedicated fans, and they should be synonymous with their chosen game.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>There are quite a few factors to think about when trying to decide who the greatest esports player of all time is. If we add up the criteria, who is the GOAT of esports?</p>



<p>There can only be one answer…</p>



<h2 id="h-johan-n0tail-sundstein">Johan ‘n0tail’ Sundstein</h2>



<p>Johan ‘n0tail’ Sundstein is without a doubt the greatest esports player of all time. While many other names were just short of number one, n0tail has to be the most successful esports player <strong>ever</strong>, putting him above everyone else. But why?</p>



<p>Not only is n0tail one of the best Dota 2 players in the world, but he is also a two-time back-to-back champion when it comes to The International (the biggest Dota 2 annual tournament). He won the two titles back in 2018 and 2019.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>N0Tail has also won four Major championships, making him one of the most well-decorated competitors in the Dota scene. If that wasn’t enough, he has won a staggering <strong>fifty </strong>lower-tier events, including DreamLeague and DreamHack. </p>



<p>And if <strong>that</strong> <strong>still wasn’t enough</strong>, he is one of the leading co-founders of OG, a brilliant and highly regarded esports organisation. Despite not competing since The International in 2021, the Danish-Faroese gamer claims he is ‘just taking a break’.</p>



<h3 id="h-n0tail-earnings">N0tail Earnings</h3>



<p>N0tail also has the highest earnings of any esports player in history, with an estimated $7.1 million earnings in prize money. He sits at more than half a million dollars ahead of the second-highest-earning esports player of all time.</p>



<p>Sundstein started his career competing in the game Heroes of Newarth but eventually switched to Dota 2, which was a decision that ultimately led to his massive success and monumental profile.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Not only is n0tail the highest-earning esports player of all time, but even some of his teammates in OG are in the top five. It just goes to show how valuable Dota 2 is.</p>



<h2 id="h-honorable-mentions">Honorable Mentions</h2>



<h3 id="h-lee-faker-sang-hyeok">Lee ‘Faker’ Sang-hyeok</h3>



<p>For many, Faker is the best esports player of all time, having won the League of Legends World Championship a record four times and having established himself as one of the most dominant esports players in history. He’s a rockstar competitor with a stunning profile, but he’s yet to break away from being ‘just’ a competitor and hasn’t won anywhere near as much as n0tail.</p>



<h3 id="h-ian-crimsix-porter">Ian ‘Crimsix’ Porter</h3>



<p>Crimsix is one of the biggest and most successful FPS-based esports players in the world. Over a career lasting more than a decade, Porter secured a whopping 38 chips and three Call of Duty world championship titles. For a while, he was the highest-earning esports pro in the COD space and was widely regarded as the pinnacle player of days gone by.</p>



<h3 id="h-oleksandr-s1mple-kostyliev">Oleksandr ‘s1mple’ Kostyliev</h3>



<p>When you think Counter-Strike esports, you think ‘s1mple’. Despite not being the winningest player in the scene, s1mple is widely known as one of the best esports players of all time, and his accolades speak for themselves. For years, he has been playing at the top of his game, and millions of CS fans have leant on his guidance and in-game tips to succeed in their own aspirations.</p>

<p>It is a crazy day when a Vice-presidential Candidate acknowledges esports. The popular (and newly announced VP for Kamala Harris) political figure, Tim Walz, recently acknowledged a Minnesota high school on their Valorant varsity team’s State Championship victory back in 2022.</p>



<p>Walz, who has been governor of Minnesota since 2019, has already been seen doing various sporting activities with his kids, such as football coaching and more. And now, it would seem the political figure has esports under his belt, too.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-tim-walz-congratulates-high-school-valorant-team-for-state-championship-victory-in-2022">Tim Walz Congratulates High School Valorant Team For State Championship Victory In 2022</h2>



<p>Back in 2022, the Apple Valley High School varsity Valorant team took home first place in the State Championship. Walz made sure to acknowledge this massive feat for the school, as he was well-known for acknowledging other sports too.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Congratulations on an undefeated season and winning the Minnesota Varsity League State Championship in Valorant. Competitive success requires more than mere physical strength and agility; it also demands mental fortitude and tactical planning.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Walz’s acknowledgement of esports is a huge feat for the industry, as in the past, many political figures have sought to restrict video games at various levels.</p>



<p><em>“With esports on the rise, I am extremely proud of you and the role you have taken on to grow esports participation at Apple Valley High School in Minnesota. You are at the helm of transforming a hobby into a potentially life-changing career in a new and innovative realm of sports.”</em></p>



<p>With <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/verizon-announces-free-high-school-esports-league/">Verizon’s new esports program</a> being introduced into US schools, we are looking at a very bright future for scholastic esports events and more.</p>

<p>When the Nintendo Switch launched in 2017, one thing it didn’t really have in its library were AAA games. It had major first-party games like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, but nothing from the bigger third-party developers. With the upcoming launch of the Nintendo Switch 2, there appears to be a shift happening with the games that’ll be available for players.</p>



<p>According to Paul Gale, the Nintendo Switch 2 will have “big launch window releases” from third-party studios. These include “significant” AAA games.</p>







<p>“A few major third party developers whom at E3 2017 weren’t anticipating Nintendo Switch taking off the way it did and didn’t have a Triple A title at launch/the show itself, are working on big launch window releases for Nintendo’s next system,” Gale posted <a href="https://x.com/paulgalenetwork/status/1820819933267403125?s=46" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on Twitter</a>. </p>



<p>“[Nintendo Switch 2] will have some early, significant ports, parallel releases, and exclusives.”</p>



<p>As far as what those AAA games on the Nintendo Switch 2 could be, that’s anyone’s guess.</p>



<p>Nintendo is expected to reveal its next console in early 2025 with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-reportedly-headed-for-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release rumored to be</a> for March 2025. The latest rumors on the system claim that it will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-will-be-backwards-compatible-and-support-4k-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">be backwards compatible and support 4K</a> resolution.</p>

		<p>Activision and Treyarch have released the gameplay reveal trailer for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Black Ops 6</a> Zombies game mode and the Terminus map, and it totally has a lot of zombie fighting in it. Also a speed boat, intriguingly… A reveal for the Liberty Falls map will come on 28th August during Call of Duty: Next.</p>
<p><iframe title="Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 - Round-Based Zombies Terminus Reveal Trailer | New Gameplay" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZexnXA4mMEk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>If there’s one thing that Activision wants you to know about this game mode, it’s that it’s “round-based”, just like all the zombies modes were before last year’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/15/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-2023-review/">Modern Warfare 3</a> made it all open world. This was not a particularly popular move, and so Activision is backtracking almost as fast as when the backlash to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/11/04/call-of-duty-infinite-warfare-review/">COD: Infinite Warfare</a> made “boots on the ground” the only thing they would ever say about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/11/10/call-of-duty-wwii-review/">Call of Duty: WWII</a>.</p>
<p>As featured in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/06/black-ops-6-zombies-cinematic-trailer-promises-gameplay-reveal-later-this-week/">the cinematic reveal</a> Terminus map is set in the Philippine Sea at a remote US naval base turned CIA outpost turned subterranean laboratory. As the Requiem crew are broken out of their confinement, they discover the bio-research in progress for Project Janus, and have to start busting it up.</p>
<p>Treyarch say that you’ll want to pick Grigori Weaver, Elizabeth Grey, Mackenzie ‘Mac’ Carver, and Maya Aguinaldo as player characters to get the richest story experience while playing this.</p>

<p>Getting back to the round-based format will have pretty much all of the zombies mode staples returning as well. There’s a main quest to follow and puzzle your way through across multiple attempts and explorations, but then there’s also plenty of side-content to discover as well with a whole host of easter eggs. It all builds up to (if you survive) a point where you need to extract.</p>
<p>For your character build, both pre-match and with a mid-game progression, there’s the returning systems of perks, weapons and loadouts, field upgrade abilities, and then series staples of perk-a-colas, pack-a-punch, ammo mods and more.</p>
<p>You’ll want to use everything you’ve got to blast away at the new upside-down head spiders called Vermin, flying Parasites, the newly armoured Manglers and the full body horror of the Amalgam</p>
<p>There’s a whole ton of detail to delve into, with specific examples, on <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/08/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-deep-dive-terminus-map-intel#Shamblers">the Call of Duty website here</a>.</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 lands on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, Xbox One and PC on 25th October. It will also be available on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Game Pass</a> tiers with day one games.</p>

            <p>Did The Gentlebros come up with the pun "Pi-Rats" and then work backwards from there in deciding that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cat-quest-pirates-of-the-purribean">Cat Quest 3</a> should be pirate themed? Or was "Purr-ibean" the initiating pun? I feel that the action-RPG sequel had to begin with one of wordplay or another, given that its Steam page boasts that it also has "furr-ocious spells" and "gla-meow-rous costumes".
</p>
<p>It's also claws-out now on Steam, which has me feline fine.

<p>I'll be honest, I'm not a huge fan of puns or punworlds, but I am a fan of Cat Quest. The first two games are good, accessible hack-and-slashers, with a colourful world to explore, and Cat Quest 2 introduced co-op. They're great games to play with your kids, as a sort of My First Action-RPG experience.
</p>
<p>Cat Quest 3 continues in kind with solo and local co-op. Its big new features are nautical combat (previous games eventually allowed your character to simply walk on water), a 2.5D world (rather than simply 2D), and a "refined" combat system that allows for attack combos and hot-swapping weapons. The latter sounds great to me, but I hope it doesn't move it beyond the ken of kids.
</p>
<p>The Gentlebros should have some time to enjoy releasing one game, but the introduction of Pi-Rats to the Cat Quest animal ecosystem begs the question of which animal pun-theme might appear in Cat Quest 4. I propose Vi-King Crabs.
</p>
<p>Cat Quest 3 is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2305840/Cat_Quest_III/">over on Steam</a> for £15.29/€18/$18.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The Callisto Protocol was long billed as the spiritual successor to Dead Space by Visceral Games, especially because it was being designed by Dead Space creator Glen Schofield. However, the game eventually flopped when it launched in December 2022. On Wccftech, Kai Tatsumoto <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-callisto-protocol-break-out-outbreak-break-a-leg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gave</a> it a 7.2/10:</p>
<p><em>While an incredible looker in screenshots and death scenes, The Callisto Protocol suffers from a lack of intriguing content that makes the twelve-plus hour journey through Black Iron Prison worth two, even perhaps one single playthrough. Crafting and skill trees are both minimal in nature (with both costing a heavy amount of credits where players might only be able to fully upgrade two or three weapons in the full playthrough) while melee combat and combat encounters as a whole feel largely scripted. The horror elements stand out as reason alone to play Striking Distance's debut horror game, but you might want to find yourself getting thrown back into Black Iron Prison rather than see the journey through to the end.</em></p>
<p>Why did the game turn out to be so disappointing? Well, Glen Schofield himself believes it's because it should have been delayed, but publisher Krafton refused. Speaking in a video interview with YouTuber Dan Allen Gaming, Schofield <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IIVia5aiUQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>:</p>
<p><em>I wanted about three and a half more months and I was led to believe for about three or four months that that's the way it was going to be. In October or September 21, I was told that we were going to get the time, just no regrets. That was the term that was being used, no regrets, just put whatever you want into the game. Then January comes around, and some of the folks come over, and they just said no, it's December of 2022, and I was like, it's not going to get done, and it's going to cost you more money.&nbsp;It's not like it costs you less money because you're getting it out three months sooner. If you want it done, I got to accelerate everything by three and a half months, which means I need to jam people on here. If I need 20 people, I actually get 30 or 40 because that learning curve will not adjust.</em></p>
<p>Glen Schofield <a href="https://wccftech.com/glen-schofield-leaves-striking-distance-after-the-callisto-protocols-failure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">left</a> developer Striking Distance Studios nearly a year ago. In the above interview, he explained he wanted to focus on his health and taking care of his daughter.</p>

Earlier this year, an executive at Roblox Studio suggested the game, which lets users create their own content and make money off in-game purchases, could provide jobs to kids living in slums. Now, one country has seemingly seen enough and has outright banned <em>Roblox</em>. </p><p>On August 7, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/yilmaztunc/status/1821259391087341579&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/yilmaztunc/status/1821259391087341579" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Turkey’s Minister of Justice Yılmaz Tunç announced on Twitter</a></span> that <em>Roblox</em> had been banned completely in the country “due to content that could lead to the exploitation of children.”</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.turkiyetoday.com/turkiye/roblox-banned-in-turkiye-following-nationwide-instagram-block-37398/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.turkiyetoday.com/turkiye/roblox-banned-in-turkiye-following-nationwide-instagram-block-37398/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Türkiye Today</em></a></span> says the sudden ban was primarily driven by recent reports of in-game sexual content as well as alleged child exploitation happening in <em>Roblox</em><br></p><p> “According to our Constitution,” posted Tunç, “our State is obliged to take the necessary measures to ensure the protection of our children. It is everyone’s duty to look out for, protect, and support the best interests of our children.” </p><p>In a statement provided to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-responds-to-platform-ban-in-turkiye&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-responds-to-platform-ban-in-turkiye" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Eurogamer</em></a></span>, Roblox claimed it had spent the last two decades making the game “one of the safest online platforms” for its youngest players. </p><p>“Ensuring the safety of our users is at the core of everything we do,” a Roblox spokesperson told <em>Eurogamer</em>. “We respect the laws and regulations in countries where we operate and share local lawmakers’ commitment to children.

In April, Roblox Studio head Stefano Corazza was asked about growing concerns about children being exploited in <em>Roblox.</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/roblox-boss-kids-child-labor-exploit-indonesia-slum-1851387795&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-boss-kids-child-labor-exploit-indonesia-slum-1851387795">This was his answer</a></span>: </p><p>“So, I can be like 15 years old, in Indonesia, living in a slum, and then now, with just a laptop, I can create something, make money, and then sustain my life.”<br></p><p>This comment didn’t go over well online and led to a lot of backlash.

We are happy today to share that we will extend 2v8’s initial run until next week, August 15 @ 11am ET. <a href="https://t.co/2Udb1mmumz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/2Udb1mmumz</a></p>— Dead by Daylight (@DeadbyDaylight) <a href="https://twitter.com/DeadbyDaylight/status/1821547941246505174?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 8, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>In <a href="https://x.com/DeadbyDaylight/status/1821547943507152969" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a new post on X/Twitter</a>, Behaviour Interactive announced today that the initial run for 2v8 mode would now conclude on Thursday, August 15, at 8 am PT / 11 am ET. More interestingly, Behaviour Interactive disclosed the reason for extending the 2v8 trial run was due to the high demand from the community, in addition to <a href="https://x.com/DeadbyDaylight/status/1821547943507152969" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">revealing</a> that 2v8 accounted for over 40% of all matches played in Dead by Daylight since its debut late last month, even though 2v8 had long queue times. </p><p>"We've been blown away by your reaction to 2v8 these past two weeks, and we've heard your demand loud and clear for the mode to be extended beyond its planned end date," Behaviour Interactive wrote in the post. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Although fans have requested 2v8 for years, there has yet to be an ETA on if/when 2v8 will be a permanent mode in Dead by Daylight. However, in a separate post, Behaviour Interactive <a href="https://x.com/DeadbyDaylight/status/1821547944820023425" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> that the introduction of 2v8 was "only the first iteration" with intentions to refine the mode before making it a permanent staple in Dead by Daylight. Specifically, the development teams want to address challenges related to 2v8's matchmaking and variety in Killers, along with "a more compelling Survivor experience." </p><p>For those unfamiliar, 2v8 mode, as the name implies, is a game mode in Dead by Daylight that increases the player count from 1 killer and 4 survivors to 2 killers and 8 survivors. With the increase in player count, 2v8 introduces a few changes to the core Dead by Daylight gameplay experience. These include a larger map and the removal of Hooks and Perks. </p><p>In our review of Dead by Daylight, which we awarded a 9/10, IGN wrote: "After almost five years, Dead by Daylight has grown into an incredible slasher film simulator and the best asymmetrical multiplayer game around." </p><p><em>Taylor is a Reporter at IGN.
