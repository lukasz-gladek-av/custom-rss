            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo and Monolith Soft have announced <i>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</i>, a remastered version of the 2015 Wii U JRPG&nbsp;<em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em>.</p>

<p>Launching on March 20th,&nbsp;<em>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition&nbsp;</em>looks to be doing for its parent game what 2020's&nbsp;<em>Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xenoblade-chronicles-definitive-edition-announced-for-switch">did for the first game</a> in the series.</p>

<p>Right now, we don't know a lot about what kind of enhancements we can expect from this remaster, other than that it will be "visually enhanced" and that it'll also feature new story elements, although we don't know what those story elements are yet.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xenoblade-chronicles-x-remaster-free-roaming.jpg?itok=ufcTCqEX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xenoblade-chronicles-x-remaster-free-roaming.jpg?itok=Z_rx5lQL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Xenoblade Chronicles X&nbsp;</em>is finally getting a remaster.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em>, it's a JRPG from 2015 that is, believe it or not, part of the overarching&nbsp;<em>Xenoblade Chronicles&nbsp;</em>series.</p>

<p>Although it bears the&nbsp;<em>Xenoblade&nbsp;</em>name, it's not actually narratively connected to any previous entries in the series, although you'll likely recognize some common elements and themes if you're a fan of the franchise.</p>

<p>Unlike other&nbsp;<em>Xenoblade&nbsp;</em>games, you play as a custom-created character in&nbsp;<em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em>. When you awake from a lifepod after a crash-landing on an alien planet, you must help humanity to explore and colonize this planet, dealing with its dangers as you go.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking,&nbsp;<em>Xenoblade Chronicles X&nbsp;</em>offers similar action-RPG gameplay to its predecessors, although the core exploration gameplay is much more about cataloguing and surveying a new planet.</p>




<p>At first, you'll be exploring the beautiful and savage planet of Mira on foot, but after a while, you'll gain access to a mech with which you can reach certain areas and defeat certain enemies more easily.</p>

<p><em>Xenoblade Chronicles X&nbsp;</em>is the latest in a line of Wii U games to get Switch remasters. Others include&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/super-mario-3d-world-bowsers-fury-announced-for-nintendo-switch"><em>Super Mario 3D World</em></a>, horror game&nbsp;<em>Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water</em>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/wonderful-101-remastered-preview">quirky actioner&nbsp;<em>The Wonderful 101</em></a>.</p>

<p><em>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition&nbsp;</em>launches <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">exclusively on Nintendo Switch</a> on March 20th.</p>

It’s not coming — at least, not for a while. In an <a href="https://play.date/stereo-dock/">update to the Stereo Dock’s page</a>, the company describes the challenges it faced in getting a good prototype, but says that, in the end, the device didn’t meet its standards. </p></div><p>The Stereo Dock was going to be a small desktop Bluetooth speaker and pen holder that you could attach a Playdate to. Panic first <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523929/playdate-preorder-game-lineup-dock-announced">announced the Stereo Dock</a> in 2021, when it was still working toward releasing the Playdate. </p><p>On the web page, the company describes the unexpected challenges it faced getting the Stereo Dock to market: </p><div><blockquote><p>What happened? Well, our first regret was assuming that our factory at that time — a factory that made lots of Bluetooth speakers — could easily design the electronics for us, saving us lots of time and money. That went pretty well at first. But they, in turn, outsourced the Bluetooth software and chipset to&nbsp;<strong>another</strong>&nbsp;company in&nbsp;<strong>another </strong>country.</p><p>As a result, the Stereo Dock would crash often — rapidly adjusting the volume would do it. The Bluetooth pairing/unpairing experience was rough. And when we played music, it just didn’t sound very good. The back-and-forth between three companies trying to fix bugs became a huge challenge. And worst of all: the cost of the Stereo Dock kept getting higher and higher.</p></blockquote></div><div><figcaption><em>The Playdate Stereo Dock could still happen someday.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>GIF: Panic</cite></p></div><p>Ultimately, Panic says it had to “hit pause” on the Stereo Dock, because it was spending more money developing the device than it would likely make back, and the prototypes, while “beautiful,” weren’t good enough. “And if we’re going to ship a product,” the company writes, “it has to be, at least, good.” </p><p>In the meantime, Panic says it’s focusing on the Playdate, “as our new factory comes online and production once again resumes.” The company plans to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/24/24278678/dont-panic">showcase some updates</a> and surprises on October 31st at 1PM ET.</p></div><div><p>Most Popular</p><p>Most Popular</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/28/24276043/apple-new-usb-c-magic-mouse-charging-port-bottom"><h2>Apple put the Magic Mouse’s charging port on the bottom again</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24279307/apple-mac-m4-updates-news-announcements"><h2>All the news from Apple’s ‘week’ of Mac announcements</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/28/24273124/apple-imac-m4-chip-announced-price-release-date"><h2>Apple updates the iMac with new colors and an M4 chip</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282533/amazon-mac-mini-leak-specs-m4-size"><h2>Amazon leaks tiny Mac Mini with M4 Pro</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/28/24275569/apple-usb-c-magic-keyboard-mouse-trackpad-no-lightning"><h2>Apple’s new Magic Keyboard, Magic Mouse, and Magic Trackpad have USB-C</h2></a><hr></li></ol></div></div></article></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But it feels fitting that <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em>, a beloved but mostly overlooked game from 2015, will end up being part of the current console’s end-of-life send-off. <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</em> arrives on March 20, 2025, with enhanced visuals and new story beats. </p><p>Here’s the trailer:</p><p><em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em> is a futuristic game about trying to rebuild humanity on a distant and hostile planet called Mira. The large-scale world is full of giant monsters to fight, mechs to customize and ride, and lots of MMO-style fetch quests and resource harvesting. There’s also multiplayer-specific missions and Global Nemesis Battles in addition to all of the existing character affinities and skill trees to manage. </p><p>It’s Monolith Soft’s immediate follow-up to <em>Xenoblade Chronicles</em> for the Wii, and had a bit more of the mech-infused flavor of studio cofounder Tetsuya Takahashi’s previous RPG series,<em> Xenogears </em>and<em> Xenosaga</em>. It’s also precisely the sort of game that would benefit from some Definitive Edition cleanup, and possibly even the added horsepower of a Switch 2 whenever it finally arrives. </p><p>In the meantime, it’s exciting to see the entire <em>Xenoblade</em> series up to this point in one place. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xenoblade-chronicles-3-nintendo-switch-jrpg-impressions-1849357306&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xenoblade-chronicles-3-nintendo-switch-jrpg-impressions-1849357306"><em>Xenoblade Chronicles 3</em></a></span> and its beefy expansion were excellent, and while I can’t wait to see what Monolith Soft does next, an upgrade port of <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X </em>is the perfect thing to tide fans over unit its next project is officially announced. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The highly popular computer game from the 1970s, The Oregon Trail, is being turned into an action-comedy movie by Apple.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/oregon-trail-movie-apple-1236045454/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Hollywood Reporter</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-oregon-trail-is-getting-a-movie-adaptation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameIndustry.Biz</a>), The Oregon Trail is receiving a movie adaptation by Apple. Will Speck and Josh Gordon will direct and produce the movie. The duo is responsible for movies like Blades of Glory and Office Christmas Party.</p>



<p>Moreover, Oscar winners The Lucas Bros. and Max Reisman will be responsible for writing the screenplay that follows the journey of a 19th-century pioneer on the Oregon Trail. Emmy winners Benj Pasek and Justin Paul will be brought on to provide original music. The movie is also rumoured to have “a couple of original musical numbers in the vein of Barbie.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Oregon Trail was a computer game that exploded in popularity in the 1990s. It was developed by Bill Heinemann, Don Rawitsch, and Paul Dillenberger in 1971 and released by MECC in 1974. The game’s goal was to “teach school children about the life of a 19th-century pioneer on the Oregon Trail,” where the students could be a wagon leader who guides a group of settlers.</p>



<p>Oregon Trail received a remake from GameLoft in 2022. The remake featured new playable journeys, upgraded visuals, and other enhancements while staying faithful to the source material. The game’s most famous aspect has been the multiple hazards you can face on your journeys, including broken limbs, snakebites, many diseases, and even dysentery.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Nintendo has announced <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/xenoblade-chronicles-10">Xenoblade Chronicles X</a>: Definitive Edition, a souped up version of the acclaimed 2015 sci-fi action-RPG released on Wii U, which will bring enhanced visuals and more on its release next year.</p>
<p>"The year is 2054. Humans have fled Earth amidst a destructive intergalactic war. As one of the survivors and a member of the New Los Angeles (NLA) colony, the mission is to help build a new home on the sprawling, hostile planet Mira," the official blurb reads.</p>
<p>"This seamless open world across five otherworldly continents is teeming with unknown creatures – some of which are epic in scale – and players will fight for the future of humanity." You can check out a trailer for Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition below.</p>

<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition will include added story elements, as well as customisable avatars on release. Meanwhile, players will be able unlock a "powerful" Skell, but only once they have done what they need to prove themselves to the BLADE organisation. A Skell, for those unfamiliar, is a giant mech that will aid in exploration across Mira.</p>
<p>The game will also feature some multiplayer-specific missions. Nintendo notes a Switch Online membership and a Nintendo Account are required for online play.</p>
<p>The addition of Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition to the Switch library now means every game in the series is playable on one console, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/xenoblade-chronicles">Xenoblade Chronicles</a> 1 - 3.</p>
<p>In particular, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xenoblade-chronicles-3-review-a-jrpg-masterpiece">Xenoblade Chronicles 3 received a glowing review from Eurogamer</a> in 2022, described as "a JRPG masterpiece".</p>
<p>While Xenoblade Chronicles X shares thematic references with the other games in the series, it is a standalone story and considered one of the best games on the Wii U. Now it follows plenty of other Nintendo-published games with a swanky Switch port.</p>
<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition will release on 20th March next year, for Nintendo Switch. No mention of that elusive <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> console.</p>

			<p>Following the expiration of the Dragon Age: The Veilguard review embargo, lots of media and industry people have started sharing their thoughts on BioWare's latest RPG, including Larian Studios Director of Publishing Michael Douse. In a lengthy tweet <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1850949592667590700?" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> on X, Douse showered the game with high praise:</p>
<p><em>I’ve been playing Dragon Age: The Veilguard in complete secrecy (behind my backpack at the office in front of a giant window, in the kitchen). From me, you may be wondering “is this a game compatible with my experience during BG3” so I’ll tackle it from that perspective. </em><em>The answer is yes. It is to a heavy, 9 season long show what a well-made, character driven, binge-worthy Netflix series is.</em></p>
<p><em>It has a good sense of propulsion and forward momentum. The combat system is honestly brilliant (to me, a mix of Xenoblade &amp; Hogwarts which is giga-brain genius). It knows when it needs a tentpole narrative moment, and it knows when to let you toy around with your class and exploit some of its stronger elements. </em><em>More important, to me, it feels like the first Dragon Age game that truly knows what it wants to be.</em></p>
<p><em>In short, if you want some character driven romping with a strong combat system in a universe you know, love, or have heard of, it is much better than the average action game, and much less heavy than the gargantuan RPGs that may intimidate at times. In a word, it’s fun!</em></p>
<p><em>To me, I’m extremely happy BioWare gets to stick around - presumably - in these uncertain (because of moronic corporate greed) times. An existential game, and a fun one at th</em>at.</p>
<p>As I jokingly replied via tweet, it was not quite <em>complete </em>secrecy. I have known Michael for years and have him on my Steam friends list, so I noticed he was playing Dragon Age: The Veilguard while I was also going through it for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard-biowares-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review</a>. Having said that, as you already know if you read my evaluation of the game, I wholeheartedly agree with Douse's assessment of BioWare's latest work. It should definitely appeal to franchise fans but also to those who enjoyed games like Larian's own masterpiece Baldur's Gate 3. It's different, but there are many common threads that will make fans of Western RPGs happy if they give it a chance.</p>
<p>The game is out in two days on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/intel-core-ultra-9-285k-review-a-new-era-for-efficiency-but-is-it-right-for-you/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/intel-core-ultra-9-285k-review-a-new-era-for-efficiency-but-is-it-right-for-you.1021995/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/intel-core-ultra-9-285k-review-a-new-era-for-efficiency-but-is-it-right-for-you/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Intel Core Ultra 9 285K represents a shift in Intel’s strategy, focusing on power efficiency over raw performance. It’s part of the new Core Ultra 200S series, bringing promises of lower energy consumption, cooler temperatures, and improved productivity. However, early adopters may encounter unexpected hurdles. </p>



<p>After spending time using the new CPU exclusively, let’s explore what this new chip offers, where it shines, and whether it’s the right upgrade for you.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-new-a-fresh-start-and-new-challenges">What’s New: A Fresh Start and New Challenges</h2>



<h3 id="h-new-naming-convention-and-socket-requirements">New Naming Convention and Socket Requirements</h3>



<p>The Core Ultra 9 285K introduces Intel’s new naming scheme, replacing the old “Core i” branding. This chip is comparable to the Core i9 series but brings more than just a new name. It’s built using TSMC’s manufacturing process, the same foundry behind AMD and Nvidia chips. </p>



<p>The Core Ultra 200S series also require the new LGA 1851 socket, meaning you’ll need a compatible motherboard to make the jump. And while Intel’s new approach looks to the future, the switch to the Core Ultra platform isn’t entirely seamless, especially for early adopters.</p>



<h3 id="h-pc-build-and-specifications">PC Build and Specifications</h3>



<p>Before getting into the actual review of the CPU, it’s important to note the hardware used for this review. The CPU is, as you’d expect, the Intel Core Ultra 9 285K. It’s sitting on an MSI MPG z890 Carbon WiFi motherboard with 48GB of G.Skill Trident Z5 CK CU-DIMM&nbsp;DDR5-8200 RAM and a Nvidia RTX 4090 FE graphics card. For cooling the CPU, the machine is using the&nbsp;<a href="http://go.corsair.com/4PZZrM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Corsair H150i iCue Link LCD AIO</a>&nbsp;along with six iCue Link fans. The entire PC is sitting in a <a href="http://go.corsair.com/4PZZrM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Corsair iCue 5000D RGB</a> Airflow ATX mid-tower case.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Specification</strong></th><th><strong>Details</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Architecture</td><td>Arrow Lake-S</td></tr><tr><td>Cores</td><td>24 (8 P-cores/16 E-cores)</td></tr><tr><td>Threads</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td>Base Clock</td><td>3.7 P-core/3.2 E-core (GHz)</td></tr><tr><td>Max Clock</td><td>6/4.4 GHz</td></tr><tr><td>Socket</td><td>LGA 1851</td></tr><tr><td>Process</td><td>3nm</td></tr><tr><td>L3 Cache</td><td>36mb</td></tr><tr><td>L2 Cache</td><td>40mb</td></tr><tr><td>Price</td><td>$589</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-installation-issues-a-frustrating-experience">Installation Issues: A Frustrating Experience</h2>



<p>Setting up the Core Ultra 9 285K proved more frustrating than it should have. After building the machine, I was faced with numerous boot issues that left the system stuck at the BIOS splash screen in a frustrating boot loop. The machine would work fine through the Windows 11 installation, but would then have issues arise after going through the initial setup.</p>



<p>It took reaching out directly to our motherboard manufacturer — in this case, MSI — to figure out the actual cause and a workaround.</p>



<p>From what I was told, there was an issue with Windows 11 and its  24H2 update. Specifically, it came down to connecting a discrete graphics card — something that almost everyone will do when building a PC — and trying to boot up. If you tried to use your AMD, Nvidia, or Intel GPU, you’re likely to run into this problem. Luckily, there’s a temporary fix.</p>



<h3 id="h-our-workaround">Our Workaround</h3>



<p>If you’re installing one of these new Intel Core Ultra CPUs with integrated graphics, follow these steps to avoid the headaches I encountered:</p>



<ol>
<li>Connect your monitor to the motherboard’s integrated graphics first.</li>



<li>Download and install all necessary drivers from the manufacturer’s website, as Windows updates won’t help just yet.</li>



<li>Turn off the PC, disconnect from the integrated graphics, and connect your discrete GPU.</li>



<li>Boot into Bios</li>



<li>Disable integrated graphics in the BIOS to avoid conflicts.</li>
</ol>



<p>These steps worked for me, but the process feels cumbersome, especially for anyone spending a premium on early adoption. I was told fixes are on the way, but for now, installation may be more frustrating than it’s worth.</p>



<h2 id="h-everyday-performance-quiet-cool-and-efficient">Everyday Performance: Quiet, Cool, and Efficient</h2>



<p>Once set up, the Core Ultra 9 285K impresses with its efficiency and thermal management. Power consumption remains low during everyday tasks, and temperatures stay well within safe limits.</p>



<ul>
<li>Average power usage during light tasks: 45 to 55 watts (W)</li>



<li>Maximum power during heavy benchmarking: 145W</li>



<li>Typical temperatures: between 43°C and 50°C</li>



<li>Peak temperature during stress tests: 87°C</li>
</ul>



<p>When looking back at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/intel-i9-14900k-cpu-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Intel Core i9 14900K</a>, you can see just how big of a drop that is. The 14900K saw temperatures that maxed at 108°C and a max wattage of 304W when in the heaviest use. That saw drops of 52% in max power consumption and 19.4% in max temperature. And that comes with no change in the cooling or case being used from the last review.</p>



<p>This chip offers excellent stability for daily use, making it a great option for users who value quiet operation and energy efficiency.</p>



<h2 id="h-gaming-performance-a-step-to-the-side">Gaming Performance: A Step to the Side</h2>



<p>In gaming, the Core Ultra 9 285K offers performance comparable to Intel’s previous generations. While games run smoothly and look good, there’s no significant improvement over recent chips like the 13th or 14th-gen models.</p>



<ul>
<li>Games performed well without relying on upscaling technologies like DLSS or FSR.</li>



<li>Power and temperatures remained low during gaming sessions, even under extended play.</li>
</ul>



<p>However, gamers with recent hardware won’t see major gains by upgrading to the 285K. Games like Cyberpunk 2077 and F1 23 had solid performances, but nothing stood out after regular play time. </p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-productivity-performance-a-strong-contender">Productivity Performance: A Strong Contender</h2>



<p>For productivity tasks, the Core Ultra 9 285K shines. It handles video rendering and 3D modeling efficiently, with stable performance across various benchmarks.</p>



<ul>
<li>DaVinci Resolve rendering times:
<ul>
<li>1080p60: 1 minute 53 seconds</li>



<li>1440p60: 3 minutes 16 seconds</li>



<li>4K60: 6 minutes 9 seconds</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Blender rendering saw power usage peak at 132 watts, but most tasks kept it under 90 watts.</li>
</ul>



<p>This level of performance makes the 285K ideal for content creators who need reliable rendering power without excessive heat or energy consumption. </p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Benchmark</strong></th><th><strong>Results</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Blender</td><td>6:33 Render Time</td></tr><tr><td>7-Zip Compression</td><td>166,784 MIPS</td></tr><tr><td>Geekbench 6 Multi-Core</td><td>19930</td></tr><tr><td>Geekbench 6 Single-Core</td><td>2658</td></tr><tr><td>Cinebench 2024 Multi-Core</td><td>2282</td></tr><tr><td>Cinebench 2024 Single-Core</td><td>131</td></tr><tr><td>CPU Profile (3D Mark)</td><td>17,579</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-is-the-core-ultra-9-285k-worth-it">Is the Core Ultra 9 285K Worth It?</h2>



<p>The Core Ultra 9 285K brings meaningful improvements in efficiency, but it feels like the starting point for Intel’s next chapter rather than a revolutionary leap forward. Here’s our take on who should consider it and who might be better off waiting.</p>



<h3 id="h-who-should-buy-it">Who Should Buy It?</h3>



<ul>
<li>Users upgrading from older systems (5+ years) looking for better efficiency and future-proofing</li>



<li>Content creators and professionals focused on video editing, 3D rendering, or other CPU-heavy tasks</li>



<li>Energy-conscious users who prioritize quiet, efficient setups</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-who-should-wait">Who Should Wait?</h3>



<ul>
<li>Gamers with recent Intel or AMD hardware, as performance gains are minimal</li>



<li>Those interested in AMD’s upcoming Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which may offer better value</li>



<li>Budget-conscious upgraders waiting for 14th-gen Intel CPUs to drop in price</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-final-thoughts-a-glimpse-of-the-future-with-a-few-hiccups">Final Thoughts: A Glimpse of the Future with a Few Hiccups</h2>



<p>The Intel Core Ultra 9 285K is a solid introduction to Intel’s next era, offering improved efficiency and stable performance. However, the installation issues and lack of noticeable gaming gains make it hard to recommend to everyone.</p>



<p>If you’re overdue for an upgrade or need reliable productivity performance, the 285K could be a good choice. But for gamers or those already using recent hardware, it’s worth waiting for better stability, more driver support, and potential price drops. </p>



<p>This chip lays the foundation for Intel’s future, but it’s not yet the must-have upgrade many were hoping for. Early adopters should expect some challenges, but the long-term potential is promising.</p>

Activision quality assurance staff who worked on the just-released <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> have walked out in protest at the company's return-to-work policy.
</p>
<p>
Staff at Activision's quality assurance studio in Eden Prarie, Minnesota, were told to return to the office full-time back in January, after years of remote or hybrid working. At the time, <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoUK/status/1851263877230612869">the move was criticised by the company's biggest union as a "soft layoff"</a>. Nine months later, the row over this policy's effects rumbles on. 
</p>
<p>
Last Friday, Eden Prarie staff members took strike action backed by the Communications Workers of America (CWA), which claimed in a <a href="https://www.cwa7250.org/index.php/11-news/303-activision-workers-to-rally-for-wfh-accommodations">statement</a> that Call of Duty publisher Activision was "insisting workers must work in the office - even those with serious medical conditions and doctor's recommendations to work from home". 
</p>
<p>
Ahead of the protest, Activision workers group ABetterABK issued a <a href="https://x.com/ABetterABK/status/1849816772670578822">statement</a> saying the "unequal policy" had "unquestionably harmed disabled employees and employees in need of work from home accomodations", who it claims have been unfairly refused exception from return-to-office work in the months since the policy's introduction. 
</p><p>
So why strike now? Well, last Friday's Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 launch was an attention-grabbing date, for one. ABetterABK's statement also references employees being "disrespected" by a recent company email discussing this October's National Disability Employment Awareness Month.
</p>
<p>
"[The email] depicted a disabled person working from home while our coworkers in need are not allowed this essential tool for equal accessibility," the statement claimed. "[Activison] has been championing DE&amp;I while they continually fail us."
</p>
<p>
Images of the protest show around 30 staff holding CWA signs. The walkout also attracted the attention of local media.

<p>
"We work on Call of Duty, we were part of the QA team that worked on Black Ops 6 that just released today," a striking staff member and ABetterABK union steward told Fox 9. 
</p>
<p>
"We have worked on Modern Warfare 2 which was the most profitable game the company ever released - and that was done remotely." 
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">This afternoon, AQAU-CWA members held a rally protesting Activision and Microsoft's refusal to allow work from home accommodations to employees who need it.

<p>
In a statement to Eurogamer on the protest, an Activision spokesperson told me that the company acknowledged returning to offices had been "an adjustment for some" and that discussions over specific employee's needs were still "ongoing", the best part of a year since the policy was first announced.
</p><p>
"We respect our employees' rights to express their point of view," an Activision spokesperson told Eurogamer. "We understand that returning to the office has been an adjustment for some. We engage in an interactive process with employees who request accommodations. This is an ongoing conversation at the bargaining table, and we will continue to discuss our respective interests in that forum."

		<p>If I had enrolled in one of Dr. Jones’ courses at Marshall College, I’d probably have demanded my money back. Oh sure, he knows his stuff, and his passion for archaeology and preserving stuff in museums is without doubt, but his impromptu field work probably means that he barely spends any time doing the <em>actual</em> teaching you’d expect him to. It should come as no surprise that, after a break-in at Marshall College by a very, very, very tall man, he takes that as an excuse to go gallivanting once again in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Gamescom Date Reveal Trailer - Indiana Jones and the Great Circle" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/STrKl828Aeg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Let’s address the priceless porcelain elephant in the room, because if there’s one element that has proven to be rather divisive since Indiana Jones and the Great Circle’s reveal, it’s the mixed first and third-person views that MachineGames has leant upon for this game. Given how Indiana Jones helped inspire the third-person action of Tomb Raider and Uncharted, it would have been very natural for it to come full circle with third-person adventuring – after all, that’s what we saw in Indiana Jones and the Emperor’s Tomb, two decades ago – but that’s not MachineGames’ speciality, so they’ve gone predominantly first-person instead.</p>


<p>In fact, the game is probably 99% first person, with the only brief cuts to third-person coming when swinging on Indy’s trademark whip, pulling himself up to a ledge or a little bit of climbing. It works decently well, but I’d personally argue that they could ditch third-person entirely – we’ve had countless examples like Dishonored, Mirror’s Edge and more that have special abilities and slick movement entirely in first-person, and Indy’s just a dude who does a bit of clambering and swinging in comparison.</p>
<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle quickly grabbed my attention as I played through the opening stages. There’s a really intriguing blend of linear and open levels, of action, stealth and puzzles, all wrapped up in the pulpy action adventuring of a classic Indiana Jones story.</p>

<p>Investigating the nighttime break-in at Marshall College is a quick prologue and introduction to the wider story, a familiar starting point as you and Marcus Brody try to figure out what was stolen and who did it. Crucial clues then see Indy immediately packing to head off to the Vatican –&nbsp;it’s alright, someone else can fill in for his classes.</p>

<p>Messaging a good friend in the clergy en route, it’s clear that this won’t be a haven of safety for an inquisitive American. Set shortly after Raiders of the Lost Ark in 1937, it’s the height of fascism in pre-WW2 Europe, and the Vatican is now flooded with patrolling Blackshirts that you have to sneak (or clobber) your way past.</p>
<p>You can absolutely use stealth to your advantage, hunkering down behind objects and out of sight, picking up objects and throwing them to cause distractions for you to move to other cover, but this isn’t Splinter Cell. Stealth is often more of a prelude to some robust and rambunctious brawling, without the ability to attach to cover or do corner takedowns, so you’ll invariably resort to fisticuffs at some point with left and right hooks, blocking incoming swings to let you counter, and grabbing items to wallop enemies with. Each item will break after just a few hits, whether it’s a rake or a bell that makes a delightful clanging sound as you clobber someone over the head –&nbsp;even more satisfying if it’s a canned takedown from behind.</p>
<p>One thing I didn’t really latch onto was using the whip for anything but traversal. In the moment, I was happier to wallop enemies instead, but that’s something I’ll have to remind myself to do for the full game.</p>

<p>You can, of course, resort to firearms as well, whether that’s Indy’s revolver or grabbing a dropped gun from an enemy. Don’t expect a Doom-like arsenal of guns to be stuffed into Indy’s back pocket, or even a Halo-style two-gun limit. This is more like the Mirror’s Edge of having just the clip that’s in a gun before you need to drop it – though you can also use empty rifles to hit people, which is a little amusing.</p>
<p>If that doesn’t tell you what you need to know about the gunplay, then the other thing is that a straight up headshot won’t kill an enemy, even if they’re not wearing a helmet. It took me by surprise while playing, but it makes sense. Two shots to kill at the default difficulty will encourage more of a stealthy approach and lead to more brawling.</p>
<p>You’re nicely rewarded for exploring the nooks and crannies of levels, with MachineGames having snuck a bunch of little side puzzles and secrets in. It makes you feel clever when you root around on a guy’s desk and find a note talking about some kind of iconoggraphy, only to spot that particular motif and realise that it’s the trigger for a secret passageway.</p>
<p>You’ll also be on the hunt for the books that feed the character progression. You need to then action those books by spending Adventure Points that you’ve collected for performing various feats and mission goals, mind you, but there’s some nifty abilities, such as Punch Out restoring stamina with a KO, Lucky Hat giving Indy another chance after being downed himself, if he can just drag himself across the floor to reach his fedora, and plenty more besides.</p>

<p>The trip through to the Vatican was a fairly directed and linear level, but jumping ahead to a visit to a dig site at Gizeh showed off the other side to this Indiana Jones game. This presents a much broader region to explore, with a workers’ camp that’s a safe haven to return to with Dame Nawal a handy ally to give you the main mission, a small village, and then a whole host of dig sites around the Sphinx.</p>
<p>It took a while to realise that the game wasn’t going to hold my hand here, shepherding me through to important events and mission objectives, wrapping me up in a disguise to get past German guards patrolling the desert. As I first stepped out of the camp, I was immediately confronted and found myself in a scrap, though a little more care meant I was more than able to avoid patrols. It’s only a fair bit later (and thanks to a set of handy pointers for this preview event) that I could grab and don some worker’s garb, from well away from the action –&nbsp;a little odd that I couldn’t get any at the camp or village, though.</p>
<p>The main goal is to figure out what Voss is after and foil his plan, with this adventure’s companion Gina manning a radio back in Dame Nawal’s tent. While waiting for the opportunity to sneak in, Nawal gives you the goal of preventing the wider pillaging of historical artifacts, namely a set to stone stelae that absolutely belong in a museum.</p>

<p>Following the clues to these locations takes you around this map, to underground passages and ancient structures. Some are single room puzzles –&nbsp;a room filled with angry scorpions needs you to waft a torch at them, another needs use of a lighter to clear a pitch black and completely overgrown passage –&nbsp;but then there are the much, much larger digs, a site that’s almost very flooded and with the Germans having to make do with too few pumps and generators. While they’re distracted, you can sneak in, get some clobbering done, a little bit of light electrocution by turning generators back on, and finally get access to a little puzzle chamber to reveal another stele.</p>
<p>There’s a nice flow to it, though I also found myself completely backed into a corner at one point, a half-loaded rifle in hand and half a dozen guards that I’d previously skirted past now heading down to figure out what the fuss was about. It took a few goes to get out of that scrappy situation, and it wasn’t a pretty fight!</p>

<p>Through it all, there’s a sense that MachineGames has really understood the charm and appeal of the Indiana Jones films. The cutscenes are impeccably rendered, Troy Baker doing a good job of channelling a younger Harrison Ford (though still occasionally sounding more like himself), and with some light humour that largely works quite well.</p>
<p>I do think that the first person gameplay will remain a sticking point for some. There’s a different style and scale to how you interact with a game world in first person over third person, a need for greater precision in your controls when trying to target and interact with things, and a closeness that perhaps highlights the game-y way that characters walk, talk and act outside of cutscenes, but I’m fine with that. The films are pulpy fun, so this can be a game-y game.</p>
<p>And in general, I’m rather keen to see how this full adventure comes together. MachineGames are taking a less obvious path, but that’s going to lead to a much more individual and distinctive game and journey. And if you’re going to trust anyone to make a game that’s a lot to do with beating up fascists, it’s probably them!</p>

			<p>The details of the PS5 Pro enhancement patch coming to Lords of the Fallen have been shared by developer Hexworks. Here's what they shared with fans in the new press release:</p>
<p><em>The PS5 Pro version of Lords of the Fallen allows players to experience the game with a 40% increase in pixel density over the base PlayStation 5 console, resulting in a sharper image and finer details. Performance Mode delivers rich visual detail at 4K60 (upscaled from 1440p) with a fluid 60 frames per second, sharper distant details, and refined textures on characters and environments. For those prioritizing visual fidelity, Quality Mode runs at native 4K30, showcasing intricate visuals across the dual realms of Axiom and Umbral at a stable 30 FPS.</em></p>
<p>Interestingly, the developers have also teased that further updates and enhancements are planned for the game as a whole, mainly inspired by feedback received from the community. This is a bit of a surprise, as we believed no further patches would be coming for Lords of the Fallen, given that Hexworks is already working on a <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-2-gets-first-details-elevated-production-values-gameplay-improvements-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sequel</a> scheduled to launch in 2026.</p>
<p>Speaking of Lords of the Fallen 2, Gamereactor has just <a href="http://0.10.211.177/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> an interview with Hexworks head of art Javier García Lajara, who talked about the first installment as well as the upcoming sequel:</p>
<p><em>In a month, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-sold-1-million-units-in-10-days-since-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached</a> a million copies sold, and after that we kept working on several updates and post-launch content for several months. We are around one million and a half more or less. I don't have the final numbers but it should be like that. Unfortunately we haven't had a perfect launch, mainly on PC. The PC market is full of different specs. You can run the game on a pretty beefy machine or you can have a low-end PC, and our game needs to run on both platforms, so we were trying to fix all these problems after launch and we spent several months doing that. I think we managed to do it and the game right now is a completely new experience. I think it's worth it to try again if you had problems on launch.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>For Lords of the Fallen 2, we are not only keeping the dual realm mechanics; we are improving it, and we are leveraging on what we do there. I can't say too much about that. Epic joined the ship to funding the project and we are using of course Unreal Engine 5.&nbsp;</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/doloc-town-is-a-pixel-art-farming-sim-with-a-platforming-twist.1021971/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/doloc-town-farming-sim-bullet-hell<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer RedSaw Games and publisher Logoi have announced&nbsp;<em>Doloc Town</em>, a cozy pixel art farming sim with a spicy bullet hell and platforming twist, and you can check it out on Steam now.</p>

<p>In a press release, RedSaw and Logoi say&nbsp;<em>Doloc Town&nbsp;</em>takes place "amidst the remnants of civilization", not unlike Pathea's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/my-time-at-evershine-skipping-early-access"><em>My Time&nbsp;</em>series</a>, although it's fair to say&nbsp;<em>Doloc Town&nbsp;</em>is decidedly less idyllic than those games are.</p>

<p>You'll get the chance to build up "automated production systems" on a farm where you can cultivate crops and build facilities, all while you're contending with post-apocalyptic weather conditions like acid rain.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/doloc-town-farming-sim-platformer-rainy-forest.jpg?itok=EwApMZJ4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/doloc-town-farming-sim-platformer-rainy-forest.jpg?itok=5f92FLkN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Doloc Town&nbsp;</em>looks to be a moody yet cozy post-apocalyptic farming sim.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're wondering what makes&nbsp;<em>Doloc Town&nbsp;</em>stand out amongst a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fields-of-mistria-roadmap">bevy</a> of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-of-shire-release-date">other</a> cozy <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/my-time-at-sandrock">farming sims</a> on the market right now (or about to be on the market, anyway), the answer could well lie in the game's combat systems.</p>

<p>Rather uniquely,&nbsp;<em>Doloc Town</em>'s combat takes influence from platformers and bullet hell shooters. RedSaw says you'll be able to use "guns and...auxiliary combat drones" to help you battle "dangerous creatures".</p>

<p>Don't worry if you're not much of a bullet hell fiend, though; RedSaw says that the game's customization will allow "flexible combat styles", so you shouldn't need to fret about not having perfect reflexes.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Doloc Town</em>, which also gives a sense of the game's&nbsp;very&nbsp;<em>Cave Story</em>-esque pixel art aesthetic, right here.</p>




<p>If your interest has been piqued by&nbsp;<em>Doloc Town&nbsp;</em>and you'd like to check it out, then you're in luck; a demo of the game is available right now via Steam, so you can give it a go and see whether it's for you or not.</p>

<p><em>Doloc Town&nbsp;</em>doesn't have a release date yet, but when it does land, it'll arrive <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2285550/Doloc_Town/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">on PC via Steam</a>. Stay tuned for more.</p>

So it’s always been incredibly ironic that the actor who played him was caught partaking in one of the more violent and shameful moments in American history. If there were a January 6 riot inside the universe of Bob’s Burgers, you know Jimmy Pesto would have been in the thick of it as well. </p><p>This week’s sentencing falls short of the 18 months requested by federal prosecutors, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/comedian-anchorman-mr-show-sentenced-jan-6-capitol-attack-rcna177642&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/comedian-anchorman-mr-show-sentenced-jan-6-capitol-attack-rcna177642" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NBC News reports</a></span>, but is still well above what Johnston’s lawyers were seeking. The sentencing memo claims the Hollywood actor was far from just a bystander at the riot and was instead inside Congress pushing forward with the rest of the mob, at one point wielding a riot shield against police in the tunnels beneath the building. Johnston’s lawyer, meanwhile, claimed he was being disproportionally targeted due to his fame. </p><p>Despite the attack on the Capitol taking place in January 2021, the actor wasn’t arrested until June 2023, after which he pled guilty. Federal prosecutors also shared a photo as part of sentencing that showed Johnston dressing up as QAnon Shaman more than a year after the riots. </p><p><em>Bob’s Burgers</em> didn’t replace Johnston until late 2023, after he had already been arrested, with the character being left out of seasons 12 and 13. Jimmy Pesto is now played by Eric Bauza, who debuted in season 14 and had previously done voice work for cartoon characters like Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck. <em>Bob’s Burgers </em>just entered its 15th season last month. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As SAG-AFTRA’s strike against video game companies continues, the guild has just signed a new deal with Ethovox to protect performers in the AI age. Ethovox is currently working on a consensual, foundational A.I. voice model to ensure performers will be “protected and compensated fairly” while their model reflects their “commitment to diversity and inclusion”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/new-sag-aftra-and-ethovox-agreement-empowers-actors-and-secures-essential-ai-guardrails" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">deal</a> between SAG-AFTRA and Ethovox ensures that the artist will receive “both session fees and ongoing revenue sharing for the life of the foundational model.” The guild’s National Executive Director and Chief Negotiator, Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, stated that during the A.I. age, the performers required “more contractual protection, not less” to safeguard their livelihoods.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Duncan Crabtree-Ireland stated, “SAG-AFTRA will continue to recognize AI companies, like Ethovox, that agree with our union’s AI guidelines.” Duncan acknowledged that not every performer would want to work with an AI company; however, those who intend to do so will have an agreement that secures “informed consent” and provides “fair compensation.”</p>



<p>Ethovox CEO Cissy Jones stated, “Ethovox is the only voice A.I. company owned and managed by voice actors, and we are pleased to be partnering with SAG-AFTRA on building a foundational voice A.I. model that prioritizes the interests of voice actors.”</p>



<p>Jones adds that “A.I. should be a choice”. Hence, Ethovox has been reaching out to the voice actor community during the entire process and will demonstrate fair compensation and ethical A.I. development in the future.&nbsp;</p>

<section><p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is a confident display of developer MachineGames' toolset, as well an understanding of not just what it feels like to be Indy, but what it means to be him.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Trailers for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle have nailed the tone of the franchise. The triumphant John Williams theme song, Harrison Ford's sly smirk, all accompanied with the crack of a whip and the distant howl of a Wilhelm scream. These are stylistic staples in the 43-year-old franchise that has had five films, a handful of games, and a TV show. There's no doubt that developer MachineGames understands the look and feel of Indy, but questions have lingered around its ability to capture <em>playing </em>as the globetrotter. Now that I've had some hands-on time with the game, it's clear to me MachineGames understands more than just the aesthetic of Indiana Jones, but also what it means to <em>be</em> Indiana Jones. The result is a promising prospect not just for fans of the franchise, but the adventure genre as a whole.</p><p dir="ltr">Taking place between Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade, The Great Circle sees the titular character a year removed from his globe-trotting adventures, having been teaching archaeology at the fictional Marshall College in the interim. At the beginning of my hands-on time, I wasn't thrust instantly into a big action set piece, but instead I got to walk around as Dr. Henry Walton Jones Jr. the professor, rather than Indiana Jones the adventurer. This is an important distinction, as it presented a more relatable tone with the character, and a steady sense of pacing that allowed me to take in its environments rather than run through them--characteristics I was happy to see present for the entirety of my 90 minutes of hands-on time, all the way from Marshall College to the mini-sandbox of Giza.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1592/15929708/4391652-q5zvdkjg.png" data-ref-id="1300-4391652" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="800" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1592/15929708/4391652-q5zvdkjg.png" data-ref-id="1300-4391652"></a><figcaption>Playing as Dr. Jones the professor, rather than Indiana Jones the adventurer, presents a more grounded tone.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1592/15929708/4391652-q5zvdkjg.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Dr. Jones's time-off from adventuring is put to an end, however, when he comes face-to-face with a towering intruder, portrayed by the menacing presence of Tony Todd, who steals an artifact from the college's gallery and beats the crap out of Jones. With an artifact gone and its mystery thief on the run, Professor Jones hangs up the tweed sports coat in exchange for his brown leather jacket and fedora.</p><p dir="ltr">Before heading across the world on a new adventure, I was allowed to spend more time in the college, where I was able to explore a side of Indy--or Dr. Jones the professor, rather--that I had only seen glimpses of in the films. I was left to clean up the thief's mess, picking up artifacts and placing them back in their rightful cases based on historical cues like hieroglyphics, playing like an environmental riddle and laying the seeds for the importance of observation for the puzzles to come.</p><p dir="ltr">The game's first-person perspective made looking at the artifacts in Indy's hands feel more tangible and immersive. Even inspecting Indy's notebook--which you do often--feels seamless, as he opens it in front of you without pausing the game, so you can look at maps and notes in real-time without covering your viewpoint, allowing you to still observe and walk around the environment.</p><blockquote data-size="large" data-align="center"><p>MachineGames understands more than just the aesthetic of Indiana Jones, but also what it means to <em>be</em> Indiana Jones</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">It was during this time as Dr. Jones that the game reinforced this Clark Kent/Superman-like theme; that Dr. Jones is a mere alter ego to the larger-than-life adventurer Indiana Jones. It's a motif that came up later in the preview, when an old friend of Indy's didn't recognize him without his glasses, tweed suit, and bowtie. It feels intentional, especially in a particular scene when Indy puts his hat on, accompanied with the swelling notes of a John Williams-like score. The scene had the same effect as Christopher Reeves's Clark Kent taking off his glasses and standing up straight to reveal he is Superman (which <em>also</em> features a John Williams score). It's a simple trick, maybe even corny, but was effective enough to put a smile on my face. It's moments like this that, while small, capture the character's whimsy spirit better than even some of its own films do at times. Impressively, whether it's playing as the college professor or the scrappy world explorer, that same spirit seems to be infused through every element of gameplay, especially in combat.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite those Superman comparisons, Indiana Jones is not indestructible. And I learned quickly that taking on enemies face-to-face or fist-to-fist was rarely the best course of action. On one hand, clobberin' guys with punches feels appropriately cumbersome. There's a weightiness to it that can feel satisfying when blocking an opponent's punch, which can then be followed with an equally rewarding well-executed right hook to the face that leaves their face more and more swollen with each blow. On the other hand, however, combat often felt claustrophobic due to the first-person perspective, which led to rather clumsy brawls that can quickly become chaotic when taking on more than one enemy. My feelings could change after the full release, when I can play at my own pace rather than feeling the pressure of a preview event where my time with the game is limited. For now, I think of it as less a criticism and more of an indication that there is a learning curve in understanding my limits as Indiana Jones, which in turn encouraged me to be more creative in how I approached combat.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1592/15929708/4391650-vlt3e8m9.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4391650" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1592/15929708/4391650-vlt3e8m9.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4391650"></a><figcaption>Clobberin' time.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1592/15929708/4391650-vlt3e8m9.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Thankfully, there's a lot of player expression in how you can approach a fight--or how you can avoid them entirely thanks to the game's excellent stealth system. After learning I wasn't the best at hand-to-hand combat, I fell into a rhythm of finding items around me, whether it was shovel, an empty bottle, or a guitar, and using those to wail on those damned Nazis. I also found this fighting method to be genuinely funny, as I often used my whip to knock a weapon out of an enemy's hand, only to snag it for myself and beat them to a pulp with it. It didn't get old.</p><p dir="ltr">As Indiana Jones, you also have a pistol. But, to my surprise, I was extremely reluctant to use it. When I had to shoot my way out of a situation, it felt as if I was admitting I had run out of ideas--a feeling I had never felt in MachineGames' other Nazi-killing game, Wolfenstien. This is one of the strongest examples of how MachineGames has honed in on the spirit of being Indiana Jones: Sure, Indy has shot and killed his share of people in the films, but it's always secondary to his improvisational fighting antics, and this is exemplified by the game's design rather than ever explicitly telling me how to play, or overloading me with ammunition.</p><p dir="ltr">From the tight halls of the Vatican to the open areas of Giza, the game presented me multiple solutions to every combat encounter, whether it was a clean break to escape, a frying pan in arm's reach, finding a disguise, or just an old-fashioned brawl. Pulling out a gun was the equivalent of descending into panic and using it only brought more unwanted attention to me.</p><p dir="ltr">To my surprise, shooting a Nazi in the face didn't feel nearly as rewarding as yanking a bad guy's feet from under him and watching him get knocked out cold from smashing his face into a chair. This reliance on guns is further de-emphasized by allowing each gun to also be used as a melee weapon. Once, when facing-off against a Nazi with a machine gun, I yanked the gun from their hands, picked it up, flipped it upside down, and swung it right into their face.</p><blockquote data-size="large" data-align="center"><p>Sneaking around the Vatican, scouting alternate routes, and taking out enemies, in my own unique way, gave my Dishonored itch a well-needed scratch</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">With the amount of variety I was given to tackle any given situation, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle has more in common with the immersive-sim genre than I expected. MachineGames worked in collaboration with sister studio Arkane for Wolfenstein: Youngblood, which featured a more open-ended approach to design than previous Wolfenstein games, and there seems to be a knock-on effect present in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle as a result. Sneaking around the Vatican, scouting alternate routes, and taking out enemies, in my own unique way, gave my Dishonored itch a well-needed scratch.</p><p dir="ltr">The Great Circle takes an approach to level-based worlds that is similar to Dishonored--open areas are filled with side missions and secrets to explore, which the player can return to anytime, and are non-linear in their design. One of the more open-ended areas I got to explore was Giza: a vast open desert with pyramids to explore, Nazis camps to sneak around, and shabby markets to purchase items from. While Giza was completely open for me to roam around, I was only able to see about a fourth of it due to time constraints, so I barely scratched the surface of what it had to offer. It was in this area that I got the most out of the game's other two tools: the camera and the notebook. Due to this section's non-linearity, the notebook was vital in keeping track of Field Works (side missions), as well as collecting pictures I had taken, which provide context regarding points of interests and characters you meet along the way.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1592/15929708/4391647-u37v36pb.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4391647" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1592/15929708/4391647-u37v36pb.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4391647"></a><figcaption>Indiana Jones's journal is a nifty sidekick in your grand adventure.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1592/15929708/4391647-u37v36pb.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Filling out Indy's notebook gave me a sense of agency akin to Alan Wake 2's evidence board. By taking pictures myself, I had an active role in digesting the game's information, and in turn, feeling more involved in the story and objectives. This was a feature I loved in Alan Wake 2, as it made me a participant in organizing evidence, rather than an in-game notebook automatically populating itself. In Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, I had a similar feeling. Every time I took a picture of a point of interest, my natural reaction was to open my notebook and observe the photo and its information, making it more like a companion than a checklist tracker.</p><p dir="ltr">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle feels like an amalgam of many genres but appears to be striking the right balance between them, all in favor of honoring the spirit of Indiana Jones, the archaeology professor <em>and</em> adventurer. While 90 minutes wasn't enough time to get the full scope of everything the game has to offer, it gave me a taste of a kind of adventure-puzzle game seldom seen in the AAA space, and it is one that's shaping up to be an impressive display of MachineGames' toolset and understanding of molding game design around its protagonist and story. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is expected to release for Xbox Series X|S and PC on December 9.</p>

However, there haven't been many modern video games starring the globetrotting explorer, even as the series has undoubtedly inspired other well-known games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tomb Raider </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Uncharted</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That's changing with the upcoming</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> Indiana Jones and The Great Circle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, helmed by developer MachineGames, who've previously worked on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wolfenstein: The New Order</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and its sequel, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The New Colossus</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. A first-person action adventure game focusing on the events between Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Great Circle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> puts a more immersive spin on the escapades of the famed adventurer as he explores tombs and pummels fascists.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After playing the opening hours at a recent hands-on event, I got a clearer view of MachineGames' take on an Indiana Jones game, which emphasizes player agency and open-ended exploration. I also spoke with design director Jens Andersson, where he explained how </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Great Circle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is all about letting players come up with in-the-moment solutions for the game's challenges. .</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Indiana Jones and the change of perspective"><span>Indiana Jones and the change of perspective</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Great Circle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> positions itself as a new adventure during the peak of Indiana Jones' career as an archeologist and occasional college professor. With that conceit, the game focuses on building up the atmosphere and heightened reality for its core combat, stealth, and exploration gameplay sequences, all focused on a protagonist who has to scrape and improvise his way to success. For instance, using Jones' whip was incredibly satisfying for disarming foes or softening up targets to set them up for a finishing blow with an empty rifle used as an improvised club. Many encounters feel like they came out of a movie, and that kind of scrappy and sometimes comedic energy is what design director Jens Andersson wanted to recreate for the game.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/phil-spencer-says-indiana-jones-ps5-jump-good-for-xbox-s-health" target="_self">Phil Spencer: Indiana Jones' PS5 jump good for Xbox's health</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"That sense of improvisation is very 'Indy,' isn't it? All of the actions you can do in the game have to make sense for the character, and how we've built it up is something we're very proud of," said Andersson. "Player agency is really important for us, so if an enemy has a gun and he drops it, you should be able to pick it up, and you have a revolver. It's iconic for the character, but in this game, there are many times when you don't want to use it. My favorite part is seeing testers play the game, and there's like a rifle here, and there's a banjo here; everyone picks up the banjo instead because it's just more fun to beat up enemies with, and it also fits the character that you want to play as."</span></p><p>Image via MachineGames/Microsoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Following the theft of a mysterious artifact from Marshall College, the titular hero (played by Troy Baker) embarks on a new adventure that'll take him to Northern Africa, Vatican City, and other locales as he uncovers an ancient conspiracy that puts him in the crosshairs of the growing Nazi empire.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This setup is very much in line with the film series, but as a video game, there are more opportunities to explore and interact with the characters within the setting. What surprised me most about the opening hours of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Great Circle </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">is that the game is not a totally linear story experience, but rather, it features some fairly open-ended levels that offer up different ways to acquire knowledge and fight bad guys as Indiana Jones.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking with the design director, he stated that the developers were not interested in making a standard licensed game adaptation but wanted to dig deeper into an immersive experience that lives up to the classic LucasArts games—such as the seminal 1992 adventure game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Fate of Atlantis</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I really love the whole legacy of LucasArts, and we're trying to evoke that sense of adventure from those games," said the design director. "We're doing something very different with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Great Circle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but because we're building off such a legacy of classic adventure games, we have a little more confidence that we can do a modern adventure game as well. It's proven to fit well with the Indiana Jones IP, and now we get to do it on a grand scale in 2024, and that's very exciting for us."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Along with being able to walk around the environment to examine notes and artifacts, you can explore to find hidden passages, clues to side activities, and open-ended combat encounters that can be cleared with fisticuffs or stealthily knocking out foes with whatever players can find. There was a strong sense of player agency, and it reminded me of a similar feeling I play an immersive sim like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Deus Ex</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. However, Anderson stated they were trying to avoid going too deep into that sort of flexibility, rather focusing more on prioritizing improvisation within sandbox environments.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Looking to the past for inspiration"><span>Looking to the past for inspiration</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developer MachineGames is mainly known today for the bombastic and surprisingly introspective </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wolfenstein </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">games. However, the studio is made up of developers who previously worked at Starbreeze, building games such as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Darkness</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Playing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Great Circle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> showed more of a stronger pull from the dev's early games, which the design director stated has been a part of the studio's signature ethos.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"There's almost this kind of muscle memory that MachineGames has been growing consistently from project to project, and many of us have worked together since </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Chronicles of Riddick</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Darkness</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> [going back to Starbreeze]," said Andersson. "You build up a way of going about things—which can be hard to do, as game development can feel like turning an aircraft carrier. But what it came down to was that the story needed to come first, and that turned into building the kind of adventure we want to take you on and then building the game features, the pace, and the characters all based around you being Indiana Jones."</span></p><p>Image via MachineGames/Microsoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In many ways, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Great Circle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> feels like a successor to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Chronicles of Riddick</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, mainly its focus on balancing first-person action and stealth within an immersive story-driven experience. The Chronicles</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> of Riddick</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s video game adaptation was particularly successful because it didn't directly adapt the film material. Instead, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Escape from Butcher Bay</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was more interested in capturing the moment-to-moment experience of being an action hero protagonist that was unique to the interactive experience of the video game medium—and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Great Circle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> looks to carry on with that same approach.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of my favorite sections from the opening hours, one that encapsulates the structure of the game well, was the Giza Pyramids, the game's first open sandbox level. While you have a clear goal to get inside a secure tomb, surrounding the ruins are Nazi base camps on the lookout for Jones, along with settlements filled with civilians going about their routines. This section felt very much like an Assassin's Creed-style social stealth sandbox. After gathering intel and scouting ahead with a camera, I had to acquire a disguise or cover to sneak into closely guarded areas.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When it came to building out these levels, Andersson admits it was a bit risky and scary to design levels with this sort of variation, as the prevailing worry was that players would opt to skip the side activities that help build the world. Still, he reasons that it was worth having them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We have a bunch of sections that are linear and more story focused, but there are a number of larger areas like the Vatican and Giza that feature a ton of content there that are entirely up to you to engage with it or not," he said.</span></p><p>Image via MachineGames/Microsoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"From a developer point of view, it's a little bit scary for us to have open-ended levels with side content because we spend so much time on it and players might end up skipping it, but that's also why we have this revisit feature in the game. So even when you complete it you can jump back to earlier chapters and then sort of play the content that you didn't discover the first time around to see the little mysteries and encounters you missed. That's one of the things I'm most happy about with the game, and I'm interested to see what people think about it."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="On the next adventures of Indiana Jones…."><span>On the next adventures of Indiana Jones….</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What I found most interesting about </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Indiana Jones and The Great Circle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is that it's an action adventure game that's all about getting players to feel resourceful and cunning in their approach to overcoming the odds—like picking up a banjo to clobber fascists. Given the large scope, and the density of its locales, it's an ambitious take on bringing the full Indiana Jones experience to a video game, and I was impressed to see how much detail and variety there was packed into the few areas I got to explore. .</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So far, Indiana Jones' big return to the world of video games shows a new side to the character and its pulpy sense of adventure, and for the design director, he believes that the developers of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Great Circle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> have already nailed its most important goal.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It's all coming together nicely, we're still working all the way to the end," said the design director. "I'm less scared about the riskier design choices we have made, because we've kind of proven that they work. We have people play through the full game now and I just really love how the story has turned out. The whole point of this game is to get you to feel like Indiana Jones, and that's the thing I feel we most succeeded at."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributor</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Alessandro Fillari is a writer/editor who has covered the games, tech, and entertainment industries for more than 12 years.

			<p>More than half of the total CAPCOM software sales for the first half of the current fiscal year have been on PC, according to the publisher's latest financial report.</p>
<p>In today's <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/html/explanation/2025/2nd/1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> covering the first half of FY25, the Japanese publisher confirmed that sales, operating income, and Digital Contents segment are all down 25%, 39%, and 35%, respectively, over the previous fiscal year, which is not surprising, considering the publisher launched mostly minor titles in the first six months of the current fiscal year. Still, the publisher confirmed it is still on target to achieve its annual forecast thanks to a second half of the year that will be stronger than the first, thanks to the upcoming launch of Monster Hunter Wilds.</p>
<p>This fiscal year's sales also highlighted a growing trend for CAPCOM, as of the 20.025 million units of software sold, 54% were sold on PC, with console sales shrinking from 51% in FY20 to 40% in FY25. The publisher's focus on the PC market is definitely paying off, and it will be interesting to see how much Monster Hunter Wilds will sell on PC compared to consoles, which don't seem will deliver the best way to enjoy one of the most anticipated games of 2025, judging from <a href="https://wccftech.com/monstewr-hunter-wilds-display-modes-consoles-120-hz/">impressions</a> from the PS Plus exclusive beta which began today.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-bloodborne-and-final-fantasy-16-designer-velux<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A designer who worked on&nbsp;FromSoftware's&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>and Square Enix's&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy 16&nbsp;</em>has opened up his own studio by the name of Velux.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/former-fromsoftware-and-square-enix-game-designer-establishes-new-game-company-to-make-games-for-game-lovers/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Automaton Media</a> (which, in turn, cites a Japanese <a href="https://prtimes.jp/main/html/rd/p/000000001.000151924.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">press release</a>), designer Sho Igarashi will serve as the newly-created Velux Studio's CEO. He's worked not only with FromSoftware and Square Enix, but also with&nbsp;<em>Granblue&nbsp;</em>studio Cygames and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/forspoken">Forspoken</a>&nbsp;</em>developer Luminous Productions.</p>

<p>According to Automaton's translation of the press release, Igarashi's "expertise lies in battle production" (that's Automaton's wording, not the press release's), although it's not clear whether he definitely worked on combat design for the aforementioned games.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bloodborne-velux-studio-sho-igarashi.jpg?itok=ReVpqYIb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bloodborne-velux-studio-sho-igarashi.jpg?itok=FeE0XH2q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sho Igarashi's credits include&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne</em>,&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy 16</em>, and more.</figcaption></figure><p>We don't know much about Velux Studio, except that per Automaton, the company will be making games across PC, consoles, and mobile devices, and it'll include both "high-end" and "casual" titles in its remit (again, that's Automaton's wording).</p>

<p>The goal here is to "make games for game lovers", or so the press release says, and the studio will be working with Unreal Engine 5 in-house, so it sounds like nothing will be outsourced.</p>

<p>Right now, we don't know exactly what Velux is working on, although if a couple of preview images released on the studio's new <a href="https://velux-studio.co.jp/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official website</a> are anything to go by, it looks like the debut game will have a sci-fi flavor to it.</p>

<p>Velux also has an <a href="https://x.com/VELUX_STUDIO" rel="noopener" target="_blank">X (formerly Twitter) account</a>, although naturally, since the studio is new, there isn't much on there yet. Still, you know who to follow if you want up-to-the-minute news about this new company.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/velux-studio-unreal-engine-5-project.jpg?itok=9NnXjUh- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/velux-studio-unreal-engine-5-project.jpg?itok=_WYjiVYZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Velux Studio is currently hard at work on...whatever this is.</figcaption></figure><p>Igarashi is far from the only decorated designer to be starting up his own studio. In recent years, we've seen studios started up by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-disco-elysium-devs-new-studios-spiritual-successors">several ex-<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>developers</a>, as well as staffers from big companies like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-bethesda-bioware-naughty-dog-near-studios-hawthorn">Bethesda</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-ea-staffers-three-thousands-studio">EA</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-capcom-staffers-birdkin-hideaki-saori-utsumi">Capcom</a>, among others.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen what Velux Studio will reveal as its debut title, but let's hope we find out sooner rather than later. Stay tuned for more.</p>
