            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/riot-games-lays-off-number-of-league-of-legends-developers/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Riot Games, the developers of League of Legends, is laying off a number of developers at the company. The announcement came via a <a href="https://x.com/MarcMerrill/status/1846243708100091985" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">lengthy article</a> posted by co-founder Marc Merrill.</p>



<p>The layoffs come as the company works to “make sure [Riot] can keep improving the League experience now and for the long-term.”</p>



<p>Merrillsays that the decision to make the cuts were “tough”, but it wasn’t about “reducing headcount to save money”.</p>



<p>“It’s about making sure we have the right expertise so that League continues to be great for another 15 years and beyond,” he said, also mentioning the company’s goal of solving challenges faster. </p>



<p>“While team effectiveness is more important than team size, the League team will eventually be even larger than it is today as we develop the next phase of League.”</p>



<p>He added that all employees being let go from the company will get a severance package that includes a minimum of six months’ pay, their annual bonus, job placement assistance, and health coverage.</p>



<p>“Thank you all for playing and for being part of the League community,” Merrill said to close his statement.</p>



<p>In total, 32 employees were let go from Riot Games. Of those 32, 28 were developers on League of Legends, according to a Riot spokesperson. Earlier this year, Riot Games <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/riot-games-lays-off-530-people-and-ends-riot-forge/">laid off 530 employees</a>. </p>



<p>With Riot’s layoffs, the games industry has seen <a href="http://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 13,100 known jobs</a> lost in 2024. Based on multiple sources, however, the real number is likely around 16,000 at this time.</p>

Today, Amazon is offering the PS5 compatible <a href="https://zdcs.link/z6b4YY?object_uuid=8d92521e-fbd4-405d-a6e2-a064f8cad3b5&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lexar NM790</a> 2TB PCIe Gen4 x4 M.2 Solid State Drive (SSD) with pre-installed heatsink for only $128.99. This was one of the best SSD deals we saw during Amazon Prime Day. It expired quickly after, but available once again for a little while longer.</p><h2>Lexar NM790 2TB PS5 SSD for $128.99</h2><div catalogid="afd3830a-9c79-404d-8955-bea9002efa9c" id="192792"><div id="192792" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Lexar NM790 2TB PCIe Gen4 x4 M.2 SSD with Heatsink</h3></p></div><p>The PlayStation 5 console comes with a 1TB SSD, but 300GB of that is reserved for the OS, leaving around 700GB left over for games. That space will run out quickly because some games take up an enormous amount of space, especially if you buy digital copies. For example, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-jedi-survivor-review">Star Wars: Jedi Survivor</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review">Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth</a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nba-2k25-review">NBA 2K25</a> all require 140GB each. Even older games like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-review">God of War: Ragnarok</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gran-turismo-7-review">Gran Turismo 7</a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horizon-forbidden-west-review">Horizon Forbidden West</a> require 90GB of space apiece.</p><p>Enter the Lexar NM790 SSD. Although we didn't pick it as one of our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ps5-ssd">favorite SSDs for the PlayStation 5</a>, Lexar is a well known and established flash memory brand and its SSD has garnered plenty of positive reviews. The NM790 is a guaranteed fit with any PlayStation 5 console. Performance-wise, it boasts read speeds of 7,400MB/s and write speeds of 6,500MB/s, which is well above Sony's minimum recommendation of 5,600MB/s.  It's also pre-equipped with a low-profile aluminum heatsink. The 2TB capacity triples the storage of a PS5 or doubles the storage of a PS5 Pro.</p><h2>Alternative: Silicon Power XS70 2TB PS5 SSD for $127.99</h2></div><div catalogid="93755942-ef91-4264-b643-301d1026fd11" id="199763"><div id="199763" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Silicon Power XS70 2TB PCIe Gen4 x4 M.2 SSD with Heatsink</h3></p></div><p>Amazon is offering <strong>Amazon Prime members</strong> this <a href="https://zdcs.link/aAV8yw?object_uuid=8d92521e-fbd4-405d-a6e2-a064f8cad3b5&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Silicon Power XS70</a> 2TB PS5 SSD for $127.99 shipped. The primary difference is that the Lexar NM790 is a DRAM-less drive and the Silicon Power XS70 has a DRAM cache. Instead of onboard DRAM, the NM790 uses HMB (host memory buffer), which basically means that it uses the system memory as cache. The XS790, on the other hand, has a dedicated DRAM cache built into the stick. Theoretically, having a DRAM cache offers fast random write performance, but both types of SSDs are so fast that there really any noticeable performance difference when it comes to gaming on a PS5 or PC.</p><p>If you want more options, here's a list of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-ps5-ssd-deals-for-2024">best PS5 SSD deals</a> available right now.

            <p>
In the run-up to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>'s launch next week, Activision has shared a whole bunch of details relating to the PC version, ranging from system specs (complete with a not-as-bad-as-it-could-have-been 102GB storage requirement) to pre-load and launch times.
</p>
<p>
As per Activision's <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/uk/en/blog/2024/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-pc-trailer-specs-preloading-intel">newly shared blog post</a>, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 comes with support for a range of PC-specific features. It's compatible with Ultrawide monitors, for instance, and supports AMD FSR 3.1, with the publisher also promising a "huge number of options across a variety of settings so players can dial in the best playing experience possible".
</p>
<p>
Spec-wise, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is relatively modest in its demands, requiring an AMD Ryzen 51400/Intel Core i5-6600 CPU, Radeon RX 470/GeForce GTX 960/Intel Arc A580 GPU, plus 8GB RAM as a minimum. Activision's Recommended specs, meanwhile, seek a Ryzen 5 1600X/Intel Core i7-6700K CPU, plus a Radon RX 6600XT/GeForce GTX 1080Ti/RTX 3060 GPU, and 12GB RAM - all to get 60fps in "most situations" with everything set to high.

<p>
And as for players looking to go the Competitive/4K Ultra route, Activision suggest a Ryzen 7/Intel Core i7-8700K CPU, Radeon RX6800XT/GeForce RTX 3080/RTX 4070 GPU, plus 16GB RAM. And in all cases, you'll be needing an SSD with 102GB of available storage at launch - which is almost 50GB less than the space required by last year's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 on PC, but obviously expect that increase if you also want to install Call of Duty: Warzone.
</p>

</figure>
<p>
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 6 launches for PC via Steam and Battle.net at 9pm on the 24th October in the US, which equates to 5am BST on 25th October in the UK. And there's the option to pre-load starting on 21st October if you've pre-ordered the game.
</p>
<p>
Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will, of course, also be available via PC Game Pass on day one, but for console players it requires an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription.

We learn how she was forced into Arkham Asylum by her father after she questioned how her mother died, and was then repeatedly violated by the male doctor there and stripped of her rights until she did, in fact, go mad, and, how ten years later, after her release, she is still questioned and maligned by the men in the Falone crime family. But, like a chartreuse phoenix rising from the patriarchal ashes, Sofia gets hers by the end of “Cent’anni,” and we get <em>The Penguin</em>’s true protagonist. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>“For 10 years men have lied to me. And then I come home and it’s all the same. They think I’m broken. I’m not broken. I’m not the one who’s sick. And neither are you. The world is,” Sofia tells Dr. Julian Rush (Theo Rossi), the assistant to the Arkham doctor who repeatedly subjected her to shock treatment despite her protestations, and who declared her unfit for trial, forcing her to stay there for a decade.<br></p><p>Sofia is the victim of men who built their empires using violence and coercion—we learn in this episode that her father, Carmine Falcone, not only strangled her mother but several other women who he employed. When Sofia questioned him, he told her she was not herself and got her involuntarily committed to Akrham. These kinds of men are terrified of losing their power, and someone as capable as Sofia is a threat—but her womanhood makes her an easy target.<br></p><p>Sofia’s time in Arkham is painful and horrifying to watch. We see an innocent woman thrown into an asylum for daring to question a man and are forced to watch as that system breaks her down until she is no longer a person, but a feral thing. Her perfectly manicured nails become filthy, ragged claws. Her styled hair becomes wild and knotted, her pristine skin marred by redness and bruises from the electroshock therapy. By the time she takes her neighbor’s head and repeatedly smashes it onto a cafeteria table until she’s dead (RIP Magpie), we know that this place and the men who put her there effectively killed Sofia Falcone.</p><p>Milioti gives an award-worthy performance, deconstructing the character until she is as untrusting and sharp as an alley cat. You are angry for her, and in turn, for any woman who has been wrongfully accused or armchair psychoanalyzed. You want her to win. </p><p>And win she does. After the episode’s lengthy flashback, Sofia attends what is meant to be her last family dinner. After all, she’s been told by the men that she has to get on a flight to Sicily or else risk certain death, since she’s become, in their eyes, too much of a liability for la famiglia. Clad in a plunging chartreuse silk gown, she holds dominion over the family dinner for an excruciating speech, before toasting to new beginnings.<br></p><p>She leads her cousin’s young daughter to the greenhouse to spend the night, her beautiful gown trailing behind her as she walks. She awakens next to her in the morning, the orangey glow of the sunrise highlighting her profile as she sits up. Making her way back into the Falcone mansion, the young girl’s pink backpack in hand and no shoes on her feet, she pauses in the doorway to put on a gas mask. And then, like the silent killer gas can be, Sofia tiptoes, dances, and prances through the mansion, opening doors and windows with glee to let the sunlight in. Shining through her dress, it reveals the curves of her body as she moves like a jungle cat through the sprawling mansion, in which each and every Falcone family member is now dead.<br></p><p>In the last room, she takes a handgun off the end table and wakes up Johnny Vitti, the right hand man who she’s chosen to let live through the night. “Put your pants on Johnny, we have to talk,” she snaps with her New York Italian accent. Mamma mia, I’m in love. Talk about gaslight, gatekeep, girlboss, am I right?</p><p>The next episode of <em>The Penguin</em> airs on HBO Max on October 20 at 9 p.m. ET. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Insider Gaming has learned that Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will have hands-on previews at the end of this month.</p>



<p>As part of these previews, Microsoft and Bethesda are hosting several media events this week for content creators and the media worldwide.</p>



<p>One content creator has not-so-subtly hinted that he’s traveling to such an event to play Indiana Jones and the Great Circle at one of the events on social media. “Hopefully learning whip skills and wearing a cool leather jacket,” he said when asked what he was doing in San Francisco.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will launch on December 9, 2024, on the Xbox Series S|X and on PC. The game has also been announced for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-confirmed-for-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5 in early 2025</a>. According to rumours, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-targeting-an-april-2025-release-for-ps5-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">early 2025 release date is currently targeted for April</a>, giving the Xbox platform and PC four months of exclusivity. </p>



<p>Indiana Jones creative director Axel Torvenius said in an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-developers-thrilled-game-is-coming-to-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interview earlier this year</a>, “From MachineGames’ point of view, we are super thrilled and excited over the fact we will be able to be on PlayStation next year as well.” </p>

		<p>The Legend of Heroes: Trails Through Daybreak II has got a confirmed release date and it is February 14th, 2025. NISA confirmed the news today, along with releasing a brand new trailer for the game. This sequel has followed on very quickly to the first Trails Through Daybreak, which was released in the West this past July. That had been available in Japan since 2021 and Trails Through Daybreak II was first released in Japan in 2022.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-zorba-boss-how-to-beat-1851672980<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In retrospect, it is a little weird how that otherwise ridiculously generous multi-hour demo for <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> just kinda decided, “You’ve had enough,” after a random boss in Regalith Grand Cathedral. Over a million people have since told Atlus, “<em>We’ll</em> tell <em>you</em> when we’ve had enough,” and bit the bullet on the full game. That’s excellent news for us JRPG sickos, but that demo might give you delusions that all the bosses are just random collections of minions. That is quickly dispelled when you hit the game’s first <em>real </em>challenge.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Zorba—looking like one of the sexiest goths ever drawn, and sounding like Drew McIntyre—is waiting at the top of the Cathedral, and he’s brought a whole lotta dead guys with him, who hit harder than you think. But remain calm. Zorba ain’t a huge deal, so much as a place to practice good synergy. We’ll show you how to take him down.</p><h2 id="h14917"><a id=""></a><strong>Zorba’s abilities</strong></h2><p>You gotta admire a man with a plan. Zorba’s first move, every time, will be Corpse Puppetry, where he raises a Corpsethrall out of the ground. His second move? Raising another Corpsethrall. If you kill one of the Corpsethrall, guess what his next move’s gonna be? You got it. If you’re a Corpsethrall fan, you’ve come to the right place.</p><p>Once he’s got two corpses up, though, his next move will be setting his new rotten buddies up for success with Madness Curse. That inflicts them with Rage, meaning when the corpses hit you, they will hit HARD. If both enraged corpses are still up and shambling while he’s got turns left, then finally Zorba will get down to the business of dealing with you personally, by tossing some magic your way, usually either Mudoon (darkness), Kandera (lightning), or Bondage Curse, which hits one of your party with Paralysis.</p><h2 id="h14918"><a id=""></a><strong>Recommended Archetypes</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="fd9bf4600c0bf9efedfc26884c64d1c7" data-recommend-id="image://fd9bf4600c0bf9efedfc26884c64d1c7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1922" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Zorba in front of some spectacular sky action." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Zorba in front of some spectacular sky action." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fd9bf4600c0bf9efedfc26884c64d1c7" data-recommend-id="image://fd9bf4600c0bf9efedfc26884c64d1c7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1922" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Zorba in front of some spectacular sky action." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Your pointman on this one is the Warrior. All of its Slash moves do decent damage to Zorba and the Corpsethralls—a killer name for a band, I might add. If you can get Fire magic equipped—either through Inheritance, or with an Igniter—even better, since Zorba’s corpse friends don’t much care for being set on fire, and they’ll take a big chunk of damage.</p><p>Your second-in-command here is gonna be the Healer. The healing is certainly a big help, but on top of that is the fact that the Healer can cast Hama (Light magic), which the corpses are also weak to. Hama is also one of the only magic spells that can damage Zorba in a pinch, which is nice.</p><p>Lastly, bring a Knight. That’s primarily because you want the Knight’s Synthesis move with the Warrior: Jump Thrust. That move lays the hardest smackdown on Zorba in general, but it also lowers Zorba’s defense, which will make this whole thing go by even faster. The Knight also provides insurance against your biggest weakness in the fight once there are corpses around, which is that the Healer’s weak to Strikes, which the Corpsethralls will use all the damn time. Using Knight’s Proclamation to draw aggro will be the only way to keep their filthy hands off you. The Knight will take hefty damage that turn. Good thing you’ve got a healer then, eh?</p><h2 id="h14919"><a id=""></a><strong>Defeating Zorba</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="1f195f1474a0a3b968723241e9ba3a5e" data-recommend-id="image://1f195f1474a0a3b968723241e9ba3a5e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1925" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The battle with Zorba." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The battle with Zorba." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1f195f1474a0a3b968723241e9ba3a5e" data-recommend-id="image://1f195f1474a0a3b968723241e9ba3a5e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1925" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The battle with Zorba." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>When the fight starts, you’ve got a free set of turns to do some damage to Zorba. Your Healer can let loose with Hama, your Warrior can use Slicer, but whatever you do, when you get down to two turn icons left, pass your turn over to your Knight and use Jump Thrust. That’ll start this fight off with Zorba in a bad way.</p><p>When it’s his turn, of course, he’ll raise his first corpse. By and large, that first phase is the general template for this whole fight. That is, you’ll want to do as much raw damage as humanly possible to the corpses, until you hit two turn icons, then hit Zorba with a Jump Thrust. The corpses being weak to Fire and Light magic means you’ll easily get three or four big hits in before that point.</p></div><p>If you did a little extra grinding before you got to this point, you might just be dangerous enough where you can take down a Corpsethrall in one go, and in which case, if you’ve brought down Zorba’s defense more than once, the Warrior’s Slicer does absolutely brutal damage to that poor, pretty bastard. But if you’re just going about your merry way through the game, chances are good you’ll end the turn with the corpse low on health but still standing. Zorba will use his time to raise another corpse, but the remaining corpse will lash out at one of your crew for a bit of damage. Let him have a free one, it’ll be his last. Even if he hits your Healer, Zorba won’t have enough of a turn left to do anything worrisome.</p><p>Obviously, start Round 2 by taking out that first corpse, then focus on the second. If you decide to get fancy, you can use the Warrior’s Round Slash to hit all three targets at once, though it’s a bit pricey on the turn icons and MP. Use discretion. Lather, rinse, repeat. Main thing is that somewhere in this cycle of violence, you’re gonna have to sacrifice your Healer’s turn to actually heal, especially if you’re unlucky enough where one of your attacks is a miss. If you’re ever going to end a turn with two corpses standing, especially if Zorba gets to cast Madness Curse, it’s time to let the Knight do their duty for God and country. Make sure the Knight gets the last turn, use Knight’s Proclamation to eat the incoming attacks, and have your Healer recover them after.</p><p>The tl;dr with all of this is to keep Zorba so busy spawning new corpses that he doesn’t have time for anything else. That means a strong focus on getting at least one corpse out of the picture at all times. Shit does happen, however, and you need to brace yourself if you get well and truly unlucky. If you have a choice between letting the Healer do damage or topping off your team’s health, choose the health, unless Zorba’s down to the last sliver. Still, if everything goes smoothly—and 90 percent of the time, it will with this plan—it doesn’t take more than five or six goes around to take Zorba down for good, liberate the Cathedral, and hear Hulkenberg walk Zorba down with some of that, “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7-roiI5Vqc&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7-roiI5Vqc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You have offended my family and the Shaolin temple</a></span>” good stuff.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/talisman-board-game-buying-guide<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Originally published in black and white by Games Workshop in 1983, Talisman is a classic fantasy board game with a rich history spanning over 40 years. Commonly compared to Monopoly, Talisman features an easy to learn and basic gameplay loop that makes it a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-beginner-board-games">great board game for beginners</a>, despite its extremely randomized outcomes, hectic situations, and often longer-than-average play times. </p><p>Players choose from over 12 characters, all of which are classic fantasy classes, like the Wizard and Thief, and then the game begins. In it, two to six players battle it out to be the first to reach the Crown of Command in the center of the board and defeat the dragon, venturing through three main sections of the board: the outer, middle, and inner. </p><p>Throughout the game, you’ll have the opportunity to use over 100 different Adventure, Spell, or Talisman cards to gain the upper hand or screw with your opponents. You might even be able to turn one of them into a toad. </p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Featured in this article</h2></p><p>The entire history of Talisman is vast and has many out-of-print versions and expansions, so this guide will focus solely on expansions and spin-offs that are more easily accessible. </p><p id="talisman-base-game"><h2 data-toc-title="Talisman base game">The Base Game</h2></p><h3>Talisman: The Magical Quest Board Game 5th Edition</h3><div catalogid="fde15d86-9341-45d3-84d5-660752d11d57" id="207849"><div id="207849" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Talisman: The Magical Quest Board Game 5th Edition</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Price</strong>: $59.99</li><li><strong>Players</strong>: 2-6 players</li><li><strong>Age Range</strong>: 12+</li><li><strong>Play Time</strong>: 60-90 minutes</li></ul><p>Released in July 2024, the 5th Edition of the decades-spanning fantasy board game is the latest and most up-to-date version available. With the game’s rich history, it’s easy to get confused on which versions to pick up – don’t look on eBay, as 4th Editions can go for almost $150! Instead, pick up the 5th Edition, which offers the base game as well as the gameplay mechanic changes first introduced in the 3rd Edition. Additionally, compared to the 4th Edition, the newest edition of Talisman is a more streamlined, slightly less chaotic experience; the 5th Edition rulebook even mentions explicit changes with a symbol next to the rules blurbs. This version also comes with two fewer characters; it cuts the Bard and Druid. </p></div><p id="talisman-expansions"><h2 data-toc-title="Talisman expansions">Talisman Expansions</h2></p><p>A very notable bummer is that the 5th Edition is not backwards compatible with the extensive library of 4th Edition expansions. But there's a new 5th Edition expansion available called Fate Beckons. </p><h3>Talisman Alliances: Fate Beckons</h3><div catalogid="fde15d86-9341-45d3-84d5-660752d11d57" id="209044"><div id="209044" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Talisman Alliances: Fate Beckons</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li>Price: $33.99</li><li>Players: 2-6 players</li><li>Age Range: 12+</li><li>Play Time: 60-90 minutes</li></ul><p>The first expansion for 5th Edition, Fate Beckons offers <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">cooperative play</a> for the first time in mainline Talisman history. Players must complete 5 Trials in order to win the game, and do so using over 50 new cards, tokens, and figures. </p><h3>Talisman: Legendary Tales</h3></div><div catalogid="fde15d86-9341-45d3-84d5-660752d11d57" id="209045"><div id="209045" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Talisman: Legendary Tales</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Price</strong>: $49.99</li><li><strong>Players</strong>: 1-6 players</li><li><strong>Age Range</strong>: 14+</li><li><strong>Play Time</strong>: 20-40 minutes</li></ul><p>Not so much an expansion as it is a spin-off, Talisman: Legendary Tales is a story-focused adventure that has players working together to recover the five Talismans to thwart the evil that vies for control over the Crown of Command. Each of the five lost Talismans is recovered in their own unique adventures, and can be replayed as many times as possible to get the full experience.

The main draw is the Wizarding World setting, with amazing art and figures of fan favorite characters, like Harry Potter, Draco Malfoy, and Dumbledore. Make your way to the center of the board to take on the Dark Lord Voldemort to win the game.</p><h3>Talisman: Kingdom Hearts</h3></div><div catalogid="fde15d86-9341-45d3-84d5-660752d11d57" id="209047"><div id="209047" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Talisman: Kingdom Hearts</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Price</strong>: $59.99</li><li><strong>Players</strong>: 2-6 players</li><li><strong>Age Range</strong>: 13+</li><li><strong>Play Time</strong>: 90+ minutes</li></ul><p>This version also maintains the mechanics of the original game, and sees classic <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/kingdom-hearts">Kingdom Hearts</a> characters like Sora, Donald, Goofy, and Riku battle their way through Heartless to reach the inner part of the board and seal the Door to Darkness. </p></div><p id="talisman-adventures-rpg"><h2 data-toc-title="Talisman Adventures RPG">Talisman Adventures RPG</h2></p><h3>Talisman Adventures: Core Rulebook</h3><div catalogid="fde15d86-9341-45d3-84d5-660752d11d57" id="209048"><div id="209048" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Talisman Adventures: Core Rulebook</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Price</strong>: $35.94</li><li><strong>Players</strong>: 2-6 players</li><li><strong>Age Range</strong>: 13+</li><li><strong>Play Time</strong>: 2-4 hours</li></ul><p>Essentially a DnD-like (and DnD-lite), the Talisman Adventures RPG Core Rulebook has everything you need to get started with the 3D6 ruleset: a breakdown of each character class, the lore, and, of course, how to play.

The 40th Anniversary Collection includes all 13 of the 4th Edition expansions, from Blood Moon to the Nether Realm. The PS4 and PC versions include extra characters not available on Switch. Notably, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/91b1Eq?object_uuid=4cd575cf-51aa-433b-a553-0fa8bb8df978&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>physical versions</u></a> on PS4 and Nintendo Switch are not region-locked, but the expansions are.</p><h2>The Bottom Line</h2><p>Talisman is undeniably one of the most popular fantasy board games of our time, with a rich history of expansions and revisions spanning over 40 years. The streamlined ruleset of the 5th Edition makes learning it for the first time a breeze, and the updated fantasy art is worth the upgrade. And while many of the 4th Edition expansions are out of print and are either hard to find or expensive on the secondary market, the 5th Edition of the base game marks a perfect jumping on point for newcomers or those looking for a more laid back experience. The Talisman Adventures series of RPGs is a worthy, barebones competitor to DnD, and is  great for budding DMs and players of all ages looking into trying out their first RPG.</p><p><em>Myles Obenza is a freelance commerce writer for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-does-not-include-any-3rd-party-drm-including-denuvo<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/dragon-age-the-veilguard">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> does not have third-party DRM of any kind, including Denuvo, Bioware has announced.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/specifications-spotlight?isLocalized=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>, the EA-owned studio said its upcoming fantasy role-playing game lacks digital rights management (DRM) on any platform, which is sure to go down well with PC gamers.</p><p>But the lack of DRM has the knock-on effect of preventing Bioware from offering a preload period for PC players. Instead, Dragon Age: The Veilguard will be downloadable and playable on launch day, 9am Pacific / 12noon Eastern / 5pm UK on October 31 on PC.</p><p>There <em>is</em> a preload period on console, however: Xbox Series X and S preload is already available, with PlayStation 5 preload going live at 9am Pacific / 12noon Eastern / 5pm UK on October 29.</p><p>Denuvo is a controversial system used by video game developers and publishers to stem the tide of video game piracy by, they hope, pushing back the release of cracked versions of their games by sometimes weeks, maybe months, and in some cases, indefinitely. From a publisher perspective, Denuvo helps to prevent lost sales and revenue it might have received if those who pirate a video game at launch would have otherwise bought it.</p><p>However, Denuvo is often criticized by PC gamers for potentially affecting video game performance and even reducing the life-span of solid-state drives (SSDs). Denuvo has repeatedly denied the claims. In 2021, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2021-resident-evil-village-cracked-performance-beats-official-code" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Foundry</a> found the pirate version of Resident Evil Village actually improved performance. Capcom later patched the game.</p><p>BioWare has been on something of a charm offensive with PC gamers for the next Dragon Age. In July, it announced <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-is-steam-native-so-you-dont-need-the-ea-app-to-play-the-game-on-pc"><u>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</u> is “Steam native,”</a> which means the EA App is not required to play the game on Valve’s platform. Most EA-published video games <em>do</em> require the EA App, which replaced Origin in 2022, to play on Steam, much to the annoyance of many PC gamers.</p><p>This week, IGN reported on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dont-look-at-the-dragon-age-the-veilguard-trophy-achievement-list-if-you-want-to-avoid-spoilers">Dragon Age: The Veilguard’s Trophy / Achievement list</a> hitting the internet (beware of spoilers!). Earlier this month <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-doesnt-have-an-arachnophobia-mode-because-its-the-first-game-in-the-series-without-spiders"><u>BioWare confirmed Dragon Age: The Veilguard is the first game in the fantasy action role-playing game series not to feature spiders</u></a>.</p><p>IGN has plenty more on Dragon Age: The Veilguard, including <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-bioware-finally-got-dragon-age-to-the-finish-line-after-a-tumultuous-decade"><u>a deep-dive into its development</u></a>, which is well worth a read if you want to know more about how BioWare realized the game.

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">According to the <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo4/24140808/diablo-iv-patch-notes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">patch notes</a>, one of those activities that will be improved is the seasonal Realmwalkers. Currently, they lumber about and slowly spawn enemies. When enough are defeated, the Realmwalker can be slain, after which a portal to the "Seething Realm" is opened where players can gain even more rewards. Come update 2.0.3, the Realmwalkers will be receiving a significant speed buff, and they'll spawn more enemies more quickly. Realmwalkers will additionally have a chance to spawn a Treasure Goblin, and Blizzard notes that other "miscellaneous changes" have been made to make the event progress faster overall. Speeding up the Realmwalkers should mean players get to the Seething Realm, where the meat of the event is, more quickly than before.</p><p dir="ltr">The Kurast Undercity will become more lucrative as well. Blizzard notes that more items will drop from successful runs, with at least one guaranteed Legendary item. The amount of gold dropped in the dungeon will also be doubled. Enemies within the Kurast Undercity have had their health and affixes brought closer in line to that of the game's other dungeons, and the mode's timer--as well as the amount of bonus time earned from slaying elite enemies--will be increased.</p><p dir="ltr">There are plenty of other changes coming in update 2.0.3, including a bug fix that may affect one of the game's more popular Spiritborn builds. The "Evade" build for the new Spiritborn class sees players constantly dodge-rolling using the Evade button, during which they send out huge volleys of feathers that fill the screen and decimate enemies. It turns out players were faster and using it more often than was intended, as a bug for Spiritborn allowed the class to cancel its evade animation mid-Evade. That bug will be fixed in the next update. The fix may slow down the Evade build somewhat but it will likely still be incredibly strong.</p><p dir="ltr">Other changes coming in the update include buffs to a number of Mythic Uniques, a fix for players who didn't receive their Resplendent Spark for defeating the Echo of Lilith, the reimplementation of a number of items that were disabled for the expansion's launch, a mount trophy for reaching Paragon 300. Additionally, tooltips for Masterworking, Runewords, and various crafting materials will be updated for "improved readability."</p><p dir="ltr">In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-review-piercing-the-veil/1900-6418298/" data-ref-id="1900-6418298">Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred review</a>, writer Alessandro Barbosa said the expansion serves as "a great reentry point for lapsed Diablo 4 players," one that delivers on making the game "feel fresh again."</p>

The event, which runs several times a year, gives players a chance to try out demos from a slew of in-development titles. We’ve been through the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfest&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">latest batch</a></span> to highlight some of the best from the current festival, which runs from October 14 through 21.<br></p><p>Steam Next Fest often gives us our first taste of tomorrow’s indie gems or sleeper hits. Games seen during <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/steam-next-fest-best-game-demos-1851230698&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/steam-next-fest-best-game-demos-1851230698">previous</a></span> Steam Next Fests this year, since released to widespread acclaim, include the religious horror title <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/indika-steam-pc-nun-narrative-adventure-1851669861&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/indika-steam-pc-nun-narrative-adventure-1851669861" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody"><em>Indika</em></a></span>, the <em>Resident-Evil</em>-inspired <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/crow-country-indie-survival-horror-review-1851462202&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/crow-country-indie-survival-horror-review-1851462202"><em>Crow Country</em></a></span>, and noir parody <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/duck-detective-secret-salami-how-long-1851497669&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/duck-detective-secret-salami-how-long-1851497669"><em>Duck Detective</em></a></span>. Here are ten from this month’s event that could very well do the same.</p></div></div><div><p>If you only have time to play one demo during Steam Next Fest, you should make it <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2442460/Citizen_Sleeper_2_Starward_Vector/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2442460/Citizen_Sleeper_2_Starward_Vector/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Citizen Sleeper 2</em></a></span>. The sequel to 2022’s stunning TTRPG-influenced sci-fi adventure is slated to come out in early 2025 and the demo lets you play the game’s opening hours. I <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector-preview-rpg-1851533109&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector-preview-rpg-1851533109">previewed</a></span> the same demo a few months back and came away impressed by how <em>Starward Vector </em>retains the sense of risk and reward from the first game while introducing new mechanics like the ability to manage a crew and go out on dangerous missions, as well as a break system that completely changes how the game’s dice rolls work. Fans of the first game will not want to miss out on this demo, and it’s only available until the end of Steam Next Fest so try it out while you can.</p></div><div><p>Everybody has a take on the soulslike genre, but <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2736690/Void_Sols/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2736690/Void_Sols/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Void Sols</em></a></span>’ has to be one of the most unique I’ve seen yet. It’s essentially a minimalist <em>Souls </em>game that distills the tough-as-nails combat and navigation of the genre into a top-down adventure in which the protagonist and every enemy are reduced to basic shapes. While the presentation may throw you off, the core gameplay hews closely to the core pillars of the genre, so you’ll still need to memorize enemy patterns, navigate twisty environments, and level up your stats while trying not to die. So far, <em>Void Sols</em> just proves how mechanically sound the soulslike genre is, regardless of visual presentation.</p></div><div><p>What’s more American than a road trip across the country in a beat-up car? <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2756920/Keep_Driving/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2756920/Keep_Driving/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Keep Driving</em></a></span> is all about the unique charms and troubles that come with life on the open road. Pick a crappy vehicle and set out to see the country while picking up odd jobs along the way to pay for gas and other essentials. <em>Keep Driving</em> feels like one part enthralling management sim and one part <em>Kentucky Route Zero-</em>esque pastiche of the oft-forgotten parts of the country. </p></div><div><p>Earlier this month my colleague Moises Taveras previewed <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1911610/Windblown/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1911610/Windblown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Windblown</em></a></span>, the new game from <em>Dead Cells </em>developer Motion Twin, and came away impressed. He <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector-preview-rpg-1851533109&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector-preview-rpg-1851533109">praised</a></span> the game’s incredibly fast-paced movement and combat which lets you zip around the isometric roguelike’s world in the blink of an eye. You can now try out the game for yourself during Steam Next Fest, and if you like what you see, you can keep the good times rolling when <em>Windblown </em>enters early access on October 24.</p></div><div><p>Perhaps the best way to describe the unique puzzler that is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/3083300/Proverbs/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3083300/Proverbs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Proverbs</em></a></span><em> </em>is by calling it one giant game of <em>Minesweeper</em>. Inspired by Bruegel the Elder’s 1559 painting “Netherlandish Proverbs,” <em>Proverbs </em>drops you into a single giant board made up of over 54,000 individual squares. While solving the puzzle, you’ll also learn more about the painting that inspired the game (and some actual proverbs, too). This is the perfect demo to chip away at while watching TV or listening to a podcast in the background.</p></div><div><p>In <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2484580/Mushroom_Musume/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2484580/Mushroom_Musume/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Mushroom Musume</em></a></span> you raise your mushroom daughter to be the best woman/funghi she can be, and things only get weirder from there. Part visual novel, part TTRPG, part farming sim, part roguelike, and all old-school fairytale, <em>Mushroom Musume</em> is a one-of-a-kind narrative driven game about parenthood and plants. Like fairytales of old, this game will entice you with beauty and horror in equal measure, and you’ll constantly want to know how your story will unfold. The demo for <em>Mushroom Musume </em>offers a generous taste of the game, so don’t be surprised if you fall down a rabbit hole.</p></div><div><p>Think of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2940440/Are_You_Kidding_Me/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2940440/Are_You_Kidding_Me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Are You Kidding Me</em></a></span> as a cozier version of <em>WarioWare</em>. Gameplay is mostly made up of microgames that ask you to complete a number of wild tasks in a matter of seconds, but there are also a handful of characters to chat with and get to know in the game’s setting of Nowhere Space. If the combination of high-anxiety <em>WarioWare-</em>style games with laid-back character interactions sounds like a bad match, you’ll be pleasantly surprised by how well it works in the game’s demo. It’s also just nice that you can get some of that <em>WarioWare </em>fun outside of a Nintendo platform.</p></div><div><p>It feels like no Steam Next Fest roundup can be truly complete without at least one retro-inspired horror game in the mix. So here’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1257030/Heartworm/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1257030/Heartworm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Heartworm</em></a></span>. It’s a—say it with me now—retro-inspired horror game that bills itself as a love letter to the likes of <em>Resident Evil</em> and <em>Silent Hill</em>. What makes <em>Heartworm</em> stand out is its striking environmental design that always feels somewhere between a dream and reality, as well as the unique use of a camera as a weapon. This last bit clearly has ties to the game’s larger story and themes that the demo only touches on, but it’s a great teaser for a game that horror fans should keep their eyes on.</p></div><div><p>I can explain <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2666920/Building_Relationships/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2666920/Building_Relationships/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Building Relationships</em></a></span> in simple terms but it won’t really do justice to this game’s brand of weirdness. You play as a house on an island full of other homes and structures and your goal is to fall in love. You’ll do this by rolling and jumping through the 3D world and then striking up conversations with potential matches. Also, there is fishing. I told you it was weird. Yet <em>Building Relationships</em> is also delightful, mostly thanks to some great writing that leans into the absurdity of the premise while never detracting too much from some interesting meditations on the struggle of finding love. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
