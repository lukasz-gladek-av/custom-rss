<figure><a title="Nintendo Indie World Showcase Hopes" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/71310d8c49aa3/nintendo-indie-world-showcase-hopes.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo is going absolutely crazy as tomorrow, 7th August 2025, we're getting our second video game showcase for the Switch 2 and Switch. And it's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/surprise-nintendo-announces-indie-world-showcase-for-thursday-7th-august-2025">an Indie World</a>.</p>
<p>Indie World showcases are always a nice surprise, and given that this is the first for the Switch 2 gen, we might well be seeing a little more Mouse Mode in action — or, quite literally, <em>mice</em>.</p>
<p>The showcase is around 15 minutes long — a little longer over in Japan — so we've cobbled together and picked one game each (well, for the most part) that we've love to see pop up tomorrow. Some we mentioned in our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/nintendo-partner-direct-predictions-what-do-you-expect-to-see">Partner Showcase piece</a> last week, but we've also left a few of those out for a little variety.</p>
<p>Well, let's not waste any more time; let us know what you want to see in the comments, but make sure you read through our hopes and dreams below...</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:186076 @ 1754495565 -->
<h2>Mass farmicide (Ollie Reynolds, staff writer)</h2>
<figure><a title="Grave Seasons" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f33926df7d1b5/grave-seasons.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Blumhouse Games</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I had to really dig deep to come up with something for this, because let's be honest, predicting an Indie World is often a fruitless endeavour. That said, I'm really keen to see more of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/grave_seasons">Grave Seasons</a>, the upcoming farming sim with a serial killer twist from developer Perfect Garbage.</p>
<p>Is it an indie game when it's being propped up by a titan like Blumhouse? Eh, I don't know man, I'm just looking forward to it. It's not due until 2026, so it's likely we'd only get a fresh look at some gameplay at the most, but that's enough for me.</p>
<p>I really need something to inject some life into the dreadfully overcrowded sim genre, and this looks like it might just do that.</p>
<h2>Solid Gold, man (Gavin Lane, editor)</h2>
<figure><a title="The Eternal Life of Goldman" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ee9d126adbfc0/the-eternal-life-of-goldman.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: THQ Nordic</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I'm a sucker for T2, but honestly I'm happy to just wait and see <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/terminator_2d_no_fate">T2: No Fate</a> arrive fully formed at the end of October.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/eternal_life_of_goldman">The Eternal Life of Goldman</a> is the one I'm keen to hear more about, though. It's tough these days to stand out in the indie crowd when there's a parade of lovely-looking trailers coming one after another after another. Great-looking art alone simply doesn't cut it when there's just so much out there - which made Weappy Studio's platformer all the more impressive for catching my attention <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/08/round-up-every-nintendo-reveal-and-more-at-thq-nordics-2024-showcase#the-eternal-life-of-goldman-tbd">last year</a>.</p>
<p>Hopefully the game's other elements — specifically its mechanics and narrative — can match the quality of the stellar animation.</p>
<h2>You've got mail! (Alana Hagues, deputy editor)</h2>
<figure><a title="Tanuki: Pon's Summer" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/614129286bbe0/tanuki-pons-summer.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Critical Reflex</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are a few obvious picks I could easily cram in here since the indie and small developer scene continues to awe me. But I want to use this spot to highlight something we haven’t talked much about at NL: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tanuki_pons_summer">Tanuki: Pon’s Summer</a>.</p>
<p>You’re Pon, a tanuki who delivers mail on a BMX. His boss thinks he’s lazy, but really, Pon just wants to do tricks and flips all the time. You get to make friends, play baseball, and rebuild a shrine, among other things. It’s got lots of typical “cosy” elements, but you’re also a really cool little racoon dog doing sick tricks in the air, and there’s a healthy dose of chaos involved.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3218570/TANUKI_Pons_Summer/">demo on Steam</a> is absolutely delightful, and it’s been getting a ton of buzz in the showcase scene, so I <em>really</em> hope this gets a chance to shine at a Nintendo showcase.</p>
<h2>Anything is good, as long as it's not Silksong (PJ O'Reilly, staff writer)</h2>
<figure><a title="Hollow Knight: Silksong" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1a50f0a2a3c77/hollow-knight-silksong.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Well, I'm fairly easy when it comes to this Indie Direct, to be honest, I love to dive into unexpected indie delights headlong... just as long as we don't get <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a>. That's my only hope.</p>
<p>Yes, if you're out there, Team Cherry, if you're seeing this, we definitely DO NOT want to see the game that we are all dying to play suddenly stealth drop during the broadcast. No thanks. Anything but Silksong. No release date, no new trailer, no stealth dro...</p>
<p>OK. Listen. I see what you're playing at. Ice cold mode. Gloves off, then. Just give us the game and nobody gets hurt. What do you want from me?</p>
<p>Oh, and some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii">Hades 2</a> news would be good.</p>
<h2>Cheeses for us Meeces (Jim Norman, staff writer)</h2>
<figure><a title="Mina the Hollower" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/cbf7e9dfaaeb8/mina-the-hollower.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Yacht Club Games</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>So many games that I'd <em>like</em> to see, but I'm going to ring the bell for Yacht Club's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/mina_the_hollower">Mina The Hollower</a> again because it looks so very up my street and I've waited for long enough. Now yes, we're still technically waiting on console confirmation, but there's no way that the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/shovel_knight">Shovel Knight</a> devs let a game that <em>so clearly</em> takes inspiration from <strong>Zelda</strong> miss out on a Nintendo release.</p>
<p>The PC launch is set for 31st October (spooky), and my fingers are crossed that we Switch Heads are treated to the same.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/guitar-hero-dj-hero-developers-form-redoctane-games/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/original-guitar-hero-publisher-reborn-as-redoctane-games-new-rhythm-game-focused-studio-made-up-of-former-guitar-hero-and-dj-hero-developers.1263483/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Former Guitar Hero and DJ Hero developers, and the creators of the new line of <a href="https://crkd.gg/">CRKD</a> guitars have come together to form <a href="https://www.redoctane.games/">RedOctane Games</a>, a new rhythm game-focused studio that has just entered full production of its debut title, which is set to be revealed later in 2025.</p>



<p>If the RedOctane name sounds familiar to you, that's because RedOctane Inc. was the studio who teamed up with Harmonix to create and publish the first Guitar Hero game back in 2005. It also worked on Guitar Hero II with Harmonix before it was acquired by <a href="https://archive.ph/20120905022821/http://www.next-gen.biz/news/activision-paid-100-mln-redoctane">Activision in 2006</a>, and then under the Activision banner, made Guitar Hero III and Guitar Hero World Tour alongside Neversoft. However, like many other studios under Activision, RedOctane Inc. was caught up <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2010-02-12-activision-shuts-down-redoctane-underground-development.html">in a round of layoffs in 2010</a>, with the whole studio being shut down and laid off.</p>



<p>Now, RedOctane Inc. is reborn in the form of RedOctane Games, headed up by Simon Ebejer, who worked on the Guitar Hero series since Guitar Hero III as part of Neversoft, and most recently worked on Diablo IV as the vice president of operations on the Diablo franchise at Blizzard. Brothers Charles Huang and Kai Huang, who originally founded RedOctane Inc. in 1999, are still part of the RedOctane journey, and confirmed to be members of RedOctane Games' special advisory board.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Beyond Ebejer and the Huang brothers, a press release for the announcement states that the studio is made up of veteran talent who worked on the games that RedOctane was known for nearly two decades ago, and "<em>proven emerging development talent and community leaders from across today's rhythm gaming space</em>." And while the team's first title is set to be revealed later this year, the studio is currently working on "<em>a range of innovative rhythm-based experiences</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Rhythm games are about more than just gameplay, they're about feel, flow, and connection to the music and to each other,</em>" Ebejer said in the press release. "<em>RedOctane Games is our way of giving back to a genre that means so much to us, while pushing it forward in new and exciting directions</em>."</p>



<p>The press release also continues to say that RedOctane Games "<em>is ready to deliver the next evolution in rhythm gaming</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>This game won’t be Guitar Hero, DJ Hero, Guitar Freaks or Rockband. This is something new," </em>a <a href="https://www.redoctane.games/https/redoctanegamessquarespacecom/news/blog-1">blog post</a> on the studio's website from Lee Guinchard reads. "<em>A rhythm game built with love, by people who care, with the community at its core in this fast-changing modern world we live in. We firmly believe the expert here is the community and a new generation of development talent, the folks that have kept the lights on these last few years.</em>"</p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see what RedOctane Games has in the works. Rhythm games are still a significant part of the video game industry, even if they're not taking over living rooms with multiple plastic instruments anymore. Hopefully, we're not waiting too much longer into the rest of 2025 to see what RedOctane Games' debut title is.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/blackbird-mmorpg-leaks-gta-dan-houser-eso-free-2000615981</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sometimes-the-coolest-sounding-games-are-the-ones-we%E2%80%99ll-never-get.1263480/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>Rockstar Games co-founder Dan Houser finally has a publisher for his first project since <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>. A game banned from Steam amid the NSFW censorship crackdown goes free-to-download. And Microsoft’s canceled “<em>Blade Runner</em> meets <em>Destiny</em>” MMORPG <em>Blackbird</em> continues to sound really cool in fresh leaks. Welcome to <em>Kotaku</em>‘s latest Morning Checkpoint, a daily rundown of what’s going on in gaming and beyond, like what James Gunn’s Superman would have looked like <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/superman-trunks-costume-james-gunn-resisted-david-corenswent-pitch-1236252273/">without red underpants</a>. I think he made <a href="https://x.com/DiscussingFilm/status/1952851885490356613">the right choice</a>.</p> <h2>More details on Microsoft’s canceled MMORPG <em>Blackbird</em> leak</h2> <p>A recent <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/news/canceled-xbox-mmo-project-blackbird">report from True Achievements</a> shares apparent plot details from <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-layoffs-zenimax-online-blackbird-elder-scrolls-1851785629">the ill-fated ZeniMax Online project</a>. Its setting included a planet divided between fire and ice, a floating mega city controlled by AI, and various alien factions vying for power. The game would kick off with players investigating a high-profile murder, embarking on missions that would net them more powerful gear, and dealing with firefights that would erupt between the various groups. It all sounds very neat, making the project’s cancelation all the more unfortunate. Of course, it’s easy to take the most broad contours of an unreleased game and transform them into something amazing in your head, when the actual game, had it survived development and actually shipped, might have been anything but. At least with ZeniMax’s unannounced looter shooter, however, Microsoft executives <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-07-03/microsoft-s-xbox-cancels-blackbird-an-upcoming-game-that-impressed-executives">were apparently also very impressed</a>.</p> <h2><em>The Elder Scrolls Online</em> briefly goes free-to-play</h2> <p>The Bethesda MMORPG will let folks dive in without paying as part of QuakeCon 2025 which starts August 7. <a href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/68521">The deal runs through August 12</a>, which should be plenty of time to get through the tutorial section and find out if you dig <em>ESO</em> or not. Released back in 2014, the game has been <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-sales-mario-kart-world-elden-ring-nightreign-1851786793">blowing up on Xbox again recently</a> thanks in part to the arrival of <em>Oblivion Remastered</em> earlier this year. If you’re desperate for more <em>Elder Scrolls</em>,<em> ESO</em> is your best bet right now. <em>The Elder Scrolls 6</em> is in active development but probably still a couple of years away.</p>

 <h2>The post-<em>Grand Theft Auto</em> Absurdaverse draws one step closer</h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/rockstar-games-gta-6-what-is-dan-houser-nexts-game-1851058701">Ex-Rockstar creative Dan Houser</a> and Korean publisher Smilegate announced a partnership on Wednesday to ship Absurd Ventures’ “upcoming AAA, open-world, sci-fi action-adventure game” set in the “mind-bending A Better Paradise” universe. What does any of that even mean? Time will tell. Houser is crafting the story alongside fellow <em>GTA</em> veterans Lazlow Jones and Michael Unsworth, with a studio helmed by ex-Niantic and Pandemic Studios boss Greg Borrud. For a taste of what any of this might be building toward, you can check out Houser’s 2024 audio book series <a href="https://www.absurdventures.com/abetterparadise/book"><em>A Better Paradise Volume 1: An Aftermath</em></a>.</p> <h2><em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</em> comes to console</h2> <p>Strange Scaffold’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/tmnt-tactical-takedown-review-impressions-steam-tactics-1851782184">fun turn-based tactical riff</a> on<em> TMNT</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0prD_mVl45g">revealed</a> it’s coming to Xbox and Nintendo Switch on August 14.</p> <h2>The <em>Hell Is Us</em> Demo arrives on August 12</h2> <p>Don’t sleep on this upcoming horror action game led by the<em> Deus Ex</em> art director. Preview buzz back in May <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LRDO-y9mNI">was surprisingly positive</a>. It’ll be free to try later this month on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p> <h2><em>Vile: Exhumed</em> returns from Steam censorship as a free download</h2> <p>The horror game about uncovering toxic online relationships by combing through someone’s computer files <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-itch-io-sex-game-nsfw-censor-visa-mastercard-1851787281">was swept up in the payment processor NSFW game crackdown late last month</a>.

                <p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil/">Resident Evil</a> games may be full of terrifying monsters, but none might be as persistent or relentless as Duolingo's mascot, Duo the green owl. As he constantly reminds users to complete their language lessons, almost haunting them, the official <a href="https://x.com/REBHPortal" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Resident Evil Portal</a> account posted a crossover nobody expected. </p><p>"Our new biological weapon. Go. Spread language learning to the world," the translation reads (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/resident-evil-official-account-declares-the-duolingo-bird-its-new-biological-weapon-duolingo-responds-english-or-spanish/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>). </p><p>The playful exchange between Resident Evil Portal and Duolingo Japan's Twitter account started off already wild, showing a muscular version of Duo replacing the T-002 Tyrant from the original game. Duolingo Japan responded with an edit of its own, placing Duo in the role of the T-00 Tyrant (Mr. X) from Resident Evil 2. Given Mr. X's reputation for relentlessly chasing players, fans then understood the assignment. </p><p>The fun continued when Resident Evil Portal posted the popular "English or Spanish" meme, asking fans which language Leon Kennedy is studying. Fans pointed to Resident Evil 4, where Leon travels to Spain, and agreed he must be learning Spanish. The Portal account followed up with an image of Leon practicing <a href="https://x.com/REBHPortal/status/1951961277770932250" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">basic Spanish on his phone</a>, as he desperately tried to communicate with hostile villagers from the opening scene. </p><p>The latest reply from Duolingo Japan featured another buff version of Duo, now wearing Mr. X's signature fedora. He warned that he'll chase fans until they can play Resident Evil in English. Fans joined the joke by posting their app progress, which Duo approved. Some are even joking that this is why Leon is missing from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-9-requiem-hands-on-preview/1100-6532336/" data-ref-id="1100-6532336">Resident Evil Requiem</a>--because he's still trapped in a never-ending Spanish lesson. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/guitar-hero-studio-redoctane-returns-with-new-rhythm-game-in-the-works.1263447/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Original&nbsp;<em>Guitar Hero&nbsp;</em>publisher RedOctane has been revived, and the new version of the studio is apparently already hard at work on a brand new rhythm game.</p>

<p>As revealed on the studio's <a href="https://www.redoctane.games/https/redoctanegamessquarespacecom/news/press-release" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>, the new version of RedOctane will be helmed by Simon Ebejer, who worked as production director on a number of&nbsp;<em>Guitar Hero&nbsp;</em>titles while employed at <em>Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock&nbsp;</em>developer Neversoft.</p>

<p>The announcement also says that the newly-revived RedOctane "includes creators and developers who helped create and scale&nbsp;<em>Guitar Hero&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>DJ Hero&nbsp;</em>nearly two decades ago", and that newer developers and creatives from the rhythm gaming space are also joining the studio.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/guitar-hero-redoctane-multiplayer.jpg?itok=HA11ll9o 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/guitar-hero-redoctane-multiplayer.jpg?itok=TnPCjfFM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>RedOctane oversaw the creation of the&nbsp;<em>Guitar Hero&nbsp;</em>franchise in its original form.</figcaption></figure><p>Charles and Kai Huang, the brothers who originally started RedOctane back in the 2000s, will "join a special advisory board" for the revived iteration of the studio, which will bring "deep heritage and insight" into RedOctane's "future direction".</p>

<p>Ebejer says that RedOctane is currently working to deliver "the next evolution in rhythm gaming". In an accompanying <a href="https://www.redoctane.games/https/redoctanegamessquarespacecom/news/blog-1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a>, RedOctane's Lee Guinchard says the project "won't be&nbsp;<em>Guitar Hero</em>,&nbsp;<em>DJ Hero</em>,&nbsp;<em>Guitar Freaks</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>Rock Band</em>", but "something new".</p>

<p>Guinchard, along with several other staffers joining the ranks of the new RedOctane, is part of the <a href="https://crkd.gg/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">CRKD team</a>, a studio that creates modern rhythm game peripherals for old-school&nbsp;<em>Guitar Hero&nbsp;</em>games, as well as the likes of&nbsp;<em>Fortnite Festival&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Clone Hero</em>.</p>

<p>It's not entirely clear whether RedOctane's new game will utilize one of these peripherals (or, indeed, whether it'll come with an entirely new piece of hardware), but given Guinchard and company's expertise, it would seem odd if that wasn't the case.</p>

He joined in 2018.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nintendo recently made the unexpected decision to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/717610/nintendo-switch-original-price-increase">increase the prices of its last-gen Switch hardware</a> due to “market conditions,” adding $30 to the cost of the $199.99 Switch Lite, $40 to the standard $299.99 Switch, and $50 to the $349.99 Switch OLED. The price difference between the Switch OLED and the standalone Switch 2 now stands at a mere $50. But we found a deal that’s worth checking out for those who don’t want to spend anywhere near $400 for a Switch OLED.</p><p>Woot is still offering the <strong>Switch OLED that comes with white Joy-Con controllers and a free download code for <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em></strong>, which is one of the console’s best games. You’ll pay just $289.99 at <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/new-nintendo-switch-oled-mario-kart-8-deluxe-bundle-international-model-2" rel="sponsored">Woot</a>, which was already a good deal at the OLED’s original $349.99 price, let alone compared to its new, inflated price. This deal is available for the next four days, or until supply runs dry.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->290</span></p><div><p>The Nintendo Switch OLED Model: Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Bundle includes a digital copy of <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>.</p></div></div><p>While the Switch 2 is currently getting all of the attention, the Switch OLED remains a great choice due to its vast game library full of modern classics. Some of its games may run better on the Switch 2, but you’ll still get the same experience overall on the last-gen console. In fact, the Switch OLED’s screen is superior in some ways to what’s offered in the newer hardware.</p><p>Looking past the facts that it’s a smaller 720p screen and locked to 60Hz refresh rate, the OLED panel knocks the socks off the Switch 2’s LCD when it comes to color accuracy, contrast, and brightness control. Since there’s an abundance of vibrant games available for the console, including <em>Super Mario Odyssey </em>and <em>The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening</em>, to name a couple, the Switch OLED’s screen will likely impress whoever’s playing on it.</p><p>Something to note: The discounted Switch OLED model is the “International version,” and the biggest difference between this and something you can get at Walmart or Target is that it has a 90-day warranty through Woot. If you can look past that, it includes a power adapter for US outlets, and the console itself is region-free, meaning that games from any region will play as intended.</p><div><p id="other-deals-you-might-like"><h2>Other deals you might like</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>This month’s <strong>Humble Choice lineup for PC gamers</strong> is worth the price of admission. <a rel="sponsored" href="https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/c/482924/2091208/25796?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fmembership">$14.99</a> is all that it costs to get Steam codes for <em>Persona 5 Royal</em>, <em>Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden</em>, cozy game <em>My Time at Sandrock</em>, <em>Lil Gator Game</em>, and more.

Its usual $1,399.99 price isn’t too much to ask, given that it has a 3K 120Hz OLED screen, AMD’s fast Ryzen AI 9 365 processor, 24GB of RAM, a 1TB SSD, and an <em>enormous </em>trackpad.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>Last week, an army of video game journalists, critics, and content creators, myself included, descended upon Los Angeles to get a sneak peek at EA’s upcoming AAA military shooter, <em>Battlefield 6.</em> You can read <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-preview-destruction-classes-bf3-bf4-1851787384">my full preview here</a> and my thoughts on <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-bf6-dragging-people-multiplayer-reveal-ea-1851787385">one of the game’s coolest features here</a>. But this isn’t an article about <em>Battlefield 6.</em> Instead, it’s about what it’s like to travel to and take part in a massive, extravagant, very expensive multi-day video game reveal event. Once upon a time, such events were fairly commonplace, but those days feel long gone.</p> <p>We’re in an odd time for the industry, with every studio and publisher cutting costs, enacting layoffs, and cancelling games to save money, which made EA’s big two-day event in L.A. all the more strange. So I decided to document as much of it as I could to provide some behind-the-scenes information, photos, and stories, offering what insight I can into this aspect of the industry marketing machine and communicating how odd it is to be a part of something as big, expensive, and kind of absurd as a new video game preview event.</p> <h2><strong>Day One – July 29 – Checking In, Sitting Around</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000615984" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000615984"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000615984">©Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I arrived in L.A. on July 29, the day before the event got underway. Electronic Arts put all of us critics and journos up at the same fancy hotel, and I was a bit shocked by how luxurious it was. When I saw the price of a single night at the place, I started realizing just how much money EA was spending on <em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s big multiplayer reveal. “Damn,” I thought to myself. “They really need this thing to be a mega hit.”</p>

 <p>Inside the hotel, I was greeted by <em>Battlefield 6</em> posters and signage in the lobby and on the elevators. Most of the non-gamer guests seemed not to notice any of it. I checked into my room and was handed a letter from EA and Battlefield Studios about the event, as well as my room’s key card. It featured the <em>Battlefield 6</em> logo.</p> <p>In the lobby, I spotted two EA PR people at a <em>Battlefield 6</em> table. I asked them if I needed to do anything, and they said nope. There was nothing planned for today besides a small mixer in the hotel’s lounge area later that night. I had some time to kill. So I visited the Santa Monica pier, ate some churros, watched some <em>Golden Girls</em> on the hotel TV, took a picture of a seal, and splurged on room service because I wanted seafood and was lazy. I crashed that night early and woke up ready to play some <em>Battlefield 6</em> the next day.</p> <h2><strong>Day Two – July 30 – A Gray Warehouse, Limp Bizkit, And <em>Playing Battlefield 6</em></strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000615997" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000615997"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000615997">©Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Leaving my hotel room bright and early, I headed down to see what kind of breakfast spread EA had laid out for all the attendees. In a back area of the hotel I found a large room filled with empty tables and chairs where a smattering of random people had gathered, some I recognized as other writers and gaming media folks, and others whom I had never seen before. The menu was scrambled eggs, sausage, tiny baked potatoes, some fruit, orange juice, and coffee. The food was fine but also free, so I ate a lot of it and then made my way to the front of the hotel, past the <em>Battlefield 6</em> table in the lobby, and boarded a large bus along with all the other games press and we headed over to where EA had set up the big <em>BF6</em> multiplayer reveal event.</p>

 <p>On the bus ride I chatted with some people, like <em>PC Gamer</em>‘s Morgan Park, about what we expected. (We also somehow got onto the topic of how bad <em>MindsEye</em> was.) About 20 minutes later, we pulled up to a large gray warehouse in the middle of a section of Los Angeles filled with similar buildings. Someone on the bus behind me who had been to more events commented: “It’s always a gray warehouse.” Another person replied: “Yup.”</p> <figure id="attachment_2000615989" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000615989"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000615989">©Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>As we walked closer to the warehouse, I started to spot signs sporting the<em> Battlefield 6</em> logo. I also saw a shocking amount of security. A moment later, a trained dog walked by us, guided by a handler as it sniffed everyone’s bags and bodies. Once we reached the security checkpoint, I could hear explosions and gunfire coming from a single speaker haphazardly placed on a table nearby. I guess they wanted to recreate the atmosphere of a <em>Battlefield</em> game. The speaker was loud, and the looping noises were annoying. I felt bad for the PR people and security folks stationed at the checkpoint for that day and the next one.</p>

 <p>Once through the checkpoint, I saw a large military APC vehicle near a big tent set up in the parking lot. <em>Battlefield 6</em> signs and logos were plastered everywhere, with one large sign letting me know the tent area was called the “Mess House.” The efforts to create a military-themed atmosphere went way beyond that, with barrels and sandbags as decoration and more speakers scattered around playing loud war noises. <em>Really</em> loud war noises. It was hard to hear others talk if you stood near them.</p>  <p>Suddenly, I spotted two large Red Bull coolers and dashed over to one. You’d never guess, but they were packed full of ice-cold Red Bull cans. I drank one. And then another. And then way too many over the course of the next 48 hours. I spotted many other members of the press doing the same. Some of us even took a few back to our hotel rooms. Every few hours, I’d spot some staff wheeling out more Red Bulls and refilling the fridges and coolers dotted around the warehouse with more caffeinated beverages. I can only imagine how many Red Bulls were consumed during the event. This truly was an expensive shindig.</p>

 <p>After everyone had arrived and enjoyed some complimentary Red Bull, EA PR ushered us into the warehouse. Not to play <em>Battlefield 6,</em> but instead to sit in a large dark room and watch a stage show featuring devs from Battlefield Studios talking about the game. The first people up included Vince Zampella, the head of Respawn and the guy in charge of fixing <em>Battlefield</em>. A screenshot of a map was displayed on the wall behind him and the others. It started out small, but suddenly that image filled the room around us, effectively placing us “inside” the map, using technology akin to the “Volume” set on which much of <em>The Mandalorian</em> was shot. It was a genuinely neat trick, and when a few minutes later the level exploded around us, I’ll admit I smiled.</p> <p>Then, Zampella and the others left the stage and we saw the first gameplay trailer for <em>Battlefield 6</em>, which featured the musical stylings of Limp Bizkit. I saw some people around me looking confused. I giggled to myself. I guess Limp Bizkit is old enough now that its music can be used as a needle drop in a trailer in an unironic fashion. Weird shit. After the trailer, more people came on stage to talk about <em>BF6</em>. And like before, the room around us showcased an area of the game which, in turn, also blew up. That bit got old after EA did it five times. (They did win the crowd over at one point, though. After we were transported to New York City and it blew up, people cheered.) Between these segments, videos would play showing the devs digitally inserted into combat zones. EA really wanted us to know that this game is filled with explosions, destruction, and war. And if this all sounds familiar, it’s because EA would end up doing this same stage show the following day for the live stream. We were simply witnessing a rehearsal.</p>

 <p>And then… we didn’t get to play the game. Instead, we were ushered outside for lunch. A handful of food trucks were parked near the tent and ornamental APC. All the food was free. Look, it’s not every day I get to try what L.A. food trucks have to offer, and I admit I ate a bit too many quesadillas and cookies, a bit too much BBQ and mac &amp; cheese. Oh, and downed a few more Red Bulls. For some reason, perhaps to torture us, EA left all the speakers on, meaning it was hard to find a quiet place to eat and chat. There was also a Red-Bull-themed APC DJ booth in the food truck parking lot. The music was extremely loud. Nobody wanted to be near it. It was one of the saddest sights I’ve seen: a DJ dancing alone in his Red Bull APC as people actively avoided him and tried to find a chill spot to eat some tacos.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000615993" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000615993"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000615993">©Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Finally, it was time to play <em>Battlefield 6</em>. There were two warehouses filled with PCs running the military shooter. One was well-lit and multi-story—that was for all the content creators. I accidentally found myself in that warehouse and spotted a giant walking peanut carefully making its way downstairs, cluing me into the fact that, like Dorothy in the land of Oz, I’d left my familiar world of traditional game journalists behind and accidentally stepped into the realm of people who make videos on TikTok, sometimes as strange and zany characters.&nbsp;I left and went to my warehouse, where all my fellow bland, ordinary press and games media people were located. It was darker over here, but we did have access to all the Red Bull and chips we could consume. I grabbed another can, sat down at my station, and started playing<em> Battlefield 6</em>. You can read more about the game and what I thought <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-preview-destruction-classes-bf3-bf4-1851787384">here</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-bf6-dragging-people-multiplayer-reveal-ea-1851787385">here.</a></p> <p>At one point, I needed to use the bathroom. I asked an EA PR person where to go, and they pointed to the back of the warehouse. The bathroom was located at the end of a dark hallway filled with red lights that snaked around all the behind-the-scenes equipment and boxes needed to run an event of this size. At the end of this dark hallway was a single security guard on an office chair. He would spot me and others the moment we began our trek to the bathroom. It was awkward knowing that this man was clearly aware that you needed to poop or pee. Each time I returned during my four-hour gameplay session, I tried not to think about it. I asked others later if they felt the same way, and they did.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000615991" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000615991"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000615991">©Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>After playing many hours of <em>Battlefield 6,</em> we were invited to join a BBQ social mixer afterward. There were free drinks, more Red Bull, and even louder music. I stayed for a bit, shoved a ton of food into my face, and then caught an Uber back to the hotel with <em>Polygon</em> writer Giovanni Colantonio. I had writing to do, as the embargo for our preview impressions and other content was the next afternoon. I stayed up late, ordered some food, and consumed two more Red Bulls I’d grabbed from the event in my hotel room. Thankfully, a seal outside my window kept me company as I typed. <em>Golden Girls</em> on TV helped me fall asleep, and I prepared myself for day three.</p> <h2><strong>Day 3 – Deja Vu, Killing Tactical Grandma, Swag</strong></h2> <p>Day three began a lot like day two. I got up early, regretted drinking so many Red Bulls, brushed my teeth, took a quick shower, and made sure my blogs were ready to go live later that day. Then I headed down for breakfast where today, instead of sausage, we got overcooked bacon. We were then packed into another bus, and whisked back to the gray warehouse, where all the speakers were still blaring war sounds.</p> <p>The Red Bull DJ was also still there, and so were the food trucks. We were ushered into the warehouse to watch the day’s big livestream, and ended up spending an hour just sitting there. Eventually, we got to watch the same show we’d seen the day before, but now performed for viewers around the world, with everyone on stage seeming a lot more excited. This was it, the big reveal of the game they’d all been working on for years. I could tell they were genuinely excited to be there as they jumped and pumped fists in the dark areas offstage away from the audience. Still, a bit annoying to have to watch the same presentation twice, even if they did add a battle royale tease the second time around.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000615995" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000615995"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000615995">©</figcaption></figure> <p>After that, the computers were opened back up to people who wanted to play more <em>Battlefield 6.</em> I was one of those people, so I hopped on and played another three hours. I was killed by some famous streamers during my second session, including TimTheTatMan. At one point, I rounded a corner in a dusty building and shot TacticalGrandma in the face with a shotgun. Strange day. Later on, after hearing that EA was doing one-on-one interviews with some press people despite telling me that wouldn’t be possible, I asked if I could get an interview. I was politely told no. I really wanted to ask about <em>BF6</em>‘s awesome-looking Portal mode, which seems to be Halo Forge but in <em>Battlefield</em>. Sounds cool. Hope I can talk to someone at EA about that mode in the future.</p>

 <p>Before leaving, I was given some<em> Battlefield 6</em> swag, including a jacket, hat, water bottle, and stickers. I’m not really a fan of swag, but I politely took it and then realized I’d have to cram it all into my backpack to get it back home. That night, there was no lowkey post-show mixer. Instead, EA had booked a swanky afterparty to celebrate the reveal of <em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s multiplayer. Along with other journalists, I boarded a really fancy bus and rode for nearly an hour to the Sunset Room, where the party was happening.</p> <h2>The Afterparty And Coming Home</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000615986" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000615986"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000615986">©Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><a href="https://sunsetroomhollywood.com/">Entering the Sunset Room</a>, I felt immediately out of place. I don’t drink booze. I’m not a fancy guy. And I’m certainly not a nightclub dude. But I was there and I decided to enjoy it. I drank another free Red Bull. I think that was my 12th one. I dunno, I lost track. Entering the outdoor lounge attached to the club, we spotted TVs and PS5 consoles set up with <em>Battlefield 6.</em> Even though we’d all spent the last two days playing it, a group of us rushed over, passed a big, confused security guard, and started playing some more <em>BF6</em>. The game feels great on a PS5 controller and ran perfectly. As more people arrived, it became clear the invite list included a lot of folks from outside the realm of gaming as well. One guy sat down next to me and asked about what all these buttons do. I killed him like 20 times. I felt a bit bad, but he laughed and grabbed another glass of booze.</p>

 <p>Eventually, a large crowd formed around the <em>BF6</em> station at the party, and I realized I had probably played enough, so I got up and let someone else play. Snaking my way through the crowd, I bumped into a big security guard. Behind him: Travis Barker from Blink-182. He chatted up Vince Zampella, took some photos, and then played <em>Battlefield 6</em> for a bit. I got as close as I could, and from what I could tell, he didn’t do great. Later, I kicked myself for giving up my spot earlier. I could have killed Travis Barker a few times. Dang. After Travis left, I squeezed back into the demo area and got on a PS5 console, and started playing <em>BF6</em> again. This time, however, there was a large group of people at the other end of the row of TVs. Andy McNamara, a senior EA comms guy, was coaching someone on how to play the game. I looked over and could barely make out a woman. Later on, after looking at photos online, <a href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/brie-larson-attends-the-battlefield-6-reveal-celebration-news-photo/2227972875?adppopup=true">I realized that I had played <em>Battlefield 6</em> with Brie Larson</a>.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000615985" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000615985"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000615985">©Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Later on, I spotted a tired-looking Tactical Grandma at the party. I wondered if I should say sorry for blasting her in the face earlier, but then I remembered she killed me at one point, so I figured we were even. Over in the VIP area, Brie Larson was hanging out after playing <em>BF6.</em> I headed over and found her sitting with a gaggle of people, laughing and taking photos. Thanks to a connection, I was able to snag a VIP bracelet and got into the area. Someone I spoke to had talked with Larson earlier, and she told them she was playing <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>. Unfortunately, by the time I got in, the VIP section was crowded, and talking to anyone was challenging. At one point, I overheard a guard mention that too many VIP passes were being handed out. I realized that maybe it was time to leave that area. At least I can say I sat a few feet away from Brie Larson at a party. That’s kind of cool, right?</p>

 <p>Not long after my trip to the VIP section, I realized it was nearly midnight and I had a flight to catch at 8 a.m., so I grabbed an Uber with another writer and we headed back to the hotel. I packed up, watched a bit more <em>Golden Girls</em>, and went to bed, happy to know I was going to be home soon. Little did I know that, due to multiple flight cancellations and delays, I’d end up flying from LAX to Seattle to Minneapolis, where I’d sleep on the floor of the airport before catching a tiny jet home to Kansas City. It was a miserable return and a bizarre ending to what was overall a fun, but strange video game event.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000615998" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000615998"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000615998">© Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>While I was lying on the floor of an airport at 2 AM, I had time to think and decompress. For me, this event was at times a very awkward experience. All of this—the free Red Bull, paying for me to fly out there, giving me swag, putting me up in a nice hotel, stuffing my face with complimentary food—was done in an effort to win me over. EA and the PR team running this would never explicitly say they were trying to bribe any of us into writing nice things about the game, but it’s impossible not to think about it that way when you sit down and start typing up your thoughts. Of course, I remained honest in my writing, and I imagine almost every other member of the press there similarly wasn’t swayed one way or the other by all the free energy drinks. Still, it’s an awkward dance to be part of as everyone involved on both sides knows what’s happening, why it’s happening, and that it won’t really work. &nbsp;It’s also hard not to think that companies like EA probably wouldn’t spend so much money on events like this if they didn’t believe that, on some level, it worked, that all that special treatment would result in more and better coverage of the game.</p> <p>For EA, the whole thing was likely very expensive, and it makes me nervous for the folks working on <em>Battlefield 6</em>. EA is expecting this game to be a massive hit, and if it fails to do that, it could mean that a lot of people will be out of work by next year. Hopefully, that doesn’t happen, and <em>Battlefield 6</em> is a blockbuster success that revives the franchise and is a blast to play for years to come. For now, all I can do is look back at my notes, remind myself not to drink a Red Bull for a few months, and remember how odd it was to be a part of something so big and silly.</p>

<p>Gears of War: Reloaded brings the OG Gears game into 2025. But it’s not to be confused with Gears of War: Ultimate Edition, and the differences between the two releases are very different.</p>



<p>From the outside, Gears of War’s Ultimate Edition and Reloaded are very similar. They’re both updated versions of the 2006 classic. There’s a 10-year difference between the two releases. But you’re probably wondering to yourself: What’s included in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gears of War: Reloaded</a> that can’t be found in the Ultimate Edition?</p>



<p>It’s a good question. I’ve already answered another burning query: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/which-games-does-gears-of-war-reloaded-include/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Which games does Gears of War: Reloaded include?</a> So let’s now run through each version and what to expect.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-gears-of-war-ultimate-edition-amp-gears-of-war-reloaded-difference">Every Gears of War: Ultimate Edition &amp; Gears of War: Reloaded Difference</h2>



<figure><figcaption>You again. Credit to The Coalition</figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-crossplay-amp-cross-progression">Crossplay &amp; Cross-Progression</h3>



<p>Gears of War: Reloaded has both <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-crossplay-cross-platform-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crossplay and cross-progression</a>. The Ultimate Edition was released before these trends became commonplace. This means if you own Reloaded, you can do co-op campaign outings and play online multiplayer with players across PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.</p>



<p>Plus, your save data can be transferred across all applicable platforms for an easy way to make progress on any format.</p>



<h3 id="h-playstation-debut">PlayStation Debut</h3>



<p>Hell froze over the day <a href="https://www.gearsofwar.com/games/gears-reloaded/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reloaded</a> was announced. Xbox and PC players getting to play it wasn’t a surprise, but a Gears title coming to PS5? It’s a sign of the times and how the era of exclusives and first-party media is coming to an end.</p>



<p>Reloaded is coming out on PS5 the same day as Xbox and PC—August 26. Again, crossplay is a great asset for speedier matchmaking and great interconnectivity. The Ultimate Edition can’t be purchased on PlayStation, but Reloaded sure can.</p>



<h3 id="h-reloaded-is-a-remake-not-a-remaster">Reloaded is a Remake, Not a Remaster</h3>



<p>The two words are fairly interchangeable, but there is a big difference between the two. A remaster is the same content but with shinier visuals, whereas a remake upgrades the visuals, but also includes new features and might make the odd tweak to a map, gun, or sometimes even the story.</p>



<p>From what I understand, the narrative is unchanged—which is good for those seeking purity. But expect subtle differences here and there.</p>



<h3 id="h-updated-graphics">Updated Graphics</h3>



<p>The Ultimate Edition was released in 2015 and boasted 1080p / Full HD / 30 FPS for the campaign and 60 FPS for multiplayer. This was impressive at the time, but it seems cute now.</p>



<p>Gears of War: Reloaded comes locked and loaded with 4K, HDR, VRR, and 120 FPS. The difference in graphical fidelity is massive and a serious upgrade, even if you played the Ultimate Edition. </p>



<h2 id="h-should-you-play-gears-of-war-reloaded-if-you-own-gears-of-war-ultimate-edition">Should You Play Gears of War: Reloaded if You Own Gears of War: Ultimate Edition?</h2>



<p><strong>If you love the first GOW game, I’d still recommend playing Gears of War: Reloaded if you’ve purchased the Ultimate Edition before.</strong></p>



<p>I’m the kind of person who buys remasters of remasters—don’t judge me. If I love a game enough, I find new excuses to play it again. Reloaded’s content is <em>mostly</em> the same as the Ultimate Edition. It has all the fun DLC included, too.</p>



<p>The major improvement Ultimate Edition owners will experience is the graphics and performance. I think these are reasons enough to play Reloaded.</p>



<p>Notice how I’ve said “play” instead of “buy” throughout this guide? This is because if you’ve owned the Ultimate Edition before, you might be entitled to a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-gears-of-war-reloaded-free-upgrade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free Gears of War: Reloaded upgrade</a>.</p>



<hr>



<p>I hope I’ve cleared up the key differences between Gears of War: Ultimate Edition and Reloaded. If you know of any more, let me know through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Each year, Visual Concepts delivers one of the most consistent in-action products in all of sports video games through its NBA 2K franchise. While the heavily refined gameplay is primarily to thank, the immersion delivered by the NBA 2K series is as good as any other sports series at immersing yourself in the on-the-court action and feeling the energy of the arena.</p><p>Today, Visual Concepts released a blog post detailing how the development team worked to create a more immersive basketball experience through <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/08/nba-2k26s-cover-athlete-is-mvp-shai-gilgeous-alexander" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="f4aee258-d605-4917-8a05-f15e8faa82ba" data-entity-substitution="canonical">NBA 2K26</a>. New shaders bring out subtleties in players' skin, muscles, and jerseys, as well as each arena's lighting and floors; this is particularly noticeable in arenas that use pyrotechnics, as the haze takes a short period to dissipate, impacting how the lighting shines in the arena during the start of play.&nbsp;</p><p>The arena atmosphere also enjoys an improvement this year, with a massive boost to crowd variety, with twice as many character models with a wider range of body types, heads, and age groups to better represent the NBA fan base. Those fans will also have more props like rally towels, foam fingers, and rubber chickens that appear during key moments and special games. Fans will also sometimes wear LED wristbands that aid in creating light shows in the crowd during pre-game introductions and big moments during games.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Those big moments extend beyond the games, as the NBA Cup is now fully integrated, and all seven NBA regular-season trophies have ceremonies that occur at the winning player's first home game after winning the award. Banners to celebrate championships are shown being raised to the rafters to add to the overall pageantry of the in-game experience.&nbsp;</p><p>NBA teams also have team-specific features within the flow of the game, with all 30 NBA arenas designed to contain all the small-detail features of the arenas they're emulating. That includes the PA announcers and the broadcast commentary. On top of more real in-arena PA announcers, the broadcast booth adds Tim Legler as a commentator, joining the existing Kevin Harlan, Greg Anthony, Stan Van Gundy, Shams Charania, and others. Additionally, more international correspondents have been added. Finally, as the clock ticks down, the commentary's urgency will more accurately reflect the game's stakes.</p><p>Visual Concepts' VP of NBA 2K development, Erick Boenisch, exclusively answered <em>Game Informer</em>'s questions about these presentation improvements. You can see his responses below.</p><hr>

<p><strong>NBA 2K has long been arguably the best-looking sports game on the market. Why was capturing the in-the-arena atmosphere such an emphasis this time around, and how did the development team go about identifying the places that needed improvement?</strong></p><p>Every year, our team does a full audit of all NBA arenas, because you'd be surprised how often things change, so we pay close attention to every little detail.</p><p>Here’s one example: The Lakers reshuffled their retired jerseys and championship banners at the very top of the arena, way up in the rafters. We all watched WNBA legend Candace Parker’s jersey retirement ceremony and noticed when they unveiled the jersey, the placement looked different compared to our game. I checked our build, confirmed the layout was outdated, and we immediately started pulling new references to update it for 2K26.</p><p>Even though most players will never pan the camera that high, we still made the fix. Why? Because we care about those establishing shots, those tiny moments of realism. That kind of obsessive attention to detail is what defines Visual Concepts and the NBA 2K series. We want fans to know that when they step into an arena in our game, they're experiencing the real thing, down to the banners in the rafters.</p><p><strong>On that same note, the game already looked so good that when I saw new shaders for both players and floors, as well as new lighting, I wondered how much impact it could truly have. Is there a way to explain how much it will help without just putting a side-by-side image or video with 2K25?</strong></p><p>Absolutely. While visuals have always been a strong point for the NBA 2K franchise, we made a major leap this year, especially with our court shaders. For example, last year, the Oklahoma City Thunder’s court at Paycom Center looked a bit washed out, if not on the dull side. This year, it has that lifelike look that makes you want to just reach out and touch it.</p><p>The floor shader alone makes a massive difference, especially since the court is a continual showpiece on the screen in every frame of gameplay. It’s definitely one of the most noticeable visual upgrades in 2K26. This is particularly evident when comparing 2K25 vs. 2K26.</p><p>We spent months fine-tuning every floor, because not every arena is the same. Some courts have a more flat finish, while others have a higher-gloss shine. We went through each arena with the new shader, established a visual baseline, and adjusted the shaders and lighting to reflect their real-life counterparts. It’s a level of detail that adds to the overall immersion in a way that’s hard to quantify – until you see it in motion.</p>

<p><strong>But so many of these small details of almost like, "Okay, who would even notice this?" Can you talk about how all of these tiny visuals and atmospheric details add up to create something greater than the sum of its parts?</strong></p><p>I always say every detail matters to someone. There's always that person. Maybe they're a shoe person; doesn’t even look at the player, just immediately checks if the laces are right or if the material on the midsole is accurate. Then there's a tattoo person, who asks, "Did you update LaMelo’s tattoo behind his left ear?"</p><p>There are hair people, too. A player will change their style yesterday, and someone’s already asking why it’s not reflected in-game today. Every detail matters to someone, and that’s part of the beauty of our cultural crossover with NBA 2K. The connection between the game and real life is so deep, it’s mind-blowing to me.</p><p>When you layer every one of those details together, that’s what makes NBA 2K26 feel like the most authentic sports game ever made.</p><p><strong>Why were the crowds such a big emphasis this time around?</strong></p><p>Crowds were a major focus for us in NBA 2K26. We have been so focused on pushing forward with groundbreaking tech, like ProPLAY, that some of the atmosphere elements didn’t evolve as much as I would have liked in recent years.</p><p>This year, we changed that. While we continued innovating on the gameplay side, including introducing the all-new Motion Engine derived from ProPLAY, we also made time to make noticeable improvements.</p><p>To start, we doubled the number of crowd models – more heads, more bodies – and introduced a broader variety of ages, ethnicities, body types, and outfits. You’ll even notice more lifestyle brand clothing now. We also doubled the crowd animation instances, meaning you’ll see less people standing up and sitting down at the same time. Again, just like courts, crowds take up a big portion of the frame, so to get them right and reacting to the on-court action in a believable fashion, it adds a fresh layer of authenticity and immersion to the incredible NBA 2K26 experience.</p>

<p><strong>I personally love the small touches, like the trophy ceremonies or added contextual awareness from the commentary team. How does this additional layer of immersion serve the on-court product of the NBA 2K franchise?</strong></p><p>It gives players something more to play for – something that makes the experience feel alive and earned. We’ve added a few new features to truly capture the pageantry of winning in the NBA. Starting with trophy ceremonies: If a player wins MVP, Rookie of the Year, Defensive Player of the Year, or receives any of the regular season NBA awards, players will now see the award presented during the first game of the following season. A player will have to get through the offseason, free agency, the draft, and preseason before they finally reach that first game of the next season, making it feel like a real continuation of their journey. It’s a small moment, but incredibly satisfying and realistic that we have gone to that level of detail to celebrate the players.</p><p>Also new this year is the addition of dynamic banners, and as a franchise player myself, I couldn’t be more excited about this one. As you win titles, actual banners will be raised into the rafters to celebrate your championships. What's really cool is that they’ll continue to update throughout your MyNBA/MyCAREER as you win more titles and awards, a tangible reflection of your team’s legacy and place in NBA history.</p><p><strong>What does the addition of Tim Legler do for the booth?</strong></p><p>The NBA 2K development has always taken pride in its presentation and commentary, offering the best commentary in any sports game, hands down. We’ve built a deep roster of multiple commentary teams, complete with sideline reporting, color analysis, and play-by-play, which really makes our game feel unique.</p><p>This year, we added Tim Legler to the team. As a former NBA player, he knows the ins and outs of every situation, and his insight brings even more authenticity and depth to the presentation. When you add new talent like Tim to our best-in-class commentary, along with the real PA announcers for each arena, and TV-style overlays, you get that NBA 2K26 package that just can't be matched anywhere else.</p>

<p><strong>Obviously, the late-game commentary will happen with closely contested games, but is the inverse true? Will the commentators be a bit more relaxed during a blowout? Or will they get into side conversations, or talk about what this means for either team against the broader backdrop of the season?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>One of the things I’m most proud of with our commentary is how we’re always aware of the situation on the court. Throughout the game, the commentary adjusts to the moment. In the first half, for example, you’ll see the commentators be a little more loosey-goosey. The announcers will have longer conversations – threads that play out between baskets.</p><p>You may see guests like Shams Charania drop in during the second or early third quarter to deliver league updates and add flavor. But when the fourth quarter hits and the game is close, the tone changes noticeably. The energy picks up, the commentary becomes laser-focused on the outcome. Instead of hearing about how the Mavericks did last year or speculating on Cooper Flagg’s future, you're getting high-intensity, game-specific analysis. It’s all about drama and potential turning points.</p><p>The commentators are always in sync with the game's tone, which makes for a more immersive and intelligent experience. That level of situational awareness is something we’ve really refined for 2K26, and I think it stands out as a very strong level-up in our presentation.</p><p><strong>As someone who recently attended his first NBA Playoff game, the atmospheric difference between it and a low-stakes regular-season game is palpable. How is the team using all of these new additions to capture that magical feeling in the arena?</strong></p><p>Going to a playoff game is an unmatched experience. People are much, much louder than in a regular-season game. Fans are wearing the custom Playoff shirts left on the seats. Some teams have incredible traditions. All of this is reflected in NBA 2K26.</p><p>Our commentators will look back on regular-season matchups – like noting if one team won two out of three against their opponent – which adds real narrative context. They’ll have a higher sense of volume for the entirety of the game in playoff games. There's even custom graphic packages and presentational overlays, including looks at the other side of the bracket, all of which contributes to that immersion.</p><p>It’s that level of presentation that makes playoff games feel truly different from regular-season games. If you're playing a conference finals or NBA Finals game and it feels like just another regular season matchup, then we've missed the mark, and that's something we take seriously. For Visual Concepts, that distinction is critical.</p><hr><p>For more on the NBA 2K series, check out our review of last year's game, NBA 2K25, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/nba-2k25/best-kept-on-the-court" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e3b7a06a-9304-4e81-8675-4560df8e8ac1" data-entity-substitution="canonical">here</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ari Aster's new movie, <em>Eddington</em>, is a polarizing representation of a polarized nation. Riley and Gita sat down to chat about what works, and what doesn't.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Hi Riley! Both of us are here to talk about <em>Eddington</em>, the confounding new film from director Ari Aster. I know my interest was piqued in this movie when I saw the absolutely stacked cast--Pedro Pascal, Joaquin Phoenix (my husband's favorite actor), Austin Butler, and Emma Stone all appear in the film. What got you interested in this movie? I'm not sure if I can call myself a fan of Ari Aster's work, but he certainly gets my butt in a seat.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> I saw someone post about the trailer on social media and it looked interesting; I feel like I haven't seen a ton of media that straightforwardly grapples with COVID, and I was intrigued by what I saw as folks saying it was a Western. I'm not a big going-to-the-movies person, a fact that, combined with the only available seats at our showing being right in the front such that the movie was very literally in my face, made it a pretty intense experience.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Oh my god. I saw Hereditary and <em>Midsommar </em>in theaters and I would not want to be literally right in front of the screen for that. I enjoyed both <em>Hereditary </em>and <em>Midsommar</em>, but I also have problems with both these films. I think for me, I wanted to go into <em>Eddington </em>and see what he can do outside of the horror framework and honestly, I think this Aster's best work yet.</p><p>We chatted a little bit about this earlier, but you mentioned not being a horror guy but also having seen <em>Beau Is Afraid</em> and liking it. That's the only Aster I haven't seen. What's your general opinion of Aster?</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Eddington | Official Trailer HD | A24" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oL6jZqExlIk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><strong>Riley:</strong> I don't really have one--at the risk of sounding like a philistine, I'm not big on particular directors or anything. I saw <em>Midsommar </em>because it was supposed to be about religion and was disappointed when it wasn't terribly, and I never saw <em>Hereditary </em>because I am a weenie who hates horror. I really liked <em>Beau Is Afraid</em>, or at least the beginning of it (an opinion I also have of <em>Eddington</em>, which I imagine we'll get to!). As a very anxious person, I was intrigued by the idea of "what if all your anxieties are real, though?" because one of the problems I've found with my many anxieties is that sometimes they are, and that just convinces your (my) brain to keep having them in case one day they're real again.</p><div><p><strong>Gita:</strong> You don't have to be a big movie guy when you're our resident boat expert. I, unfortunately, have a degree in cinema studies.</p><p>I know we both agree that the first act of <em>Eddington </em>is probably its strongest. I saw this movie in a theater that was full of people over 50 and they were all screaming at each twist and turn. Before the second act plot twist, this is a really compelling movie about how living on the internet during lockdown kind of broke everyone's brains. Essentially, Pedro Pascal plays the liberal mayor of Eddington, new Mexico, and Joaquin Phoenix plays his disgruntled sheriff who doesn't want to wear a mask. That conflict is basically the basis for the first half of the movie, before things take a turn for the worse.</p></div><p><strong>Riley:</strong> Yeah, I really liked that setup. I think seeing the movie in New York gave that initial conflict a certain weight that I wondered if would read differently elsewhere. My sister lived in suburban Texas when COVID started and we had very different opinions about masks, but I could hold that some of that came from what Phoenix's character starts off saying: you have these blanket rules across the country, but the lived experience of a certain place might make them chafe more than they did in, say, NYC. </p><p>Hot take: I thought that the movie started off at least with a kind of earnestness that I think did undergird at least some regular people's descent into conspiracies and anti-public health stuff. People seem to be honestly looking for meaning wherever they can find it in a scary new situation. Some people took advantage of that to prey on others, and some took advantage of it to rise to a kind of power that we've now seen wreak destructive havoc across the country. But I thought the movie and many of its characters did start out with their hearts sort of in the right place, even if I don't believe what they believed.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> I think the most interesting subplot in the movie is Emma Stone's, who plays Joaquin Phoenix's wife. At the start of the film, we see that she stays at home making these incredibly weird dolls all day, while her mother listens to conspiracy podcasts. She's not especially sexually open with her husband, and he clearly loves her and wants to protect her but doesn't quite know what to do. </p><p>Over her few appearances, we start to see her listen to Austin Butler's character's podcasts, which are all have a Q-Anon-esque, "Save The Children" slant. The idea of harm against children clearly really affects Stone's character and she slowly slides into conspiracy because of her own unaddressed childhood trauma. That was the most convincing example of how a person who's basically reasonable can start believing something that simply doesn't make sense.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> Yeah, totally. I wish they did more with that guy, I was really intrigued by that. But I wish the movie did more with all of its ideas in general.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> I think this is generally my issue with Aster: in a horror context, you can allude to interesting ideas and not fulfill that promise, because horror often relies on the fear of the unknown. I do think he's better about this without the framing of horror--there's way less shocking moments for the sake of being shocking in this movie--but there's still that lingering sense of the ideas being unresolved or passed over.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> Yeah, I felt like the same thing happened in <em>Beau Is Afraid</em>. The movie starts with all these strong, real things: Phoenix's character running for mayor, and the conflict with his wife, and the drama at the police department and with the town kids' Black Lives Matter protests. Some of this stuff is played for laughs in ways I'm not sure it had to be--the protests are a punchline, but they also made me think about, well small towns can also have protests!--and then all the tension rises to one really strong boiling point. But after that, I felt like instead of following through, Aster just kind of veers in another direction that makes the whole thing feel more like a shrug.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> The protests were really interesting in that they are definitely set up as a punchline: basically Pedro Pascal's son is deliberately trolling his white male friend by hooking up with the extremely woke white teenage girl who plans the protests. But it was interesting to me that the movie also vindicates her in the second half of the film. Everything she says about whiteness defending itself and police violence does end up being correct. It's maybe the only part of the second half of the movie that makes it feel grounded in reality.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> I feel like we're trying to avoid talking about spoilers but we could do that!</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> God, okay. It's spoiler time.</p><p><strong>SPOILERS</strong></p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> After an INCREDIBLE usage of Katy Perry's Firework at Pedro Pascal's mayoral fundraiser, after Joaquin Phoenix has been humiliated by him in every possible way, Joaquin Phoenix decides to kill him. And the rest of the movie is Phoenix's increasingly harebrained schemes to cover up the murder and pin it on his black deputy.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> I wasn't sure if he pinned it on the deputy on purpose, or if things just kind of shook out that way? But he definitely wants to pin it on--sigh--antifa and the protestors.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Okay so, here's the thing. I don't think those were actual antifa supersoldiers (a very funny sentence to write). Throughout the film--in fact, the very first thing we see in the film--there's talk about Eddington building data centers for a tech firm called SolidGoldMagikarp. They're backing Pedro Pascal 100%. After Pascal's death we first see the so-called antifa, but the look mercenary, military, and are notably white and extremely sophisticated in their methods of hunting Phoenix down. The last thing you see in the movie is the successfully built data center, pristine in the middle of the desert. I think these soldiers were sent by SolidGoldMagikarp to protect their financial interests, which would also handily tie into the way that technology is portrayed throughout the movie.</p><p>Every time someone takes out their phone in this movie, everything gets worse. It's like a damage multiplier. Aster shoots people taking phones out of their pocket like someone unholstering their gun. Ultimately, the internet and technology is behind every single moment of conflict, and the second half of the movie literalizes that.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> Hhm, that's an interesting take! A friend <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1m7gr9y/eddington_solidgoldmagikarp_and_hyperreality/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told me "SolidGoldMagikarp" is an AI reference?</a></p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Not so much a take, I guess. It was the conclusion I drew as soon as I left the movie, one that other theater goers shared with me and took as fact (ALL the old people in my theater wanted to talk to us about what the hell they just watched, lmao). Given the rest of Aster's oeuvre, the guy just has a nastiness about the human race. Evil often wins out over good. I just don't buy the idea of antifa super soldiers being "real" in the context of the film. Earlier in the movie, there's footage of a shootout with police in another city, and we later see that on the phone of one of the soldiers that comes to hunt Phoenix down, as if they're deliberately trying to stir the pot. And I think actually this reference to AI solidifies that for me.</p><p>All these characters live on their phones, especially during lockdown. They don't experience reality, but a secondary "hyper reality" that feels more concrete than the actual material world. Antifa super soldiers exist within that hyper reality, a deliberate fiction given flesh by SolidGoldMagikarp. But it becomes the truth, anyway.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> Yeah, definitely. And I think that cynicism goes sort of hand-in-hand with the swerve the movie takes. I thought it started off being about "real" things but then, for whatever reason, couldn't keep it up and just had to dive into weirdo nonsense/ "look at these dumbasses" kind of stuff. And I don't love that, not just because I am an avowed hater of nonsense but also because there isn't that much to do with that as audience member. Like, what kind of lesson is "everyone sucks" or "phones are bad for you," the latter of which I think was especially complicated during the early days of COVID lockdowns because, like, what else were you supposed to do?</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Right! I think the more that Aster delves into the metaphysical, the more he loses me. I don't disagree with the general idea that safeguarding capital interests is behind a lot of what is wrong with out society, but he loves to take an extremely simple idea and just be……. extremely fucking vague about it.</p><p>Entities like SolidGoldMagikarp are portrayed as forces of nature. In the final shootout, the super soldiers seem inhumanly strong and powerful, it's honestly a great bit of filmmaking and thrilling to watch. But it's not like a hurricane or an earthquake--it's people making choices, and I suppose I don't see people are fundamentally evil in the way that Aster does.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> Yeah, I wish it had stayed pressed against the setup--is he going to caught for shooting the mayor, what will happen next, what about his wife--and forced all that into its conclusion, instead of going "ah well here's an antifa supersoldier." I think there is something really interesting to mine in the idea of, what if certain conspiracy theories were true, but I also think it's weird that of all the ones in the movie, that's the one to pick? And then don't even do anything particularly interesting with it?</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> It's also just………. bonkers violent. It's violent in a way that felt almost funny at a certain point. People get their LIMBS shot off!</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> Haha, it's nuts! It's such a contrast to that first shooting of the guy in the bar, which I also felt like was the most shocking violence. I think the bigger the violence got, the more I was like, OK this is just movie violence.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> I am not usually squeamish but the shot of the knife going into Joaquin Phoenix's head got me.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> Yeah, ugh!! But at the same time I'm just like…why? Why any of this?</p><div><p><strong>Gita:</strong> The point of the movie seems to be "we are living in a hell of our own making." I don't necessarily disagree with that, but the movie makes it feel inevitable in a way that… I just don't agree!</p><p>I don't really enjoy media about why everything is pointless. That said, Aster did for at least half the movie tap into something very real. I don't think I've seen the pandemic portrayed more accurately in media--not a high bar, since it's rarely portrayed at all.</p></div><p><strong>Riley:</strong> Yeah! I am not as familiar with his whole deal as you, but I wonder if it didn't just become… too much, the way I think a lot of the consequences of the pandemic are when you look at them too hard. Like, I don't know what I would have done with the movie instead, I don't know how you answer the question of, like, "what is wrong with everybody now and can it be fixed?"</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> I suppose I can cut Ari Aster some slack for not resolving the major question of the world's society in a movie.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/akane-banashi-shonen-jump-manga-anime"><h3>The Best Shonen Manga Right Now Is About A Niche Performance Artist’s Fall From Grace</h3></a><p>Akane-banashi getting an anime isn't shocking because it's the best ongoing Shonen Jump manga</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/labubu-lafufu-lawsuit-pop-mart-7-eleven"><h3>Labubu To Lafufu: ‘See You In Court’</h3></a><p>Pop Mart is suing 7-Eleven for allegedly selling fake Labubus in its stores</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ign-layoffs-ziff-davis"><h3>IGN Lays Off 8 Staff, 12% Of Union</h3></a><p>The layoffs follow wider cuts at Ziff Davis, buyouts, and layoffs and departures at acquired sites</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/gabe-newell-oceano-yacht-steam-valve"><h3>Gabe Newell Bought A Yacht Company</h3></a><p>Valve's head honcho is now in the big boat business</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/eddington-ari-aster-covid-movie-pedro-pascal-joaquin-phoenix]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/league-legends-wild-rift">League of Legends: Wild Rift</a> executive producer David Xu has said Riot "can and will do better," after sharing an anniversary video to the game's account on Chinese social media site Weibo that very much looks to be AI slop.</p>
<p>However, Xu hasn't confirmed that the video did use AI in this sort-of-apology, instead claiming this was a "creator-made" video that'd found its way onto the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a>' spin-off's official channels.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The video, since taken down from Weibo (but preserved for prosperity via Reddit and <a href="https://x.com/AroushTheKween/status/1952415263464603741">Twitter</a> reposts from bemused fans), depicts a big concert in celebration of Wild Rift's third anniversary. Or, as the text in the video spells it "aniversary," with the R in "3rd" looking very janky to boot. Several of your faves, including Jinx, Seraphine, and Yasuo, are doing their best to entertain a crowd who at several points look terrifyingly rubber-faced.</p>
<p>While I can't make out any six-fingered hands, there are plenty of visual glitches that you'd expect from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-need-to-reclaim-softwares-wishing-well-from-the-cruelty-of-generative-ai">generative AI</a>, from misbehaving tails to shapeshifting handguns that can't quite decide if they're firing bullets or lasers. Also, this might just be a mistranslation, given this vid appeared on Chinese socials, but one of the song's main lyrics being 'Can we turn up the blower higher' is sending me because it sounds like a Northern teenager gently moaning that they want the air con in their mum's car cranked up.</p>

"Yesterday we posted a creator-made video on our official Weibo channel that, frankly, did not hit the mark," he wrote. "When we post content on our official channels, it's on us to maintain a high quality bar and be clear about where it came from. Thank you for all the feedback, we can and will do better."</p>
<p>So, allegedly it's all third-party content that shouldn't have gone up on main, but there's been no direct acknowledgement of the AIlephant in the room - or whether Riot might put out more stuff like this in the future. Xu also neglects to mention the video's apparent point of origin, which looks to be an AI production company called '异类Outliers', whose <a href="https://space.bilibili.com/696326982">BiliBili page</a> includes the Wild Rift anniversary video and a section header that machine translates as "Collection: Alien uses AI to introduce you to 100 aesthetic styles".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6’s Portal mode has been designed to make the game feel fresh “years after you first picked it up”. </p>



<p>Earlier this year, it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-portal-return/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that Battlefield Portal was returning to the main series this year, and we finally got a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-portal-upgrade-players-build-own-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmation</a> during BF6’s multiplayer reveal. The new Portal mode puts the tools for creating in the hands of players, allowing them to craft custom and unique experiences. Now, developers have revealed the philosophy behind the Portal mode. </p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-s-portal-mode-is-for-players-that-want-to-do-more-than-completing-a-game">Battlefield 6’s Portal Mode is For Players That Want to Do More than Completing a Game</h2>



<p>During an interview with <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/battlefield-6-devs-explain-portal-map-maker-absolutely-essential-for-modern-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VideoGamer</a>, UX director Alan Pimm revealed some new insights for BF6’s Portal mode. Pimm first spoke about how the developers are looking to improve the Portal from 2042. The mode had several “clever tools,” such as scripting your own AI, customising the mode to your preferences, and more. They realised that people want terrain options, where they can pick different bits and not just their modes, and also manipulate and play with them. </p>



<p>Pimm goes on to say that the new Battlefield 6 Portal creations can be certified as modes in their own right, such as a “locked weapons mode”. However, if players try to make an XP farm for themselves, they will be told, “Actually, you won’t get XP from this one”, along with other warnings in the Editor.  </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Pimm elaborates that players don’t want a game they can complete, they want to grow with it, evolve with it or “make their dreams come true”. Battlefield 6’s Portal mode was designed with one philosophy in mind: longevity. The developers want to make the game feel fresh, “years after you first picked it up”. </p>



<p>Pimm concluded, stating that some players play for only an hour, while others play for 8 hours straight. These tools will cater to all types of players, “listen to the whole community, and make it accessible to do as much as possible.”</p>



<p>In other news, Battlefield 6 game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-game-servers-full-players-queue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">servers are already full</a> with over 40,000 players waiting for the beta to start. Additionally, a designer has stated that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-designer-reveals-sniper-glint-nerfs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sniper glint nerfs</a> are on the way. What are your thoughts on Battlefield 6’s new Portal mode?

<p>If this isn’t the biggest indication of how excited fans are for the Battlefield 6 beta to start, I don’t know what is. As I write this, more than 40,000 players are sitting in a queue to play the beta, being met with nothing more than a ‘Game Servers Full’ message on Battlefield 6’s title screen.</p>



<p>The number has skyrocketed in the last couple of hours, and it’s easy to see it hitting six figures soon enough. The first portion of the Battlefield 6 beta starts tomorrow, let’s just hope that the ‘Game Servers Full’ message disappears…</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-join-the-queue">Join the Queue</h2>



<p>Battlefield 6 is set to erupt this weekend as the beta welcomes millions of players (probably). From the multiplayer reveal last week to the countless leaks we’ve seen surface on social media in the last few months, everything is shaping up in Electronic Arts’ favor with Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>Could this be the year it overtakes Call of Duty? The hype for Black Ops 7 couldn’t be lower right now.</p>



<p>If you open Battlefield 6 right now, you’ll be met with a message advising you: ‘Game Servers Full’. It’s not a representation of any technical error (I hope), but it’s more of a placeholder that’ll keep things contained and buttoned up until the beta goes live.</p>



<p>If nothing else, it’s entertaining to watch the number ebb and flow as more players attempt to open the Battlefield 6 beta, only to find it’s not live and they’ve got their timings wrong. Perhaps I need to get out more.</p>



<p>Here are a few handy resources if you’re sitting there and staring at the ‘Game Servers Full’ message:</p>

<p>The first round of the Battlefield 6 beta starts tomorrow at 08:00 UTC (1 AM PT). Have you got your squad ready? Let me know in the comments what role you’ll be playing.</p>

  </div><p>While it's a bit awkward to use with a mouse--the Tinder-like quality makes it more suited to smartphones or tablets--there are a huge range of games it can suggest. You can start "runs" in a few different ways, like starter packs based on the staff's personal picks, new and upcoming games, and recent discoveries. You can also start from specific games you like, or even based on the tastes of "experts." These include developers, journalists, streamers, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">While on runs, you can view trailers for each of the games to see if they take your fancy, and if they do, you can pin them to remind yourself to play them later. Don't worry about skipping past games either, as there's an undo button, and the whole thing is free too. Perhaps this will be a good way to cut down your Steam wishlist full of games you swear you'll buy eventually.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
You probably already know EA's about to hold a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> open beta so you can check out its multiplayer component ahead of release, and you probably also know EA's holding an open beta <em>early access</em> event so you can get stuck in even earlier. But you might not be aware there's another way to get an early access key if you missed out previously.
</p>
<p>
As its name suggests, Battlefield 6's open beta is open to all, but the early access bit, running from 7th-8th August, is restricted. Everyone who signed up to EA's Battlefield Labs programme prior to 31st July is eligible to play early access, as is anyone that got a code from Battlefield 6's recent streamer showcase. EA Play Pro subscribers are also in, and key giveaways are seemingly still happening on Battlefield's official Discord, but the sentiment from EG team members who've tried there is basically be "good luck with that lol". Luckily, there's still one more opportunity to get involved if you don't yet have access, and it sounds relatively foolproof. 
</p>
<p>
As <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-open-beta-twitch-drops">detailed on the Battlefield website</a>, EA is also giving away keys during the early access period itself. Interested parties just need to link their EA and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> accounts, which you can <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/login?client_id=rg5jwqeyulmyy5s5zsu7juu2l3q1ue&amp;redirect_params=client_id%3Drg5jwqeyulmyy5s5zsu7juu2l3q1ue%26prompt%3Dnone%26redirect_uri%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Faccounts.ea.com%252Fconnect%252Flinking%252Fthirdparty%253Fcallback%253Dtrue%26response_type%3Dcode%26scope%3Duser_read%2Bviewing_activity_read%2Buser%253Aread%253Aemail%26state%3DRVMxOjIuMDoxLjA6U1Qya2ZocXJKQ3h1dE5jVWg6cnNjMmg">do can over on Twitch</a>, then simply watch 30 minutes of a participating Battlefield 6 streamer playing the open beta early access on either 7th or 8th August. Obviously, the sooner you watch, the sooner you can get stuck in yourself. One small caveat to all this: it's not entirely clear just how many keys will be available this way, with EA only saying "while supplies last".

<p>
It's probably also worth noting the Twitch giveaways continue beyond early access and into Battlefield 6's two open access weekends, which take place 7th-8th and 14th-17th August. Watch a participating streamer for one hour during these times and you'll unlock the Mimic Weapons Package; two hours unlocks the Landslide Soldier Skin, three hours unlocks the Shattered Vehicle Skin, and four hours unlocks the Imperial Skin. Don't forget to manually claim them from your Twitch Drops Inventory (you'll need to do this before the promotion expires), and they'll then be available when the full game launches for Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC on 10th October. If you don't already know, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-where-to-buy">here's what's included in each edition</a>.
</p>
<p>
To access the beta itself, you'll need to download the Battlefield 6 open beta client from the platform store of your choice, and PC players looking to get involved should also be aware some prep work may be required ahead of time. EA has elsewhere noted players will <a href="https://help.ea.com/en/articles/technical-issues/secure-boot/">need to activate Windows 10 and 11's Secure Boot security feature</a> in order to play. This, it says, "allows games supported by EA Javelin Anticheat to detect and remove bad actors, resulting in fewer cheaters and a better experience for players."
</p>
<p>
There's a lot riding on Battlefield 6 after the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-admits-battlefield-2042-flopped-but-would-have-been-less-than-10-percent-of-annual-revenue-anyway">disastrous Battlefield 2042</a>, and EA has spent plenty of energy trying to reassure fans it's getting things right this time. There've been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-battlefield-game-glimpsed-as-ea-announces-big-community-playtest-plans">plenty of community playtest sessions</a> via Battlefield Labs, and developers assurances have included promises this latest entry <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-leads-will-avoid-goofy-crossover-skins-to-stray-true-to-battlefield">will avoid goofy crossover skins</a> in order to "stray true" to the series. There's also been talk of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-next-battlefield-is-modern-day-brings-back-classes-and-more-focused-maps">more focused maps and the return of classes</a>, but Eurogamer's Connor Makar was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6s-multiplayer-takes-a-bold-risky-new-direction">left "unconvinced" after a recent Battlefield 6 preview</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/powerwash-simulator-2">PowerWash Simulator 2</a> is, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/22/powerwash-simulator-review/">just like the original</a>, a pretty chill time. Presented with utterly implausibly dirty things to clean, you just methodically spray unending streams of water at them, scrubbing out that dirt one section at a time. It’s a borderline therapeutic experience, but how can a sequel be much more than just having more dirty things for you to spritz? Well, by giving you a few more ways to clean them for starters.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lathering up for PowerWash Simulator 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ono5XRUQIzY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The core of PowerWash Simulator 2 remains pretty much identical, as each mission gives you something to clean that is literally caked in dirt from top to bottom, inside to out. It doesn’t matter if it’s a car, a piano or a whole building, it’s absolutely filthy to a comical degree. You’d think that a removals van would just be caked around the outside with the general grime from driving around –&nbsp;the kind that some kid would write a cheeky message in –&nbsp;and maybe a bit of dust and detritus from moving boxes inside, but no, it’s like a horror movie inside there as well.</p>



<p>Cleaning is a simple task or just pointing and squirting, choosing from a couple of different pressure washers, the spray width (which affects the range at which it can clean), and a handful of new options. You need to clean everything from every angle, so you’ll be getting right down to the ground to get under metallic trim and into wheel arches, angling into the grooves around the rear door, and climbing up to the roof to clear that as well! Each job is broken up into mini-goals that reward you with the ring of a bell for each sub-section you clean. A wing mirror here, a door handle there, and you’ve got that satisfying chime as you tick them off the list.</p>

<p>But that list can grow and evolve now through multi-stage levels, revealing messy horrors one section at a time. A rather futuristic public lavatory hides its filthy shame underground, asking you first to clean the top before it smoothly slides up and presents the full exterior, and once you’ve cleaned all of that up comes the abject horror of needing to clean the interior. It’s nice to have something dished out piecemeal like this, helping things feel more manageable, and also meaning that I didn’t need to break out any ladders to get up and clean the roof.</p>

<p>The art deco house, though, is a completely different kettle of fish. Here’s just this one monolithic task to clean, and we barely scratched the surface as time with our hands on session ticked away. I can absolutely see why having multi-stage levels helps in a game that’s all about being chill and relaxing, just breaking up some of the mental load of having a big hour-long clean up job.</p>
<p>There’s a bunch of new tools and reworked ideas within PowerWash Simulator 2. There’s a new surface cleaner, which is a bit like a water jet-powered mop on an extendable arm –&nbsp;it’s nice, but as you need to get pretty close up for it to reach out and work, I’ve not really felt the need to use it over a wider angled spread, though it’s no doubt going to please a bunch of carpet cleaning enthusiasts.</p>

<p>Soap is now fantastic, though. Instead of being a strange modifier spray that washed away particular types of dirt, it’s now a grime-busting lather that combines all the strengths of Mr. Muscle, Jif – I still refuse to call it Cif – and Cillit Bang into one. Basically, you spray the soap over everything and then, where you might have had to switch nozzle strengths to scrub away stubborn dirt, any strength spray will wash it all away. It might actually be a bit more work as you do actually have to go over everything twice, but it doesn’t really feel like it. Just note that you can only cover so much with soap before you need to reload… which here will actually remove all the soap that you’ve put down.</p>
<p>Some tasks will need you to get up and down the sides of buildings, and there’s some great new tools to let you do just that. A platform scissor lift is a handy accompaniment to more traditional scaffolding and ladders, but the star of the show is a window cleaner’s dream abseil, a simple dangling seat that you can move up, down, left and right to clean the side of high up places. This was put to great use when cleaning a huge billboard advert. Too high up for scaffolding to reasonably reach, and with a platform that only lets you get back so far, the abseil seat is the only real option for getting access to these large spaces. It works great, though there is a momentary fumble as you get on and off and have to adjust to the shifting axis of movements.</p>

<p>There’s plenty more to PowerWash Simulator 2 that we didn’t really get to toy with, from the customisable home base, to designing van liveries, to playing co-op online or in split-screen, and the career story, though we did at least get to give Ulysses the cat and some random kittens a little tickle every now and then. What’s most important, though, is that this retains that soothing essence of the reverse colouring book gameplay, with a few new options and tools just adding a smidgeon more variety.</p>

Like its previous indie-focused presentations, it'll be a shorter, 15-minute long direct, with updates and announcements for several indie games, but according to Nintendo-focused creator and leaker Switchforce, don't expect one of those games to be Hollow Knight: Silksong.</p>



<p>Last week, Nintendo hosted a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-tomorrow/">Partner Showcase Direct</a>, which included several announcements from its third-party partners, like the release date reveal for <a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-launches-september-5/">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, a new Octopath Traveler game called <a href="https://wccftech.com/octopath-traveler-0-announced/">Octopath Traveler 0</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection-nintendo-switch-2-2026/">Monster Hunter Stories 3's</a> reveal, and a new HD-2D action-RPG from Square Enix called <a href="https://wccftech.com/hd-2d-arpg-the-adventures-of-elliot-the-millennium-tales-announced-for-nintendo-switch-2-demo-now-available/">The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</a>, to name a few.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It was technically a showcase where Silksong could have shown up, but like many other potential games that could've appeared, it was absent. Tomorrow's Indie World direct is the second Nintendo presentation in two weeks, and while it's once again another place where Silksong could appear, Switchforce claims that it's not going to happen.</p>



<p>"<em>You do not have Hollow Knight: Silksong being shown off this Thursday, I'll just tell you that right now. I know some people are getting very excited, but as far as I'm aware, that is not in the cards.</em>"</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Nintendo Switch 2 Just Got Even Better — And There’s MORE Coming👀" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tuvr5j3HvXQ?start=203&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Switchforce continues to point out a key factor as to why we probably won't see it tomorrow, which is the fact that <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-gamescom-2025-hollow-knight-silksong-rog-xbox-ally/">Silksong is confirmed to be at Gamescom 2025</a>, and that there will be a demo available for attendees to check out the game themselves. If any Silksong news is coming soon, it'll likely happen at the same event where people could immediately try it out after learning of a release date, for example.</p>



<p>So if you're anxiously awaiting any spec of news on Silksong, keep your anxieties under control until <a href="https://www.gamescom.global/en/program/onl">Gamescom ONL 2025</a> on August 19, 2025. Silksong is very likely to grace that showcase, since those at Gamescom will be able to watch the new trailer, potentially have a release date to look forward to, and then try it out for themselves on the show floor the next day.</p>



<p>Which is hopefully what happens. It's been years of players waiting and hoping to see Silksong at every big showcase, whether it's a Nintendo showcase or not. It'll be good to put this all to bed when we finally get a release date, and when Silksong is finally on store shelves. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Video Game History Foundation (VGHF) has announced that it's acquired the rights to&nbsp;<em>Computer Entertainer</em>, an influential video game magazine from the 1980s that may well be able to claim a number of firsts.</p>

<p>In a press release, the foundation calls&nbsp;<em>Computer Entertainer&nbsp;</em>"one of the most important video game magazines of the industry's 'golden age'", which is the motivating factor behind the charity's mission to "locate and meticulously digitize" the magazine's "entire eight-year run" between 1982 and 1990.</p>

<p>According to the VGHF,&nbsp;<em>Computer Entertainer&nbsp;</em>is the first female-owned gaming magazine in history; it was owned and operated by sister duo Marylou Badeaux and Celeste Dolan. Not only that, but it was also "the only console-focused magazine" to survive the infamous '80s gaming industry crash.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/computer-entertainer-video-game-history-foundation-page.jpg?itok=ieD3_i-I 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/computer-entertainer-video-game-history-foundation-page.jpg?itok=-7G0LaaL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Computer Entertainer&nbsp;</em>is a real blast from the past.</figcaption></figure><p>Thanks to VGHF's efforts,&nbsp;<em>Computer Entertainer</em>'s entire back catalog is now available to read for free via the foundation's <a href="https://archive.gamehistory.org/folder/519c0dbd-0f5d-45fe-83c2-355a756391a95a756391a9" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Digital Archive</a>, a repository of gaming-related materials that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/video-game-history-foundation-free-online-library" rel="nofollow">opened earlier this year</a>.</p>

<p>The library is free for anyone to access, and thanks to its Creative Commons 4.0 license, you can even use it commercially if you wish. Since the VGHF is a nonprofit, though, a <a href="https://gamehistory.org/donate/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">donation or two</a> might not go amiss if you're intending to do so, eh?</p>

<p><em>Computer Entertainer</em>'s firsts go beyond its origins and its longevity; it may, according to VGHF, have been the only English-language gaming magazine to cover the original&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Bros.&nbsp;</em>at launch, and it was also one of the first publications to review games like&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Metroid</em>.</p>

<p>You can check out a video detailing the Video Game History Foundation's acquisition of&nbsp;<em>Computer Entertainer</em>, as well as a history of the magazine and its importance in the industry, right here.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Fresh light has been shone on an interview that claims Nintendo once suggested Pokémon's beloved mascot Pikachu should have breasts. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The interview, with The Pokémon Company's veteran CEO Tsunekazu Ishihara, dates back around 25 years, and is in Japanese — something that has prompted debate over the exact translation of what Ishihara originally said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, however, Japanese site <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/07/29/155531.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Game*Spark</a> (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-of-america-really-did-suggest-giving-pikachu-large-feminine-breasts-at-one-point-japanese-media-confirms/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automaton</a>) has examined the original interview in detail to uncover as firm an interpretation as possible — and yes, it really does seem to be what it sounds like.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Firstly, let's examine what Ishihara says, before further discussing the specific issue over the word "breasts." For context, Ishihara is discussing an early conversation he had with Nintendo of America employees regarding the localisation of the Pokémon franchise — before it launched in the West and became the global phenomenon it is today.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When I first showed Pokémon to them, they told me it was too cute," Ishihara recalled. "The staff at Nintendo of America then suggested their own designs for the characters – I won't show those illustrations to anyone as long as I live, but they kind of looked like the characters from the Cats musical.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So, for example, Pikachu was changed into a character shaped like a kind of a tabby cat with huge breasts."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/06/cats-official-trailer-00-01-54-1754483355008.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Taylor Swift in the Cats Musical movie. Image credit: Universal.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As Automaton notes, there is some debate here about the exact Japanese word used to describe "breasts," which could also mean pronounced masculine pecs. However, there's added context in what is said next.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When Ishihara is asked whether he means breasts "like those girls who do Pikachu cosplays at anime conventions," the CEO replies in the affirmative. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Yes, exactly," Ishihara states, "they presented that kind of design to us for real. I thought it was interesting, in a sense of appreciating such cultural differences. However, I didn't want to compete in the [overseas] market with that kind of thing."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/06/untitled-1-1754483413321.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Cosplay Pikachu.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One final wrinkle in the matter is a subsequent anecdote from the late Nintendo president Satoru Iwata, who in 2008 recalled early localisation conversations that featured a westernised Pikachu concept with big muscles, in an attempt to make the mascot "stronger and scarier." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But, as Game*Spark notes, this could simply refer to an additional concept also being discussed in the same meetings, as Nintendo suggested a range of alterations. And, if anything, it's yet more proof that Nintendo once had some eye-opening ideas to change the design of some Pokémon for the franchise's rollout outside of Japan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Judging by the popularity of Pokémon today, and the failure of Cats' movie adaptation, that's probably for the best.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: Universal.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
