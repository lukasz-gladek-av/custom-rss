            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/zelda/24183247/zelda-echoes-wisdom-theories-trailer-analysis<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="kETPO1">For some fans of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/zelda/24182328/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-design-change">The Legend of Zelda</a>, there’s just as much fun in theorizing and analyzing the world as there is in playing the games. So, when Nintendo released the first trailer for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24180883/legend-of-zelda-echoes-wisdom-nintendo-switch-release-date"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em></a><em>, </em>YouTubers and other fans didn’t waste time getting to work analyzing the trailer and dissecting its every detail. </p>
<p id="ampQ4h">There’s a lot to dive into this time around. Princess Zelda will be the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24181064/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-nintendo-switch-princess-peach">playable hero of the story</a> for the first time and wields an <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24181059/legend-of-zelda-echoes-wisdom-why-no-sword-gameplay-nintendo-link">entirely new weapon</a>, the Tri Rod — and the fact that <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> could have connections to previous versions of Hyrule and the series at large has already introduced ample opportunities for people to theorize. There are loads of posts on Reddit with observations, and YouTube is filled with videos analyzing the trailer. It can all be a lot, so Polygon rounded up some of the best theories we’ve seen about <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em>.</p>
<h2 id="AJWIAT"><strong>It takes place in the same world as The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past </strong></h2>

<p id="yHEBvC">A Reddit post that sparked a conversation on a Zelda subreddit made a convincing argument that the world in <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> could be connected to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/zelda/23915877/link-to-the-past-legend-of-zelda-loz-tears-kingdom-totk"><em>A Link to the Past</em></a>. The post includes a screenshot from the trailer, which shows a panoramic vista of Hyrule in <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>. In it, you can see environments like a forest in the northwestern corner of the map, mountains in the north, and Hyrule Castle in the center. The user argues these locations and the arrangement look similar to those in <em>A Link to the Past</em>, so it could mean it takes place in the same or a similar version of Hyrule. </p>
<h2 id="m2j141"><strong>The Sheikah will be back in the game </strong></h2>
<div id="9hzAmM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9bBffi3zP9g?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="PVheg3">Zeltik, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bBffi3zP9g">a popular theory crafter within the Zelda community</a>, highlighted a moment where the Sheikah appear to return in <em>Echoes of Wisdom </em>in two separate instances. The first shows a clip where a character resembling Impa, Zelda’s Sheikah nursemaid in other games, like <em>Ocarina of Time </em>and <em>Oracle of Seasons</em>, attacks soldiers in Hyrule Castle. The appearance of Impa wouldn’t be all that remarkable given she’s in so many games, but then there’s another fun treat: The trailer shows a house that appears to be a workshop or place for research. The room contains glowing orange signs that could be Sheikah symbols, and the character <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23717547/breath-of-the-wild-impa-purah-robbie-paya-master-kohga">looks a lot like Robbie</a> from <em>Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>. </p>
<h2 id="Wc9wIr"><strong>There will be two kinds of Zora in the game </strong></h2>

<p id="ot8Wdb">This is a small detail, but a fun one: There have always been different designs for the Zora in various Zelda games. The Zora in the original <em>A Link to the Past</em> had a colorful, almost dragonlike look, whereas the Zora we see in more recent games like <em>Ocarina of Time</em> have a sleeker and silvery fishlike look. In another section from Zeltik’s trailer analysis, he shows a clip from the trailer where we can see Zelda standing between both kinds of Zora. He hypothesized that there could be a conflict between the two and that the princess might play a role in mediating tensions between the two groups. </p>
<p id="CJpZgQ">Those are some of the fun theories we’ve found so far, but we will update the article as we get more information about the game. <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em> will be released on Nintendo Switch on Sept. 26. </p>

It's not the most creative name for a sale, but at least it'll be easy to remember. This year's Walmart Deals event will take place from Monday, July 8, through Thursday, July 11. Though Amazon hasn't revealed this year's dates for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/amazon-prime-day-deals/">Prime Day</a>, we know it'll take place in July.

The list includes everything from apparel and home appliances to video games, electronics, toys, and more. We picked out a few preview deals from Walmart's list that we think are worth keeping in mind. Note that the prices listed don't go into effect until the sale starts on July 8.</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSuper-Mario-Party-Red-Blue-Joy-Con-Bundle%2F5216937998%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fwalmart-deals-event-amazon-prime-day-2024%2F1100-6524475%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Super Mario Party + Joy-Con Bundle</a> -- $69 (<del>$100</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLEGO-Star-Wars-Hoth-AT-ST-75322-Building-Kit-Construction-Toy-Kids-Aged-9-Up-Buildable-Battle-Walker-4-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back-Characters-586-Pi%2F677686565%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fwalmart-deals-event-amazon-prime-day-2024%2F1100-6524475%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lego Star Wars: Battle of Hoth AT-ST Kit</a> -- $35 ($<del>50</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FHP-Victus-15-6-inch-FHD-144Hz-Gaming-Laptop-AMD-Ryzen-5-8645HS-NVIDIA-GeForce-RTX-4050-8GB-DDR4-512GB-SSD-Mica-Silver-2024%2F5395277312%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fwalmart-deals-event-amazon-prime-day-2024%2F1100-6524475%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">HP Victus 15.6 inch Gaming Laptop</a> -- $599 ($<del>979</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FTCL-65-Class-Q-Class-4K-QLED-HDR-Smart-TV-with-Google-TV-65Q650G%2F3733507013%3FadsRedirect%3Dtrue%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fwalmart-deals-event-amazon-prime-day-2024%2F1100-6524475%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">TCL 65-inch 4K QLED HDR Smart TV</a> -- $398 ($<del>498</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSamsung-Galaxy-Watch4-Classic-46mm-Smart-Watch-w-Bluetooth-Stainless-Steel-Black%2F503218134%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fwalmart-deals-event-amazon-prime-day-2024%2F1100-6524475%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Samsung Galaxy Watch6 Classic 46mm (Bluetooth model)</a> -- $99 ($<del>179</del>)</li></ul><p dir="ltr">You can check out more of the upcoming deals at the retailer's dedicated <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fshop%2Fdeals%3FathAsset%3DeyJhdGhjcGlkIjoiNTRhNTExMWYtMGEzZi00ODUzLTk3MDMtMDA1NjRhYzg5YWJjIn0%3D%26athena%3Dtrue%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fwalmart-deals-event-amazon-prime-day-2024%2F1100-6524475%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Walmart Deals store page</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/24/24185077/valve-steam-summer-sale-steam-deck-lcd-pc-deal-sale<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Summer has various official and unofficial starts to kick off the season, but the real one for many of us gamers is Steam’s annual Summer Sale — which <a href="https://x.com/Steam/status/1805299921853333557">Valve recently announced</a> will begin on Thursday, June 27th, at 10AM PT / 1PM ET. And as an added treat, Valve’s entry-level <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23513517/steam-deck-long-term-test-valve">Steam Decks</a> are already on sale for an all-time low in the run-up to the event.</p><p>Valve is discounting the base Steam Decks sold through Steam’s online storefront <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fsteamdeck%23%3A~%3Atext%3Dwhile%2520supplies%2520last.-%2C15%2525%2520OFF%2C-UNTIL%2520JULY%252011TH">by 15 percent</a> through 10AM PT / 1PM ET on July 11th, dropping the price of the LCD-equipped handheld to $296.95 (about $52 off) in the 64GB configuration and $381.65 (about $67 off) in its 512GB variant. In addition to the storage upgrade, the 512GB model features an antiglare etched glass cover on its seven-inch display.</p><div><p>The Steam Deck is a portable handheld console you can use to play PC games.</p></div><p>While the fancier Steam Deck OLED, with its slightly larger 90Hz display and bigger battery, is sadly not discounted, the standard Decks with LCD screens remain very capable machines. The original Deck offers the same performance and resolution (1280 x 800) as the OLED model, albeit at a maximum refresh rate of 60Hz, and it easily plays most compatible games on Steam save for the most graphically demanding titles.</p><p>The OG Deck can even play some big open-world games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/23/22946279/elden-ring-review-ps5-xbox-pc"><em>Elden Ring</em></a> and its new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180536/shadow-of-the-erdtree-review-elden-ring-dlc"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a> expansion. However, FromSoftware’s excellently <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24183692/hidetaka-miyazaki-interview-shadow-of-the-erdtree-difficulty">punishing</a> RPG is currently in need of a hotfix to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/20/24182545/elden-ring-has-an-issue-on-steam-deck-right-now">resolve an ongoing issue</a> when the game is left inactive on the Steam Deck for five minutes. Also, if you’re opting for the 64GB model, be sure to have a microSD card to expand it. That base storage may be fine when downloading tiny indies, but it fills up fast with bigger games. (Don’t even dream of a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/3/23944733/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-storage"><em>Call of Duty</em></a>.) Thankfully, you don’t really take any notable performance hits by playing games off <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lexar-Professional-microSDXC-Smartphones-LMS1066512G-BNANU/dp/B08T8LHL38?tag=theverge02-20">a quality microSD</a>.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p> / <span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

While maintenance is underway, the version 7.0 patch will be made available to download at around 4 a.m. PDT on consoles, and on June 27 around 8 a.m. PDT for PC and Mac players. As always, maintenance may be longer or shorter than Square Enix’s estimate but you should expect the 7.0 patch to go live around Friday, June 28 at 2 a.m. PDT. This means that the game will be down for two days across all platforms. Once the game is back up, those who have pre-ordered <em>Dawntrail </em>will be able to dive into the expansion.

Make sure to travel to your home world if you’re visiting another world or data center, as those travel systems may experience issues when <em>Dawntrail </em>launches. </p><p>Other things to check off ahead of maintenance include logging into your house (if you own one) to refresh the housing timer before the congestion of a new expansion.

Finally, log out in a sanctuary to get the rested EXP buff to help you level quickly once starting <em>Dawntrail</em>’s story quests. All you have to do now is find something to do while the game is down. Read a good book, try out knitting, or play another game on your backlog. Once <em>Dawntrail </em>releases, you won’t have free time for a while.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It isn’t just a mod: There’s story content and voice acting.

She, like most job-givers in <em>Starfield</em>, wants you to play freelance cop and go hunt down people with bounties on their heads. After chatting with her, you’ll fast-travel-menu-maze yourself to Akila City where you’ll chat with some other bounty hunters, including the either clever or cringe-worthy “No. 1,” who sometimes calls themself “no one.” </p><p>Yes. That is the character’s name. It makes me imagine a backstory in which they come up with that name while listening to some godforsaken emo music as they paint their nails black, softly whispering to themselves that <em>no one understands them</em> before dramatically sighing. Hey, it’s a Bethesda game, headcanoning stuff is almost required (and at least that’s free…<em>for now</em>).</p><figure id="" data-id="82b3c1f3d019b4fc55603a8b1135c95e" data-recommend-id="image://82b3c1f3d019b4fc55603a8b1135c95e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist of Starfield chats with a person in a space suit." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The protagonist of Starfield chats with a person in a space suit." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="82b3c1f3d019b4fc55603a8b1135c95e" data-recommend-id="image://82b3c1f3d019b4fc55603a8b1135c95e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist of Starfield chats with a person in a space suit." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Even if you choose not to shell out seven bucks for the new quest, called “The Vulture,” the Trackers’ Alliance grants you two things: A somewhat interesting, free quest that goes unresolved, and the ability to hunt down random NPCs who have bounties on their heads (where you can either take ‘em in or just murder them). </p><p>That free quest, titled “The Starjacker,” sends you out into the stars to hunt down a wanted man named Hanibal. The premise ain’t bad, and while it does boil down to just shooting your way through some random place in space, this bounty hunting concept is a decent way to make use of <em>Starfield</em>’s enormous galaxy.</p><p>Unfortunately there’s not a whole lot of mystery to this. You’ll interrogate a dude and then be given a quest marker to follow before blasting your way through a zero-grav space station. Then you’ll find out Hanibal ain’t on this space station. Your bounty is somewhere out there in the seeming endlessness of space and you’ve got no leads. </p><p>While what you do in this quest isn’t anything special (shoot, shoot, shoot, Starborn power!, shoot, shoot, shoot), the way it leaves you with this unresolved task and no leads to go on in this massive space simulation is kind of neat, and it interrupts the flow of <em>Starfield</em>’s check-list style questing. It makes <em>Starfield</em>’s galaxy <em>feel</em> large as you’re left to imagine where in this 1,000-plus-planet sector of space this guy might be hiding. </p><p>But, then, that’s it. Well, until you fork over seven bucks and buy “The Vulture.” And much like “The Starjacker,” there are some neat ideas here. Hints of promise of how this massive galaxy could be used for interesting quests. Unfortunately, spending seven bucks just gives you more of that hollow potential. </p><h2 id="h22507"><a id=""></a>A lifeless quest fit for a vulture’s feast</h2><p>The quest has you hunting down a colony war vet, the titular Vulture, who has turned his back on the Freestar Collective.

But at least it tries to inject some personality into its very brief runtime.</p><p>After arriving in the Narion system to find the Vulture, you’ll have a chat with a very scared dude who warns you that your quest to track down the assassin has put you “in hot water.” As if to prove the point, this poor sap’s warning is cut off mid-sentence as he’s offed by a shot from the Vulture’s sniper rifle. You’ll then attempt to chase the killer down, which, wouldn’t you know it, involves taking out a bunch of randos in your path.</p><p>Your pursuit will then take you to the resort of Paradiso. There, I accidentally agreed to handle the lost-and-found for the concierge before realizing I needed to go to an upper floor to check out the Vulture’s suite. There’s a neat moment in which, after searching his room, the Vulture, perched somewhere off in the distance, shoots out a window to try and get to you. As you dash out in pursuit, you’ll have to engage in a hallway firefight. </p><p>For a split second, there’s a level of urgency and activity in a place that’s otherwise a static, virtual diorama of a resort. That sort of action is something that <em>Starfield</em> could use more of. Exchanging fire in a place not meant for violence gave me some <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> vibes, and made Paradiso feel like a real place connected to this grander galaxy with competing interests that boil over into violence. All that’s to say, yes, give me a cool shootout in this bougie hellscape. </p><p>But once I got down to the ground floor, that immersion ended. I walked through the lobby of NPCs just standing around, saying random bullshit, undisturbed by the fact that loud-ass gunfire was happening two floors above them just a moment ago. I was once again reminded of how rigid and lifeless <em>Starfield</em>’s environments were. </p><figure id="" data-id="cfe151990b0fcc7dbd53962fb2aa47f5" data-recommend-id="image://cfe151990b0fcc7dbd53962fb2aa47f5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1200" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A character weilds a sniper rifle in a spaceport." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A character weilds a sniper rifle in a spaceport." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cfe151990b0fcc7dbd53962fb2aa47f5" data-recommend-id="image://cfe151990b0fcc7dbd53962fb2aa47f5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1200" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A character weilds a sniper rifle in a spaceport." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>And when I spotted the Vulture up in his sniper’s nest, people around me seemed to care less that I, a fully armed lunatic of a woman, was firing her gun at some random point in the distance. No one went running. No security guards urged me to drop my weapon. Nobody batted an eye as a gunfight raged on in this resort. </p><p><em>Starfield</em> has always sort of been on rails. But “The Vulture” explodes the sheer level of lifelessness coded into this game. I get it, it’s no immersive sim. Still, how am I supposed to roleplay as a star-hopping bounty hunter, pursuing her targets in the middle of public environments and getting into high-stakes gunfights, when the world barely reacts to these events? </p><p>And as far as the actual challenge? I love a good sniper battle. But the game literally gave me Starborn powers that let me suspend enemies in mid-air, go invisible, and slow down time. I’m virtually a god in this allegedly grounded, realistic science-fiction world, and not in a cool way. </p><p>But “the Vulture” doesn’t just suck as a quest. And it doesn’t just suck as an absurdly priced DLC. It, and the Trackers’ Alliance, expose the deep flaws inherent in <em>Starfield</em> that a mere faction quest isn’t going to heal. <em>Starfield</em> needs more than simple content injected into its massive canvas. It needs to consider how its canvas helps or hurts otherwise relatively decent premises like hunting down a renegade war vet hiding in a populated area. </p><figure id="" data-id="074372095039fcd43475bcfe60c20a35" data-recommend-id="image://074372095039fcd43475bcfe60c20a35" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A player character rapidly shoots a foe." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A player character rapidly shoots a foe." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Note: clip has been sped up for brevity.<br></figcaption><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="074372095039fcd43475bcfe60c20a35" data-recommend-id="image://074372095039fcd43475bcfe60c20a35" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A player character rapidly shoots a foe." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h22508"><a id=""></a><em>Starfield</em> remains a rigid, clunky experience</h2><p>Let’s rewind to the “Starjacker” quest for a second.

<p>A remake of the original Jet Set Radio is in development at SEGA, and screenshots from the game have been leaked online. </p>



<p>The four screenshots come from an early in-development version of the game. They give players a look at the game’s map, environment, art style, and more. Obviously, with it being so early in the development, things are likely — and expected — to change. </p>



<p>According to the poster, the images come from around 2021, and aren’t related to the free-to-play live service game that’s also in development. </p>

</div></figure>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to SEGA about the legitimacy of the screenshots. As of publishing, however, no response has been received.</p>



<p>Jet Set Radio first released in 2000 for the Sega Dreamcast. Since then, it has been released on PC, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PS Vita, iOS, and Android. It’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/insider-outlines-segas-plans-for-new-slate-of-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of a handful of games</a> receiving <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sega-announces-five-new-games-at-the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remakes and reboots at SEGA</a>, including&nbsp;Golden Axe, Crazy Taxi, Shinobi, and Streets of Rage. </p>

                <p>Bethesda has published some of the best games over the years, and if you're looking to grab a bargain with an extra layer of convenience, you can pick up several great titles as part of <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fpick-and-mix%2Fbuild-your-own-bethesda-bundle-gog-edition&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fgrab-up-to-16-bethesda-games-for-only-3-each%2F1100-6524465%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fanatical's Build Your Own Bethesda Bundle</a>. There are some excellent PC games on offer at a very affordable price, starting with two games for $7, three games for $10, or five games or more for $3 each. There are 16 games in all, so you could buy the whole package for only $48. But since most fans probably have some of these games, making a bundle of five games for $15 will probably make more sense.</p><p>The best part? Each game code you buy can be redeemed on GOG, meaning that these are DRM-free titles that you can play without needing to first connect online to authenticate your purchase. Simply download, install, and you're good to go, making this a very tempting deal for anyone using a gaming laptop or a mobile PC gaming system like a ROG Ally. You can also play these games on Steam Deck. You simply need to install GOG or a handy launcher suite such as <a href="https://heroicgameslauncher.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Heroic</a>.</p><h2>Fanatical Build Your Own Bethesda Bundle</h2><ul><li>Wolfenstein: The New Order</li><li>Wolfenstein: The Old Blood</li><li>Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus</li><li>Dishonored: Definitive Edition</li><li>Dishonored: Death of the Outsider</li><li>Dishonored 2</li><li>The Evil Within</li><li>The Evil Within 2</li><li>Doom 3</li><li>Prey</li><li>The Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind of the Year Edition</li><li>The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Game of the Year Edition</li><li>Quake</li><li>Quake 2</li><li>Quake 3: Arena</li><li>Quake 4</li></ul><p>For the games, you're getting some excellent fantasy, war, and sci-fi-themed adventures. Wolfenstein fans can grab the action-packed New Order, The Old Blood, and The New Colossus games, good-looking masterpieces of exhilarating gameplay. For something more subtle than blasting away an army of Nazis there are the Dishonored games, a potent combination of swords and sorcery where you're encouraged to think outside of the box.</p><p>Prey is also a very cerebral experience, full of cool retro-futuristic gadgets and coffee mugs that'll make you paranoid. Then there's Doom 3, a rock-solid mix of action and horror, Game of the Year editions of The Elder Scrolls titles Morrowind and Oblivion, and a whole lot of Quake. If you're looking to relive the LAN days of yesteryear, you can't go wrong with Quake 3 Arena and its lightning-fast gameplay. It's so good you'll probably get a case of phantom pain from that time you threw your back out hauling a CRT monitor up several flights of stairs.</p><p>For more DRM-free games, the <strong><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate/" data-ref-id="5000-168">GOG Summer Sale</a></strong> is now live.

True to his word, the days following Shadow of the Erdtree’s June 21 launch have seen many players take to social media to lament that the new content is simply too hard, while others complained of performance issues, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-dlc-shadow-of-the-erdtree-down-to-mixed-on-steam-as-players-complain-about-the-difficulty-and-performance?_gl=1*5kif15*_up*MQ..*_ga*NTE0MDgxMzMwLjE3MTkyNDEzNjQ.*_ga_736S6FVMCL*MTcxOTI0MTM2NC4xLjAuMTcxOTI0MTM2NC4wLjAuMA..*_ga_BBZCZLHBF6*MTcxOTI0MTM3OS4xLjAuMTcxOTI0MTM3OS4wLjAuMA..">leading to a ‘mixed’ review on Steam</a>.</p><p>However, its fearsome difficulty hasn’t stopped Karyal from attempting to take on the DLC using a very unconventional method of controlling her tarnished, which also proves that 90 percent of a FromSoftware boss fight plays out between the ears. </p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Perri (@perrikaryal) <a href="https://twitter.com/perrikaryal/status/1805008470166450460?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 23, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Karyal made headlines last year after beating Elden Ring’s base game content while using an electroencephalography (EEG) brain monitoring headset to control specific in-game actions such as attacking, and rolling. EEG technology is ordinarily used by physicians as a diagnostic tool. However, after encountering the brain-scanning headwear while studying for a masters degree in psychology she became curious as to whether the technology could be adapted to control video games as part of a virtual controller.</p><p>To that end Karyal was able to use some fancy coding to train the software that came with her commercial EEG headset to recognize patterns in her brain’s electrical activity that were brought about when she imagined a particular object, action, or emotion. Each pattern was then assigned to an input on a virtual controller, which allowed Karyal to execute actions with her mind by imagining things during gameplay. For example, by imagining herself pushing a cube forward she could execute a roll, or alternatively she could imagine a plate spinning to make her tarnished perform an attack, or simply make herself angry to heal.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>WE DID IT</p><p>Shadow of the Erdtree, first boss, COMPLETED with mind control, and ZERO HANDS</p><p>I can't believe it.

However, for Shadow of the Erdtree, the streamer opted to attempt a completely hands-free run, by using eye-tracking software to track the movement of her head to control her character's movement, and voice prompts to trigger more nuanced actions, including saying “I choose you” to summon a spirit ash. Navigating to bosses also required a completely different command setup to the one used during the climactic fights themselves, adding another layer of mental gymnastics to the process.</p><p>Impressively, Karyal  has already managed to use her mind-control approach to take down two challenging early DLC bosses in the Divine Beast Dancing Lion, and Rellana, the Twin Moon Knight. Of course this isn’t the first time that FromSoftware fans have employed a non-traditional controller to shame Elden Ring bosses. Just last year <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-streamer-missmikkaa-simultaneously-defeated-two-malenias-with-a-dance-pad-and-a-controller">Twitch streamer MissMikkaa managed to beat two Malenias simultaneously in two separate instances of the game while using a Dance Pad and a PS5 DualSense</a>. Another FromSoftware challenge runner by the name <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-no-hit-run-electric-saxophone-controller-playthrough">Dr. Decomposing was also able to complete a no-damage run while using a modified electric saxophone</a> as a controller.</p><p>Be sure to check out <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Shadow_of_the_Erdtree_DLC?_gl=1*hhybk0*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTcxODI5MzYyNi4xNzE5MjQ3MzAz*_ga_736S6FVMCL*MTcxOTI0NzMwMi4xLjAuMTcxOTI0NzMwMi4wLjAuMA..">IGN’s interactive map and comprehensive guide</a> for all the tips, tricks, and walkthroughs that you need to get the most out of your time in the Land of Shadow, or read up on how <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-mods-have-begun-and-yes-most-make-it-easier">modders are already finding ways to make the game easier on PC</a>.</p><p><em>Anthony is a freelance contributor covering science and video gaming news for IGN.

While some stalwarts like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/return-to-monkey-island-review"><u>Return to Monkey Island</u></a> have valiantly kept the torch burning, the days of walking around 2D environments shoving seemingly unrelated items into your pockets and then pushing them up against equally random objects in cryptic combinations have largely passed. With that in mind, it seems especially fitting that Lorelei and the Laser Eyes, the latest from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/09/17/sayonara-wild-hearts-review">Sayonara Wild Hearts</a> developer Simogo, is a puzzle game very much about gazing back through the tangle of time (in more ways than one). The striking style of this exceptionally clever adventure may not look familiar on the surface, but at its heart, it’s the closest thing I’ve played to a modernization of what a point-and-click adventure could be. Its story is enticingly fresh, its vibes perfectly eerie, and the desire it evokes to uncover every inch of its intricately interwoven mystery is irresistible. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>You take on the role of Lorelei, whose story begins in the dark woods outside of a looming manor with little direction beyond a strange invitation to an exhibit there that promises to transcend art itself – one that she might also be a part of? Lorelei and the Laser Eyes prides itself on its obfuscation, rarely giving you a straight answer to any of the questions it raises or telling you what the heck is actually going on – and that’s notable, because it starts at “curiously unexplained” and only gets wilder from there. But that enigmatic attitude never drove me toward frustration over the 13 hours it took me to beat it, always enticing me to uncover the answers for myself in a way that feels natural rather than laborious or obligatory.</p><p>Doing so generally has you directing Lorelei from fixed camera angles as she walks the black and white halls of this manor, bumping up against a cavalcade of locked doors that you’ll slowly but surely figure out how to open. Avoiding spoilers as much as possible, that could involve decoding the meaning behind a nearby poster to decipher the correct combination for a padlock, or it could require circling back much later once you’ve found a key somewhere else. The entire manor is one big puzzle box (with many literal puzzle boxes tucked inside it as well), and figuring out how to move more easily through its halls, which doors to open next, and the right position for each piece to click into place is a consistent thrill. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The entire manor is one big, masterfully assembled puzzle box.&nbsp;</p></div><p>This estate is also a masterfully assembled contraption because it seamlessly weaves in an immense amount of freedom alongside more curated encounters. Lorelei and the Laser Eyes is the kind of game that’s a delight to talk about with friends as you compare the physical notes you’ve taken and revel in having solved a particularly tricky challenge – but it’s also a difficult one to discuss, because its relatively open layout means you could be tackling some of its puzzles in very different orders. It strikes an ideal balance between letting you just figure things out and driving you toward key story moments or conversations with its scant cast of characters, all of which are wittily written and tantalizingly obtuse in equal measure. </p><p>The types of puzzles you’ll solve also have an impressive variety to them. Some take the form of literal puzzle books, having you work out straightforward but entertaining number problems to get a solution to an obstacle blocking your path. Others are spatial puzzles that ask you to walk around a room and look at things from a very specific perspective to reveal the answer. Then there are those that will have you deciphering (relatively simple) secret messages in letters or documents, filling your inventory with items and objects that will inevitably be used elsewhere, dialing numbers on a telephone at the manor’s front desk to get outside help, or lots more – many of them asking you to dive into the history of Lorelei herself and the events playing out around her in a way that satisfyingly links all your actions to the compelling story at hand. There are even a few sections that drop you into the spooky, Resident Evil-inspired halls of an in-universe video game, complete with PlayStation-era graphics and hilariously clunky tank control movement.</p><p>However, that joke about the bad controls of olde would be funnier if Simogo hadn’t been so committed to the idea that Lorelei and the Laser Eyes should be a single-button game, a limitation that <em>can </em>be interesting but more often works against it. Apart from moving around with a thumbstick or WASD (and opening the settings), every single button does the same thing: It pulls up your menu when you aren’t near anything, interacts with stuff when you are, selects items in your inventory, cycles through the numbers on combination locks, and attempts to unlock them when you think you have the right answer. There isn’t even a dedicated back button in the menus. While this comparison will come across harsher than I mean it to be, the last game I reviewed to try something like this was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/balan-wonderworld-review"><u>Balan Wonderworld</u></a>, and I hate it just as much here as I did there. </p><p>This utterly pointless self-restriction adds unnecessary friction to moving around and solving puzzles. The only way to stop looking at a lock is to intentionally try an incorrect code. If you want to examine an item, book, or note in your inventory while trying to find the right combination, you have to physically step away from the lock before you can access the menu (and if you are in a tight space with other interactable objects, you might walk into their range and select them instead). If you forget where you are going and need to quickly glance at the map, you have to go <em>three </em>menu lists deep before you can then select the map for only a specific floor… and then have to scroll to “exit” buttons on those lists to get back out. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Simogo co-founder Simon Flessler said in <a href="https://screenrant.com/lorelei-laser-eyes-interview-challenge-puzzle-simon-flesser/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview</a> that part of the justification for this control scheme was to make Lorelei and the Laser Eyes as broadly accessible as possible – but while that’s a goal I admire, it’s not one that would be compromised in any way I can see by also including the option to use dedicated buttons that quickly exit an interface or pull up the map. The absence of those basic features by no means ruins the experience of playing this otherwise extremely smartly designed game, and if they are the price I have to pay then so be it, but it is an obnoxious blemish on a moody world I was otherwise completely enthralled by. </p><p>That world is at least captivating enough to smooth over most rough edges. This isn’t a horror game, but it does wear the clothes of one occasionally, putting you on edge and teasing at the terrors that bind its puzzles together. There are only a couple of actual “scares,” and the small handful of outright fail states are very explicitly telegraphed, so you’ll never feel like you got something you didn’t sign up for if you’re mostly interested in carefully considered problem solving. But Lorelei and the Laser Eyes does do a fantastic job of <em>unsettling</em> you as you go, using its beautiful black-and-white visual style with pops of neon to create haunting, abstract imagery that can sometimes be as anxiety-inducing as any monster.</p><div data-cy="carousel"><h3>Tom's Favorite Puzzlers</h3><p>A non-comprehensive list of some of my absolute favorite puzzle games.</p></div></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>Exploring Lorelei and the Laser Eyes’ forlorn manor feels both familiar and novel. Shoving playing cards and letters and other objects into my pockets in the hopes that they’ll help me decode a lock or solve some mystery down the line would fit right at home with the best of the classic point-and-click adventure game genre, but the lovely, low-fi presentation, eerie story, and creative puzzles wrapped around that are all impressively fresh. An unwavering dedication to being a one-button game adds some unnecessary annoyances, but it doesn’t stop it from being a captivating journey just the same. Like all the best puzzle games, it had me frantically scribbling symbols, numbers, and names on physical pieces of paper just to make sure I left no otherworldly stone unturned.</p></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3><div><p>amazing</p><p>Lorelei and the Lasers Eyes' puzzles are clever, its vibes perfectly eerie, and the desire it evokes to uncover every inch of its intricately interwoven mystery is irresistible.</p><a href="https://www.ign.com/person/TomRMarks" title="Tom Marks"><span></span><figcaption><p>Tom Marks</p></figcaption></a></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Three thoughts struck me after my first encounter with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Shadow of the Erdtree</a>'s electrifying Divine Beast Dancing Lion boss: "WHAT?", "<em>Ouch</em>", and, dimly, "What <em>is</em> going on under there?". And one kindly modder has now helpfully answered that last question by derobing the thing and giving us all a peek at how the sausage is made (spoilers: no sausage is involved, but there are some Dancing Lion-related spoilers ahead so proceed with caution).
</p>
<p>
For the uninitiated, the Divine Beast Dancing Lion is one of the Elden Ring DLC's earliest major boss encounters and is found hanging out at the top of the Belurat tower settlement. It's an impressive sight too; a twirling, soaring, gnashing creation inspired by (as its name strongly suggests) the traditional Chinese lion dance, in which two performers - one controlling the head, the other the tail - mimic the movements of a lion.
</p>
<p>
Keen-eyed Tarnished have doubtless already spotted the human legs poking out from beneath the lion's cloth-covered body - one pair at the front, another at the rear - but the flapping, flailing material makes it hard to see much else while it's in motion. As it turns out, though, developer FromSoftware has gone a little further than just giving the Dancing Lion legs; two fully formed and (mostly) animated human performers are both tucked away under the cloth, and both can be seen thrashing around to control the beast when the cover is removed.
</p>

<figcaption>A closer look at the Divine Beast Dancing Lion.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO8vEHspEdE" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
We know all this thanks to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO8vEHspEdE">sterling work of Youtuber BonfireVN</a> (cheers <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/model-viewer-forensics-reveal-that-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtrees-dancing-lion-boss-is-actually-two-little-guys-piloting-it-around/">PC Gamer</a>), who immediately read everyone's mind and whipped that cloth straight off. And what a sight it is too! The performers themselves are both largely naked save for a loincloth, a protective armour skirt, and, in the case of Mr. Rear, filthy bandages covering his face. Both, too, are properly animated - when their limbs touch the ground at least - Mr. Rear spending pretty much all of his time scrambling around on all fours.
</p>
<p>
Admittedly, the illusion quite hilariously falls apart when the Dancing Lion performs some of its more extravagant moves - its corkscrewing, airborne forward lunge for instance - the pair whipping and flopping back and forth with impossible, physics-defying acrobatic abandon. But <em>still</em>.
</p>
<p>
Of course, this isn't the first time FromSoftware has gone the extra mile to create something wonderful players wouldn't ordinarily see in Elden Ring - who could possibly forget the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/tyhq8j/apparently_this_is_what_shrimp_guy_looks_like/">dreamboat face-reveal</a> of everybody's favourite masked prawn guy? - but it's always nice to get a peek at the craft behind the curtain. Even if the curtain is hurtling toward you at 100mph, jaws gnashing and lightning bolts coming out of its bum.
</p>
<p>
So, if you're finding the Divine Beast Dancing Lion boss a bit too intimidating, why not follow that classic bit of advice and (now accurately) picture it with no clothes on? Or, if that doesn't work, there's always Eurogamer's Elden Ring: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Shadow of the Erdtree guide</a>.

While you may be looking ahead to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/assassins-creed-magic-gathering-set-has-me-hooked" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" The Assassin’s Creed Magic: The Gathering Set Has Me Hooked"><em>Assassin’s Creed</em> universes beyond set</a>, let’s take a moment to appreciate <em>Modern Horizons 3 </em>a bit more and take a closer look at it. We will examine the <em>Modern Horizons 3 </em>Collector boosters, and determine if buying these premium-priced packs is worth your time.</p>

<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/modern-horizons-3-collector-boosters-breakdown.jpg?itok=E6v8WcGp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/modern-horizons-3-collector-boosters-breakdown.jpg?itok=WmgAXH3c 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Magic’s collector boosters change with each set due to the changing card styles, and treatments they do for these packs. Each set has its own showcase looks, oddities, and different things Wizards puts into sets to get players to chase them. Let’s keep it simple here and take a look at what one can expect to open in these $40 (US) packs.</p>
<ul><li>5 Rares
<ul><li>1 Foil Rare or Mythic rare from the main set</li>
<li>1 Rare or Mythic Rare from the Modern Horizons 3 Commander decks new cards (foil, foil-etched, extended art options included)</li>
<li>2 Non-Foil Rares with ‘booster fun’ treatment such as borderless, extended-art, or retro frame treatment.</li>
<li>1 Foil Rare or Mythic Rare that can have any treatment such as extended-art, borderless, retro framed, double rainbow foil serialized Eldrazi, foil-etched, traditional foil Special Guests, textured foil Special Guests or Double Faced Flip Planeswalker</li>
</ul></li>
<li>4 Foil Commons</li>
<li>3 Foil Uncommons</li>
<li>1 Foil full art Basic Lands</li>
<li>1 Retro-frame common or uncommon, or full art Snow Covered Wastes</li>
<li>1 Foil retro-frame common or uncommon, or full art Snow Covered Wastes</li>
<li>1 Foil token</li>
</ul><p>While Wizards of the Coast has an <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/feature/collecting-modern-horizons-3" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Collecting Modern Horizons 3">in-depth breakdown of collector packs</a>, and different treatments this should help you get an idea of what you can find in the pack. Of course, this begs the question: what are the best opens you can get?</p>
<h2>The Most Valuable Cards in Modern Horizons 3</h2>
<p>With a newly released set prices are still fluid as sleepers are found, and overperformers discounted. Still, the set has already shown us some of what the most valuable cards are, and it’s adjusted for some early results. If it's mythic rare and eldrazi it's a good sign you have opened some money especially.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/eldrazi-concepts.jpg?itok=HBwm6qEi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/eldrazi-concepts.jpg?itok=vua9An25 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The borderless, concept Eldrazis foiled</figcaption></figure><p>Ulamog, the Defiler has emerged as the chase rare of the set so far as we're seeing even the basic version going for $60.00 or more. While the pricest versions of these cards are the serialized versions, of which there are only 250 of each Eldrzi titan, the normal concept Edlrazi foils catch a pretty penny to with the foil concept version of Ulamog going for $200, and who knows what the serialized ones will go for (though it won't approach <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/post-malone-buys-magic-gathering-one-ring" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" Post Malone Buys Magic: The Gathering The One Ring Card">the One Ring's price</a>).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/eldrazi-retro.jpg?itok=hriEhZ9b 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/eldrazi-retro.jpg?itok=ZRa1PU-V 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Retro-frame versions of Ulamog and Emrakul, along with a borderless Ugin's Labyrinth</figcaption></figure><p>It’s not only the concept Eldrazi versions that sell well though. As the more valuable part of the Eldrazi trio, Ulamog and Emrakul’s retro-frame versions are also commanding a hefty premium, and are among the most expensive cards in the set. These are cool versions of the cards, showing a pre-eight edition-esq look. Also here is Ugin’s Labyrinth, which you can expect to normally in decks with Eldrazi, and is a ridiculously good land in those decks.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/flip-walkers.jpg?itok=uFqJKCcS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/flip-walkers.jpg?itok=1HsrmQXV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The four most valuable of the dual faced flip planeswalkers here in borderless, textured foil. Grist is not pictured, and is hanging out more around $10-$15</figcaption></figure><p>The flip planeswalkers here show us popular characters at the moment of their sparking as Planeswalkers in the past. Sorin, Tamiyo, Ajani, and Ral have all picked up significant value in these borderless textured foil versions. This style of card was popular back when it premiered in <em>Magic Origins</em>, and it’s no surprise it’s popular here. Being powerful also helps with some even being looked at in competitive play.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/flare-ocelot-kaalia.jpg?itok=EBNspFEH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/flare-ocelot-kaalia.jpg?itok=_fd_enUb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some of the best cards in the set in their most premium versions sneak up to the top.</figcaption></figure><p>Flare of Denial is a free counterspell, and it’s to no one’s surprise that it is going for a pretty penny with it likely to be played in all sorts of formats. If your blue deck has a decent amount of creatures (like Merfolk), you probably want to run it. Ocelot Pride combines three popular things: life gain, tokens, and cats, in a cool, efficient package for a magic hat trick. Kaalia is perhaps the most upscale version of an already popular commander.</p>
<h2>What Did We Open in Modern Horizons 3 Collector Boosters?</h2>
<p>Wizards were kind enough to send me several <em>Modern Horizons 3</em> Collector Boosters, and I’ve gone through them all. I’ll be showing some of the more valuable things we found through the seven packs, so you can get an idea of what might be inside a collector booster even if you don’t get one of the lottery tickets of a serialized Eldrazi.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kozilek-the-broken-reality_0.jpg?itok=8Fl5flZT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kozilek-the-broken-reality_0.jpg?itok=BQN3fd_b 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The most valuable card I opened in my seven packs</figcaption></figure><p>I got the cheapest Eldrazi titans in my packs, in the borderless concept eldrazi form. I think that Kozilek here is being a bit overlooked, as he fits both Eldrazi decks, and colorless decks in general. He provides an army in a box, disruption in a box, and card advantage in a box, all in one easy package. He also makes a great upgrade to the Eldrazi Commander Deck with the +3/+2 boost to colorless.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/solitude.jpg?itok=gCNtnqDE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/solitude.jpg?itok=4o1FJgjH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I solemn swear not to use scam methods with this.</figcaption></figure><p>I started playing <em>Magic: The Gathering </em>in 2003, shortly after Scourge was released, so I have some fond memories of the retro frame, as I got many older cards in cheap bins as well. However, white cards have always seemed to get washed out with it, and it’s a shame for them that they didn’t manage to fix it a bit here, and it is one of the things the new border does well (also: putting the rarity in the corner making life easier for my colorblind self). As for Solitude itself, it’s one of the evoke elementals and is a very powerful card.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/flare-of-duplication-retro-foil.jpg?itok=QhYnpEmL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/flare-of-duplication-retro-foil.jpg?itok=hdCiJeqA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The retro foil still having the old swish brings a small smile to my face</figcaption></figure><p>Flare of Duplication can here be seen as a reminder to check the price of the specific version of a card you have. While the normal version of Flare of Duplication will only run you a few dollars, and the baseline retro version is not too much more, this version has a premium. As for the card itself, it’s a decent new fork variant, and red can often have the creatures to sacrifice to play it for free, but remember it has to be a nontoken red creature.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/eladamri-portrait-foil.jpg?itok=GlS5dXqR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/eladamri-portrait-foil.jpg?itok=8-pi9hD4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Turn 1, Mana Elf, Turn 2, Eladamri, Turn 3, a cheap elf, and Blightsteel Colossus</figcaption></figure><p>As a character, Eladamri is an important part of one of magic’s most iconic storylines: the Weatherlight saga, but he’s been absent in cardboard form since <em>Tempest </em>was released back in 1997. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tmp/224/eladamri-lord-of-leaves" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Eladmari, Lord of Leaves">Eladamri, Lord of Leaves</a> is part of the reserved list so they can’t reprint him, but the chance here for a new card was taken. Eladamri, Korvecdal is a pretty sweet card, fitting right into Elf decks, while also useful in many other decks as a powerful card advantage engine and cost skipper.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/echoes-of-eternity-framebreak-foil.jpg?itok=BndKdOIz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/echoes-of-eternity-framebreak-foil.jpg?itok=XS4F2xLX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Is this winmore?</figcaption></figure><p>One of the new ‘kindred’ cards as the type replaces the old Tribal card type, Echoes of Eternity requires significant dedication to the colorless cause with three colorless pips. For that though you get a pretty big return with a Panharmonicon-style ability and a free spell double for colorless. This can plug right into an Eldrazi commander deck, and this particular version of it is worth almost triple the cheapest version.</p>
<h2>Is it worth it to buy Modern Horizons 3 Collector Boosters?</h2>
<p>Opening Booster Packs in general is kind of like gambling: you never know what you might get. Looking at the prices of the cards I opened compared to the $40 price tag, only 2 of them ended up worth more than that today on TCG Player. Generally, it is better to buy singles of cards you want than to buy a pack unless you plan on drafting of playing sealed with it.</p>

The modal double faced cards (with lands on the back) will help the value as the cards in <em>Zendikar Rising </em>are several dollars now, and the same is likely in a bit for some of the uncommons from <em>Modern Horizons 3</em>.</p>
<p>Should you buy a collector booster pack of <em>Modern Horizons 3</em>? No, probably not unless you get a lot of joy out of opening a booster. As far as sets to open collector boosters from though, this is a pretty good one with lots of neat treatments and cool cards.</p>

Much like the puppeted Chinese lion costumes you might see at a parade, there are just a pair of fellas holding up the front and the rear, and for as gnarly as the finished product looks, it’s actually even stranger watching them in action in this stripped-down form.</p><p>The guy at the front fully has his head in the giant lion’s head, but what is mostly obscured in the final incarnation of the fight is that his hands are also clasping the sides of the lion’s face, especially its jaw. In other words, he not only leads the charge, but he’s controlling its maw, and the roars you hear from it are presumably his. You can see this in the cutscene when you first trigger the fight, but otherwise it’s pretty hard to make out when everything’s in motion.</p><p><strong>Order <em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree:</em></strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/ELDEN-RING-Erdtree-PRE-PURCHASE-Digital/dp/B0D4TZ1RYK/ref=sr_1_6?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-lion-boss-video-two-guys-1851557574&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody" data-amazonasin="B0D4TZ1RYK" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20">Amazon</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.me/cmn8lfikrvq&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.me/cmn8lfikrvq" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">Best Buy</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8335294-14555742?sid=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Felden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8335294-14555742?sid=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Felden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">Humble Bundle</a></span></p><p>The poor guy in the back is another, sadder story. His one job is to be the ass of the lion. He doesn’t get to do much but follow the head. Occasionally he’ll get flung as a tail whip, or offer his back as a jump pad for the guy upfront, and the worst part is that he does this <em>on all fours</em>. He’s hunched over looking directly at the ground and his hands are bunched into fists as he literally white-knuckles the encounter. To make things even worse, he’s got a sack over his head. He’s just kind of <em>the </em>most deeply pitiable guy in the Land of Shadows. If you thought you hated your 9-5, I’m sure this dude’s got it so much worse.<br></p><p>BonfireVN’s video not only strips much of the decorative flair that obscures the two puppeteers, it also shows the fight in this form and it’s kind of hilarious. Again, the guy in the front is entirely responsible for the aggression and attacks, meaning that you just kind of get to watch the guy in the back fly through the air, skid against the ground, and twist and turn like crazy just to keep up. The guy in the back moves much more like an animal than the guy up front, and it’s neat seeing how their animation and movement styles were blended into this singular entity.</p><p>The video is honestly just a great showcase for FromSoft’s animators. It’s deeply impressive watching how fluidly the animations unfold on this level, so if anything, you should give the video a look just to pay some respect to the team that clearly worked hard on the fight. But mostly, pay your respects to the lion’s ass. Nobody wants to be that guy, and it’s often thankless work. <br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Roguelikes! They’re all the rage lately, whether it’s a pure run-based game like Hades 2, a devilish combination with something like the settlement-management of Cult of the Lamb or the application of the genre’s live-die-live-again loop to add a new bit of spice to a familiar series like The Rogue Prince of Persia. Into that last category comes a new contender: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/diablo-4-best-class">Diablo 4</a>, which will soon introduce a new wave-based roguelike mode in its next season.</p>

<p><a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo4/24111472/the-diablo-iv-season-5-ptr-what-you-need-to-know#Hordes">Infernal Hordes</a> is a mixture of roguelike progression - here you’ll be collecting the very Diablo-named resource of Burning Aether to buy new gear at the end of a run - and a classic horde mode, with gangs of enemies arriving in 90-second waves. If you survive a wave and mop up any last foes, you’ll get to pick between three Infernal Offers - temporary upgrades for that run that offer potential bonuses for additional challenge - before moving onto the next wave of baddies.</p>
<p>Pulping all the waves in each of the mode’s eight difficulty tiers will let you proceed to the Well of Hatred to battle three random members of the Fell Council (from five possible bosses), which will reward even more Burning Aether. Aether is obtained per player, so you won’t have to argue with friends about what to spend it on. At the end of a run, you’ll be able to cash in your collected Aether by buying Spoils of Hell, offering equipment, materials, gold and ‘greater equipment’ - an item with a guaranteed Greater Affix - for your efforts.</p>
<p>You can jump into the Infernal Hordes mode using the new Infernal Compass item, which will scale with your world tier and difficulty. The compass itself can be upgraded by collecting Abyssal Scrolls, granting access to higher Infernal Hordes tiers that increase the chance of earning legendary and unique drops, as well as Spoils of Greater Equipment.</p>
<p>The Infernal Hordes mode will debut in Diablo 4’s Season 5, which will be available to try for yourself from tomorrow, June 25th, for a week via the APRG’s Public Test Realm. After that, it’ll arrive in Season 5 proper with any necessary tweaks made in response to the test feedback.</p>
<p>Season 5 will debut a new post-campaign questline called The Eyes of the Enemy, which you’ll need to complete to gain the Infernal Compass needed to play the horde mode. Elsewhere in the update will be new legendaries, uniques and items, which can drop anywhere but will have a higher drop rate in the Infernal Hordes mode.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nosferatu-is-coming-to-make-vampires-scary-again.910047/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24184946/nosferatu-trailer-release-date-cast-remake<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="z5fuoW">There’s been no shortage of vampire movies and TV shows in the last couple of years. There was <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23679108/renfield-review-nic-cage-nicholas-hoult"><em>Renfield</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24133463/abigail-review-horror-comedy-vampires-scream"><em>Abigail</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23439476/interview-vampire-lestat-de-lioncourt-tv-show"><em>Interview with a Vampire</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23792915/what-we-do-shadows-season-5-review"><em>What We Do in the Shadows</em></a>, and more, all exploring different genres (with varying degrees of success) through the lens of everyone’s favorite creatures of the night. But we haven’t had many truly scary vampires recently, and it seems like <em>Nosferatu </em>is here to correct that fact. </p>
<p id="8kGCtu">The latest remake of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22891878/nosferatu-100-years-vampire-movies">classic German horror movie</a> — itself an unlicensed adaptation of Dracula — comes from <em>The VVitch</em> and <em>The Lighthouse</em> director <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23020420/the-northman-review-robert-eggers-alexander-skarsgard">Robert Eggers</a>, who seems to be leaning into the oppressively dark and creepy atmosphere of the original film. </p>
<p id="0R6YiE">The movie follows Thomas Hutter (Nicholas Hoult, who was also in <em>Renfield</em>) and all the strange things that happen to him after he visits the castle of the mysterious and vampiric Count Orlak (Bill Skarsgård). In the original story, this includes (arguably) prompting the Count’s move to the city in pursuit of Hutter’s wife, who seems to have already been bewitched by the vampire. </p>
<p id="7qJwDJ">The first trailer for the movie, which went online Monday, is all about establishing a mood, full of dark rooms and pitch-black castles. We see glimpses of Orlak’s castle, but the majority of the trailer is focused on the folks back in London, who seem to be eagerly anticipating his dreadful arrival. Of course, we don’t really get to see much of Orlak, better known as Nosferatu — only his silhouette, giving us a fantastically scary ending to the trailer. </p>
<p id="PAjfps">The movie’s stacked cast also includes previous Eggers collaborators Willem Dafoe and Ralph Ineson, as well as Emma Corrin and Aaron Taylor-Johnson. </p>
<p id="J2iCWx">In the grand tradition of counter-programming that has included movies like <em>Wolf of Wall Street</em> and <em>Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</em>, <em>Nosferatu </em>is set for release on Christmas Day. So you can take the whole family to meet the Count. </p>

  <p id="lzQIVQ">Valve is kicking off its Steam Summer Sale with an awesome discount on the Steam Deck. Right now, you can pick up either the 64 GB or 512 GB model of the original LCD Steam Deck for their lowest price yet. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck">64 GB model</a> is on sale for $296.65 (was $349), while the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck">512 GB version</a> is just $381.65 (was $449). Valve is slowly phasing out its launch models of the Steam Deck equipped with LCD screens, so this deal will only be available while supplies last. Both models include a zip-up case for the Deck, but the 512 GB version is unique in that its screen is covered in anti-glare etched glass. </p>

<p id="FobHXr">While these slightly older models don’t include the larger battery or OLED display featured in the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23950861/steam-deck-oled-review-valve-handheld-gaming">Steam Deck OLED</a>, the launch version of the Steam Deck remains a formidable alternative to other handheld options like the Nintendo Switch or ROG Ally.</p>
<p id="F3LitN">Valve’s list of Steam Deck verified titles has expanded exponentially since launch, and even includes games like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough"><em>Elden Ring</em></a>, which is particularly handy if you recently picked up a copy of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24180113/dlc-walkthroughs-guides"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a>. Of course, if you’re looking for even more reasons to adopt a Steam Deck, you can always check out <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22949326/steam-deck-review-pc-gaming-portable">our review</a>. </p>

The article also alleges that Lara will be added to <em>DBD </em>on July 16.</p><figure id="" data-id="ffabbfbbabfb439a743c181cbf3f423c" data-recommend-id="image://ffabbfbbabfb439a743c181cbf3f423c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1328" data-height="747" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Lara Croft as she will appear in Dead By Daylight.

While these games are generally remembered as great adventures, there was some controversy around many of the brutal death animations featured in them. Now you can kill her in more brutal ways, if that’s something you’ve been wanting to do...</p><p>“Lara Croft has survived expeditions few would dare attempt, locked eyes with death and lived to tell the tale... Now, she must face yet again a dark adventure shrouded in Fog,” explained Behaviour Interactive, according to <em>Eurogamer</em>. </p><p> “With her experiences and skill set, Lara Croft perfectly embodies the characteristics needed to survive in The Fog and is right at home in the world of <em>Dead by Daylight</em> alongside other iconic characters. Though she may be well-prepared for the Trials ahead, in the Entity’s twisted world, the future is never promised,” said Behaviour Interactive. </p><p>  <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dead-by-daylight-dungeons-and-dragons-castlevania-dlc-1851477094&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dead-by-daylight-dungeons-and-dragons-castlevania-dlc-1851477094"><em>Dead by Daylight</em>’s current season</a></span> is heavily inspired by <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, so it’s not like the game hasn’t been dabbling in non-horror crossovers already. </p><p>Still, I don’t think Lara Croft is a good fit for <em>Dead By Daylight</em>. Turning such a powerful and badass character famously known for surviving and fighting into a screaming victim who won’t just pull out a pistol and blast away the monster seems silly and out of character for any version of the Tomb Raider<em>.</em> But hey, gotta keep making the number go up and feed people more content. That’s the way things work in 2024.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">Before the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion arrived for Elden Ring, director Hidetaka Miyazaki set some interesting expectations for the DLC's map. He basically said the new map would be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-dlcs-map-is-as-big-or-bigger-than-limgrave/1100-6521275/" data-ref-id="1100-6521275">similar in size to the base game's starting area of Limgrave</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">That's definitely underselling the Realm of Shadows, the DLC's map, quite a bit. In fact, on X (formerly known as Twitter), an <a href="https://x.com/eldenringhq/status/1805178154421559297?s=46" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">account called Elden Ring Updates</a> posted <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-world-map-guide/2900-5487/#1" data-ref-id="2900-5487">Shadow of the Erdtree's world</a> over the top of Elden Ring's landmass. It's pretty astonishing viewed this way and shows it's clearly bigger than Miyazaki initially teased.</p><p dir="ltr">Last week, Shadow of the Erdtree released to critical acclaim. In fact, The Witcher developer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-dev-says-its-an-honor-for-elden-rings-shadow-of-the-erdtree-expansion-to-break-its-record/1100-6524435/" data-ref-id="1100-6524435">CD Projekt Red congratulated the Elden Ring DLC for breaking the record for best-reviewed RPG expansion</a>, overtaking the throne from Blood and Wine.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're curious about Shadow of the Erdtree, GameSpot has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-things-to-know/2900-5484/#1" data-ref-id="2900-5484">14 things you should know before playing the Elden Ring DLC</a>. One important thing to consider is you can't just start the expansion from the beginning of the base game.</p><p dir="ltr">One Twitch streamer is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-elden-ring-player-is-beating-shadow-of-the-erdtrees-bosses-without-lifting-a-finger/1100-6524463/" data-ref-id="1100-6524463">venturing through the Elden Ring expansion using the power of her mind</a>. Perrikaryal apparently has a setup that uses motion sensors for her head and eyes combined with an electroencephalogram (EEG) device for certain brain activity, so the streamer doesn't even need to move her fingers to beat the game's tough DLC bosses.</p><p dir="ltr">For more, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-review-kill-them-with-kindness/1900-6418243/" data-ref-id="1900-6418243">Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree review</a> as well as our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-guides-hub-classes-summons-and-more/1100-6501032/" data-ref-id="1100-6501032">guides hub for the DLC</a>.</p>

If hunting down Scadutree Fragments isn't your thing, however, there's a mod that gets rid of the feature altogether.</p><p>By now, you're probably aware that you need to amass dozens of Scadutree Fragments to withstand the dangers lurking around the Land of Shadow. But if you prefer the methods of old, user Sereenaty over at Nexus Mods has the answer. The <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/5255" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">No More Scadutree Grind</a> mod removes the need to collect the fragments, as well as Revered Spirit Ashes, and instead makes it so damage dealt and taken are scaled in a similar way to the vanilla game.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree DLC Review</p>
      </div>
<p>Before you install the mod, there are a few notes worth keeping in mind. "The mod was only tested on a fresh character with zero Scadutree fragments collected," reads the description. "No idea how it affects saves that already collected some."</p><p>In addition, the creator mentions that the scaling is similar to endgame areas like Farum Azula. In short, playing Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree with this mod won't immediately become a walk in the park, but there'll be a noticeable difference--especially because you won't need to collect items across the map anymore.</p><p>If you still prefer to play Shadow of the Erdtree as is but you're having trouble finding Scadutree Fragments out in the wild, here are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-scadutree-fragments/2900-5485/" data-ref-id="2900-5485">all Scadutree Fragment locations</a> to help you locate the ones you're missing.</p>

The prefab used for the TE will have to have properly set up TextMeshes – at least one but it supports as many as desired</li><li>Storage: The TE will have container features</li></ul></li><li>These TE properly support up/downgrading, so for example a block that has Signable can upgrade to a block that supports Storage and Signable and keep its text</li><li>Adding new features does not require enumeration modifications so should be easier going forward to add custom TE features from mods</li><li>Example usage of these features can be seen on the new player storage blocks “cntWoodWritableCrate” and similar</li></ul></li><li>File lookup prioritizes files in user data (e.g. LocalPrefabs) over mods</li><li>New game argument “-newprefabsmod=somemod” allows defining a mod in which new prefabs get stored instead of going to “LocalPrefabs”. Mod name is given by its internal name from its “ModInfo.xml”, not the folder name</li><li>XUi changes:  <ul><li>Generic “repeat_content” attribute support for all views.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/blue-protocol-global-may-never-launch-as-bandai-namco-online-goes-insolvent/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>We <a href="https://wccftech.com/blue-protocol-debut-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first covered</a> Blue Protocol, the stylized online action RPG developed by Bandai Namco Online, nearly five years ago. Back then, there was no assurance the game would ever launch in Western countries.</p>
<p>That changed in December 2022, when Amazon Games took the stage at The Game Awards to <a href="https://wccftech.com/blue-protocol-confirmed-for-2023-launch-on-pc-amazon-will-publish/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announce</a> a publishing deal with Bandai Namco Online to bring the game to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X outside of Japan.</p>
<p>Blue Protocol eventually got <a href="https://wccftech.com/blue-protocol-to-launch-on-pc-first-in-japan-may-support-cross-play-additional-features-detailed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its debut</a> in the Land of the Rising Sun on June 14, 2023. The Western version was <a href="https://wccftech.com/blue-protocol-mmorpg-gets-delayed-to-2024-in-the-west/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delayed to 2024</a>, but we haven't really heard any more about it. In fact, Amazon Games continued to mention its publishing deal with NCSoft for Throne and Liberty (<a href="https://wccftech.com/throne-and-liberty-f2p-mmorpg-launches-on-september-17-on-pc-and-consoles-with-cross-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now set to launch on September 17</a> in Western countries) in its press releases, whereas Blue Protocol wasn't mentioned any longer. The last blog post on the official global website is dated November 13, 2023.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that may be due to a dire financial situation. A few days ago, Bandai Namco Online (a subsidiary of Bandai Namco Entertainment) <a href="https://gamebiz.jp/news/388005" target="_blank" rel="noopener">declared</a> itself insolvent due to substantial losses. That doesn't necessarily mean work on the game is about to stop, but it doesn't incite faith in its future, either.</p>
<p>The developers held a live stream earlier this month, but it didn't provide any news on the global launch. They only talked about upcoming updates, such as the next chapter in the main story, a new region, an increased level cap to 80, and new passive abilities for each class available in Blue Protocol.</p>
<p>We'll keep an eye on the news from Japan, hoping for the best while preparing for the worst.</p>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/24184982/elden-ring-dlc-shadow-erdtree-difficult-hard-boss</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring%E2%80%99s-dlc-isn%E2%80%99t-as-difficult-if-you-just-run-away.909999/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24184982/elden-ring-dlc-shadow-erdtree-difficult-hard-boss<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="Ye25Us">Is <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24180113/dlc-walkthroughs-guides"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a><em> </em>too hard? I thought it might be when I first started. The <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24183254/elden-ring-dlc-shadow-of-the-erdtree-blackgaol-knight-memes-jokes">Blackgaol Knight</a> kicked my ass immediately, and I couldn’t even go walking in the forest without a beastman ripping me to shreds. Then I remembered the strategy that got me through so much of the Lands Between: <em>just run away.</em></p>
<p id="f0FAl1">You’re not imagining things. <em>Shadow of the Erdtree’s </em>difficulty is a step above <em>Elden Ring</em>, with enemies strong enough to make your level 100+ character feel like a feeble baby. It might even be hard to remember feeling this vulnerable, but that’s definitely how it was the first time you played <em>Elden Ring</em>! Just like the Lands Between, the Land of Shadow is also scary and violent, and sometimes it’s really just telling you to <em>fuck off</em>.</p>
<p id="FWstzs">The thing is, running away won’t just be more fun that dying over and over again; it’s also how you get stronger! Specifically, by exploring the Realm of Shadow and finding <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24178006/scadutree-fragment-locations-all-where-to-find-sote-dlc">Scadutree Fragments</a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24178007/revered-spirit-ashes-locations-all-where-to-find-sote-dlc">Revered Sacred Ashes</a>. These boons, which boost your stats and the stats of your Ashes respectively, are key to overcoming your inherent weakness in the shadow realm. Critically, you can find tons of these boosts simply by exploring.</p>
<p id="70B3Lj">It’s possible to find 10 Scadutree Fragments without fighting a single boss in the DLC, which will give you a significant boost to your attacks and even more importantly, your defense. Leveling up the old fashioned way with runes is still worth doing, but the stat boost from Scadutree Fragments is much larger and more worthwhile in the Land of Shadow.</p>
<p id="S1Odvh">It’s also worth remembering how useful exploration is for simply finding new <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24180256/all-new-dlc-weapon-locations">weapons</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24177999/talisman-locations-all-dlc-sote">talismans</a>, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24180255/all-new-dlc-armor-set-locations">armor sets</a>. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24182436/rellana-location-weakness-strategy-how-to-beat-sote-dlc">Rellana’s devastating Twin Moon attack</a> can be more easily overcome by finding a talisman that gives your magic resistance a huge boost, but you’ll have to leave her castle domain to find it.</p>
<p id="rDOCFS">Yes, the Land of Shadow is an oppressive and dangerous place, but by uncovering its secrets, you can overcome it. And if you still need a little help, you can always check out our detailed <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide">boss guides</a>!</p>
