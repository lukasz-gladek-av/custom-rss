            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is due out on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC in just ten days from the time of this writing, on November 14, 2025. Now that <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-launches-game-ready-driver-black-ops-7-ffvii-rebirth-adds-frame-generation/">graphics card drivers are already being pushed ahead</a> of its arrival, Activision has already put out a launch trailer for the game, and more importantly, has finally put out a PC specs chart, including a small word on the specs for handheld PCs.</p>



<p>The new trailer is mostly a cinematic look at the various modes you get in Black Ops 7, with action shots of the campaign, the multiplayer, and zombies.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 | Launch Trailer (PC Features Spotlight)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Ry41LBsSuQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The PC specs are the more intriguing part of today's reveal, if only because they're not too demanding. Here's the minimum specs:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS:</strong>&nbsp;Windows 10 64 Bit (latest update)</li>



<li><strong>CPU:</strong>&nbsp;AMD Ryzen 5 1400 or Intel Core i5-6600</li>



<li><strong>RAM:</strong>&nbsp;8 GB</li>



<li><strong>Video Card:</strong>&nbsp;AMD Radeon RX 470 or NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970 / 1060 or Intel Arc A580</li>



<li><strong>Video Memory:</strong>&nbsp;3 GB</li>



<li><strong>Storage Space:</strong>&nbsp;SSD with 115 GB&nbsp;available space at launch</li>
</ul>



<p>The recommended specs:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS:</strong>&nbsp;Windows 11 64 Bit (latest update)</li>



<li><strong>CPU:</strong>&nbsp;AMD Ryzen 5 1600X or Intel Core i7-6700K</li>



<li><strong>RAM:</strong>&nbsp;12 GB</li>



<li><strong>Video Card:</strong>&nbsp;AMD Radeon RX 6600XT or NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 or Intel Arc B580</li>



<li><strong>Video Memory:</strong>&nbsp;8 GB</li>



<li><strong>Storage Space:</strong>&nbsp;SSD with 115 GB&nbsp;available space at launch</li>
</ul>



<p>And the specs for players that want to play at 4K:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS:</strong>&nbsp;Windows 11 64 Bit (latest update)</li>



<li><strong>CPU:</strong>&nbsp;AMD Ryzen 5 5600X or Intel Core i7-10700K</li>



<li><strong>RAM:</strong>&nbsp;16 GB</li>



<li><strong>Video Card:</strong>&nbsp;AMD Radeon RX 9070XT or NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 / 5070</li>



<li><strong>Video Memory:</strong>&nbsp;16 GB</li>



<li><strong>Storage Space:</strong>&nbsp;SSD with 115 GB&nbsp;available space at launch</li>
</ul>



<p>Here's the full specs chart:</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 PC specs. Image credit: Activision</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The most unfortunate part of this specs chart is how little is said about PC handheld optimization. On the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/ca/en/blog/2025/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-pc-trailer-specs-preloading-handheld-systems">Call of Duty blog</a>, Activision writes, "<em></em><em>Black Ops 7</em>&nbsp;ships fully tuned for supported PC handhelds, including the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X. The developers enhanced UI legibility, scaled every screen for smaller displays, and optimized the game to deliver smooth performance without sacrificing image quality. With native control support, it’s easy to drop in and start playing right away."</p>



<p>That's nice to hear but it lacks any real specifications about how the game will run on PC handhelds, like the recently released ROG Xbox Ally X (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/">which you can check out our review for here</a>). Hopefully, we'll get a better sense of how it runs ahead of launch, though, with how close we are to that, it seems PC handheld users will either get a great experience on launch, or the lack of details here is a sign of poor performance to come.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This year <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/box-office-demon-slayer-infinity-castle-biggest-anime-opening-1236516498/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle</em> </a>and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/chainsaw-man-movie-reze-arc-box-office-weekend-premiere/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Chainsaw Man – The Movie: Reze Arc</em></a> played spoiler at the box office in their respective opening weekends (for the pocket-watching pundits among us), aweing moviegoers with the indescribable spark of magic animation. Anime has legs and is worth taking seriously as a new direction in cinema. Instead of addressing the 2D elephant of a lesson in the face, Hollywood said, “You know what the world really needs? More live-action anime films.”</p><p>According to an exclusive report from <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/chloe-zhao-manga-kodansha-studios-1236605962/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadline</a> (on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kodansha.us/post/3m4qpg6tpu32x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">manga day</a>, no less), Chloé Zhao, two-time Oscar winner behind<em> Nomadland</em> and Marvel’s <em>Eternals</em>, and Nicholas Gonda are teaming up with manga publisher <a href="https://aftermath.site/heres-the-dumb-shit-you-have-to-put-up-with-to-read-manga-these-days" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kodansha</a> to head up a global studio called Kodansha Studios. Kodansha Studios, in turn, will exist for the express purpose of creating “premium, live action movies and television series” based on manga from Kodansha. To break this down in comic book movie terms, Kodansha is pulling a DC Studios by having Zhao and Gonda become their <a href="https://gizmodo.com/james-gunn-head-of-dc-movies-and-tv-warner-bros-1849701460" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">James Gunn and Peter Safran</a>, guiding a <a href="https://gizmodo.com/report-david-zaslav-pushed-back-on-ta-nahesi-coates-black-superman-movie-for-being-too-woke-2000628090" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new era of live-action anime films</a> to a cinematic golden age. All the while, ensuring quality control, fostering healthy communication between international directors and manga creators, and developing solid scripts to bring their work to light. Hopefully, this will make the phrase “live-action anime film” less of a punchline than it has been over the past decade by utilizing Kodansha's manga catalog.&nbsp;</p><p>On paper, all of it sounds lovely, set against the haphazard wild west of <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-one-piece-yu-yu-hakusho-anime-live-action-netfl-1850050620" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">random-ass live-action Hollywood adaptations</a> that have seen the light of day and are looming menacingly over the horizon. But it's hard not to reflexively recoil when the Deadline piece namedrops “beloved manga” like Katsuhiro Otomo’s <em>Akira</em>,<em> </em>and go, “God dammit, they’re gonna try doing it again.”</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Impact of Akira: The Film that Changed Everything" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IqVoEpRIaKg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>If there is any anime that could be considered Hollywood’s Moby Dick, it is <em>Akira</em>. Still, Kodansha Studios' mere existence essentially shows that, despite decades of false starts, studio reshuffles, and directorial ghosting—such as <a href="https://gizmodo.com/warner-bros-gives-up-on-akira-remake-but-hollywood-wont-2000621686" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warner Bros. shelving its version</a> in the early 2000s, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/jordan-peele-nope-akira-adaption-references-film-1850048374" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jordan Peele</a> politely declining, and <a href="https://gizmodo.com/taika-waititi-still-plans-on-directing-akira-eventuall-1839207999" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Taika Waititi</a> eventually withdrawing after years of development hell—<em>Akira</em> remains Hollywood’s promised-yet-elusive cash cow. With Kodansha Studios declaring its raison d’être as “premium live-action projects” (whatever that means), the thought that <em>Akira </em>might be their flagship effort feels like creative ambition and more like comedic arrogance. Should <em>Akira </em>prove to be the hill Kodansha Studios chose to die on, with the promise of guaranteed success because it’s popular, it’s hard not to stifle a laugh at the thought of it still attempting to see the light of day.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="RARE // MAKING OF AKIRA DOCUMENTARY FROM 1988 // ENGLISH SUBS" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BXsar5rpgwg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Tokyo Movie Shinsha’s 1988 <a href="https://gizmodo.com/akira-35-year-retrospective-impact-1850645834" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Akira</em></a> isn’t just a sci-fi anime film. It’s a miracle. A once-in-history convergence built on unheard-of budget, artistic labor, and technical muscle that animated over 160,000 cels and hand-painted matte backgrounds with the kind of obsessive artistry that <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/news/latest/2020/6/8/akira-anime-film-producer-corrects-30-year-fact-on-how-much-the-groundbreaking-film-cost-to-make?srsltid=AfmBOorrcZSOtdh698GQTcySSmgOi-xMhlmUSUnrM1vhjt7qmmXVFb0E" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no studio today could bankroll</a>. The film isn’t just looked back on as lightning in a bottle but as a global flag-planting moment that declared anime as a cutting-edge art form worth taking seriously. Threatening to recapture it in live action isn’t just misguided—it verges on being creatively bankrupt. Undeterred by taste, history, hubris, or the sheer impossibility of doing it justice.&nbsp;</p><p>To quote YouTuber Cosmonaut Marcus in his succinctly titled video, <a href="https://youtu.be/f9I-s2UwxZk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Why I Hate Live-Action Anime Adaptations</a>, “If you agree to adapt an anime into a live-action TV show or movie for Hollywood, then it means that you are already disrespecting the source material because in any great animated work, the beauty goes beyond the story or the characters, usually it's good because it's animated.”&nbsp;</p><p>While I’m <a href="https://aftermath.site/bet-kakegurui-netflix-live-action-anime" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a bit of a sicko</a> who likes some live-action adaptations on their own merits, I agree with the latter half of Marcus’ take. Roughly 90 percent of why anime fans like the medium is the moving drawings. So reading this news in concert with Sony, through its <a href="https://gizmodo.com/sonys-potential-kadokawa-acquisition-could-tighten-its-grip-on-anime-and-manga-2000526376" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fucked up homunculus merger with Kadokawa</a>, also plans to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/anime-movies/sony-is-stepping-up-its-plans-for-more-live-action-movie-adaptations-of-anime-and-manga-properties/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ramp up its live-action efforts</a>, despite their direct financial success from <em>Demon Slayer</em> and <em>Chainsaw Man</em>, has me both fucking exasperated and side-eyeing Kodansha Studios playing follow the leader.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Tokyo Movie Shinsha</span></figcaption></figure><p>It’s not like Kodansha hasn’t had successes with already-made anime adaptations of its works; they're special because they're animated beautifully, filling in the gaps in manga panel artistry for anime fans without losing their artistry. And Kodansha’s library has proven to yield some of the most memorable anime films, like <em>Weathering With</em> <em>You </em>and <em>A Silent Voice</em>—<em>anime</em> films being the operative word.&nbsp;</p><p>Playing devil's advocate, there are exceptions to the rule of live action adaptations not being an entire crapshoot, but mainly as a reflection in fans' eyes in retrospect as cult classic hits with the likes of Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt-led<em> </em><a href="https://gizmodo.com/all-you-need-is-kill-anime-movie-trailer-edge-of-tomorrow-warner-bros-2000575528" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Live Die Repeat</em></a> and The Wachowskis’ <em>Speed Racer</em> (pound for pound <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwh9ETdhrf4&amp;t=2980s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the best live action anime film of all time</a>). There’s even been pretty decent live-action ventures in the past, like <a href="https://kotaku.com/what-we-loved-no-really-about-alita-battle-angel-1832758443" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Alita Battle Angel</em></a>, and that Netflix adaptation of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLfE-WiHAWU&amp;pp=ygUdbGFzdCBzYW11cmFpIHN0YW5kaW5nIG5ldGZsaXjSBwkJAwoBhyohjO8%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Last Samurai Standing</em></a> looks promising. But for every success, there’s also monumental failures from leveraging Kodansha’s catalogue for live-action works—your Scarlett Johansson-led <a href="https://www.wyomingnewspapers.org/?a=d&amp;d=WYWPN20170501-01.1.7&amp;srpos=1&amp;e=-------en-20-WYWPN-1--img-txIN%7CtxCO%7CtxTA-isaiah+colbert+ghost+in+the+shell-------0------" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Ghost in the Shell</em></a>.</p><p>Should Zhao and Gonda prove masterful international directors and original mangaka matchmakers, bringing underappreciated gems into the mainstream with “premium” live-action projects for works like all power to them. Works less likely to make folks reflexively throw their arms up like hearing “live action <a href="https://kotaku.com/my-hero-academia-netflix-live-action-anime-bnha-movie-1849883927" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>My Hero Academia</em></a> or live action <a href="https://gizmodo.com/naruto-live-action-film-lionsgate-1851047617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Naruto</em></a>,” not helping themselves by going for big-spectacle, fantasy-laden shonen hits with an even larger margin for error, for the disrespect Marcus mentioned earlier, to bring it to live action and look shit. If the first of their projects is <em>Akira</em>, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/gachiakuta-doesnt-just-redefine-shonen-anime-it-anoints-itself-as-the-next-big-thing-2000622249" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Gachiakuta</em></a><em>,</em> <em>Fire Punch</em>, or <em>Shangra La Frontier</em>, because they’re popular fantastical works, then all good will for Kodansha Studios is lost.</p><p>If Kodansha Studios instead invests in showcasing its creative skills through greenlighting live-action series and films based on more realistic sleeper hits in seinen and shojo genres, like <em>Princess Jellyfish</em>, <em>Blue Period</em>,<em> Hajime no Ippo</em>, or (<a href="https://gizmodo.com/vinland-saga-creator-makoto-yukimura-looks-back-on-writing-his-pacifist-viking-epic-2000664303" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gulp</a>) <em>Vinland Saga,</em> then, and only then, can it flirt with its strength as a studio capable of delivering on its promises for all its so-called premium projects. Do that, and I can have faith in prospective Kodansha Studio live-action adaptations of series like <em>Knights of Sidonia</em>, <em>Land of the Lustrous</em>, <em>To Your Eternity</em>, <em>Tower Dungeon</em>, and be less gun-shy about them possibly tackling <em>Akira</em>.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/i-owe-my-workday-to-criterion-24-7"><h3>I Owe My Workday To Criterion 24/7</h3></a><p>If you’re going to have cotton candy, you have to eat your vegetables too.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/europa-universalis-v-review-impressions-paradox-pc-eu5"><h3>How Am I Supposed To Review Europa Universalis V</h3></a><p>There is simply too much video game here, and it's always in motion</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-halo-white-house-trump-vance"><h3>And Also, Who Even Cares About Halo And Lord Of The Rings These Days</h3></a><p>"All of these things do have a feeling of dragging and resuscitating a corpse"</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/kodansha-studios-akira-anime-live-ation-chloe-zhao-nicolas-gonda]]></content:encoded>

It’s a solid lineup of titles, representing a wide variety of genres. That means there’s something for everyone, and some off-the-beaten-path games you might not normally buy, but now you get them without having to pay anywhere near full price. Here’s the full list of games included in the November 2025 Humble Choice, with blurbs from the press release.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Total War Warhammer III</strong>: A grand-scale strategy game where fantasy armies battle daemonic forces in the Realm of Chaos.</li><li><strong>Another Crab's Treasure</strong>: A Soulslike adventure where a hermit crab fights enemies using trash as makeshift shells.</li><li><strong>Pharaoh: A New Era</strong>: A 4K remake of the classic city-builder where you manage resources, appease gods, and build magnificent monuments in Ancient Egypt.</li><li><strong>Etrian Odyssey HD</strong>: A first-person dungeon crawler focused on creating a party and mapping a dangerous labyrinth.</li><li><strong>No More Heroes 3</strong>: A stylish hack-and-slash game where an assassin fights alien superheroes in over-the-top battles.</li><li><strong>Synergy</strong>: A sci-fi city-builder about building a sustainable human settlement on a harsh alien planet.</li><li><strong>Spin Hero</strong>: A roguelike RPG where combat and progression are determined by spinning a slot machine.</li><li><strong>Paleo Pines</strong>: A cozy farming sim where you run a ranch, explore an island, and befriend dinosaurs.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest game in here is probably the strategy game Total War: Warhammer III, which we gave a 9/10 in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/total-war-warhammer-3-review">review</a>. It’s a huge blockbuster PC game with many dozens of potential hours of play time. Another Crab’s Treasure is a surprisingly accessible Soulslike game that got an 8/10 in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/another-crabs-treasure-review">review</a>. And Etrian Odyssey HD is a personal favorite, a remaster of a Nintendo DS dungeon crawler that has you draw the map as you explore.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyone interested in relaxing farm sims can try out Paleo Pines, while No More Heroes 3 offers fast-paced action. There’s plenty here to try, and any one of these games is worth the $14.99 asking price all on its own. Getting the whole bundle for that price is a killer deal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As always with Humble Choice, a membership gets you a month of IGN Plus as an added bonus, as well as access to more than 50 DRM-free games in the Humble Vault. You also get a discount on Humble Store purchases, with bigger discounts the longer you keep your membership active.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, 5% of each Humble Choice membership goes to charity. This month’s charity is <a href="https://www.nokidhungry.org/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">No Kid Hungry</a>, which seems like a particularly timely choice.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>While we're still waiting on a proper update in the legal battle between Nintendo and Pocketpair regarding Nintendo suing Pocketpair over Palworld and its alleged infringement on Nintendo patents, we do have an update on some of the patents in question, thanks to <a href="https://gamesfray.com/huge-blow-for-nintendo-head-of-u-s-patent-office-takes-rare-step-to-order-reexamination-of-summon-subcharacter-and-let-it-fight-in-1-of-2-modes-patent/">Games Fray</a>, who has been reporting in-depth analysis on the case as it develops.</p>



<p>Spotted by Games Fray, the US Patent Office, specifically the director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), John A. Squires, has initiated a re-examination of Nintendo's patent number <a href="https://archive.org/details/12403397">12,403,397</a>. You might not recognize that patent by its number, so to give you a refresh, it's the one regarding summoning characters and making them battle, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-new-patent-should-not-have-happened-says-lawyer-palworld/">the one that IP and patent lawyer Kirk Sigmon said "<em>should not have happened, full stop</em>."</a></p>



<p>The patent being re-examined, especially in this case where Squires has kicked off the re-examination himself, is "<em>rare</em>," according to Games Fray, and this re-examination could result in the patent being revoked. It's possible that the patent is upheld, but with how uncommon this step is from the USPTO, that could already be a sign of trouble for Nintendo.</p>



<p>As Games Fray speculates, it could be that the public attention this case is getting has helped move it up the priority docket, with Squires examining it more closely to initiate the re-examination in the first place, but for now, we'll have to see if the re-examination bears any fruit.</p>



<p>Regardless, the fact that the USPTO is looking even more closely at Nintendo's patents likely spells more trouble for Nintendo's case against Pocketpair. It was already trying tactics that Games Fray <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-reportedly-doing-everything-to-make-lawsuit-against-palworld-stick/">described as a "<em>hail mary</em>."</a> This case is far from over; there's still a lot that needs to play out, but more and more it is looking like Palworld maker Pocketpair will be able to come out the other side of this with a win.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[14 Essential Tips For Getting Started In Arc Raiders]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-tips-solo-group-recycle-free-loadout-2000641174</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/14-essential-tips-for-getting-started-in-arc-raiders.1343779/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i>Arc Raiders</i> came out last week and folks have been pouring into the servers–in some cases overwhelming them. And as players immerse themselves in the PvPvE extraction shooter, it’s developing a reputation as a well-made game that poses a number of interesting and unpredictable challenges as you fight to stay alive, hoard piles of resources, and craft your way to loadout supremacy.</p> <p>There’s no way around it: <i>Arc Raiders</i> expects a serious investment of your time and a willingness to suffer some pretty humiliating and often random losses that will set you back in your efforts to accumulate good weaponry and gear.</p> <p>Having spent about 50 hours in the game myself, I’ve found it to be one of the best online shooters I’ve ever played, and I’ve also learned a thing or two about surviving out there amidst hostile robots and sinister players looking to get the better of me. My runs have mostly been solo, but much of what I’ve learned still applies to rolling out with a group.</p>

 <p>So here are 14 of the best tips I can give to those getting started in <i>Arc Raiders</i>.</p> <h2>You can trade Free Loadout Augments for Looting Augments</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000641193" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641193"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641193">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>This tip is a two-parter: First, don’t sleep on the <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Free_Loadout_Augment">Free Loadout</a>. When choosing to go out on a run, you can either build a loadout from the gear you’ve collected and crafted, or choose the Free loadout which always includes one main weapon, ammo for it, some bandages, a shield recharger, and any number of other utility items or grenades. It’s a handy way to get back out there without risking your good stuff.</p>

 <p>These items are free, so the only thing you really lose on a failed run with these is your time (and maybe a fragment of your sanity). But if you do manage to extract with them, hey, that’s free gear you didn’t have to craft (and you can always break it down for parts).</p>

 <p>But perhaps the most important thing about the Free Loadout Augment is <b>you can trade a Free Augment for a </b><a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Looting_Mk._1"><b>Looting Mk. 1 Augment</b></a><b> from Lance in the Traders tab.&nbsp;</b></p> <p>This has become my default approach to any run that ended in failure: Go back out with a Free Loadout, return home with it and trade it for a Loot one and either go out and get more loot <i>or</i> recycle the Looting augment I just purchased if I already have enough or have better Augments to use.</p>

 <p>Free Loadouts are an efficient way to keep the crafting supplies flowing.</p> <h2>You can roll after a fall to cancel out fall damage</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000641192" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641192"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641192">© Gif: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>For a relatively realistic game, <i>Arc Raiders </i>is generous with how long you can sprint and how far you can fall before you take damage. But missing a jump or taking a fall can hurt and isn’t ideal when you’re fleeing a pursuit from an enemy player or Arc. Turns out, <b>hitting dodge right when your feet touch the ground will let you roll to cancel out the damage from falling</b>.</p>

Also, it seems like some heights are too far to recover from–so don’t expect to leap off the tower in Spaceport and roll your way out of damage. You can, as of now anyway, manage to use <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1ompomw/has_anyone_survived_a_tower_freefall_like_this/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;embed_host_url=https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-embark-pvp-toxic-betrayal-leaper-2000640905">an exploit to grab onto a ledge to cancel out such a fall</a>–and falls from far lesser heights.</p>

 <h2>Rubber parts are pretty important</h2> <p>In my 50 hours of playing <i>Arc Raiders</i> (mostly on solo runs), one particular crafting part has remained perpetually low in stock: <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Rubber_Parts">Rubber Parts</a>.</p> <p>I suspect part of this is due to just how often Rubber Parts are used. For example, to upgrade, build, and repair many guns and gun parts, you’ll either need both <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Metal_Parts">Metal</a> and Rubber Parts or you’ll need to <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Mechanical_Components">craft Mechanical Components</a>, which requires Metal and Rubber.</p> <p>Rubber Parts can be salvaged or recycled from a number of different sources (Scrappy will also give you some after every run). But you can also find them in Mechanical, Industrial, or Technological loot sources. You can spot ideal locations with the matching icon (a gear for Mechanical, building for Industrial, and circuit board for Technological) by looking at the map both before you go out for a run and while you’re on the map.</p>

 <p>I heartily recommend going on several runs to stock up on Rubber Parts.</p> <h2>The Practice Range is essential</h2> <p>While you’ll play through the briefest of tutorials when you first start <i>Arc Raiders</i>, in my experience, it’s not enough to get a feel for the movement of your character and the behavior of its various guns, especially as you mod them with various attachments.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000641196" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641196"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641196">© Gif: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Going out on a run with a weapon you’ve never used before isn’t wise and will likely get you killed. Enter the practice range, which lets you go into a small map (with a few secrets of its own tucked away) to practice your parkour skills and try out different guns. You can literally swap out various gun attachments in real time to get a sense of what they do. For example, I’ve learned that I greatly prefer the Muzzle Break attachment over the Compensator by trying it out in the safety of the Practice Range.</p>

 <p>There are also two achievements you can earn by going to the practice range and using four different guns, so there’s that.</p> <h2>For mouse and keyboard users: Rebind your dodge roll</h2> <p>Rolling out of the way of incoming fire from players or Arc is essential to surviving in <i>Arc Raiders</i> and, in my experience, the default binding of Left Alt for rolling isn’t ideal. This is a function that you need to be able to access quickly under pressure while maintaining your hold on WASD.</p> <p>I’ve chosen to break out my keyboard that has a split spacebar for backspace and forward space side-by-side for this reason. I mapped dodge to backspace and set left space as jump and I’m digging it so far.</p> <p>But if you have a normal keyboard, I recommend mapping sprint to caps lock (toggle, if you wish), and freeing up your shift key to roll. Mapping your dodge roll to a mouse button is also a good move. Whatever mapping you decide on, though, just make sure you can accentuate WASD while rolling without too many weird, cramp-prone finger movements. Thank me after you’ve survived getting swarmed by Hornets.</p>

 <p>Also, Embark Studios, why are there not double or triple bindings in this game? Come on!</p> <h2>The birds will give you away (as well as other noisy things)</h2> <p><i>Arc Raiders</i> has phenomenal sound design–easily some of the best I’ve ever heard in a video game. But it’s not just an audio treat. You likely already know that running around, rummaging through stuff, and cracking open various caches is <b>loud</b> (you can invest in skills to make your activities quieter though). On top of that, various buildings are outfitted with security cameras and metal detectors that set off alarms. Watch out for these while also keeping your ears open for other people tripping them.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-embark-extraction-virgil-watkins-interview-2000639879#comments">I Asked <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ Design Director If Camping Makes Me A Bad Person</a></p> <p>But also beware of <i>the birds.&nbsp;</i></p> <p><i>Arc Raiders</i>’ design director <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-embark-extraction-virgil-watkins-interview-2000639879#comments">Virgil Watkins mentioned these feathered loudmouths</a> in our discussion about the fairness of various hiding places in the maps, and it’s clear they can easily give you away even while you’re slowly walking through forests and other natural habitats. But like all the other sound traps, you can use this to your advantage. Listen and look for flocks of birds taking spontaneous flight near you. It usually means someone is nearby.</p>

 <h2>You can ask people to follow you</h2> <p>There are two emote wheels in <i>Arc Raiders</i>; one lets you ping a variety of locations with information such as “I heard something here,” “avoid that,” or, a very useful one, “group up over there.” By default, these emotes are only heard by your squad, but you can toggle on the fly to make it heard to all Raiders.</p> <p>The “group up” emote seems to have a secret second mode. If you look down at the ground and select it, your character will say “Follow me” or “Group up on me.” This is very useful if you want to take the lead with some randos, or even those in your party.</p>

 <h2>Recycling is tricky</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000641183" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641183"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641183">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><i>Arc Raiders</i> lets you break down various items in two ways: Salvaging and Recycling. Salvaging is done while you’re out in the field, while Recycling is done in your inventory when you’re out of a game. Recycling will always net you more resources than Salvaging, so unless you need to Salvage to get a specific item or you need to clear up space in your bag while out in the field, try to wait until you extract before you start breaking things down.</p> <p>However, the language used for some objects is a little vague. Take <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Toaster">Toasters</a>, for instance. You’ll find these objects scattered around the world and you can break them down into Plastic Parts and Wires if you recycle them. The description reads “Can be recycled into crafting materials.” That might make you think that the only thing a Toaster is good for is being immediately recycled.</p>

 <p>But hold your horses. Many objects with descriptions that read “Can be recycled into crafting materials” can also be used in upgrading your various workshops. Toasters, for example, are needed to upgrade your Refiner.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000641184" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641184"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641184">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I recommend tracking resources for your workshop upgrades. Once you construct a new workshop, tab over to “Level Up” and click on the tracking button. This will label any instance of the items required with an eye symbol so you’ll know it’s needed and, thus, you’ll be less likely to accidentally break it down.</p> <h2>Full bag? GTFO</h2> <p>At most, you’ll be given about 30 minutes to do your thing on a map. Sometimes you’ll spawn with less time than that. And I’ve learned in my 50 hours that time needlessly spent in the game can be seriously costly. I’ve had full bags of loot, only to get intrigued by a specific location that ends up leading to a Clusterfuck™ that gets me murdered, seeing me lose all the stuff I’d found.</p> <p>Even the most basic of parts, such as Metal Parts and those Rubber Parts I told you about, are essential to keep in stock. So while you might have a bag full of stuff that doesn’t feel valuable, it all adds up to something you’re looking to craft or sell for credits. But you can’t do any of that if you died and lost it all.</p>

 <p>A full bag, regardless of how much time is left, means it’s time to leave–and extracting can be a whole quest full of dangers and surprises in and of itself. A good loadout is built on a path made up of small victories.</p> <h2>Planning a route is essential</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000641182" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641182"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641182">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I realized this essential tactic pretty late in my time with <i>Arc Raiders</i>. At one point I dropped into a map with an inconvenient loadout and was about to extract, but I realized that this was actually a great opportunity to scope out the path to an objective I had a quest for.</p> <p>So I took the opportunity to do some reconnaissance, observing the various paths I could take if I was better equipped, and what threats were likely to happen. And wouldn’t you know it, I came across one of the death-delivering Sentinel turrets along the way. I was pretty glad in that moment to not be carrying a ton of things I’d rather not lose to an unexpected threat.</p> <p>Enemy AI is rather spontaneous in this game. They don’t show up in the same place on every run and their behavior (which in some instances was <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-embark-extraction-virgil-watkins-interview-2000639879#comments">developed using machine learning</a>) is very unpredictable and disturbingly smart.</p>

 <p>So if you’ve got an important quest or have a key to a particularly good loot spot, spend a run just examining potential routes and escape plans. Grab a Free Loadout to do this so an unpredictable death isn’t as costly.</p> <h2>Dam Battlegrounds is spicy</h2> <p>This next tip might evolve over time, but in my experience, Dam Battlegrounds, which is the first map you gain access to, is more prone to bouts of PvP. I suspect part of this is because the map is home to the newest folks coming into the game and just getting their bearings and experiencing the flow of its PvPvE action.</p> <p>Other maps unlock after you’ve made enough progress doing things on Dam Battlegrounds, and that’s where a lot of folks are out trying to loot for good shit or are just questing after investing some time into the game, and thus their loadout; they’re probably less likely to risk that progress.</p> <p>So just have your radar up for shenanigans every time you head out to Dam Battlegrounds. People are antsy over there.</p>

 <h2>People are nicer than you think</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000641180" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641180"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641180">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>This tip can result in your death. Hate to say it, but in a PvPvE game, unless someone is in your party, they can pose a potential risk to you. But! I’m finding that folks in <i>Arc Raiders</i> are a bit nicer than I experienced during the Server Slam, especially on maps other than Dam Battlegrounds.</p> <p>When going into a building, while I don’t do it every time, when I suspect someone’s around, I will usually use the emote wheel to shout out a “Hello” followed by a “Don’t Shoot!” I have been surprised just how often randos will reply with a “Don’t Shoot,” often followed by a holstering of their weapon.</p> <p>This kind of dynamic is part of the unique, prisoner’s-dilemma social game at work in <i>Arc Raiders</i>. Holstering a gun seems to have become a universal way to signal you’re not going to shoot someone, so return the gesture if you see someone putting their gun away.</p> <p>Or betray them. I dunno. Be a bad person. You’ll get what’s coming to you eventually if you turn evil.</p> <h2>Go nuts with gadgets</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000641179" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641179"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641179">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Maybe the inner-<i>Siege</i> fanatic in me is at work here, but once I realized I can craft items to seal doors, erect barricades, and set up traps, oh, how I realized what a devastating saboteur I can be in this game.</p> <p>I’ve sealed up entire rooms while I loot, hunkered down in some buildings to hunt Arc through windows, usually while running solo, covering my ass with traps and gadgets. Some gadgets are harmless, like <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Noisemaker">the Noisemaker</a>. Others range from nonlethal, like the <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Jolt_Mine">Jolt Mine</a>, to lethal, like <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Explosive_Mine">the Explosive Mine</a>.</p> <p>At the time of this writing, with <i>Arc Raiders</i> less than a week old, I haven’t seen many people use gadgets to booby-trap areas. I’ve also surprised many a wandering Raider with a well-placed trap or two. Folks are less likely to sneak up on you if you’ve established a perimeter of fun toys for them to encounter.</p> <h2>Snitches can be your best friend (especially while running solo)</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000641178" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641178"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641178">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Snitch">Snitches</a> are often a pain, as they’ll summon Arc to your location if they spot you. But they can be <i>your</i> pain to inflict on others. Lately I’ve gotten into the habit of keeping my eyes peeled for one, even if they’re at a great distance. Typically, shooting at one will draw them over to you.</p> <p>This is a great way to lose pursuant enemy Raiders. Call over a Snitch by getting its attention and it will either summon Wasps or Hornets, which will target you as well as your unfriendly Raider enemies, or just prove a helpful distraction by giving your foes another problem besides you. This can help you make a clean getaway or prove a helpful distraction that lets you fall back and help Arc kill your enemies.</p> <hr> <p>As <i>Arc Raiders</i> matures, I’m sure I’ll find more helpful things to share. For now, however, these tips should help you break down what is arguably a very complex and hardcore game. Mastery over its various systems and unpredictable gameplay is well worth the experience and the struggles of failure.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Here’s some unexpected but much-appreciated news: <a href="https://kotaku.com/there-was-nearly-a-sequel-to-space-jam-about-skateboard-1831528293#:~:text=This%20fateful%20meeting,in%20%24230%20million.">Brendan Fraser</a> and Rachel Weisz are reportedly in talks to star in a new <em>Mummy</em> film from Radio Silence, the team behind<em> Ready or Not</em>, <em>Scream</em> (2022), and 2023’s<em> Scream VI.</em> And it could be a direct sequel to the second film.</p> <p>On November 4, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/new-mummy-movie-brendan-fraser-rachel-weisz-1236418031/"><em>The Hollywood Reporter</em> reported</a> that it had heard from sources that Fraser and Weisz are currently in talks with Universal to return to the franchise that started back in 1999 with the blockbuster action-adventure movie <em>The Mummy, </em>an action-oriented remake of the studio’s original 1930s horror movie. &nbsp;The outlet reports that Radio Silence is producing and directing the movie. The duo, made up of filmmakers Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett, found success with 2019’s <em>Ready Or Not</em> and helped revitalize the <em>Scream</em> franchise in 2022.&nbsp; Sean Daniel, who helped produce the OG <em>Mummy</em> movies, is also on board.</p>

 <p>Details on the new movie are still under wraps (get it?), but a source told<em> The Hollywood Reporter</em> that the yet-to-be-confirmed new <em>Mummy</em> movie isn’t a reboot, but instead a sequel that would possibly “disregard” the events of the third film, which hit theaters in 2008, moved the franchise into China, and controversially recast Weisz’s character. The outlet reports that David Coggeshall is behind the new <em>Mummy’s</em> screenplay.</p>

  <p>After 1999’s fantastic <em>Mummy</em>, Universal followed it up with two sequels. The equally fun sequel arrived in 2001 and was also a box office hit. <a href="https://kotaku.com/games/the-mummy-tomb-of-the-dragon-emperor">But the franchise stalled before returning seven years later</a> and flopping with critics, though that film still brought in over $400 million.</p> <p>In 2017, Universal rebooted<em> The Mummy</em> with Tom Cruise as part of the studio’s<em> Dark Universe</em> project. While it earned about the same as the third <em>Mummy</em> movie, it cost significantly more and was attached to a failed cinematic universe that never took off. So it makes sense that Universal, wanting to cash in on this oddly reliable franchise, is looking to bring back the two charismatic stars who launched the whole thing in 1999. Let’s just hope it all works out and we get one more fun mummy-filled adventure with Fraser and Weisz.</p>

When you add in the threat of other players who might want to kill you and take your loot, too, you really need to make sure you're prepared to fight at all times. But there's a bit more to the game than just survival, as there are also a variety of quests to complete that can provide you with resources that will help you on your journey through Speranza. Below, we've listed out every quest you can undertake in Arc Raiders.</p><h2>Arc Raiders missions list</h2><p>There are currently 63 quests in Arc Raiders, though more will be added with future updates. As of right now, you can expect to spend dozens of hours completing these quests, which task you with finding spots on the map to interact with, looting unique resources to return safely to someone in Speranza, or defeating specific enemy types.</p>

<p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/exclusive/2025/11/04/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-will-have-a-new-never-before-seen-conclusion">Game Informer</a> has spent some exclusive time at Square Enix's Shibuya, Tokyo offices, and that also involves chatting to the game's producer, Takeshi Ichikawa, who has shared some interesting news about the upcoming game — it'll have a "new conclusion".</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067klyjiw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

<p>While more interviews and tidbits will be available in the subscriber-only issue, Game Informer shared Ichikawa's cryptic comment about one of the changes coming to this big reimagination of the 2000 PlayStation RPG.</p>
<p>While Reimagined "follows the narrative of the original story", Ichikawa told the outlet that "player choices, players will get to see a new conclusion that's never been seen before" in previous versions of the game. That includes the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/dragon_quest_vii_fragments_of_the_forgotten_past">3DS remake</a> that launched in 2013 (well, 2016 in the West).</p>

<p>"...even players who have played previous versions of Dragon Quest VII, they'll still get to have this fresh narrative experience with Reimagined" Ichikawa concludes, leaving the rest to speculation. Will it be an extension of what was there before? Or something completely new? We'll have to wait and see.</p>
<p>We've been getting a few little snippets of info on the upcoming remake; Ichikawa recently teased that fans are ready for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-producer-reckons-were-ready-for-its-dark-sorrowful-story">more "dark and sorrowful" story</a>. Plus, there's some streamlining and other quality-of-life changes coming along with the lovely visual overhaul.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>It has been two years since the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-invasion-pve-release-date-story-missions-1850720767"><span>first and only </span><i><span>Overwatch 2 </span></i><span>story missions launched</span></a><span>, and I still yearn for the conclusion we won’t be getting. Blizzard has </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-03-22/blizzard-entertainment-makes-big-changes-as-overwatch-2-struggles"><span>reportedly canceled the campaign</span></a><span> that was once a pillar of the sequel’s pitch, which isn’t too surprising considering the apparent development struggles that the team had while </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-story-missions-campaign-canceled-blizzard-1851345720"><span>getting it off the ground</span></a><span>. Despite this, </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span> has a story that has been largely in limbo for years, with most of the shooter’s external media focusing on new characters and looking as far away from the main conflict as it can. Well, Blizzard may have just wrapped it all up kind of unceremoniously, at least, as far as the titular organization’s conflict with the Omnic radicals of Null Sector is concerned.</span></p> <p><span>In an almost six-minute audio drama, Commander Vivian Chase, aka Sojourn, addresses the public. Null Sector, the Omnic resistance group that rose up in the initial campaign, has apparently retreated following a “final battle” with Overwatch in Buenos Aires. Sojourn answers a handful of questions at a press conference, name-drops some </span><i><span>Overwatch 2 </span></i><span>characters like the shield-wielding Brigitte and the Omnic tank Orisa’s creator Efi, and says that things are chill, for now. The Overwatch organization will continue to serve the public, however, implying that some new threat may be lurking in the future. Other pieces of </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>media have hinted at more antagonistic forces beyond Null Sector and the chaos-inciting Talon organization that characters like Doomfist and Reaper belong to, so this might just be Blizzard clearing the series’ plate to focus on something new. I’ll say, though, that if this is the end of </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>’s Null Sector storyline and we got it in an audio drama that tells us about a sick battle that happened off-screen, that’s a real bummer.</span></p>  <p><span>The audio drama ends with a screen that says “The story continues in </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>,” likely a reference to the new Lore section that’s being added to the game in its midseason update. I’ll hold sweeping judgments until we get a better look at what Blizzard is doing to get the game’s story back on track. For now, I’ll just hope that this is a sign of more story content to come, and that Blizzard can salvage its universe as more than just a stage for crossover events.</span></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-tactics-modders-are-making-sure-the-remaster-gets-the-bonus-content-it-deserves.1343746/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Before <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-review-ivalice-chronicles-2000628040"><em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</em></a> brought the strategy RPG classic to modern platforms, there was the <em>War of the Lions</em> remaster for the PlayStation Portable. That version had a ton of bonus features, from extra job classes and characters to additional cutscenes and even a multiplayer mode. Unfortunately, all of that bonus content was cut from the current remaster, but dedicated fans are painstakingly trying to add it back in with mods.</p> <p>That’s good news for players on PC who can take advantage of all the work that’s already been done and find fresh reasons to keep playing. The 2007 <a href="https://kotaku.com/why-everybody-loves-final-fantasy-tactics-5973196">version of <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em></a>, which is also the one available on iOS and Android, added a lot. There were guest characters Balthier from <em>Final Fantasy XII</em> and Luso from <em>Final Fantasy Tactics A2: Grimoire of the Rift</em>, as well as&nbsp;Dark Knight and Onion Knight job classes that let generic recruits rival the power of named companions. There was also a wireless multiplayer mode that let players team up or compete for treasure.</p>

 <p>The multiplayer mode might require deeper tinkering to bring it to <em>The Ivalice Chronicles</em>, but there are <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasytacticstheivalicechronicles/mods/33">already mods</a> <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasytacticstheivalicechronicles/mods/34">adding the rest</a>. In fact, fans like NexusMods user <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasytacticstheivalicechronicles/users/1594389">DanaCrysalis</a> have already gone and added other tweaks and bonus features as well, including the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasytacticstheivalicechronicles/mods/26">Red and Blue Mage</a> job classes from the <em>Final Fantasy Tactics Advance</em> spin-off. Qualify-of-life fixes, meanwhile, include a way to stop all of the monsters in your party, including Chocobos, from endlessly <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/games/finalfantasytacticstheivalicechronicles">filling up your roster with eggs</a>. There’s even a mod adding <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasytacticstheivalicechronicles/mods/36">extra-difficult random encounters</a> to the map.</p>

 <p>If you’re playing on console, however, there’s no way to take advantage of any of this. Why didn’t Square Enix simply restore all of this cut bonus content itself? “We did of course consider the addition of new jobs, abilities, and characters—including the jobs featured in <em>War of the Lions</em>,” director&nbsp;Kazutoyo Maehiro <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-had-to-be-brute-forc-1851784636">explained prior to launch</a>. “However, the original version of <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em>&nbsp;is a very complete game both from a game design and story perspective. If we were to make major changes, it would only be a loss for not only fans of the original game, but also those new to the title.”</p>

 <p>In fact, there were apparently even discussions about adding more new content early on in development. The game’s original writer and director, Yasumi Matsuno, recently wrote on X that he has thought about branching out beyond the confines of the original story, like allowing players of the <em>Ivalice Chronicles</em> version to recruit characters like Miluda and Izlude. That ended up not being the right fit for the game’s budget and scope, which among other things required essentially rebuilding the game’s lost code base from scratch. “I think that if we were to do that, we should just make a new game,” he said.</p> <p>Obviously, Square Enix should do exactly that, but for now a vibrant modding scene will have to suffice.</p>

		<p>Commandos: Origins will be getting its first major piece of DLC on November 18th, taking players to the island of Crete. The DLC is called Shadows Over Crete and it is set after the events of the German invasion of Crete in 1941. The Shadows Over Crete will add four new fully voiced missions with the Commandos teaming up with the Cretan Resistance, led by Eleni Andris.</p>

<p>Commandos: Origins will also add a new enemy type in the form of paratroopers who can quickly descend onto battlefields and add a new threat dimension for players. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/09/commandos-origins-review/">Commandos: Origins review</a>, Adrian said, <em>“Commandos: Origins is probably very good; an interesting historical setting, charming visuals, and deep and varied strategic options. You won’t notice any of that if playing on console however, you’ll be too busy wrestling with the terrible controls to be having much fun. That, and the buggy visuals, make this one to be missed unless you’re on PC.”</em></p>
<p>Commandos: Origins’ Shadows Over Crete DLC will be available for PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, and PS5 for $14.99.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Hideo Kojima attended Lucca Comics 2025 this past weekend and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zN2yGExts_c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was featured in a special panel</a> with two actors from Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, Luca Marinelli (who played Neil Vana) and Alissa Jung (who played Lucy).  A lot of the panel focused on the experience of working on the game, including having to shoot remotely during the pandemic. However, Kojima also shared that he makes games partly with the hope of giving people the energy to live on and be happy.  </p>



<p><em>I grew up watching movies or reading books. When you're a child, you feel so dark about the world sometimes, but for me, there weren't really good role models around me, so what helped me was movies. The characters, or the dialogues, or the theme of the movie really cheered me up. I thought that gave me energy to live on. So I want to return that and that's one of the reasons I create games. If someone plays my game and, after a few years, feels like, I want to live on because I played this game and it cheered me up. That would be the happiest thing that I would feel because I've put that thought when creating the game. There's so many things in entertainment, but games are so immersive, and you play like hundreds of hours on games. So if I ask the person to spend hundreds of hours of their life and they are relieved of stress or whatever, that's fine too, but I also want to give them something through my game. Like, through Luca and Alyssa's relationship and the characters of the game, you feel something. You could use that in your real life and become happy. That's my goal. And of course, I haven't reached that point, but that's how I think when I create my games.</em></p>



<p>The sentiment isn't shocking for those who have come to know Kojima and his unique mentality throughout the years, and without a doubt, at least some of his games have definitely touched a few players.</p>



<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach launched on June 26 for PlayStation 5 to widespread critical acclaim. Given that rights of the franchise have returned to Kojima Productions, we can expect to see the game on PC and probably even on Xbox Series S and X at some point in 2026, <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-directors-cut-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just like the previous installment</a>.</p>

<p>Use these Roblox Wings Of Glory monthly redeem codes for November 2025 to get free Tactical Medals, allowing players to progress through the levels of the game quickly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’re a fan of the legendary Tom Cruise movie Top Gun, then <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-roblox-prospecting-codes-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> Wings Of Glory is going to be right up your alley. Wings Of Glory is a highly detailed combat flight simulator game that boasts over 150 aircraft, ranging from vintage classics to modern beasts. It features intense 10v10 dogfights in historical locations, allowing players to relive some of the greatest battles the world has ever seen. The fast-paced gameplay can provide hours of endless fun, with six different nations’ aircraft to choose from. Wings Of Glory has extremely realistic flight controls as well as highly customisable planes, making it the ideal game for fans of the aeronautical world. The progression system in the game allows players to get their hands on timely upgrades, but some additional rewards would go a long way, and that’s where the Wings Of Glory codes can come in handy.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>The Switch 2 continues to be a sales juggernaut, as Nintendo has announced that it has sold over 10 million Switch 2 consoles in its first six months.</p><p>In its <a href="https://chrome-extension//efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251104_4e.pdf">2nd quarter fiscal year report</a>, Nintendo states 10.36 million Switch 2 units have been sold from its June 5 launch through the end of September. Although Nintendo frames this number as an overall decrease from the Switch 2’s hot start, which established it as the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/06/11/nintendo-switch-2-is-the-fastest-selling-console-ever-with-35-million-units-sold-in">fastest-selling home console ever</a>, it has remained a strong performer.&nbsp;</p><p>This number now means that Switch 2 is selling more than twice as fast as the original Switch did during the same launch period (4.7 million in its first six months in 2017). The Switch 2 has also outperformed the PlayStation 5's sales during its first six months (<a href="https://gameinformer.com/2021/04/28/playstation-shatters-industry-sale-records-for-fy2020-over-78-million-ps5-consoles-sold">7.8 million</a>), albeit that console also suffered from supply shortages.</p>

      <p>Mario Kart World</p>
  
</article>

<p>The report also reveals sales figures for the Switch 2’s marquee first-party titles, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/mario-kart-world/roam-if-you-want-to">Mario Kart World</a> and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/donkey-kong-bananza/breaking-through-to-something-new">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>. Mario Kart World, a launch title that was also a pack-in for the $499 Switch 2 bundle, has sold 9.57 million units, with 8.1 million from the console bundle. This means nearly every Switch 2 owner grabbed a copy of the latest Mario racer. Donkey Kong Bananza, which launched on July 17, has sold 3.49 million copies. Overall software sales for Switch 2 in the first half of the fiscal year sit at 20.62 million.</p><p>With the holiday season approaching, the recent launch of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/pokemon-legends-z-a/maintaining-rank">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a> (of which sales data is not yet available), and the highly anticipated release of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/09/12/metroid-prime-4-beyond-hits-nintendo-switch-2-and-switch-this-december">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> on December 4, it’s likely the Switch 2 will continue its strong momentum heading into 2026. In fact, Nintendo has modified its sales forecast for the next fiscal year; it now expects to sell 19 million Switch 2 consoles before the end of March 2026, up from its previous forecast of 15 million.&nbsp;</p><p>For more on Switch 2, you can see what remaining games will hit the console this year with our <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/29/2025-nintendo-switch-2-game-release-schedule">Switch 2 release calendar</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Most of the time when I’m working I need a little background noise. Sometimes that means music, sometimes podcasts, sometimes streamers. Most recently I’ve been working with the Criterion 24/7 channel on my second monitor, and I swear to god it’s fixing my mental health.</p><p>My husband and I are very aware of how much bullshit we let into our minds. We try not to binge television shows—after three episodes, we watch something else. For every fluffy blockbuster we watch, we make an appointment to watch something off the beaten path. We pop on an episode of <em>The Gilded Age</em> before embarking on an hours-long baseball game. It’s all about balance: If you’re going to have cotton candy, you have to eat your vegetables too.</p><p>But when I work, I often seek out the kind of slop I try to avoid in the rest of my life. For a long time my bread and butter for working was extremely long Let’s Plays, but I also keep podcasts in the rotation for a similar reason: I just like to hear the sound of human voices while I work on something. Streamers like NorthernLion and Hasan Piker have also worked their way into my routines, though there’s only so much I can take of grown men playing video games at this point in my life, as amusing as their anecdotes may be.&nbsp;</p><p>Reality television (my husband hates it, so I can only watch it in my office), podcasts and streamers genuinely do help me to get started with my work, because they help me feel like I’m not just typing alone in my office with my cat. The problem with all these sources of “content” is that they make me feel like my brain is melting after a while. So last week, on a whim, I tossed on the Criterion’s 24/7 channel, which plays movies from the Criterion Collection 24 hours a day, and I had the complete opposite effect.</p><p>I know that watching a dense, foreign language film like <em>Ceddo</em> while working on an essay or typing emails isn’t going to help me retain much of what I’ve seen. But that said, looking over to my second screen and seeing a frame that’s been arranged deliberately, with care, makes me simply feel more like an adult. I know I can’t really watch the movie with the focus it deserves, but at the very least it’s another really cool film to add to my list, and my growing collection of Blu Rays from Criterion.</p><p>Because of Criterion 24/7, which is available with a subscription to the Criterion’s streaming service, I’ve enjoyed the pleasures of Orson Welles’s<em> The Trial</em>, Pierre Creton’s experimental gay coming of age story <em>Un Prince</em>, as well as <em>In Celebration</em>, which features a very young Brian Cox. Sometimes I’m still in the mood for slop, but it’s a more balanced diet. Even if I’m not grasping every detail from these films, I still feel better off for having seen them—and am sometimes drawn into ten or fifteen minute stretches of beautifully framed shots. Since all of these movies are already in the Criterion streaming collection, I can always watch them again when I’m not working. But when I am working, they remind me that I am not sitting around bullshitting. Like these artists, I have the ability to make things with care, too.</p><p>My mom, who is a professor, used to watch Turner Classic Movies all day long while grading papers before she formed a mild addiction to home renovating shows on Bravo. Maybe I picked up this habit from her instead of inventing it wholecloth. Either way, watching images that are more than incidental, and aspire to more than just entertainment, is healing my neural pathways. It gives me no joy to admit this, but my mom had a point there.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/kodansha-studios-akira-anime-live-ation-chloe-zhao-nicolas-gonda"><h3>Somehow, The Threat Of A Live-Action Akira Refuses To Die</h3></a><p>If there is any anime that could be considered Hollywood’s Moby Dick, it is Akira</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/europa-universalis-v-review-impressions-paradox-pc-eu5"><h3>How Am I Supposed To Review Europa Universalis V</h3></a><p>There is simply too much video game here, and it's always in motion</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-halo-white-house-trump-vance"><h3>And Also, Who Even Cares About Halo And Lord Of The Rings These Days</h3></a><p>"All of these things do have a feeling of dragging and resuscitating a corpse"</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/i-owe-my-workday-to-criterion-24-7]]></content:encoded>

<p>The demo arrives on the Switch eShop — for both the Switch 1 and 2 versions of the game — at <strong>9pm PST</strong> <strong>today</strong> (that's <strong>midnight EST</strong> and <strong>5am BST</strong> on <strong>5th November)</strong> and will allow you to play up to Episode 2.</p>
<p>And yes, of <em>course</em> you'll be able to transfer your progress over to the full game. That's the best thing about these demos. So it's the perfect way to try the game out if you're on the fence. You don't have to replay anything if you decide to pick it up, and if you don't gel with it, well, that's okay too!</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067klyjiw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

<p>In case you missed it earlier this year, Raidou Remastered is a completely refreshed version of the 2006 PS2 action RPG <strong>Devil Summoner: Raidou Kuzunoha vs. the Soulless Army</strong>, which itself is part of the Devil Summoner spin-off series from the Megami Tensei series.</p>
<p>The remaster features completely overhauled visuals and compat, full voice acting, fast travel, the ability to save anywhere, and a number of other quality-of-life features.</p>
<p>We <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/raidou-remastered-the-mystery-of-the-soulless-army">reviewed the Switch 2 version</a> of the game when it launched on 19th June 2025, calling it "a wonderful retread of a forgotten classic", though with some quibbles about the visuals and some simplistic gameplay elements.</p>
