            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lego-fortnite-brick-festival-storm-chasers<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic has revealed big changes for&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite&nbsp;</em>in the coming days, including a major new social roleplaying experience and an update to the core mode that adds lots of new content.</p>

<p>First up,&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite</em>'s new Brick Life mode is coming on December 12th. Described by Epic as an "all-new social roleplay experience in the&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite&nbsp;</em>universe", the mode will allow you to "make new friends, explore the sights, land your dream job, and move into your new home", according to Epic's description.</p>

<p>Brick Life looks to be an experience that wants to compete with&nbsp;<em>The Sims&nbsp;</em>(and also <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>, perhaps), so of course, you'll also be able to build your dream home and furnish it with all kinds of fun accessories, by the looks of things.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lego-fortnite-brick-life-odyssey-update-phones.jpg?itok=bS3qgpjP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lego-fortnite-brick-life-odyssey-update-phones.jpg?itok=HaYo1H59 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Lego Fortnite</em>'s new Brick Life mode is a "social roleplaying experience" that has shades of&nbsp;<em>The Sims&nbsp;</em>about it.</figcaption></figure><p>In the trailer, we also see&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite&nbsp;</em>characters riding on vehicles, working out at the gym, stealing diamonds from some kind of bank vault, and engaging in plenty of other activities, so it looks like there'll be lots to do in Brick Life.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for this new&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite&nbsp;</em>mode right here.</p>




<p>The second major piece of&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite&nbsp;</em>news released by Epic today is a name change and major update for&nbsp;the main&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite</em>&nbsp;mode. It's now called&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite Odyssey</em>, and it'll be part of a new bespoke&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite&nbsp;</em>section within the main&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>game.</p>

<p>Tomorrow,&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite Odyssey&nbsp;</em>will get a brand new update by the name of Storm Chasers, and it's set to bring a new biome, new dungeons to explore, and new enemies to fight, plus "a formidable big bad" in the form of the titular Storm King. Here's the trailer!</p>




<p>In case you're not aware,&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite&nbsp;</em>is a spinoff mode within massively popular battle royale game&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>.</p>

<p>Released in December last year, the mode debuted to a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lego-fortnite-debuts-with-over-23-million-concurrent-players-will-get-updates-in-early" rel="nofollow">staggering number of concurrent players</a>, with that number <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-festival-launches-with-over-600000-concurrent-players-as-lego-fortnite-passes" rel="nofollow">only increasing in the following days</a>.</p>

<p>Since then,&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite&nbsp;</em>has received a number of updates, including new features, tweaks to existing mechanics, and even <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-fortnite-may-2024" rel="nofollow">a crossover with&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em></a>, among many other things.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite&nbsp;</em>for free right now as part of&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>, which is available to play on PC, PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and mobile devices.</p>

It seems like some people might be gravitating to whatever broken build they can find currently popping off online in part because they’re struggling with the early game in a way they didn’t in <em>Path of Exile 1</em> or similar games like <em>Diablo IV</em>. </p><p>This exploratory phase is part of the fun of diving into a big new action-RPG though. <em>Path of Exile </em>is a game all about deep character customization that lets players experiment with all sorts of builds until they find something that really suits their playstyle or overperforms in unexpected ways. It’s still the earliest days for <em>Path of Exile 2</em>, which came out in preview mode on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on December 6 alongside its Steam Early Access release (the game is currently $30 but will be free-to-play at its 1.0 launch). </p><p>And dealing with unexpected difficulty curves or build nerfs is better than battling down servers or long queue times. “For those still in queue, what we are doing right now is letting in players in batches so that we can make sure to monitor the backend and not overload it,” the studio <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/pathofexile/status/1865156788636848490&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/pathofexile/status/1865156788636848490" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">revealed</a></span> late on Friday. “Thanks once again for your patience and hopefully it won’t be too much longer.” </p><p>Things seem to have improved as of Monday. The concurrent player count recently dipped to 330,000 on PC, down from its weekend peak of 578,562. The record launch came despite equally big debuts last weekend from the likes of <em>Marvel Rivals </em>and <em>Infinity Nikki</em>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-game-director-reveals-new-details-about-companions/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Avowed’s Game Director, Carrie Patel, has disclosed details on how companions interact with the player in the upcoming game.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-more-interactivity-and-reactivity">“More Interactivity and Reactivity”</h2>



<p>In conversation with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/after-starfields-strict-companions-im-glad-avoweds-crew-wont-be-backseat-driving-and-second-guessing-all-your-choices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>, Carrie Patel discussed how they wanted to provide “a little more interactivity and reactivity” to companions “based on the events and conversations and quests that you’re encountering in the game.” Patel added that they wanted companions “to have a little bit more to say” about their journey together.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Patel then goes on to talk about how engaging with companions is a significant part of RPGs, but finding the ‘balance’ is also crucial. They didn’t want Avowed’s companions to “feel like someone is backseat driving and second-guessing all your choices.” Patel also compared Avowed’s companions to Starfield’s, stating that they won’t have as extreme reactions when you do something ‘evil’ but will provide some form of pushback.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-avowed-s-companions-will-have-opt-in-engagement">Avowed’s Companions Will Have Opt-In Engagement</h2>



<p>Patel then talks about the opt-in engagement players can experience with companions in Avowed. The developers have “written a lot of content for these characters for their engagement in the story with one another, with the player.” However, it’s up to the players whether they want to explore this content. For example, when they return to the party camp, players “might hear their companion say a thing or two”, but they decide whether to have the conversation and “get to know their companion a bit better.”</p>

Not only are we getting a new Lego Pass with piles of new content for the existing Lego Fortnite survival/crafting game, but we're getting an entirely new Lego game, dubbed Brick Life.</p><p>Lego Fortnite Brick Life, which launches on December 12, is an open-world social sim in which you and 31 of your closest friends can hang out in Brick Bay, a lively Lego City that's full of activities, jobs, and empty lots you can build on, and Brick Bay will be expanding all the time. For example, December 18 will mark the opening of the Rooftop Club, a fancy social space that provides stunning views of the city from above. The launch of Brick Life happens to coincide with the addition of text chat to every Fortnite experience, which will be key for a social sim like this one.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4411527-1%286%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4411527" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4411527-1%286%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4411527"></a><figcaption>Brick Life is designed as a family-friendly social sandbox mode.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4411527-1%286%29.png"></figure><p>Brick Life isn't just some new Creative Lego island, however--Epic is treating Brick Life as a full new game on the same level as the existing Lego Fortnite survival game. As a result, that original Lego Fortnite game is being rebranded as Lego Fortnite Odyssey, with the term "Lego Fortnite" now referring to everything under that umbrella, rather than a specific mode.</p><p>Lego Fortnite Odyssey, meanwhile, is getting its own massive update this week that introduces a new villain, the Storm King, and a new faction that opposes him called the Storm Chasers. This new quest line will cause destructive storms to pop up all over the map at random--you'll need to navigate treacherous Storm Dungeons to make them go away and make progress toward defeating the Storm King.</p><p>All this new content for Lego Fortnite is being accompanied by an all-new Lego Pass, which is headlined by the new Raven Team Syd skin, which unlocks as soon as you buy the pass. Remember that access to the Lego Pass, along with the Music Pass and OG Pass, are now included with Fortnite Crew, so if you subscribe to Crew at any time while this Lego Pass is active, you'll immediately receive the Raven Team Syd skin.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4411523-legofortniteodyssey_stormchasers_keyart.png" data-ref-id="1300-4411523" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4411523-legofortniteodyssey_stormchasers_keyart.png" data-ref-id="1300-4411523"></a><figcaption>The original Lego Fortnite survival game has been rebranded as Lego Fortnite Odyssey.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4411523-legofortniteodyssey_stormchasers_keyart.png"></figure><p>On top of that, Lego Fortnite has some completely free skins it wants to give you. Connecting your Lego and Epic accounts will grant you the Mr. Dappermint skin--he's that giant candy cane that they sell in the shop each December--as well as the Explorer Emilie skin that has been available for doing that since last year. And just for good measure, playing Fortnite on mobile and earning any amount of XP before February 21 will grant you the Chord Kahele skin, which will be the first Festival default skin that will be equippable as a skin, and which also has a Lego style.</p><p>Brick Life is just one of Fortnite's big new modes in Chapter 6, along with the new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-fortnite-og-chapter-1-season-1-weapons-map-and-changes/2900-6012/" data-ref-id="2900-6012">OG mode</a>, and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-finally-getting-official-first-person-mode-but-its-not-battle-royale/1100-6528295/" data-ref-id="1100-6528295">first-person Ballistic mode</a>.

                <p>Hold on to your potatoes, because developer MachineGames has released the first patch for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. The update adds path tracing for select Nvidia cards, improved whip behavior, and a host of gameplay fixes, as detailed in the full patch notes below.</p><p dir="ltr">On <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/ZKn6jyPTe2ElFSJ0yZ2WA/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-tm-update-1?linkId=100000316950846" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bethesda's website</a>, MachineGames provided a laundry list of improvements for the action-adventure game, headlined by path tracing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-run-on-your-pc-check-out-the-requirements/1100-6528208/" data-ref-id="1100-6528208">for PC players</a>. Think of this feature--which is also in the works for AMD cards, according to the developer--as <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-path-tracing/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a souped-up version of ray tracing</a>. That means, for example, offering even more realistic lighting sources and reflections. However, you need the hardware to support it, as the developer says at least 12GB VRAM is needed.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="2047998103" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

<p>Let’s start with Lego Fortnite Odyssey and the new update for the game, dubbed Storm Chasers. The Storm King has kicked off a quest to consume the whole world, and it’s up to you and your friends to find Storm Chaser Village, make new friends, and build up the strength to stop him.</p>
<p>Storm Chaser Village is the new hub, with a bunch of Storm Chaser characters to meet and grab missions from. These will take you out into the Storm where you’ll look for Storm Dungeons to take on – these are regenerated and randomised every 24 hours.</p>

<p>There’s some new gameplay mechanics, and overhaul of progression and component-based crafting that will have you scavenging for resources of higher rarity. Enemy difficulty has been equalised across biomes to help improve balance through the game, as well. LEGO Fortnite Odyssey is compatible with split-screen across PlayStation and Xbox consoles.</p>

<p>Lego Fortnite Brick Life is something completely new, though. Ever wanted to live in a Lego city? Because now you can, hopping onto servers alongside 31 other players and hanging out in restaurants, parties and clubs in what looks a little more like the social side of GTA Online.</p>
<p>You’ll have your own home to decorate, but affording all that will require you to get a job, which include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Courier – Deliver parcels to other Brick Bay residents!</li>
<li>Academy Professor – Share your knowledge with the class at Moundale Academy.</li>
<li>Security Officer – Make sure crime doesn’t pay.</li>
<li>Scoundrel – Prank fellow city-goers.</li>
<li>Sushi Chef – Serve up the tastiest fish in Brick Bay!</li>
<li>Bobom Milk Tea Bobarista – Serve Brick Bay’s most refreshing beverage.</li>
<li>Fortune Teller – What does your future hold? New furniture!</li>
</ul>
<p>You can swap careers whenever you like.</p>
<p>With cash in your account, you can buy and then customise your own home at one of several empty lots in the city, whether that’s in the suburbs or the heart of the city. Just open your phone and use the furniture catalogue to personalise it, or visit the furniture shop for more bespoke items. If you own any Decor Bundles and Builds from the wider Lego Fortnite, you can use these as well.</p>
<p>You can visit locations including the town square, the beach, Durrr Burger, and Mourndale Academy to socialise with other players. The Rooftop Club will open on 18th December with an in-game event. Importantly there’s the standard Fortnite chat restrictions to keep a lid on interactions, which can take place using text chat, or through the use of emotes and jam tracks.</p>
<p>It sounds really interesting, finding yet another new direction to push Fortnite in and reviving some of that early 2000s social game space vibe in the process.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/covenant-is-new-first-person-dark-fantasy-combat-game-from-halo-battlefield-destiny-doom-devs/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Legion Studios is a relatively new and small studio that contains a team of 12 people who all have a significant amount of experience. The team consists of developers from <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-xs-playstation-5-ports-halo-gears/">Halo</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-takes-top-spot-in-revenue-in-october-2024-newzoo-reports/">Call of Duty</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-rising-brings-the-sci-fi-franchise-to-mobile-thanks-to-netease/">Destiny</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-ii-ray-traced-path-tracing-mod/">Doom</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/apex-legends-from-the-rift-update-available-today-adding-new-cosmetics-launch-royale-more/">Apex Legends</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/four-development-studios-working-on-new-battlefield-game/">Battlefield</a>, all of which are announced in the first gameplay trailer that they revealed. They have just announced their new and upcoming game called Covenant, which is a first-person dark fantasy combat game. To get a glimpse at what the game will be looking like, check out the first gameplay trailer below. The trailer is just under three minutes long.</p>
<p><iframe title="COVENANT - Official Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GxeAuWTduC4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Covenant will have a Metroidvania and Soulslike world, where players will get to explore a vast, interconnected world, where you'll get to go on a long and arduous journey to discover the fighting stances, weaponry, spells, and armor that can help you become powerful in the game. The footage seen in the trailer shows that Covenant will be developed using Unreal Engine 5, with the footage in the video being from a pre-alpha, in-engine build of the game. Despite that, the quality looks great, and the world looks incredibly detailed and reminiscent of FromSoftware games. Even the narration that sets the tone of the video feels very much like a Soulslike. However, it is pretty rare to see a first-person Soulslike, so it'll be interesting to see how Covenant will shape up and whether it'll be closer to a game like Remnant. However, even that title is in the third person. With how quick movements and attacks are in a Soulslike, it seems like being in first-person will provide an additional challenge that may not sit well with those who are fans of the genre.</p>
<p>At the moment, there is no sort of ETA or release window for Covenant, which is to be expected, considering this is really the first time anyone is hearing about the game. They shared some relatively generic PC specs for the title, which can be found on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3333990/Covenant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam page</a>. If this game is something you are interested in, you are able to wishlist this game now on Steam.</p>
<p>Much like many Soulslike or Metroidvanias, you will be able to play alone, as well as play with friends in co-op, if that is your preferred method for these types of games. There are also plenty of PvP opportunities, as you will be able to battle in 1v1, 2v2, and 3v3 arenas.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on this reveal?</p>

elaborate about what this means as it relates to exclusivity. Beyond that, the decision on "spacing" when a game might come to a rival platform after Xbox needs to also factor in production timelines, Booty said.</p><p>"We want to make sure there's a great experience for our Xbox players, and then the gap between [when it becomes available on PlayStation] is as much a production decision as it is anything else. This is a game that was in production before we acquired Bethesda, even," Booty said.</p><p>Microsoft announced it would acquire ZeniMax, the parent company of Machine Games studio owner Bethesda, in 2020--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-now-officially-owns-bethesda-in-7-5-billion-purchase/1100-6488574/" data-ref-id="1100-6488574">the deal officially closed in 2021.</a></p><p>After Microsoft acquired ZeniMax, it acknowledged that making some of Bethesda's games exclusive to Xbox, including Starfield and The Great Circle, would lead to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-being-an-xbox-exclusive-means-millions-in-lost-sales-microsoft-believes/1100-6515976/" data-ref-id="1100-6515976">millions of lost game sales.</a> Microsoft said at the time that it would aim to make that up with Game Pass sign-ups and hardware sales.</p><p>In February 2024, Microsoft disclosed that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-now-has-34-million-fully-paid-subscribers-growth-coming-from-pc-and-cloud" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game Pass had reached 34 million members</a>, but the company hasn't revealed a new figure since.

            <p>
Epic Games has announced a second major <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-fortnite">Lego Fortnite</a> mode, Brick Life, that's set to arrive within the main <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> game on 12th December. 
</p>
<p>
The arrival of Lego Fortnite Brick Life means the game's original Lego Fortnite mode, launched last December, is getting a slight rebranding - to Lego Fortnite Odyssey.
</p>
<p>
So, what is this new Brick Life offering? Well, it's described as a social experience set in an ever-evolving city where you can hang out with others, take on jobs (courier! professor! sushi chef! fortune teller! scoundrel!) and build a Lego home.

<p>
Lego components for your home will come from the Decor Bundles and Builds you've unlocked within Lego Fortnite so far.
</p>
<p>
There's lots new in the rebranded Lego Fortnite Odyssey, meanwhile. The mode's latest update, Storm Chasers, adds a fresh village to build up alongside new allies, and storms that strike until you defeat the Storm Dungeon at their centre. 
</p>
<p>
These dungeons - which will shift around the map - look to be an attempt at providing more of a different experience each day you play. Storm Dungeons will reform after 24 hours, as will the boss behind it all: the Storm King. 
</p>
<p>
I've always felt that, beyond village progression, Lego Fortnite lacks a proper end game. Now, similar to the Ender Dragon in Minecraft, the mode has a final boss you can work towards being powerful enough to defeat.
</p>

 </a>

<p>
Fresh vehicles in the update include an aquatic barge, new items include the healing Slurp Launcher, while NPCs can now revive you upon defeat.
</p>
<p>
Other welcome enhancements include melee attacks having increased range, stamina consumption being reduced, and another buff to your inventory size.
</p>
<p>
Earlier today, we reported on leaks that suggested virtual popstar <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-hatsune-miku-crossover-coming-leaks-suggest">Hatsune Miku was headed to Fortnite in 2025</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/chained-echoes-dlc-ashes-of-elrant-q2-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Deck13 and developer Umami Tiger have announced&nbsp;<em>Ashes of Elrant</em>, the first major story DLC for JRPG homage&nbsp;<em>Chained Echoes</em>. It's due to arrive sometime in the second quarter of next year.</p>

<p><em>Ashes of Elrant&nbsp;</em>will bring a brand new playable character in the form of the White Wolf (no, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cyberpunk-2077-sales-witcher-production" rel="nofollow">not that one</a>), an anthropomorphic wolfman character who looks to be a close combat melee specialist.</p>

<p>It's not just the White Wolf, though;&nbsp;<em>Ashes of Elrant&nbsp;</em>will also introduce new story segments to&nbsp;<em>Chained Echoes</em>, as well as new areas to explore, more than 40 new enemies and bosses to take on, and more equipment to collect, plus lots more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/chained-echoes-ashes-of-elrant-dlc-white-wolf.jpg?itok=qdSZ8wIM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/chained-echoes-ashes-of-elrant-dlc-white-wolf.jpg?itok=4g1diigx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Chained Echoes Ashes of Elrant&nbsp;</em>DLC will add a new playable character and more.</figcaption></figure><p>Story-wise, Umami Tiger (previously known simply as solo developer Matthias Linda) hasn't revealed too much about what you can expect, which is par for the course for a story-driven RPG.</p>

<p>However, we do know&nbsp;<em>Ashes of Elrant&nbsp;</em>will take place just before the finale of&nbsp;<em>Chained Echoes</em>, and that it'll involve a "new call for help" being sent to the Crimson Wings. Answering that call will lead to uncovering "more about the origin of the Order of Leonar and Lenne's past".</p>

<p>Naturally, you'll have to play&nbsp;<em>Ashes of Elrant&nbsp;</em>in order to learn more. We don't have a release date for it yet, but the DLC is set to arrive sometime in Q2 next year, so you can likely expect it sometime around spring or summer.</p>




<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Chained Echoes</em>, it's a throwback JRPG created by German solo dev Matthias Linda. The game features deliberately retro-style pixel art visuals, as well as turn-based combat and a story that revolves around multiple characters.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Chained Echoes&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1229240/Chained_Echoes/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/chained-echoes/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/chained-echoes/9N1WWRPJ12FK" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/chained-echoes-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>, and its&nbsp;<em>Ashes of Elrant&nbsp;</em>DLC is set to launch in Q2 next year.

A year after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/7/23990660/lego-fortnite-release-epic"><em>Lego Fortnite</em> launched a new era inside of the game</a> — one based on the idea that <em>Fortnite</em> is a collection of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/9/23992574/fortnite-festival-harmonix-guitar-hero-rock-band">many game experiences</a>, rather than just a battle royale — Lego is expanding its presence with a new title that sounds reminiscent of <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em> roleplaying as well as a rebrand of its core survival game.</p><p>First up is a game called <em>Brick Life</em>, which is billed as “an all-new social roleplay experience.” Players explore a Lego-ified city location with 31 other people and can take on specific jobs like courier, security guard, or sushi chef. Players can design their own homes and explore locations like a magical school and rooftop club, and there are missions to take on as well. From the sounds of it, <em>Brick Life</em> is a more family-friendly take on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/11/23828431/rockstar-cfx-re-mod-tools-roleplay-server">the enduring popularity of roleplaying servers in <em>GTA V</em></a>, and Epic isn’t being all that subtle about the connection:</p><p><em>Brick Life</em> is launching inside of <em>Fortnite</em> on December 12th, though it won’t be available for players in South Korea.</p><p>As part of the announcement, <em>Lego Fortnite</em> — the <em>Minecraft</em>-style survival experience that launched last December — is being renamed <em>Lego Fortnite Odyssey</em>. From now on, “Lego Fortnite” will be the name of the hub inside of <em>Fortnite</em> that houses all of the Lego experiences. Epic and Lego have been steadily expanding their partnership over the last year, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/27/24084644/fortnite-new-lego-games-raft-survival-obby-fun">launching new games</a> and also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/20/24106477/lego-fortnite-user-created-games-epic">letting <em>Fortnite</em> players build their own Lego games</a>.</p><div><p>The ongoing collaboration between Lego and <em>Fortnite</em> could provide a hint at what to expect from the upcoming “persistent universe” that Epic and Disney are making together, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/7/24065281/disney-epic-games-investment-fortnite-metaverse">following a $1.5 billion investment from Disney in February</a>. Since then, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/4/24261555/epic-disney-fortnite-unreal-fest">we’ve heard very little specifics</a> about what the virtual world might look like.</p></div><p>Meanwhile, Epic has also announced that <em>Fortnite</em> is getting support for a revamped version of text chat, which will be available as an option across all of its experiences starting on December 10th. There will be three kinds of text chat available: party channel for talking with your squad; game channel for a public conversation with people on the same island; and DMs with people on your friends list.</p><p>Epic says there will be two kinds of chat filters — one that removes personal information, and another that filters out “various kinds of mature language and toxicity” — which will be always on for players under the age of 13 in all forms of text chat. They will also be always on for all players in the channel chats. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/16/23962354/epic-games-fortnite-report-voice-conversations">The feature will also include a reporting system similar to the voice reporting tool Epic launched last year</a>. Here’s an example of what text chats look like in the game:</p><div><p>All of these announcements come at a particularly busy time for <em>Fortnite</em>. The battle royale game is currently in the midst of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/26/24306403/fortnite-minus-one">a brand-new chapter</a> that kicked off <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/4/24288014/fortnite-chapter-2-remix-snoop-dogg-times-square-music">following an ambitious music-themed season</a>, and Epic also recently <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/12/24294616/fortnite-og-permanent-december-release-date">brought back the nostalgia-filled <em>Fortnite</em> OG as a permanent mode</a>. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/7/24315134/fortnite-ballistic-counter-strike-first-person-shooter-fps">Epic just announced “Ballistic,”</a> a multiplayer first-person shooter mode that launches inside of <em>Fortnite</em> on December 11th.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-rivals-player-count-reaches-10-million-in-just-72-hours.1055718/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-10m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>NetEase has announced that its online superhero shooter&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>has already crossed a major player count milestone just a few days after its initial release.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1865909229070016851" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on the&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>X account, the game has crossed the 10 million player mark already, which is particularly impressive given that the announcement was made almost exactly 72 hours after&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>' launch on Friday.</p>

<p>In the post, NetEase thanks "each and every one" of the people who have checked out&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>so far and shares a special piece of artwork depicting some of the game's interpretations of classic Marvel characters like Wolverine, Hawkeye, and, uh, Squirrel Girl.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-rivals-player-count-10-million-artwork.jpg?itok=1oOjPhrX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-rivals-player-count-10-million-artwork.jpg?itok=UlZJaAp8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>seems to have proven pretty popular among players.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting this player count doesn't necessarily translate to revenue for NetEase;&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>is free-to-play, after all, and all of its heroes are unlocked for all players at the start of the game, although a battle pass is up for sale if you do want to shell out some real-world cash.</p>

<p>Still, a quick look at <i>Marvel Rivals</i>' <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2767030/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB page</a> shows that the game still appears to be going pretty strong. Its 24-hour player count peak sits at 480,990 at time of writing, with 296,557 players currently playing the third-person hero shooter.</p>

<p>That's without taking into account player numbers on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S as well. Naturally, many of those 10 million players will have jumped in to check the game out and will have no intention of sticking around, but it's still safe to call&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>a success, I think.</p>




<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>is, it's a third-person multiplayer hero shooter created by NetEase Games.</p>

<p>Bearing <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-announced" rel="nofollow">more than a passing resemblance</a> to Blizzard's&nbsp;<em>Overwatch</em>,&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>sees teams of Marvel heroes and villains competing against one another to complete objectives like holding territory or escorting a moving object to its destination.</p>

<p><em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>is available to play for free right now on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.

That’s happening again today, as the Genetic Apex SP Emblem Event 1 launches, joining the ongoing Venusaur Drop Event and the Bulbasaur-themed Wonder Pick Event. And while it’s strange, it makes it a great time to pick up the game.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196165" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="95" data-playlist="196165,194907,194141" data-current="196165"><div><p>What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21711.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Emblem Events are, in my opinion, the best of the current rotation of special challenges the mobile card game offers. They’re focused on battling other real-world players rather than the game’s mediocre AI, and with far better rewards than the standard for-the-hell-of-it battles that’ll only net you thimbles of XP. The current Venusaur Drop event against the CPU certainly gives you something to do, but go into it with a half-competent fire deck and you’ll have won all the good loot within half an hour. Emblem Events, named for the badge-like prizes rewarded that you can display on your profile, offer a tastier challenge against real people, with decks you don’t know in advance.</p><p>With <em>Pocket</em>’s signature bemusing lack of clarity, the new event is titled “Genetic Apex SP Emblem Event 1.” And if you’re thinking, “Hang on, I’m pretty sure that already happened,” then no, silly, you’re thinking of “Genetic Apex Emblem Event 1,” which took place in November. Don’t you look daft.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-venusaur-drop-event-full-art-card-1851710232&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-venusaur-drop-event-full-art-card-1851710232"><em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>’s New Venusaur Event Features The Most Beautiful Card</a></span></p><p>SP stands for...ummm...“consecutive wins”? Yeah, no, it doesn’t make a lick of sense. But that’s the goal here: winning multiple matches in a row, which is so much juicier than anything that’s come before. Last month’s version was just about accruing wins overall, but this is much tougher. <em>And</em> it’s also uncharacteristically generous in its first handful of prizes, awarded just for participation!</p><p>For playing once, whether you win or lose, you get three of the coveted Pack Hourglasses, then another three for playing three battles, and once you hit five matches, you get six more hourglasses! That’s enough for a whole new pack, just for playing five times. Then there’s another 12 for battling ten times! Two packs, just for goofing around in the event, is—pleasingly and also miserably—better than the challenge rewards you get for paying the $10 a month for the god-awful Premium Pass. (There’s also 150 Shinedust for winning three battles, but that’s <em>rubbish</em>.)</p><p>The gloat-worthy prizes are the emblems, with four on offer, each increasingly more grand than the last, awarded for winning from two to five battles in a row. So having that crowned picture on your profile comes with some earned bragging rights.</p><p>It’s a short event, only lasting seven days, so get cracking. And don’t forget to gather Bulbasaur and Magnemite cards in the current Wonder Pick Event, and all the promo cards dropped in the ongoing Venusaur Drop Event. Woo! This is <em>Pocket</em> at its best, I reckon, and it’s looking likely to go quiet again on all fronts in a week.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10013590" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Store page</a> also features fake selling points and even fake awards from video game websites, including IGN.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The Most Anticipated Game About Making The Most Anticipated Game!” reads the game page. “You're now in charge of the biggest gaming disaster... Or masterpiece? Run your dream game studio while juggling angry fans, corporate chaos, and endless delays. Fight your way through gaming conventions, dodge ruthless journalists, and master the art of creative excuses.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/09/gta-1733750215619.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Grand Taking Ages VI is meant to be a parody of GTA 6. Image credit: PlayStation Store.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Grand Taking Ages VI is supposedly inspired by real gaming industry events, and “delivers a satirical take on game development and the endless wait for certain highly anticipated titles.” It promises a release before October 2025, or before when the developer expects Grand Theft Auto 6 to come out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of the developer, the PlayStation Store page mentions Violarte sp. z o.

The website for Violarte was only created recently, and contains fake games and awards as well as what look like fake employees visualized either with stock photos or generative AI.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has asked Sony and Violarte for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Grand Taking Ages VI should obviously not be taken seriously, its appearance on the PlayStation Store does call into question Sony’s curation process. The PlayStation Store has seen a number of questionable games over the years, but all the major video game storefronts struggle with this issue. The likes of Steam, the various app stores, and even the Nintendo eShop are packed with slop. And who can forget God of War rip-off War Gods Zeus of Child, which appeared on the Xbox store back in 2022?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Grand Taking Ages VI, its appearance on the PlayStation Store is likely not long for this world. “In memory of those who didn't have a chance to live till this moment (and those who gave up waiting and bought a PS6 instead),” the description concludes. “PS6 doesn't exist yet, but by the time some games release, it probably will.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GTA 6, meanwhile, launches on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S in the fall of 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

It supports Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and Windows PC via wireless and wired connections.</p><p dir="ltr">At $240, the Squid Game Pink Guard Edition is just $10 more than the standard Instinct Pro, so if you're in the admittedly niche overlap of Squid Game fans looking for a pro-style controller for Xbox or PC--or you really like the color pink--this is a good option. That said, if the feature set caught your eye but you would prefer a different color option, you can grab the Scuf Instinct Pro for just $190 (was $230) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Instinct-Custom-Wireless-Performance-Controller-Mobile/dp/B0BB3CG33L?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://howl.link/osymo21vg5ee4?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17335363731871?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Best Buy</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/09/mighty-morphin-power-rangers-ritas-rewind-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Right, let’s get this out of the way early, Mighty Morphin’ Power Rangers: Rita’s Rewind sadly isn’t very good. I know, I know, I’m as disappointed as you are as this felt like it would be the second coming of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/06/29/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tmnt-shredders-revenge-review/">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge</a> just with Power Rangers – who are probably, maybe, just as awesome as our friendly neighbourhood heroes in a half-shell. A 2D side-scrolling beat ‘em up with retro arcade visuals and shoot ‘em up sections, I mean, what could go wrong? As it turns out, quite a lot.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers: Rita's Rewind | Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pgm1RkQgp5E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>First off though, in terms of what it <em>does</em> get right, Power Rangers: Rita’s Rewind absolutely nails the aesthetic. The opening theme-music drips nostalgia and superbly sets the tone, giving you all of the retro feels. For people of a certain age, this is your childhood, but in 2024. Even better, the game itself has the sheen of a coin-up arcade screen overlaying the visuals, really cementing the sense of playing this game in your local arcade – you know, the one that no longer exists.</p>


<p>The chunky pixellated characters have a lot of charm, the Rangers themselves ninja flipping smoothly across the levels, whilst the never-ending horde of Putties you face are decent, if rather bland, punching bags. Thankfully, the look of the bosses is much more like it, correctly channelling the Saturday-morning TV shoddiness of the original much-loved Power Rangers series.</p>
<p>Smartly, the game is subdivided into a TV episode structure. Your team of Rangers face reams of goons, before battling a boss who, of course, runs off. You give chase in your Dinozord, blasting away in shooting sections that honour the almost-3D sequences of Sega’s classic game Afterburner. Then the boss gets biggified and your Dinozords combine to build the mech-like Megazord, resulting in a ginormous scrap.</p>


<p>Sadly, once you get to actually playing Power Rangers: Rita’s Revenge, things fall apart pretty quickly. Beat ‘em up sections are dull and pedestrian, with lacklustre collision detection proving a constant irritation. Think you’re lined up on the correct parallel plain to punch a Putty? Well, the game is pretty sure you are wrong, every time. Resulting in your Ranger unleashing a devastating flurry of fist-based pain on some innocent thin air.</p>
<p>Next to nothing of interesting or note happens across a level either; you pummel the same small selection of goons again and again and there are no weapons to pick-up or vehicles to control. Even local co-op fails to elevate proceedings, due to the Rangers themselves playing exactly the same. Sure, their disappointingly limited range of attacks look a bit different, but they have identical form and function. Unlike, TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge you won’t find any levelling up or new attacks to unlock here, just the same paltry selection of attack combos, jumps and throws.</p>
<p>Even the ultimate attacks are basically just colour-pallet swaps; the lack of imagination here, considering the rich and varied source-material, is truly disheartening. Indeed, the only interesting occurrence as you walk from left to right is when a Putty comes out with a green time crystal that rewinds time – admittedly accompanied by neat VHS effects – until you destroy it. Though this one good idea is itself rewound and reused so many times that it is soon rendered dull.</p>

<p>Whilst the beat ‘em up section are serviceable but uninspired, the shoot ‘em-up sections are a mess. Visually incoherent with a smorgasbord of explosions and effects, it’s almost impossible to tell where your Dinozord is as it runs towards the horizon, let alone navigate all the obstacles and enemies heading your way. Unlike Afterburner, Outrun or other arcade titles from the era, these shoot ‘em up section fail to recreate any sense of depth, resulting in even more confusion as everything is given a flat appearance. Good luck trying to tell to how close a runaway truck is, as it supposedly careens its way into your path. Irritating and pointless, the shoot ‘em up levels of this game should have been made skippable.</p>
<p>Which just leaves the Megazord smackdowns, which, frankly, suck. Played from a first-person perspective, the players pass the controller and take it in turn to battle the villain of the week. Dodging attacks, finding an opening, punching the big baddy and charging up your sword is the format. It’s kind of interesting in your first encounter with Goldar, but the same boss-fight structure with a different character model is repeated ad-nauseum.</p>

<p>Controls here are loose and inexact, and the whole thing is frustrating and poorly conceived, with little sense of satisfaction if you emerge triumphant as your victory was likely more down to luck than any skill or intention. You know when players are choosing to skip their go, that this part of the game is a dud.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/mighty-morphin-power-rangers-ritas-rewind-review-power-of-friendship<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I was able to attend Summer Game Fest live earlier this year, and one of the games that hyped me up the most was, you guessed it, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/mighty-morphin-power-rangers-ritas-rewind-preview-mighty-good-time" rel="nofollow"><em>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita's Rewind</em></a>. The last time I consumed any sort of <em>Power Rangers</em> media was back in the 90s, but even still, something about <em>Rita's Rewind</em> gave me a great deal of excitement.</p>

<p>And now, after having spent time going through <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/digital-eclipse/games" rel="nofollow">Digital Eclipse's</a> <em>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita's Rewind </em>as both solo and co-op, I'm pleased to say it lived up to my expectations. This retro-fueled beat 'em up is the perfect homage to both <em>Power Rangers</em> fans as well as those who just love a good ol' brawl in the streets.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ritas-rewind-special.jpg?itok=EqXz3zQb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ritas-rewind-special.jpg?itok=5jihDthC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>When it comes to clowns, I don't hold back.</figcaption></figure><h2>Punchin' 'em Good in <em>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita's Rewind</em></h2>

<p>Whether you're new to beat em' ups or you scarf them down like some sort of gaming glutton, <em>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita's Rewind </em>hits the spot. It's a side-scrolling beat em' up first and foremost, but it does have a few tricks up its sleeve to differentiate it from the rest. Of course, the main draw to <em>Rita's Rewind </em>are the Power Rangers themselves.</p>

<p>I'm a Blue Ranger guy -- same as I was back in the 90s -- and getting to play him in video game form is a treat. You can choose from any of the Rangers (and an extra one after you beat the game!) and each has a pretty simplified, but nonetheless satisfying moveset.</p>

<p>Each Power Ranger has the same set of moves, but their animations are different to help make them feel more distinct from one another. For example, the Blue Ranger incorporates his lance into attacks, while the Black Ranger uses an axe. Like I said, character choice doesn't seem to make much of a difference unlike in, say, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-shredders-revenge" rel="nofollow"><em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge</em></a>, but it's nice to have distinct visual flair.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ritas-rewind-elevator.jpg?itok=u4PLwEcP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ritas-rewind-elevator.jpg?itok=-LgvA3q8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Fighting with friends is always better.</figcaption></figure><p>A few more moves create a satisfyingly simple set of attacks anyone can enjoy, including an attack that launches a Ranger into the air. From the air, you can take out pesky Tenga Warriors that tend to fly up high. You can finish a combo off by launching yourself down on an enemy with a strong kick or a "down smash."</p>

<p>Combat is gratifying, especially with the sound effects that accompany whacking the enemy. I just wish there was a bit more complexity to the combat in <em>Rita's Rewind</em>, as that would make this great brawler something truly excellent. Nonetheless, there wasn't a moment I didn't have fun throughout the 3-hour or so campaign.</p>

<p>Definitely bring a friend along, if that wasn't already clear. While playing through <em>Rita's Rewind </em>is in itself an enjoyable experience, the optimal way is always to play with friends. Having a buddy come along on the harder difficulty made for a wonderful session of play, and I can't wait to get all the Rangers together for another go.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ritas-rewind-co-op.jpg?itok=gUJMn3oZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ritas-rewind-co-op.jpg?itok=7fV3y7DE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You can see their little faces distort as you punch them. I'm just now noticing this and I love it.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita's Rewind </em>Mixes Things Up</h2>

<p>Whether you're fighting through a toxic factory or bashing away at Putties in a misty graveyard, stage variety g<em>ives Rita's Rewind </em>a lot of charm. However, there are also moments throughout the campaign that mix things up and change the gameplay altogether, and that's another point where <em>Rita's Rewind </em>shines.</p>

<p><em>Rita's Rewind</em> occasionally mixes things up and becomes an on-rails shoot 'em up. During several points during the campaign, you take control of a Dinozord and start blasting away at flying ships and ground hazards in your way. I'm a junkie for <em>Star Fox 64</em>, and these segments play a lot like this, so you know I'm having a blast.</p>

<p>But wait, there's more! That's right, you can, of course, take control of a Megazord as well. You get to partake in brief segments as the Megazord fights another gigantic foe. It plays a bit like <em>Punch-Out </em>here, where you have to recognize enemy attack patterns and dodge around them, then go in for the ol' one-two.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ritas-rewind-bike_0.jpg?itok=_nBmwjvL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ritas-rewind-bike_0.jpg?itok=ydXXw5oD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>There's also some high-octane motorcycle segments too! <em>Akira </em>slide!</figcaption></figure><p>Megazord segments are decent enough, but fall flat compared to the other areas of gameplay in <em>Rita's Rewind.<strong> </strong></em>Get hit once as a Megazord and you're thrown back -- then you have to charge in again while dodging attacks and hope you can land your hit. It's a bit finicky and takes a while to get the hang of.</p>

<p>This is especially true if you're playing multiplayer, as it switches who controls the Megazord after getting hit once. The transition period for switching between players, going in, and hoping to punch your opponent again slows the pace of the gameplay down considerably.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ritas-rewind-dinozord.jpg?itok=64iK_i42 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ritas-rewind-dinozord.jpg?itok=g8XrLsiS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Each Power Ranger does, of course, have a different Dinozord.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita's Rewind </em>Feels Authentically Retro</h2>

<p>From both a visual and sound perspective, <em>Rita's Rewind</em> is absolutely top tier. By far, my favorite aspect of the visual design in <em>Rita's Rewind</em> is its CRT filter. This isn't your ordinary, "we'll throw some lines on the screen and call it CRT" type of deal. It turned my monitor into a gosh darn CRT television.</p>

<p>The filter adds a slight curvature to the edges of the screen, which most other filters in games seem to ignore. Of course, if this isn't to your liking, you can either forgo the filter altogether or choose from several others. Either way, <em>Rita's Rewind</em> is meant to be seen through this retro lens.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ritas-rewind-megazord.jpg?itok=vLOzonUS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ritas-rewind-megazord.jpg?itok=jfrPX4sU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Tell me this doesn't look awesome.</figcaption></figure><p>The spritework is also exceptional, as are the animations. Everything about <em>Rita's Rewind</em> oozes with love for the IP. During those Dinozord/Megazord segments, you're met with a nice blend of 2D and 3D graphics that make for an exceptionally action-packed, wild ride as you blast your way through foes.</p>

<p>There's also an exciting, rock-and-roll soundtrack that pays homage to <em>Power Rangers</em>' Tokusatsu origins. It's the kind of music that'll pump you up and serves as a wonderful complement to the non-stop action. Composer Sean Bialo is no stranger to retro-inspired OSTs, and even worked on games like <em>Shredder's Revenge</em>. Bialo's experience is clearly on display here.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ritas-rewind-rollercoaster.jpg?itok=7CDFMPtt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ritas-rewind-rollercoaster.jpg?itok=fN_zAnQG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Can't enjoy a darn rollercoaster ride in peace...</figcaption></figure>

<p>My complaints are few and far between. Besides the just OK Megazord segments, bosses can feel a bit of a button mash on higher difficulties, especially when the game employs relatively simple fighting mechanics. <em>Rita's Rewind </em>is also just a tad too short for my liking, but there is some replayability with various collectibles and mission objectives to complete.</p>
