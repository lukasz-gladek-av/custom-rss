            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>For a few months now, many gamers had seemingly pinned their hopes on a company in China to help <a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/ram">alleviate rising prices on RAM</a> resulting from the <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-steam-deck-is-still-out-of-stock-and-valve-says-get-used-to-it-2000669487">ongoing and worsening memory shortage</a> fueled by AI hyperscalers and tech giants. But while new tests show the Chinese-developed RAM is good for gaming, it’s unlikely to be the silver bullet many had hoped.</p> <p>Over on the (sighs) PC Master Race subreddit, one of the largest PC gaming communities on the internet, people have been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1pdn11s/do_you_guys_think_cxmt_will_save_us/">talking about Chinese tech company CXMT</a> with some hoping that the DRAM maker <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1qxw0gj/cxmt_and_ymtc_ready_to_flood_the_world_with_ram/">could help produce more consumer RAM</a> while the bigger players, like Samsung, pivot to supporting companies hungry for parts and memory to power future AI data centers. The idea being that while the big RAM makers focus on that, CXMT will be here for the little guys, aka <a href="https://kotaku.com/pc-gamers-are-dumpster-diving-for-ram-because-prices-keep-skyrocketing-2000667727">PC gamers</a>&nbsp;looking to upgrade their rigs without taking out a loan to do so.</p>

   <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1qx42x7/cxmt_priced_32g_ddr43200_ecc_at_138_link_in/">CXMT 32GB DDR4 RAM reportedly selling for less than $150 online</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tech_x/comments/1qsuwbd/chinas_new_ram_company_cxmt_is_selling_ram_at_138/">caught the attention</a> of a lot of gamers. Even though DDR4 is older and slower than DDR5, it represented a more affordable option. (And considering the fact that DDR4 is also starting to sell out and see huge price increases, there is demand for it.) Would China save gamers? <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1qtsijj/is_china_the_one_that_is_going_to_save_us/">Memes were created suggesting this was the case.</a> But the reality isn’t so simple.</p> <h2>CXMT RAM is good for gaming, but…</h2> <p>First, the good news: RAM using CXMT chips is comparable in gaming performance to RAM sticks created by bigger-name companies like Samsung and SK Hynix. In a new and <a href="https://www.techspot.com/review/3089-ddr5-made-in-china/">comprehensive report</a>. <em>TechSpot </em>tested Kingbank-produced RAM containing CXMT bits against G.Skill RAM using SK Hynix memory. And the results in games like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> were promising, with the cheaper Kingbank RAM performing within a few percentage points of the more expensive G.Skill RAM. In the current market, cheaper RAM performing this well really is good enough.</p>

  <p>Now, the bad news:&nbsp;In the last few weeks, CXMT RAM has gone up in price, something noted by <em>TechSpot</em> and others. The company can’t produce nearly as much as its bigger competitors, and it is likely raising prices as demand increases, shattering some gamers’ hopes that CXMT would be the hero they hoped for in the ongoing memory shortage.</p>

 <p>Another thing to note is that CXMT has been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News">essentially banned in the United States</a> for a few years now. <a href="https://wccftech.com/cxmt-ymtc-removed-from-pentagon-list-opening-door-for-chinese-dram-adoption/">And while there are signs that this might be changing soon</a>, especially with rumors that <a href="https://x.com/wccftech/status/2023756672175677891">Apple wants to cut a deal with CXMT</a> to help the tech giant fill in supply gaps, for the moment, CXMT is unlikely to flood the U.S. market.</p> <p>The other big problem is that CXMT has <a href="https://www.mk.co.kr/news/business/11957166">already committed to allocating around 20 percent of its production to creating memory for AI companies</a>. That doesn’t mean <a href="https://investors.micron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/micron-announces-exit-crucial-consumer-business">CXMT is pulling a Micron and abandoning consumer RAM</a> anytime soon, but it is yet more evidence that China’s DRAM maker will noy be some PC gaming savior. “It’s over,” posted one person on Reddit to the news of CXMT pivoting. “Not even China gives 2 hoots about the retail market.”</p>

It's available to preorder at a variety of retailers for $49.99 (<a href="https://zdcs.link/a56MWO?object_uuid=00d0d9ef-015f-4a08-aa43-a0093b725354&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0GM224VBV" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">see it here at Amazon</a>) and is set to be released in a few months time, on June 3. But there's even more in store for fans: those who preorder this version of the game also get an exclusive Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy promo card as a bonus. That's quite a nice surprise alongside the game itself. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you can't wait to grab the Switch 2 version (and an extra Magic: The Gathering card), head to the links below to get your preorders in.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Preorder Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth (Nintendo Switch 2)</h2><div id="235622"><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235622" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth (Switch 2) + MTG - Final Fantasy Promo Card</h3></p></div></span></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/a56MWO?object_uuid=00d0d9ef-015f-4a08-aa43-a0093b725354&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0GM224VBV" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">See at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/z64XrY?object_uuid=00d0d9ef-015f-4a08-aa43-a0093b725354&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">See at GameStop</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QpBg3g?object_uuid=00d0d9ef-015f-4a08-aa43-a0093b725354&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">See at Best Buy</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/z3Od0R?object_uuid=00d0d9ef-015f-4a08-aa43-a0093b725354&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">See at Walmart</a></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">What's included in the box is, unfortunately, a Game-Key Card, meaning the actual game isn't loaded onto the cartridge. However, putting the cart in your Switch 2 does let you download the game and is required when you want to play it. It also lets you sell the game when you're done with it, which you can't do with a digital game code.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Preorder Bonuses</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As far as preorder bonuses go, the Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy promo card is the most exciting one of the bunch. It features variant art of Zack Fair, drawn by Tetsuya Nomura, which you can see in the image above, and has identical abilities to the Zack Fair card found in the Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy set. This card is only available while supplies last, though, so it's well worth preordering the game now to make sure you get your hands on it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside the card, there's also a reversible inlay that comes with the physical edition of the game, and in-game items of a Posh Chocobo Summoning Materia, Armor: Shinra Bangle Mk. II, and Armor: Midgar Bangle Mk.

            <guid>1439674</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Ubisoft has started email users of its services that it is rolling out age verification for Ubisoft accounts, with limits coming in for social features so players can only interact with people on their friends list unless the account is verified. It does not look like it is worldwide but does affect countries where laws require age verification for people to access some content, including the UK with the introduction of the Online Safety Act. This move seems to be specifically about the UK</p>
<p>In the email I received, Ubisoft wrote, <em>“To keep our community safe and ensure age‑appropriate experiences for all players, Ubisoft is introducing a new age verification step for certain communication features. This update also helps us comply with the UK Online Safety Act.</em></p>


<div>
<h4><em>What is changing</em></h4>
<p><em>If your Ubisoft chat setting was previously set to “<b>Friends of Friends</b>” or “<b>Everyone</b>”, it has now been switched to “<b>Friends Only</b>”. You can still chat freely with people on your friends list, but you’ll need to verify that you are&nbsp;<b>18 or older</b>&nbsp;to use text or voice chat with players outside your friends list.</em></p>
<p><em>This update applies to your experience on&nbsp;<b>PC and mobile</b>. On&nbsp;<b>console</b>, nothing changes: your platform settings continue to apply.</em></p>
</div>
<div>
<h2><em>Why this is required</em></h2>
<p><em>This step helps us maintain a safe environment for all players and offer more tailored experiences while meeting UK regulatory requirements. Your privacy stays fully protected. Age verification is handled securely and Ubisoft does not store your identity documents. They are used only to confirm your age.</em></p>

</div>
<div>
<h4><em>How to verify your age</em></h4>
<p><em>You can complete the verification at any time from the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/account/privacy-center/data-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ubisoft.com/account/privacy-center/data-protection&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1771525808296000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0caF7g4wSNpeNsZYgNEbwO">Privacy center</a> on the Ubisoft Account website. Simply switch your Voice &amp; Text Chat setting to “<b>Friends of Friends</b>” or “<b>Everyone</b>”, then follow the verification steps. You’ll only need to do this&nbsp;<b>once</b>. More details about age verification and how it works are available on <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/help/article/000116275" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ubisoft.com/help/article/000116275&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1771525808296000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0DHYae_AQUQ6g5hGqaKyg0">Ubisoft Help</a>. Thank you for helping us keep our community safe and enjoyable for everyone.”</em></p>
<p>If you choose to verify your age to access text and voice chat with people that are not on your friend list Ubisoft is providing four ways to do this. The first is to use the Yoti Digital ID app through which you confirm your ID and get a digital ID that can be used for different services. The second is age estimation where you take a photo and software estimates your age. Ubisoft states that these photos are not store and are encrypted. The third way is to upload a photo of your ID and scan your face to confirm it matches. Again, Ubisoft says that none of this data is stored or shared. The final way is to do a credit card check to confirm you are over 18. Ubisoft has confirmed that this only applies to voice and text chat through the Ubisoft platforms on PC and mobile, but not on consoles as those are controlled by their parent companies.</p>

<p>Amy Mars? Veronica Rose?</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="92a82647796ce"><a title="Sonic the Hedgehog Amy Rose &amp; Kristen Bell" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/92a82647796ce/sonic-the-hedgehog-amy-rose-and-kristen-bell.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The next <strong>Sonic the Hedgehog</strong> movie is set to be a big one, with even more classic characters coming back, one of which is everyone's favourite pink hedgehog, Amy Rose. And we now know which Hollywood star will be voicing the iconic character</p>
<p>Revealed by <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/sonic-4-kristen-bell-voice-amy-rose-1236508342/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Kristen Bell, best known from <strong>Veronica Mars</strong>, <strong>Frozen</strong>, <strong>The Good Place</strong>, and <strong>Gossip Girl</strong>, will be taking up the piko piko hammer.</p>
<p>She'll be joining Ben Schwartz (Sonic), Colleen O'Shaughnessey (Tails), Idris Elba (Knuckles), and Keanu Reeves (Shadow) — assuming these all return — among many other star-studded names, when <strong>Sonic the Hedgehog 4</strong> speeds onto cinema screens on 19th March 2027.</p>
<p>In fact, Schwartz shared a rather adorable photo of the pair on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DU6JVK4lBLA/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==">his instagram account</a> earlier today, accompanied by this sweet little celebration: "WE HAVE OUR AMY ROSE!!! And I could not be more excited!!! Please welcome the incredible @kristenanniebell to the @sonicmovie family!!!"</p>

<p>Amy was expected to appear in fourth Sonic movie after a very brief cameo during <strong>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</strong>. Metal Sonic is also rumoured after he featured during the same cameo, but we don't have an official announcement for his return yet.</p>
<p>And it seems like everyone is coming back for the sequel: Jeff Fowler will remain in the director's chair, while Neal H. Moritz and Toby Ascher of Original Films and Toru Nakahara are also on-board as producers.</p>
<p>And the Sonic series isn't stopping at another numbered movie, either. Late last year, Variety reported that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/new-sonic-universe-movie-spin-off-announced-for-2028">a new 'Sonic Universe' spin-off is in the works for 2028</a>. So the blue blur is steadily becoming a multi-media monster.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Overwatch Fans Prove Fickle As Their Loyalty Is Bought By Cat Cosmetics]]></title>

            <guid>1439662</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Loyalty is a funny thing. Sometimes it’s earned, sometimes it’s bought, and sometimes it’s won over by </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-jetpack-cat-competitive-ranked-hero-bans-fika-2000668681"><span>cute kitty cats in jetpacks</span></a><i><span>.</span></i><span> The latter was on full display this week as</span><i><span> Overwatch </span></i><span>fans reversed momentum to unlock new skins in the latest event.</span></p> <p><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>’s current season has players siding with either the titular peace-keeping group or the terrorist organization Talon over the course of the next six weeks. At first, Talon was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-talon-sides-event-allegiance-rewards-lootbox-2000668184"><span>pulling off a decisive victory</span></a><span> against Overwatch, with fans defecting to the villainous group for laughs and lootboxes. Now that the second week is upon us, the rewards have refreshed, and players have been given the option to switch sides to win different prizes. Well, a lot of people did, and have sold out Talon for Overwatch so they can get a bunch of cute </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-jetpack-cat-tether-bob-dva-ultimate-flight-2000666163"><span>Jetpack Cat</span></a><span> cosmetics.</span></p>

 <p><span>Overwatch is currently winning out on the faction war with a pretty significant lead of 59.42 percent of players siding with Winston, Sojourn, and the rest of the good guys, while Vendetta’s new reign as head of Talon is only drawing 40.58 percent of the vote. I’m not judging these fickle allegiances too hard. Ideologies are ever changing and contain multitudes. What we believe in one week of February 2026 might be completely different the following week.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000670714" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000670714"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000670714">© Blizzard Entertainment / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>But you know what is forever? A profile picture of Jetpack Cat. This week’s rewards include two profile pictures, a voice line, and a profile banner, all with the prettiest girl at Watchpoint: Gibraltar. It looks like that was enough to get people to stop doing terrorism on behalf of their Italian mommy.</span></p>

 <p><span>This all comes alongside the latest </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>lore drop, which includes an audio drama of Brigitte recalling meeting Fika, the cat that would one day don a jetpack, and exploring design ideas to get her feline companion off the ground and in the air. </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span> is restructuring its seasons to integrate narrative more heavily, and this week it looks like the story content we’re getting corresponds to the rewards players are getting. So if future seasons keep this Splatfest-esque battle going, we’ll probably get used to seeing people hopping back and forth between both sides to unlock cosmetics.</span></p>

  <p><span>Will we get another lore drop next week as the rewards refresh? It’s unclear at the moment, as this is the first season in which </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span> has been using the story-driven format to drive in-game events. The in-game Story menu has two locked story drops left for this season, which is running until April, so we likely won’t get new lore on a weekly basis. Whatever we do get, however, will factor into </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-spotlight-story-vendetta-cinematic-new-heroes-2000665327"><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>’s remaining seasons in 2026</span></a><span>.</span></p>

The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Three Apothecary Diaries Adjacent Manga, For Your Consideration]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/the-apothecary-diaries-manga-reccomentations-red-river-eunich-of-empire-jaadugar-a-witch-in-mongolia/</link>
            <guid>1439644</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>As we all should know well by now, <a href="https://aftermath.site/apothecary-diaries-frog-scene/"><em><u>The Apothecary Diaries</u></em></a> is an excellent show. It’s got romance, political intrigue, a strong female lead, and it scratches that sleuthy, laid back-yet menacing <em>Columbo </em>vibe. But it's also just one show. Meaning, you’re probably wanting to find more things like it while waiting for a new season if you haven’t broken and read ahead in its manga and light novels already. Luckily for you, my body is 70 percent manga, and I’ve curated three series you can check out that strike a similar chord to Maomao's misadventures as a lady-in-waiting in a kingdom she wants little to do with.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Light spoilers for those three series’ set-ups.</strong></p><figure><figcaption><span>Kei Saikawa/Kotaro Shono/Manga Plus</span></figcaption></figure><p>First up is <a href="https://mangaplus.shueisha.co.jp/titles/100439?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Eunuch in Empire</u></em></a>, a series on MangaPlus, which, after reading the first chapter, I dubbed as <em>The Apothecary Diaries,</em> but for boys—or more specifically, teenagers. You’ll understand why I call it that in a moment. The series, written by <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=270527&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Kei Saikawa</u></a> and drawn by <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=163955&amp;ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">Kotaro Shono</a> (the guy who illustrated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World%27s_End_Harem?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>World’s End Harem</u></em></a>, just so you know what we’re dealing with), follows Jafar, our titular eunuch charged with overseeing three sister concubines in the royal palace’s “secret garden.” While Maomao has an aptitude for poisons, Jafar’s special skill is telling when someone is lying. It’s a trick that comes in handy when concubines in the palace suddenly start dropping like flies with a murderer on the loose in the palace, setting off a bunch of political disorder as women jockey to become the emperor’s favorite amidst the chaos.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Kei Saikawa/Kotaro Shono/Manga Plus</span></figcaption></figure><p>Between buxom panels you can’t read in public, <em>Eunuch of Empire</em> does stay on the even keel just enough to tell a pretty involved murder mystery as Jafar teams up with the three sisters to uncover the truth behind the murders and put a stop to them. Plus, for folks who can’t seem to focus on reading all the back and forth dialogue and procedural walking through the anatomy of the series’ murders and motives, Shono makes sure to draw all those pivotal revelations in a very <em>Game of Thrones</em> style sexpositon kinda way, minus any actual sex, just to make sure you’re paying attention to the moving and shaking of its plot.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Kei Saikawa/Kotaro Shono/Manga Plus</span></figcaption></figure><p>On the upside, the manga is finished, so you don’t have to worry about getting invested only to find the story isn’t finished. The downside is that the series delivers a bit of a rushed ending that feels like one of Maomao’s earliest cases she’d solve at the beginning of her journey. Still, seeing how a eunuch and a trio of concubines have to navigate those same confines is an interesting wrinkle to <em>The Apothecary Diaries</em>’ formula. So if you need a quick, altogether inoffensive read featuring a bunch of beautifully drawn women using their collective cunning and assets in equal measure to help Jafar solve serial killings within a kingdom’s harem, <em>Eunuch of Empire</em> is a pretty decent read.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Chie Shinohara/Viz Media</span></figcaption></figure><p>Next up is <a href="https://www.viz.com/red-river?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Red River</u></em></a>, a classic Viz Media shojo series that’s serendipitously due for <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2026-02-14/chie-shinohara-red-river-shojo-manga-gets-tv-anime-this-summer/.234197?ref=aftermath.site"><u>an anime this year</u></a>, adding to the whole<a href="https://aftermath.site/journal-with-witch-josei-anime-crunchyroll/"><u> shojosei renaissance wave</u></a> the anime industry has decided to add to fans’ all-shonen diets. The series, created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chie_Shinohara?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Chie Shinohara</u></a>, follows Yuri, a high school girl whose life is on the upswing. She’s just had her first kiss with a cute boy from school, and they’re taking their first, awkward steps toward dating. That is, until hands suddenly spring from a puddle, snatching her from the modern day (like <em>Inuyasha</em>) to Anatolia, AKA Turkey, during the era of the Hittite Empire. </p><p>Yuri can’t hop into a well and reverse isekai her way back home to flunk at school like Kagome. No, she’s stuck <em>Samurai Jack</em> style, unless she finds the mystic or one of equal power who can send her back home. The problem: the one who spirited her away into the past is the Queen, who wants to use her blood as a part of a sacrifice to ensure her child becomes next in line to the throne. She finds her refuge in a handsome prince named Kail Mursili, despite his reputation as a womanizer who gets around, and he takes a liking to Yuri and sets up the ruse that she’s his concubine to protect her as both a virgin sacrifice and help get her back home.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6qNhxSDcoaY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Official Manga Trailer | Red River (3-in-1 Edition), Vol. 1 | VIZ"></iframe></figure><p>Yuri may spend every waking moment plotting her quickest route back home, but along the way she accidentally becomes a one‑woman revolution. Armed with the scraps of knowledge she half‑remembered from her history classes, she unwittingly becomes a figure the kingdom hails as the second coming of Ishtar, the goddess of love and war. In reality, her divine insight boils down to modern sensibilities like knowing that horseback riding beats chariots in mobility any day of the week, and being able to spot iron because, well, she’s from the future and at the very least knows what a frying pan looks like. But to everyone around her, these tiny flashes of common sense look like miracles. Slowly but surely, the homesick lovergirl becomes a living legend, willing to run the dozens against men thrice her size to enact revenge against the Queen.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Chie Shinohara/Viz Media</span></figcaption></figure><p>In comparison to <em>Eunuch of Empire</em>, <em>Red River</em> hews closer to <em>The Apothecary Diaries</em>’ overall vibe because its epic is more than one note. <em>Red River</em>’s narrative is rich with action and political meddling that Yuri and Kail are routinely challenged with navigating. Their struggle to overcome every wrench the queen throws at them isn’t made any easier by the fact that they immediately suss out she’s the cause of their misfortune. The real obstacle is proving, beyond a doubt, that the queen is to blame.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Chie Shinohara/Viz Media</span></figcaption></figure><p>That becomes exceedingly difficult when her weapon is black‑magic water that can evaporate and slip away, making its viability as evidence as elusive as her weaponization of it is deadly. Bubbling beneath the forward thrust of their political game of cat and mouse is an allies‑to‑lovers romance between the pair as they counterplot against the queen and fall deeper in love. All the while, they’re locked into a game of thrones with her that’s less chess and more like that <em>John Wick: Chapter 3</em> scene where <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCjNPzoUC5g&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Keanu Reeves and Common have a silencer shoot‑out</u></a> in a public train station without anyone noticing.</p><figure><blockquote>— 『天は赤い河のほとり』TVアニメ公式 (@tenkawa_anime) <a href="https://twitter.com/tenkawa_anime/status/2022868472729088438?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">February 15, 2026</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>And because it’s a shojo manga, its art style has that soft, floaty charm that practically dares you to catch feelings right alongside them—even as the queen keeps trying to drown Yuri with her magic water at every turn. And with only 72 chapters (barring its spin‑offs),<em> Red River</em> makes for a snug read ahead of Tatsunoko Productions’ anime adaptation this spring.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Tomato Soup/Yen Press</span></figcaption></figure><p>Last up is <a href="https://yenpress.com/series/a-witch-s-life-in-mongol?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>A Witch’s Life in Mongol</u></em></a><em>,</em> a josei manga by <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=232317&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Tomato Soup</u></a> (yes, that’s their pen name) that the folks at Science Saru are set to animate later this year as well. The series follows Sitari, a muslim girl who is already at her wits' end when we first meet her as a slave putting on a fake smile to get by with the family who just purchased her. But things get worse when she starts to warm up to them, and they’re all wiped out by Genghis Khan’s army, completely glassing her village. Rather than resign herself to being rounded up as captive servants to the Mongol empire, Sitara seeks revenge by infiltrating the imperial palace, taking on the name Fatima, from her deceased mistress, bringing it to ruin from the inside by becoming an indispensable lady in waiting who can read important texts about science and medicine.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Tomato Soup/Yen Press</span></figcaption></figure><p>While <em>A Witch’s Life in Mongol </em>is still ongoing, it's also the one series that is most in step with the novel feeling <em>The Apothecary Diaries</em> emanates. For one, rather than having Maomao’s aversion to knowing more than she needs to know, out of fear of putting herself in political danger with all the bigwig royalty she has to deal with, Sitari relishes it to the point that she becomes a spy for many of the folks in the Mongol empire to see her vengeance come to light. All of that outer turmoil, wherein she creates a false bravado while earning her keep in the empire for years, is made all the more vexing for her when she harbors complicated feelings of attachment to the wives who are just as much captives as she is, and her desire to see her revenge through, making her a more complicated and invigorating character to follow than Maomao at times.&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SLZhRSC1gjs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Jaadugar: A Witch in Mongolia Teaser PV |July 2026"></iframe></figure><p>It also doesn’t hurt that the series sings as a piece of historical drama that takes the reputation everyone knows of the Khans as conquerors and puts a spotlight on the backstage of history, highlighting the real anguish and devastation the empire inflicted upon the Iranian city of Tus and their neighbors, whom they dominated and enslaved. Having all that complicated and dire storytelling told in a cutesy, Betty Boop-esque chibi illustration doesn’t detract from any of the height its character-driven story is carrying. <em>A Witch’s Life in Mongol </em>is arguably the best <em>Apothecary Diaries</em> variant you could hope to read, so whet your appetite for the anime by Science Saru come July 2026. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[DayZ Creator Calls On Consumers to Help “Normalize Delaying Games” Following ICARUS: Console Edition Delay]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/dayz-creator-calls-on-consumers-to-help-normalize-delaying-games/</link>
            <guid>1439629</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Earlier this week, developers <strong>RocketWerkz</strong> and <strong>GRIP Studios</strong> announced that the console release for the popular survival game, <strong>ICARUS</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/icarus-console-edition-delay/">would be delayed by one month</a>, from its initial <a href="https://wccftech.com/icarus-console-edition-arrives-on-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-s-in-february-2026/">February 26, 2026,</a> release date to <strong>March 26, 2026</strong>. Along with announcing the delay, the studios also confirmed that the team would host a Reddit AMA on<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SurvivalGaming/comments/1r7k1p3/developer_ama_lets_talk_delays_survival_games/"> r/Survival Gaming</a>, during which <strong>DayZ </strong>creator <strong>Dean Hall</strong> (who is also the creator of ICARUS) called on consumers to help <strong>"<em>normalize delaying games</em></strong>."</p>



<p>The statement doesn't come in the form of an answer from Hall, but rather as a preface before the AMA even kicks off. Hall begins by writing, "<em>We need to talk <strong>frankly</strong> about delays</em>." He continues, "<em>Games cost <strong>a lot of money to make</strong>. Timing makes a tremendous difference to the cost of a game, so there can be huge impacts with delays [in] releasing a game.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Players want quality and certainty, but it is my belief that developers latch onto this and get 'target fixation' about launches. Some of this is because of revene pressures, but much of it is wrapped up in perception. We are here today to <strong>break this perception</strong>. Failure to delay also leads to 'crunch culture.' So I am here today on a mission - <strong>let us normalize delaying games.</strong> You as consumers have the power to make it clear to platform holders (Xbox, PlayStation) that <strong>delays are okay</strong>."</em></p>



<p>When ICARUS: Console Edition was delayed earlier this week, the statement from the teams insisted that the game was in a "<em>strong and stable state</em>," but it chose to delay the game to give the team more time to polish it, "<em>rather than launch with known issues</em>."</p>



<p>In response to a question about game delays, Hall continued to discuss the issue, saying, "<em>I think most delays happen due to a failure to hit quality. And even when devs want to provide quality, they don't have the money they can spend to hit it. So they try to hide it, or ignore it. This is what happened with the ICARUS launch and we paid the price of going to 'Mixed.'</em> <em>As the studio got more fund security, we tried to break this cycle. <strong>But it is hard.</strong>"</em></p>

            <guid>1439623</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-3-review-shadow-keanu-reeves-jim-carrey-1851726797">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a>&nbsp;</em>ended with a <a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-3-4-post-credits-amy-rose-metal-shadow-1851726285">post-credits scene featuring Amy Rose</a>, Sonic’s ally and love interest, but she doesn’t speak during that brief appearance. That’s because they hadn’t cast her yet, but that’s officially changed, as <em>Frozen&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Good Place&nbsp;</em>actor Kristen Bell will be voicing the hammer-swinging hedgehog in&nbsp;<em><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-4-film-sequel-confirmed-march-spring-2027-sega-1851744323">Sonic the Hedgehog 4</a>&nbsp;</em>next year.</p> <p>Ben Schwartz, who voices Sonic in the films, announced on Instagram that Bell would be joining the cast in the fourth movie, which is set to premiere on March 19, 2027. The post includes an image of both actors holding little figurines of their characters.</p>

 <blockquote><p>WE HAVE OUR AMY ROSE!!! And I could not be more excited!!! Please welcome the incredible @kristenanniebell to the @sonicmovie family!!!</p></blockquote>   <p>Bell joins the stacked voice cast of Schwartz as Sonic, Keanu Reeves as Shadow, Idris Elba as Knuckles, and Colleen O’Shaughnessey as Tails. O’Shaughnessey is the only actor reprising her role from the&nbsp;<em>Sonic </em>games. Jim Carrey also stars in the films as Doctor Eggman, though it’s unclear if he’ll return for the fourth film given his character’s fate at the end of&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em>. He does <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jim-carrey-says-hes-down-to-return-for-sonic-4/1100-6528618/">sound interested, though</a>. What we know about <em>Sonic 4&nbsp;</em>implies that <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-sonic-3-concept-art-may-clear-up-that-confusing-pos-1851743775">some time-travel shenanigans</a> are in order, so it wouldn’t be surprising if Carrey popped back up as some kind of multiverse variant or something.</p> <p><em>Sonic 4&nbsp;</em>isn’t the only movie in the works over at Paramount, as the company is also working on <a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-live-action-movie-spin-off-shadow-4-5-2000649220">some kind of spin-off</a> for 2028. Fans are speculating that Shadow, rather than showing up in the fourth movie given its likely focus on Amy, may instead be the focus of this spin-off film. Maybe Rouge the Bat will finally show up in that movie since she was omitted from the last one, despite it being a loose adaptation of <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, the game in which she debuted.</p>

              <p>Almost everything about Pokémon’s latest set, Ascended Heroes, has been strange. The so-called “special” set officially released on January 30, but due to some <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-ascended-heroes-delay-booster-2000664086" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">undisclosed distribution issues</a> only the triple-pack sticker collection made it to shelves. The next wave of products should go on sale on February 20, including the all-important Elite Trainer Box, and this might perhaps cause the current resale values of the cards to calm down. Because right now, they’re out of control.</p> <p>Thanks to the enigmatic Pokémon Company International (TPCi), we’ve been fortunate enough to have received a bunch of Ascended Heroes packs early, including this week’s ETB, and even a couple of collectors boxes due for release in March. Each contain the same packs you can (in theory) buy right now in the sticker collections, but with different bonus materials (and yes, we <em>could</em> have sold them for four times their recommended retail price as that’s what pre-orders are currently being resold for, but thankfully we have some morals). It is the most peculiar of sets. It’s the largest collection ever, with a record-breaking 217 regular cards (including ex), and then a whopping 77 ultra-rares and higher. This is then made even more bonkers by the fact that every single regular card comes in multiple reverse-holos, with a matching energy-type reverse holo each, and then one of four different Poké Ball variants, as well as Team Rocket reverses for their cards!</p>

 <p>Good luck actually buying them, though. The same issues that have plagued the hobby since November 2024 continue, and at this point it can only be assumed that TPCi is deliberately ensuring they continue by constantly ramping up the number of special rarity cards designed around fervent player nostalgia. Not only does Mega Evolutions: Ascended Heroes feature the continued reintroduction of Mega Pokémon, but it also sees the return of what are now being called “Mega Attack rares,” the cards with their moves written in bold Japanese lettering that last appeared in 2015’s XY Primal Clash, and remain extremely collectible. Oh, and it also brings back Trainer Pokémon cards, revived last year during the swansong of Scarlet &amp; Violet and then weirdly abandoned just as it was getting going. That not enough to cause a frenzy? Well then, why not put in two gold cards, one featuring Mega Dragonite, then other Mega Charizard Y, and then the most astonishingly detailed Special Illustration Rare of Gengar. Yup, it’s like they took everything that can cause a set to go crazy, and put it all into one set, right at the point when buying Pokémon cards at all has become close to impossible.</p> <h2>Pull the other one</h2> <p>Of course, all that would suggest that if you&nbsp;<em>can</em> find some Ascended Heroes, it’s party time, right? Well, somehow no, because despite featuring more special art cards than any set in history, they’re also wildly difficult to pull. We were fortunate enough to open around 35 packs, and didn’t pull a single one of the 22 SIRs, let alone a gold card. Early stats suggest that SIRs are in fact found in one in every 100 packs, which is&nbsp;<em>ridiculous</em>, and the golds are in one in every thousand. This forced rarity is of course making resale prices even more crazy than they’ve been at any point during the last <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-magic-the-gathering-scalpers-cards-2000632017">18 months of the TCG’s destructive explosion</a>.</p>

 <p>In fact, from all those packs we only saw a single Illustration Rare, although from watching YouTubers opening packs this seems like it might have been some especially bad luck. There were also six regular ex cards, two ultra rares, and rather pleasingly, two Mega Attack rares, the Lucario and the Diancie. Which is all to say, the pull rates suck compared to those of previous Mega Evolutions sets, rights when we needed them not to the most.</p>

 <p>I realize this is grimly naive, but it does seem such a shame that such extraordinarily beautiful art is created for these cards, and then made outlandishly difficult to actually see. These cards deserve to be owned and loved, but if you pulled a piece of worthless cardboard for which someone would pay you over a thousand dollars, it enters the territory of being morally dubious <em>not</em> to sell it. (I’m delighted to have this debate in much more detail, if you find this crass or flippant.) Again, as I’ve said for <em>years</em>, I cannot think of any plausible reason why TPCi does not sell the artwork for these cards as prints on its stores. Let it be appreciated!</p> <p>Anyway, all that aside, let’s get mercenary about it. If you do find a pack and pull any of the following cards, you’re rich. Because we are in some whole new territory now. Over the years that I’ve been writing these articles I’ve seen the prices fluctuate, but it’s almost always been the case that the cards in tenth place are around $20, and sometimes a lot lower. The card in tenth this time is currently $164. In fact, you’d have to go as low as 18th to find a card under a hundred bucks, and <em>37th</em> for a card under $20. These are record-breaking prices across a set. These are the weirdest times. All prices were accurate (according to <em>TCG Player</em>) at the time of writing.</p>

 <hr> <h2>N’s Zoroark ex SIR</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000670681" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000670681"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000670681">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>With the massive increase in quality of the Illustration Rare cards, the&nbsp;<em>Special</em> Illustration Rares have had to up their game too, and you can really see the result here. N is displayed in his classic anime way, with that watercolor Zoroark, but then look at that background. That is some astonishing detail. And it’ll cost ya. As I said, even at this point in the top 10, we are already in the big money. This card is currently going for around <strong>$164</strong>.</p> <hr> <h2>Mega Feraligatr ex SIR</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000670688" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000670688"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000670688">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I rather love that this card is getting so much attention. Its 400 attack is hilariously OP, but that applies to the $8 regular ex versio… WAIT, WHAT?! The regular ex is going for EIGHT DOLLARS?! Goddammit, people, get a grip. Those are 50c cards! Anyway, back on track, this is just a joyfully cartoony card that is somehow outselling the likes of <a href="https://www.serebii.net/card/ascendedheroes/279.jpg">Iono’s Bellibolt</a> and the astonishing <a href="https://www.serebii.net/card/ascendedheroes/283.jpg">Mega Hawlucha</a>. I mean, it’s obviously not worth the&nbsp;<strong>$193</strong> it’d cost you to buy right now, but it’s at least a lot of fun!</p> <hr> <h2>Lillie’s Clefairy ex SIR</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000670690" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000670690"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000670690">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Here’s your creepy underage waifu card for the set. Beautiful art, but given no one usually gives a shit about Clefairy you know this isn’t fetching&nbsp;<strong>$247</strong> based on it’s strength against Dragon-type opponent Pokémon.</p>

 <hr> <h2>Team Rockets’s Mewtwo ex SIR</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000670691" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000670691"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000670691">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I’m delighted people are loving this card so much, but it’s doing nothing for me. Look closely and you can see the detail, but sit back and it just seems such a bland design to me. Still, it’s Giovanni and Mewtwo, and that’s enough for most to smash open their piggybanks. Although it’d have to be a very big piggy, given this costs <strong>$336</strong>. And yeah, you’re right: these prices&nbsp;<em>are</em> jumping up by astonishing amounts.</p> <hr> <h2>Pikachu ex 277 SIR</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000670692" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000670692"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000670692">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Oh my gosh I love this card so much. It’s just unburdened joy in pink and yellow, as well as being the most adorable pastiche of the overly serious nature of the terastalized Pokémon we saw in Scarlet &amp; Violet cards, the splendid work of artist James Turner. It also packs a punch with a 300 attack, and the ability to survive a single knock-out hit from an opponent. You’ll want four of these in your deck, right?! And they’re only <strong>$364</strong> each! (And that’s not even close to how expensive this same card is about to get…)</p>

 <hr> <h2>Mega Dragonite ex Gold</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000670694" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000670694"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000670694">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I was very surprised when the reintroduction of gold cards caused such clamor toward the end of last year. They had very much gone out of favor, and an attempt to reintroduce them during Scarlet &amp; Violet with a garish green-n’-gold design was a massive flop. It is notable that the new gold prints are far better than we’ve seen before, and the illustration above does not do them justice. The texturing and holo effect is really something, making them look like something truly special compared to the rest of the cards. And yet, here’s Dragonite—the mascot for Ascended Heroes—stuck down in fifth. Obviously I’m not suggesting it’s not doing well—it will cost you a mindblowing&nbsp;<strong>$458</strong>—but it’s still interesting that it’s significantly behind the far more colorful and joyous SIR Dragonite that’s yet to come.</p> <hr> <h2>Pikachu ex 276 SIR</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000670695" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000670695"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000670695">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I’m not certain, and please let me know if I’m wrong, but I think this might be the first time the same Pokémon has had two different SIRs in the same set. Of course, if anyone’s going to get that, it’s Pikachu, and it’s such a pleasure that it’s in two such lovely cards. We have the YIPPEE Pikachu a couple of spots above, and the UH-OH Pikachu here. This one’s by an artist brand new to the TCG, called booota, and if this is the standard I can’t wait to see what’s next. Oh yeah, the price:&nbsp;<strong>$516</strong>. Yikes.</p> <hr> <h2>Mega Dragonite ex SIR</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000670698" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000670698"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000670698">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Oh what a thing of beauty. Yes, Mega Dragonite is ridiculous with those wings coming out of its head (god, imagine the pain of flying), but it looks resplendent here, and even better for being surrounded by Dragonair in that swirling background. Masterful work by the reliable DOM. The only issue being, if you wanted one, you’d have to give up eating for a month and pay&nbsp;<strong>$564</strong>.</p>

 <hr> <h2>Mega Charizard Y ex Gold</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000670687" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000670687"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000670687">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Yup, they snuck a Charizard into the Dragonite-themed set, just to make things even more unimaginably stupid. And then they made it so rare that it guaranteed the set to be even more valuable to scalpers than any before. The solution to this insanity? Print more of the most collectible cards, so regular people have a greater incentive to buy packs, but the resale market is flattened by over-population. TPCi isn’t making a cent from any of these resales, so what exactly does it have to lose by addressing this problem?</p> <p>Anyhow, it isn’t doing anything to help, and that’s why this card will cost you an eye-watering <strong>$638</strong> pack fresh.</p> <hr> <h2>Mega Gengar ex SIR</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000670702" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000670702"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000670702">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Poor old Dragonite. Not only does it get usurped by the random inclusion of a Charizard in its own set, but then it gets shoved aside by the ever-mean Gengar. This beautiful, stormy card has blown the top off the market, <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-ascendant-heroes-mega-gengar-ex-2000664572">at one point selling for as much as $1300</a>. Things have somewhat calmed down over the last couple of weeks, but the price is still out there. Right now, before things hopefully stabilize with the addition of more population with February 20’s new releases, this card is still fetching <strong>$830 </strong>on average.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/people-of-note-preview-turns-music-genres-into-rpg-mechanics-and-its-got-me-tuned-in</link>
            <guid>1439602</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">As someone who grew up playing music and turn-based RPGs, People of Note seems like a game made in a lab and specifically targeted at me. It's a rhythm-based RPG where genres of music dictate its societies and timing inputs determine the effectiveness of your abilities. And the way it blends its soundtrack throughout the world and battle is one of its most interesting aspects, and for how it sets the tone for its atmosphere and combat mechanics. These are fantastic ideas I caught glimpses of in a hands-on preview build that featured an early section of the campaign, but the thing I'm still hung up on is how much it's caught up in this cheesy twee attitude that's a bit tough to buy into. As is the case with several RPGs, however, a short snippet isn't going to paint the whole picture.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The demo I played (which is available now) drops you into Durandis, a mountainous region that's home to several genres of rock music. You have the metalheads living separately from the punk rockers who despise grunge kids in a way that's very reminiscent of how we formed cliques in middle school based on music and the fashion that came with it. It's corny for sure, but that's the idea it's going for. As the pop singer and lead protagonist Cadence, she still has a lot to learn about the world of music, and so she familiarizes herself with these genres along the way. Shortly after you arrive, Durandis is attacked by a faction of old-timey Western musicians called The Homestead – for what reason, I'm not entirely sure, but it explains how divisive music tribalism harms its world known as Note.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Although the music itself didn't strike a chord with me, I appreciate how it mixes genres throughout. Going into the grunge part of town plays a riff on Nirvana's "Smells Like Teen Spirit" while the punk section picks up the tempo while using melodic octave chord progressions. When fighting the wild west-coded invaders, an uptempo folk tune plays as the battle theme, but a pop mix blends pretty seamlessly into the same underlying song when the turn order goes into a pop phase and the same goes for a classic rock phase – there's a mechanical reason for this, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When it switches to a certain music genre during a turn, the song will shift accordingly and this powers up party members who represent that specific style. Cadence's attacks will hit harder during a pop phase while the washed-up guitarist Fret gets a boost in his abilities in a rock phase. It's neat how this works, but adds a strategic layer to who you tee up for big hits as you line it up for the best turn possible. People of Note includes mechanics like timing-based inputs to maximize effectiveness of attacks and abilities, which many more are now familiar with thanks to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, and I'm happy to see this trend continue because I enjoy the active element it brings to turn-based battles.</p><p>I need that story and its characters to grip me at some point, because that's what great RPGs are often remembered for.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">One thing I wish People of Note was better about in this regard was syncing up those inputs to the backing track, or making the battle themes punchier to accentuate on-beat cues for those button prompts. At least in this early hour-plus, the visual indicators aren't quite as clear and the audible feedback wasn't really felt; not to keep invoking Clair Obscur's name, but for a non-rhythm game, it was very good about creating "beats" when executing attacks or dodging/parrying enemies through visuals and sound cues. Perhaps more time with People of Note and getting deeper into the mechanics will let these kinds of features shine more, so it's something I'm paying attention to when the time comes to play the final version.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I only played with two characters (Cadence and Fret) in my party, yet I still got a good feel for how party composition and builds are important to winning tougher battles. You collect Songstones to modify their perks and can customize characters' movesets, and I had Cadence as my heavy hitter while Fret was more of a support role with healing and feeding BP (beat points, the resource needed to use abilities). Still, with the genre phases throughout a battle, I needed them to remain versatile. That's also because you can do some interesting things with turn order – the time signature at the bottom of screen telegraphs how the turn can play out, and who you use and in those specific open measures is up to you. For example, against the last demo boss Freq, I had three open measures and I would use Fret to boost Cadence's BP to then use her powerful Instant Hit attack, and then use the third turn to either heal or defend depending on the situation. Enemies can also permanently modify specific measures in the fight, like how Freq put a half-damage debuff on all attacks used in first measures. This is where I think People of Note can really differentiate itself from other combat systems and go from a novel music-based RPG to a uniquely tactical one.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">People of Note - Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A nice feature that makes dungeon crawling smooth is that you recover HP after each fight, and since BP is built within battles themselves, you don't have to manage some sort of magic resource like MP or mana. Each combat encounter is a turn-based puzzle to figure out on its own. It's more appreciated considering that dungeons in People of Note have actual puzzles to solve, which break up the pace; in the playable demo, there's a series of rooms with light beams you need to align and reflect off mirrors to unlock doors. It's not exactly noteworthy as we've seen these kinds of challenges many-a-time, so it's also appreciated that there aren't random encounters and all battles thus far clearly delineated in the overworld.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">By no means does People of Note seem like a high-budget project, but it's hard to overlook the ways in which its production values sometimes undercut what it's trying to portray. Dialogue scenarios are nearly all still portraits with overlaid text boxes, which would be fine if its writing was sharp enough to make said dialogue intriguing. As a frequenter of visual novels, it's par for the course. However, it's hard to get a sense of the goings-on for this style of game. Some of the enemy attack animations are quite odd, too, but some of the abilities you have, like the limit-break style Mash Up attack where party members attack simultaneously, add some much-needed spectacle in the rare moments you get to use them. Even if I think the scene itself has that cheesy twee tone I'm not too fond of, there's a fully animated scene in the demo when Cadence recruits Fret that does showcase its visual chops with a musical number to flex the team's musicality.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There's plenty of corny media I've enjoyed, some of which just needed time to establish itself before shining. So this isn't to say I'm dismissive of People of Note, but it's for hoping that it comes around and embraces that attitude in an endearing way. The drama between Fret and former bandmate Freq in the demo's story bits is quite charming for its play on familiar music industry tropes, and the larger idea of finding unity in blending musical genres (possibly realizing that we're not all the different) could be an enticing theme to bring it all together. I just hope it can transcend the incessant need to be quirky and at least be clever in ways that elevate its world and story instead of going for simple references for the sake of it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For my part, I was immediately drawn to the concept for People of Note, as a lifelong musician (of sorts) and lover of rhythm games; Hatsune Miku: Project Diva, Dance Dance Revolution, and the like. And as an RPG sicko, I've seen a lot of innovation in the genre coming out of smaller-scale games and indie spaces in recent years. People of Note does remind me of last year's Fretless and 2023's Thirsty Suitors in its approach as well, so I hope it can hit those similar highs in its own ways.</p><span data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><section data-cy="user-list-embed"><span><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Michael Higham's Top 10 Favorite RPGs of All Time</h3></p><span><a href="https://www.ign.com/playlist/michaelhigham/lists/michael-highams-top-10-favorite-rpgs-of-all-time" sx="[object Object]" data-cy="see-all-btn" title="View All Games">See All</a></span></span></section></span><p data-cy="paragraph">People of Note, so far, clearly seems like something that can speak to both the musically inclined and turn-based enjoyers, so it has promise for sure. It's also got a great cast of voice actors we've heard in other RPGs and animation projects and a neat combat system to potentially set itself apart from its contemporaries. But I need that story and its characters to grip me at some point, because that's what great RPGs are often remembered for. I'll find out for sure when People of Note launches on April 7 on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch 2, and PC – and you can try it for yourself with the demo that's out now.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/people-of-note-preview-turns-music-genres-into-rpg-mechanics-and-its-got-me-tuned-in]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/this-switch-2-grip-might-be-the-ultimate-way-to-play-gamecube-games-in-handheld</link>
            <guid>1439563</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="4e70039ba7b4f"><a title="GameCube Grip Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4e70039ba7b4f/gamecube-grip-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo launched its dedicated GameCube NSO pad alongside the Switch 2 last year, undoubtedly providing the best experience for docked play. However, much like the N64 pad before it, the controller doesn't do much to help with handheld play, where the Joy-Con 2 button layouts simply can't capture the <em>feel</em> of the original hardware.</p>
<p>Enter abxylute's N9C, a Switch 2 grip that launched on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1932181238/abxylute-n9-n6-full-size-controller-for-nintendo-switch-2?ref=7yzisn">Kickstarter</a> today and was almost immediately fully funded, which looks as close as we'll ever get to a GameCube pad built for handheld play.</p>
<p>Similar to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/crkd-nitro-deck-for-nintendo-switch-almost-great-but-with-one-major-flaw">CRKD's Nitro Deck range</a>, this is a grip that sits around the Switch 2 screen, substituting the usual Joy-Con placement for one half of the 'split' pad. It attaches via the console's bottom USB-C port to keep the button inputs super snappy, boasts swappable joystick gates for both 8-way and circular options, supports gyro controls <em>and</em> has four extra buttons on the back for you to remap as you please.</p>
<p>Most importantly, however, it nails the look of the GameCube pad. Sure, anything in that shade of purple is bound to bring the nostalgia, and the d-pad and stick tops are a <em>little</em> off from the original design (if we're really being picky), but it's difficult to knock that face button placement when we start to think about the prospect of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker">Wind Waker</a> on the go.</p>

<p>If those violet tones are enough of a throwback for you, and you can do away with the GC's asymmetrical button layout, abxylute is also launching its N6 grip for a slightly more conventional look. This one packs in hall-effect joysticks, front-facing speakers, remappable buttons, gyro support and more. It might not be quite as nostalgic as the N9C offering, but it certainly looks comfier for extended handheld play sessions than the standard Joy-Con setup.</p>
<p>This one comes in either black or purple colourways, so you can choose how much of a throwback you want.</p>

<p>As we mentioned, both grips are only up for Kickstarter support at the time of writing, though early backers will have access to "a Super Early Bird price before full retail availability". You can pledge $618 HKD (around £59 / $79) for one of the N6 grips with an expected April 2026 delivery, or $696 HKD (roughly £66 / $89) for a N9C unit with an estimated June delivery during this early period</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Frontier Legends, an Open World Survival Western Game, Launches Early Access This Spring (and Releases Demo This Weekend)]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/frontier-legends-open-world-survival-western-game-launches-early-access-this-spring/</link>
            <guid>1439560</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today, Canadian developer <strong>Neojac Entertainment</strong> (known for the games <strong>Junk Survivor</strong> and <strong>Athos</strong>) announced that its next game, <strong>Frontier Legends</strong>, will debut this Spring on Early Access.</p>



<p>As you could probably guess from the title, <strong>it is a Western game</strong>, and also an open world title with survival and adventure elements. <strong>It casts players as a greenhorn settler</strong> fresh off the train, dropped into the rugged and unforgiving American West <strong>with nothing but ambition and a will to survive</strong>. Players can then become a hunter tracking game through dense wilderness, a trader running goods between settlements, a lawman keeping order on dusty streets, or even a bandit carving out a criminal empire, according to Neojac.</p>



<p>The game blends fast-paced survival mechanics with crafting, exploration, and base-building in an open world that features staples like dynamic weather, day-night cycles, and unscripted NPC encounters.<strong> One of the most ambitious features of Frontier Legends is its settlement-building system</strong>: players can grow their starting camp into a <strong>fully functioning frontier town</strong>, recruiting NPC settlers and assigning them roles in farming, crafting, gathering, and defense. The settlement's health reflects the player's leadership, so a well-managed town thrives, while a neglected one risks crumbling under the pressure of the frontier's dangers.</p>



<p><strong>Exploration is said to be central to the game's experience</strong>. Players will be able to venture beyond their settlements to discover ancient ruins, forgotten camps, legendary treasures, and hidden secrets scattered across the game world. There's also <strong>taming of wild horses</strong>, with each horse sporting unique attributes that make them valuable companions for travel, combat, and survival.</p>



<p>The game also supports <strong>cooperative and competitive multiplayer</strong>, though Neojac hasn't yet clarified how many players can play simultaneously. Anyway, <strong>players can team up to trade, build, and endure the frontier together</strong>, or take the darker path of raiding, betraying, and fighting rivals for dominance. Community events and seasonal challenges are planned to offer ongoing rewards and recognition.</p>

<p>If this overview has made you interested in Frontier Legends, you may be happy to hear that Neojac <strong>is going to release a demo for the imminent Steam Horse Fest</strong>, which begins tomorrow and lasts through February 23.  The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3032150/Frontier_Legends/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam page</a> also includes the minimum and recommended system requirements, which you'll find below.</p>

            <p>
I’ve been shying away from The Killing Stone because it’s a deckbuilding card battler, and we do get a lot of emails about those. The game launches into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/store.steampowered.com/app/2781470/The_Killing_Stone">Steam early access</a> today, so it’s time to have a proper gander. Ho now! This is a deckbuilding card battler… set in a mansion somewhere in the Arctic during the 17th century… created by Question Games, developers of ‘unfinished game’ game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-magic-circle">The Magic Circle</a> and weird suburbia sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-blackout-club">The Blackout Club</a>. Yes, the same Question who were founded by people who worked on Bioshock, Thief and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a>.
</p>
<p>
 What’s more, The Killing Stone reminds me of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/inscryption">Inscryption</a>, in that it appears to be divided between a hellish table-top game and hellish goings-on in the world around that table-top game. To be specific, you’re playing that table-top game against a series of demons, with the souls of the cursed Svangård family hanging in the balance. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Between rounds, you explore the mansion in first person and chat to  the Svangårds, together with various animal familiars. Broadly, you’re trying to figure out what happened to your old mate Mariken, who appears to be responsible for the whole mess. The writing, meanwhile, comes in two dialects - “period 17th century English”, and “a more modern prose”, with full text and voice-acting for each.
</p>
<p>
This is… a lot! I wonder if I’ve hitherto avoided reading about The Killing Stone because my third eye picked up on the sheer occult density of the thing, and steered my conscious mind away. Alas, it is too late for me. And probably you, if you've read this far.

<p>
The early access build includes three “primary story acts”, each focussing on one Svangård family member and an associated deck of cards, three demon lords to play against, and a bunch of optional ritual missions, encompassing 6-8 hours of playtime. 
</p><p>
“As development continues, we plan to add translations into more languages, more story, expand the voice acting, and develop an even more complex mystery for you to unravel,” Question write on Steam. “This element in particular is where your feedback will be crucial, but we want to hear about everything, so be sure to join us on Discord where you’ll find some of the team deep in their own Occult rituals (aka game development).” Bless.
</p>
<p>
“One of 1.0’s biggest features will be our planned endgame content, The Reckoning, which we will have more information about soon,” the post continues, signing off with a note that “The Killing Stone is the game we’ve always wanted to make”. They’re planning to reach 1.0 in around six months. 
</p>
<p>
What do you reckon, then? I’m quite sold on what I’ve read, but I was similarly sold on The Blackout Club, which proved a bit creaky and lumpish in practice. Here is how young master Nic Reuben (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-blackout-club-review">summarised that game in 2019</a>: “Just like a secret clubhouse, it’s likely to lose its allure if you spend all your time there - but it’s exciting as hell to to visit in a snatched moment.”
