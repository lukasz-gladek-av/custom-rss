            <p>Construct 'n' destruct sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/besiege">Besiege</a> recently got a splashy expansion in The Splintered Sea, which Nic enjoyed a lot in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/besiege-splintered-sea-review">his review</a> while calling it compact, small and brisk. Apparently Nic wasn't alone in this opinion: its developers now say they're working on a free update that will expand the expansion and make its campaign 50% longer.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The update will add five new levels to The Splintered Sea and will release on July 22nd.
</p>
<p>One of the levels will feature a tentacle beast that can rip apart your vessels, as seen in one of the previous Splintered Sea trailers. Another will challenge your steering, by having you build a small ship you need to guide through a series of closing gates. Apparently another will feature a battle against a swarm of sharks.
</p>
<p>"We’ve also been experimenting with the idea of adding additional challenges to levels that, while not required for completion, can offer a much greater test of your ability," says <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/346010/view/4237406000171593409">the announcement</a>. The offered example is a series of crates the player can choose to smash through while still completing a level within the time limit.
</p>
<p>It's nice to see Spiderling Studios taking feedback onboard and working to make the expansion more substantial - particualrly because it wasn't at all bad in the first place, and it would have been easy to leave it as it was. Aside from those dinkonyms above, Nic already referred to it as "an awesome and incredibly complex and worthwhile thing."</p>

It’s boring, plot points aren’t explained properly, and it is by and large unimportant, or so go the criticisms. Of course, what those complaints don’t tell you is that a lot of the people behind them are also skipping through large swaths of the story. It’s not a new problem to <em>Final Fantasy 14</em>, but it is one that <em>Dawntrail </em>is bringing back to the forefront. Some <em>Final Fantasy 14</em> players have a problem of their own, and it’s a lack of willingness to engage with the game’s methodical storytelling in its entirety. - Willa Rowe <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-players-need-to-read-a-book-1851573545&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-players-need-to-read-a-book-1851573545">Read More</a></span></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9e37b9f3aee44b9cc02fcfde6b4c5313" data-recommend-id="image://9e37b9f3aee44b9cc02fcfde6b4c5313" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A PS5 and PS4 sit in front of a colorful background.

<p>While the Descendants themselves steal the show, with their unique abilities and appearances, it’s the weapons that will help push you to new heights. If your primary rifle is weak, you won’t be able to push end-game content. Well, here is where to get new weapons in The First Descendant!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-new-guns-in-the-first-descendant">How to Get New Guns in The First Descendant</h2>



<p>There are multiple ways to acquire new weapons in The First Descendant. You can unlock powerful guns via the game’s battle pass, earn them by completing missions and defeating bosses out in the world, and by purchasing guns and other equipment from Deslin on Albion.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Deslin is the easiest way to acquire new weapons in the game. He sits just down the staircase leading to the left-hand (when looking at the map) portion of Albion. You can’t miss him, as he’s marked with an icon of two crossed rifles and his odd appearance. He wears modified welding goggles and a pilot’s cap.</p>



<p>While the weapons he sells prove inexpensive and readily available, you’ll likely visit him to buy Reactors. You’re more likely to unlock new weapons by completing missions out in the world. They’re bite-size content that rewards you after a few minutes of combat.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-improve-your-weapons-in-the-first-descendant">How to Improve Your Weapons in The First Descendant</h2>



<p>The First Descendant features a system in which the more you use a weapon, the more powerful it can become. You earn <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/weapon-proficiency-first-descendant-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Proficiency XP</a> for every kill and mission you complete, and as your weapon levels, it unlocks Module slots. You absolutely want to slot Modules into your weapon, as they alter the gun’s fire rate, damage type, critical hit chance, and more.</p>



<p>As such, even if you find an end-game weapon that’s more powerful than anything you’ve used previously, you’ll want to grind out missions and enemy kills to upgrade it further!</p>

<p>After you pick up a new weapon, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-emote-in-the-first-descendant/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learn to use the emote wheel</a> to show it off!

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/what-does-weapon-proficiency-do-in-the-first-descendant-%E2%80%93-answered.920418/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/weapon-proficiency-first-descendant-answered/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>The first time you unlock a new weapon and explore the game’s equipment and inventory system, you’ll note your gun has an orange bar beneath its stats. This bar indicates its Weapon Proficiency level, and you can’t click it or hover over it, making it a mystery. So, what does Weapon Proficiency do in The First Descendant?</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-weapon-proficiency-in-the-first-descendant">What is Weapon Proficiency in The First Descendant?</h2>



<p>The game’s Weapon Proficiency system directly affects how powerful your weapon will become as you progress through the game. It’s your skill level with each unique weapon in the game, and the higher the level, the more top-tier Modules you can equip to your gun in The First Descendant.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s a way to increase your power level further upon unlocking one of the game’s best weapons—or a favorite weapon that you don’t want to let go of—to push end-game content. </p>



<p>So, why do you need more Modules on your weapon? Think of Modules in The First Descendant like Gems in an RPG. They alter the effects and affixes of your gun with additional damage, better accuracy, and improved critical hit rate chances. Some even add elemental damage to your bullets, like Fire.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-increase-your-weapon-proficiency">How to Increase Your Weapon Proficiency</h2>



<p>There’s only one way to increase your Weapon Proficiency in The First Descendant. You must equip and use the gun in the field. The more you use a weapon, the more Proficiency XP you earn.</p>



<p>Once you complete a mission out in the game’s various zones, you’ll receive a summary of how much Proficiency XP you earned during the quest.</p>



<p>It’s best to occasionally swap weapons to ensure none fall behind the curve!</p>



<hr>



<p>While you’re grinding Proficiency XP, why not take a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-descendant-story-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deep dive into the game’s story</a>?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/satisfactory-finally-leaves-early-access-on-september-10/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Coffee Stain's first-person open world factory building game Satisfactory finally has a 1.0 launch date, over four years after its debut in early access (<a href="https://wccftech.com/satisfactory-massive-hit-epic-games-store/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">originally on the Epic Games Store</a>).</p>
<p>The Swedish development team, also known for the Goat Simulator franchise, <a href="https://x.com/SatisfactoryAF/status/1809241796146331846" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a September 10 PC release date. They also detailed several key changes that will be introduced with the launch version, starting with many changes to the resource modes available on the world map.</p>
<p>According to Coffee Stain, most node reductions have been made in the Northern Forest to encourage expansion from there as players progress into the later stages of the game. At the same time, nodes have been scattered throughout the map, placed where it makes geographical sense to achieve a more even resource distribution. The main materials addressed are Caterium, Sulfur, and Quartz.</p>
<p>In addition, Iron, Copper, and Limestone nodes and water Geysers have been spread across the map to help with basic resource income wherever you build a factory. Coal has also seen changes, with a number of them added in close proximity to The Abyss while also being removed in a few spots around the map.</p>
<p><iframe title="Satisfactory Announcement" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/febekpSoEbA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Changes to recipe costs will be made in Satisfactory 1.0 to foster smoother transitions between phases and levels, especially in the later stages of the game. Requirements are generally being relaxed; for example, Programmable Splitters will use AI Limiters and Geothermal Generators will use Highspeed Connectors, whereas both used to be made through Supercomputers.</p>
<p>Critically, Coffee Stain claims to have made major optimization strides when it comes to stuttering and memory requirements, especially for textures. The game, which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5s-lumen-completely-transforms-the-visuals-of-satisfactory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upgraded to Unreal Engine 5 last year</a> with great visual benefits, has now been brought up to version 5.3 of Epic's engine. VRAM, NVIDIA DLSS/ AMD FSR, shadow rendering, level streaming, and actors in the world have all been optimized. Moreover, foliage will no longer be destroyed by vehicles as players drive through it, which not only saves a ton of computing power but also looks a lot better, according to the developers. Last but not least, dedicated servers won't be considered experimental anymore and have had a ton of bugs fixed.</p>
<p>These are just the highlights of Satisfactory Update 1.0. More detailed notes will be published closer to the September 10 launch.</p>

		<p>Bandai Namco has revealed BLEACH Rebirth of Souls for PC, PS5, PS4, and Xbox Series X|S. A release date has not been confirmed. The upcoming game will feature an original story for BLEACH, instead of adapting a story from previous arcs. BLEACH Rebirth of Souls is designed as an arena fighter, with characters from the series clashing in combat. Each character possesses unique abilities for use in battle, where a single strike can end a fight.</p>
<p><iframe title="BLEACH Rebirth of Souls – Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B0XoOx8kTEk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In&nbsp;BLEACH Rebirth of Souls, the more dire the circumstances, the greater character’s power can grow. In the middle of each conflict, the momentum can shift as characters can unleash powerful attacks the closer they get to being defeated. This state reveals new shapes and swords to allow&nbsp; players to snatch triumph from the jaws of defeat.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2011/08/22/review-bleach-soul-resurreccion/">Bleach: Soul Resurrección Review</a></h2>
<p>The last Bleach game we appeared to have reviewed was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2011/08/22/review-bleach-soul-resurreccion/">Bleach: Soul Resurrección</a>, way back in 2011. At the time, Dan said,<em> “The story also hasn’t been handled particularly well. Having just a wall of text at the start of a level is actually quite deflating, and rather than pumping up the player for a bit of carnage it has the opposite effect. If the story had been fleshed out then the score would have been a fair bit higher. Overall it’s a fun game, but also a real missed opportunity.”</em></p>

			<p>A new Resident Evil Village comparison video shared a few hours ago highlights the visual improvements the <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-4-village-path-tracing/">path tracing mod released earlier this year</a> for all entries in the series powered by the RE Engine brings to the game.</p>
<p>The comparison video put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC">MxBenchmarkPC</a> highlights how the biggest improvements the mod brings are global illumination and shadows improvements. The mod also enhances RT reflections by adding more reflective surfaces to the game. Unfortunately, things aren't perfect all the time, as the mod doesn't feature any denoiser, resulting in worse image quality at resolutions lower than 4K, and not every sequence in the game looks good, which is not surprising at all, considering the game wasn't built with path tracing in mind.</p>
<p><iframe title="Resident Evil Village Path Tracing Mod vs Ray Tracing - Graphics/Performance Comparison | RTX 4080" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7U4fm0lXkks?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Despite a setting and premise that's markedly different from the rest of the series, Resident Evil Village manages to be among the best entries in CAPCOM's survival horror series. This is thanks to an excellent story, polished presentation, and solid core mechanics, as Nathan highlighted in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-village-horror-greatest-hits/">review</a>.</p>
<p>Resident Evil Village is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One. The game launched late last year for certain <a href="https://wccftech.com/m2-ipad-pro-can-run-resident-evil-village-at-max-visual-settings/">iPhone and iPad models.</a></p>

		<p>Hot off the release of The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak, NIS America has revealed that The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak II is coming in early 2025 for PC, PS5, PS4, and Switch. Both Agnes Claudel and Van Arkride return as the main characters, with the game location remaining as the Claudel Republic.</p>
<p><iframe title="Trails through Daybreak II -  Announcement Trailer (Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, PC)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sI7TgkoXqMk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The description for The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak II says, <em>“One day, a shocking series of murders set the wheels of fate into motion once again. Chaos looming on the horizon, the spriggan Van Arkride receives an unexpected visitor. Who is behind the murders, and what is their goal? Time may be the only key to unlocking the secrets lurking beneath the shadows… “</em></p>

<p>In our The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak review, Miguel said, <em>“The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak is the spark that this series needed, and an incredible new chapter for such an iconic franchise. The shift in tone for the story and the addictive dual-mode combat had me hooked from beginning to end. If you play any game in this series, make it this one.”</em></p>

			<p><a href="https://forums.exputer.com/threads/exclusive-final-fantasy-xiv-mobile-is-in-development.237/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to leaker Kurakasis</a>, Final Fantasy XIV Mobile is in development. This is reportedly part of the strategic partnership <a href="https://wccftech.com/square-enix-tencent-form-partnership/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signed</a> by Square Enix and Tencent around six years ago.</p>
<p>Back then, the press release explained:</p>
<p><em>Square Enix Group will be accelerating these business development efforts to enhance its content services worldwide through this strategic alliance with Tencent Group. Outcomes of this newly created alliance include the establishment of a joint-venture company, co-development of AAA titles based on new intellectual properties, the licensing of existing intellectual properties, and more.</em></p>
<p>So far, no game project borne out of this partnership made it to market. An unannounced Nier mobile game was canceled in December 2023 (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/tencent-axes-square-enix-nier-mobile-game-it-hunts-new-hit-sources-2024-02-02/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as reported by Reuters</a>) as the developers failed to find the right monetization model for such a high-cost project.</p>
<p>Needless to say, a full port of the gargantuan Final Fantasy XIV MMORPG may prove to be even more problematic in that regard. To this day, it is one of the few games in the genre that mandates a subscription to play; such a business model is unlikely to find success in the mobile space.</p>
<p>We'll have to see if this project, unlike Nier's, ever sees the light of day. Meanwhile, Square Enix has just released the fifth Final Fantasy XIV expansion, <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-launches-on-july-2-says-square-enix/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dawntrail</a>. Following the end of the previous 10-year-long storyline, adventurers are now headed to a brand new continent, Tural, inspired by real-life Southeast Asia and Latin America.</p>
<p>So far, the reception has been a bit worse than expected. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2649240/FINAL_FANTASY_XIV_Dawntrail/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">On Steam</a>, only 63% of the 2,147 user reviews published to date are positive. On the other hand, Final Fantasy XIV Producer and Director Naoki Yoshida <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/e2da42164b4e6c9967ebb2e41d6321a515d36909" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that the game registered a record number of players not seen since the re-launch of A Realm Reborn in 2013. Yoshida-san also outlined some of the planned job adjustments coming in future updates for Monk, Astrologian, Viper, Black Mage, Tank, Samurai, Red Mage, and Pictomancer.</p>
<p>In other news, Naoki Yoshida recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-final-fantasy-xiv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spoke</a> about the possibility of Final Fantasy XIV launching on the next Nintendo console. He said that could happen, but it may be years before such a release takes place.</p>

			<p>While we wait for 2K and Cloud Chamber's <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-4-in-development-since-2015/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BioShock 4</a>, a stunning new graphical showcase of 2010's BioShock 2 has been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC2Ttbm8m8I" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a>.</p>
<p>Created by German YouTuber 'Digital Dreams', this new showcase shows 2K's Bioshock 2 running in 8K resolution at 60FPS on an NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU combined with an AMD Ryzen 9 7950x CPU. For this showcase, the YouTuber used '<a href="https://www.patreon.com/NiceGuy147" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CompleteRT</a>' Ray Tracing ReShade shader that adds Ray Traced Diffuse Illumination as well as Ray Traced Reflections. "<em>One of the most advanced&nbsp;<strong>Screen space Ray Tracing</strong> Shaders, lets you add [Global illumination], [Ambient Occlusion], Matte, and Glossy Reflections to your favorite games using Reshade</em>", the description of this Ray Tracing shader reads.</p>
<p>As expected on this setup, the game runs on the highest-possible settings, and the results are pretty spectacular, especially for a 14-year-old title - Rapture has never looked this great. Check out the new BioShock 2 showcase below and judge for yourself:</p>
<p><iframe title="[8K60] Bioshock 2 - CompleteRT -  ultra Settings BeyondallLimits - ULTRA GRAPHICS SHOWCASE" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tC2Ttbm8m8I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Released in 2010 for PC and the available consoles at that time, the PS3 and Xbox 360, BioShock 2 is considered a worthy sequel to 2007's BioShock. Some even consider the sequel better than the 2007 original due to the improved gameplay and combat. "BioShock represented a watershed moment in the gaming industry when it illustrated that games, like feature films, can be viewed as art - both in art design and in the rich depth of the narrative," Christoph Hartmann, then president of 2K said in 2010. “Most importantly, the media are stating what we’ve known all along; that whether or not you’ve played the original, BioShock 2 is a worthy successor to one of the best games of all time that should not be missed.”</p>
<p>As said, 2K and developer Cloud Chamber are currently actively working on BioShock 4 with Cloud Chamber r<a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-team-ramps-up-recruitment-with-30-job-offers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ecently looking for numerous new team players in order to ramp up development on the game</a>. Meanwhile, the creator of the original BioShock, Ken Levine, is currently working on <a href="https://wccftech.com/judas-is-finally-unveiled-by-bioshock-creator-ken-levine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Judas</a> with his studio <span>Ghost Story Games.</span></p>

<p>The Call of Duty League’s ‘regular season’ has now wrapped up and players are preparing to make it big on the stage at COD Champs in Texas later this month. It has been a tough year for many involved, with some teams putting up an abysmal performance that saw loss-streak records broken dramatically, and for others, it has been a jubilant season filled with success. </p>



<p>However, despite the ups and downs, the drama and the clutch moments, viewership for the Call of Duty League has dropped around 29% since 2023.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-on-the-way-down">On The Way Down</h2>



<p>In a string of <a href="https://escharts.com/news/cdl-2024-regular-season-recap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">statistics revealed by escharts.com</a>, it was highlighted that viewership during this year’s CDL regular season tanked by almost a third. The average viewer count dropped by 28.5% while the peak viewer count saw a decline of 26.8% – the airtime remained almost the same, though.</p>



<p>It might seem bizarre to some, but the COD League’s official channel barely managed to retain the strongest market share in terms of viewership. On YouTube, the CDL channel pulled in just 38.6% of viewers, with Scump’s iconic ‘watch parties’ grabbing a whopping 36.8% of the market. At the start of the season, an exclusivity deal threatened the watch parties hosted by Seth ‘Scump’ Abner and other personalities, such as ZooMaa – without them, this year’s viewer count would have collapsed in on itself.</p>



<p>This season’s peak came during the Stage 3 Major between Atlanta FaZe and OpTic Texas, which is considered the El Classico of Call of Duty. In a dramatic showdown, OpTic Texas secured its first trophy in more than 800 days, beating FaZe while a peak count of 335,170 users watched on. The team would later decimate Toronto Ultra to snag the trophy.</p>



<p>With that drop in mind, we now look to COD Champs, which is set to run from July 18 – 21. There’s a $2.2 million prize pool on the line but with viewership going the way it is, how much of an audience will be there to see this season’s champion crowned? </p>

            <title><![CDATA[That New Tarkov Update Has Basically Ruined PvE]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/new-tarkov-update-ruined-pve/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/that-new-tarkov-update-has-basically-ruined-pve.920316/</guid>

<p>Battlestate Games recently deployed a major overhaul to Escape from Tarkov’s PvE platform, making it so that solo players can run the game on their local PC as opposed to a centralised server. It was intended to reduce matching times to mere seconds, and while that box was ticked, the changes introduced a string of problems that are getting up the noses of players worldwide – as if BSG needed more bad publicity.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-they-broke-it">They Broke It</h2>



<p>Along with the ‘offline PvE’ changes came several tweaks to how the game’s ‘player-vs-environment’ AI characters behave, particularly when roaming the map and interacting with loot crates and such. Battlestate applied a serious update that makes them much freer, which immediately means that players are having a tough time predicting their movements. This is where the issues begin – and it’s a long road from there.</p>



<p>Due to new ‘homing AI’ updates, if the computer-controlled enemies know where you are, they’ll descend upon your location with reckless abandon, which just isn’t right. Players are reporting ‘Scavs’ and PMC characters – again, all AI – almost joining forces in an unrealistic way to combat the solo <strong>and terrified </strong>players exploring a little PvE.</p>



<p>There are also reports of PMCs ‘over-spawning’ on maps, with the most extreme claims suggesting that more than double the normal amount of PMCs are appearing in AI form. They’re smarter, more tactical, and less afraid of making a group push towards a player cowering in a corridor somewhere, holding that angle.</p>



<p>Further, the ‘offline PvE’ change seems to have made it tougher for people to run the base game without experiencing issues. On certain maps, frame rate drops are now commonplace, with some players complaining that Escape from Tarkov has ‘become unplayable’. Battlestate Games has promised that further tweaks are inbound to address these issues – as always.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/kien-delayed-22-years/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/game-delayed-for-22-years-has-just-been-released-%E2%80%93-on-gba.920307/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/kien-delayed-22-years/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>It might have slipped through the nets of gamers worldwide, but Kien, a game that entered development in the early 2000s, has just been released on Game Boy Advance. Back in 2002, a group of aspiring developers got to work on Kien, seeking to produce a game for the GBA platform – fast-forward some 22 years and only one of the original developers remains with the project, but he never gave up hope.</p>



<p>From facing financial ruin to balancing game development and marketing while studying at university, Fabio Belsanti from Italy finally crossed the finish line a couple of weeks ago, releasing Kien in physical form for the Game Boy Advance after a 22-year delay.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-that-s-got-to-be-a-record">That’s Got To Be A Record</h2>



<p>Kien is a full-fledged GBA title that sees players assume control of either a fearless warrior or a mystical priestess, fighting through a series of environments on the way to save the planet of Malkut. Here’s the trailer for Kien:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Kien - Official Game Boy Advance Trailer #2 (2024)" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kk0-yXB3Wvw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Belsanti, who was the sole developer left working on the project when it was finally released in June, addressed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/article/2024/jul/04/kein-the-most-delayed-video-game-in-history-released-after-22-years" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">why it felt like the right time</a> to push the game into the market:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I believe we are in a phase similar to the revival of vinyl or cassettes for music – a return to previous, more primitive forms of the medium driven by nostalgia from the generations who lived those eras, and curiosity by those who came after such technology. On a romantic level, the thought of releasing the game on its original console is simply magical. To see Kien come to life on the very platform it was designed for is a dream come true.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The feedback already received on the trailers has been stellar, with retro gaming fans welcoming the arrival of an entirely new game some 15 years after the Game Boy Advance was discontinued. It promises to take them back to days gone by, fuelling their nostalgia-riddled passion for gaming that was likely kickstarted decades ago. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-on-xdefiant-bugs/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-%E2%80%98that%E2%80%99s-okay-you-can-move-on%E2%80%99-if-you-can%E2%80%99t-take-xdefiant%E2%80%99s-bugs.920304/</guid>

<p>This week, XDefiant’s Season One update arrived, bringing about new maps, weapons, and mechanics, along with a series of tweaks, quality-of-life improvements, and of course, new <strong>issues</strong>. It also introduced Ranked, which hasn’t landed well with the majority of the player base on account of it not <strong>feeling </strong>like a Ranked mode.</p>



<p>Shortly after the new update dropped, Ubisoft’s Mark Rubin took to social media to explain why XDefiant is experiencing so many issues, defending the game against those claiming it was released too early and ‘rushed out’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-built-up-from-the-ground-floor">‘Built Up From The Ground Floor’</h2>



<p>XDefiant was released on May 21 to a relatively positive reception, with hundreds of thousands of players pouring onto the platform in the first hours of the game going online. It was a long-awaited arrival that came following months of delays and postponements, so eager players were just happy to finally receive it – and then the teething issues surfaced. </p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/PixelsofMark/status/1809020713954914444" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Speaking candidly on social media</a>, executive producer, Mark Rubin explained why XDefiant’s launch hasn’t been smooth sailing:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>What we have is an engine that has only ever been an MMO. And so all of the infrastructure for an FPS has had to be built up from the ground floor. we are working on developing all new tech in an engine that was designed for something else. That being said the engine is really great but it does require a lot of work and with that work comes a lot of bugs that other engines have already worked out. We’re not a shooter that’s been out for 20 years. If you like what we are trying to do stick around and you’ll see things improve and new features get added. <strong>But if the game isn’t for you that’s ok you can move on.</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>From the horse’s mouth, if you can’t stomach XDefiant’s core issues, then feel free to go away. Plenty of problems have surfaced in the last month and a half, ranging from hit detection to net code and from menu bugs to animation-based issues, and while Ubisoft is working on them, it seems that each major patch just brings more problems to the table. </p>

In this ATLUS Exclusive <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> story version, we would like to introduce more about the narrative and the characters. The registration for digital pre-order and wishlist are open, so please be sure to pre-order or wishlist.</y></p><p>Before we begin I would like to preface just in case that this introduction is limited to the opening section of the story. However, for those who would like to enjoy the story without knowing anything at all, please feel free to end the video here and please look forward to the release of the title.</p><p>Is everyone ready? Now it is time to begin this presentation on the story. We hope you will stay until the end.</p><p><strong>■ Premise of the Story</strong></p><p>The game depicts a story of weaving bonds and becoming a king in a unique setting. The setting is a kingdom in turmoil rocked by a major incident in which the king is assassinated. The protagonist, a young boy, is on a journey with his partner, the fairy Gallica, to save a cursed prince. However, in the midst of all this an unprecedented election magic is invoked. The protagonist is swept into this unprecedented upheaval and ends up embarking on a journey around the world. In this exclusive showcase, let me share with you the beginning part of the story explaining why the protagonist decides to pursue the throne and some details on the allies who will support him.</p><p><strong>Monsters Called “Humans”</strong></p><p>First of all, what threats are the people of this world under? I would like to talk about the biggest cause for this, the monsters known as “humans.”</p><p>In the setting for <em>Metaphor</em>, the atmosphere is filled with particles of anxiety created by people’s feelings of anxiety. This is the source of the magic of this world, which impacts the world in various ways. The particles called “magla” are sucked up and collected by a special device in the city. It is widely known in this world, for example, as a source of funding for this kingdom. In recent years, the amount of magma has increased and monsters have arisen in response. The most prominent example of this is the monster known as “human.”</p><p>The design of the human was inspired by the many fantastic paintings left behind by the medieval artist Hieronymus Bosch. The mysterious creatures in Bosch’s paintings are sometimes described as the world’s first depiction of monsters or fantasy creatures. <em>Metaphor</em> has invited guest artists such as Koda Kazuma for background concept art, Ikuto Yamashita for the Gauntlet Runner designs, and Yuji Himukai for some Archetype designs. For this title, Hieronymus Bosch can be seen as the fourth great guest artist to join, lending us his hand. The protagonists will meet people suffering from these monstrous threats, and their journey will be filled with turbulence. N</p><p><strong>World Affairs</strong></p><p>Now let’s talk about what sort of situation this world is in. The story takes place in the “United Kingdom of Euchronia,” a country that was originally divided into three separate countries that were then annexed into one. However, the power of the royal family has already waned and a cadre of officials from the state religion known as “Sanctism” now effectively rule the country. At the top of the list is Sanctifex Forden. The aging king had no heir, and many of the people were beginning to look to the moderate Forden as their next leader to avoid political instability. On the other hand, there are a few who do not agree with Forden and the Sanctist vision.</p><p>The person leading the charge on that end is a man named Louis, who at a young age became a powerful military elite. Louis is a man who declares that the kingdom has become infested with humans because of the anxiety brought about by the king and Sanctism, and he seeks to protect the weak who follow him from the monsters by force of arms. He is also a charismatic figure with a growing number of enthusiastic sympathizers in various locations. The story of <em>Metaphor</em> opens with a shocking scene in which Louis assassinates the king with his own hands. In fact, Louis is a great traitor who not only killed the king, but also plotted the assassination of the prince who was heir to the throne. Now that the king has been killed, if Louis wins the battle with Forden, a man who killed two generations of the royal family could potentially become the next king—a situation that the supporters of the royal family would risk their lives to prevent.</p><p>So far we have revealed that the protagonist is traveling with the fairy Gallica to save the cursed prince. But in fact, his mission is to defeat Louis, the one who casted the curse. From the beginning of the story, the protagonist and Gallica have been on a mission to assassinate the treasonist, Louis.</p><p><strong>■ Purpose of the Journey</strong></p><p>Assassinating Louis is a tremendous journey for the protagonist unnamed boy and his partner Gallica. The symbol of Louis’s power is the Charadrius, the world’s only flying gauntlet runner, which also serves as his headquarters. However, the protagonist encounters a human before he even meets Louis, and in the process, he awakens an Archetype—a power of heroism that lies deep within him—and he survives, albeit painfully.</p><p>The protagonists make their attempt on Louis’s life at the royal funeral. However, the face of the king, who should already be dead, appears in the sky, and a proclamation is made that the next in line to the throne will be the one who is most desired by the people. This is the result of a formidable magic power inherited only by the king, from generation to generation, which he had arranged to be triggered upon his death. Thus, an unprecedented upheaval ensues, with the entire population of Euchronia competing to gather support by a set deadline.</p><p><strong>Election Magic</strong></p><p>This is the background of the invocation of the election magic, which is the first turning point in the story. Immediately after this magic is invoked, the king’s face in the sky above shows the current popularity rankings and the faces of Forden and Louis appear, big and bold. In other words, at the start of the story, we are at the beginning of a conflict between two huge forces: Santifex Forden, who is in effect, the ruler of the country, and Louis, a charismatic rebel in the military. In the process, the protagonist decides to jump into the turbulent journey for the throne in order to save the prince, his best friend since childhood, and to take Louis’s life for that purpose.</p><p><strong>■ Travel Companions</strong></p><p>Now let us introduce you to the allies who will join the protagonist.</p><p><strong>Gallica</strong></p><p>Gallica, the fairy who has been with you since the beginning of your journey, is your partner who guides you along the way and provides you with direction. Fairies are rare in this world, and although they cannot participate directly in battle, they are especially important because they are companions who can help confirm plans and provide local information, guiding the protagonist in both nagging and kind ways, so that he does not get lost. However, she sometimes gets complaints from other team members saying that they can’t sleep from the sound of her wings when she flies around while they sleep.</p><p><strong>More</strong></p><p>Here is the keeper of <a title="Games > Aka [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/aka">Aka</a>demeia, the facility for Archetype customization, who I mentioned in another video. His name is More. More is the author of one of the key items in the game, the fantasy novel that the protagonist carries. He is imprisoned in this mysterious space. He is well-versed in a variety of knowledge and offers various advice to the protagonists as they research their Archetypes. He is also a supporter and one of the followers we introduced in another video, meaning you can nurture your bond with him. As a person who has been exploring this world since his youth, he as a follower, governs the “Seeker” Archetype lineage. The Seeker, which the protagonist first awakens, belongs to this overarching Seeker lineage.</p><p><strong>Grius</strong></p><p>The story begins with the protagonist being assigned the mission of sending a message to an ally. Due to strict confidentiality, only Gallica was informed of the details of the message, namely the mission to assassinate Louis, who cast the curse, in order to break the prince’s curse. Grius is the ally who you need to deliver the message to. He is not only a master of martial arts, but also skilled in magic, and once even attempted to master Archetypes. Louis is not an easy target to approach. However, with the assumption that he will surely appear at the king’s funeral, the protagonist along with Grius, join hands on this mission.</p><p><strong>Strohl</strong></p><p>In order to deliver a message to Grius, who is undercover as a soldier in the Royal Army, the protagonist first volunteers to be a soldier at the recruitment center in the Royal Capital. There he meets Strohl, a young man of noble birth. It is a rare sight to see a noble volunteering for military service, but he seems to have a deep grudge towards humans from prior experience. Perhaps because of this, he has the courage to stand and fight as a noble in front of other citizens, and he has a strong sense of justice, treating everyone equally. <a title="Genres > Party [68 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/party">Party</a> members can freely swap between the Archetypes that the protagonist acquires during his journey, but the first Archetype that awakens in Strohl is the warrior. His beliefs are embodied in his heroic image and give him new strength.</p><p><strong>Hulkenberg</strong></p><p>The name of this red-haired warrior is Hulkenberg you drew. She is a member of the Holy Order and once served as the prince’s guard. However, during Louis’ attack on the prince, she was unable to fulfill her duty to protect him, and stepped away from the Royal Capital for a long time. She continued her journey, searching for the whereabouts of the prince without a clue as to his safety. In the midst of this disappointment, she learns of the king’s death and returns to the Royal Capital, where she meets the protagonists. She would then throw herself into the fray once again. The first Archetype to awaken in her is the “Knight.” With her pride as a knight and unwavering determination, she is a reliable presence in the party. She can be a bit stubborn and stoic at times, but on the other hand she has her goofy side, such as relishing and eating unconventional food.</p><p>As a side note, when we first announced this work we had a red-haired <a title="Companies > elf [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/elf">elf</a>-like woman as our concept character, and through the development process of the game, we were able to complete her as this character Hulkenberg. Thank you to those who have been waiting patiently to see how she would turn out.</p><p><strong>Heismay</strong></p><p>This is Heismay. With his distinctive appearance, he is a unique character who also joins the party. He has a different and painful past compared to Strohl and Hulkenberg, and in order to overcome it, he decides to face his own anxiety and awakens his Archetype. The first Archetype to awaken in him is the “Thief.” Despite his seemingly comical appearance, Heismay is a skilled and agile fighter. Heismay will expand the range of the party’s tactics to a new level.</p><p><strong>■ New Companions</strong></p><p>Now the traveling companions will be further increased as the story progresses. Let us continue and introduce you to some of the new fellow characters.</p><p><strong>Neuras</strong></p><p>Of course, the party needs legs that’ll take them around the wilderness to fight in the campaign. Those legs are the gauntlet runner, and Neuras is its pilot. He was originally a gauntlet runner designer for the royal family. He’s a man of unique traits, whose only interest seems to be the knowledge of gauntlet runners, but he is also a lively figure who brings a cheerful mood to the trip, not being easily discouraged by the serious problems that could trouble the others. Although he does not take part in dungeon combat, he is one of the key supporters of the protagonist and others on their journey, awakening the “Gunner” Archetype in the protagonist. Also, bonding with him may cause a change in the gauntlet runner itself. Please look forward to that as well.</p><p><strong>Junah</strong></p><p>Let’s continue the introduction further. This is a scene from a major national event. The name of the beautiful woman standing on stage is Junah. She is a songstress, known to have the most beautiful voice in the kingdom. She is even more famous than the royal family, despite the lack of modern media in the world. Junah, in fact, has an unexpectedly important background, and she too awakens an Archetype—the “Masked Dancer”—and later joins the protagonists in their journey. The character art is by Shigenori Soejima, a well-known artist in the <em>Persona</em> series. Junah’s costume is prominent, but in order to achieve the vivid and fashionable art that we are known for, while still fitting in with the fantasy world, we created characters unique to this title, referencing the “Swinging London” fashion movement of London in the 60s. We are pursuing a particular artistic style, which we hope you will enjoy in your gameplay.</p><p><strong>■ Tribes in the World</strong></p><p>We have introduced the companions that will join you on your journey, and one thing to point out is that they’re all from different tribes. In the previous information drop, we have told you that there are eight tribes in this world. The Clemar, averse to irrationality. The Roussainte, who pride themselves on strength. The Rhoag, who are long-lived and see the value in passing something on. The Ishkia, said to be highly intelligent. The Nidia, who are particularly sociable. The Paripus, who love a lively banquet. The Eugief, who value harmony. The enigmatic Mustari, who do not speak much. In addition to those eight, there are the Elda, the protagonist’s tribe, whose existence itself is rare.</p><p>These tribes are set based on a concept unique to this game. The motifs we used were the traits and characteristics that people have. To draw a line with standard fantasy world settings, the tribes in this game were created from scratch, being inspired by the biases of people’s personalities and values. This is one of our efforts to rebuild the fantasy <a title="Genres > RPG [16,403 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPG</a> from the ground up, and we hope that you will enjoy the freshness of this new experience.</p><p><strong>■ Election Race</strong></p><p>The title also features gimmicks to make the game more exciting, such as the “election magic,” and the great race across the kingdom, which is held as part of the popularity contest. In a kingdom ruled by a monarch, it is truly an event that turns things upside down. In the confusion of not knowing what is right and wrong, what ideas will people come up with, and what will people seek in a king. Although the word “election” may sound formal to some, we incorporated it because we thought it would be a device that would provide unpredictable developments when depicting a fantasy story. Please look forward to the details on this.</p><p><strong>■ Closing</strong></p><p>Well, how was it? In a world where anxiety which we all inherently carry is becoming a real force to be reckoned with, and in order to confront it, we must awaken the heroic powers, or Archetypes, that we are also born with, and overcome our fear of an unknown future. We created this RPG with such a goal in mind. Unlike the contemporary story we have made in the past, there are various settings that are unique to <em>Metaphor</em>. But we have created a game that can be enjoyed by all users. For example, we have a “Memorandum” function that can be activated with a single button during play, to give the freedom to enjoy the details of this world setting. We hope that many people will play the game once it is released, so please stay tuned.</p><p>Once again, <em>Metaphor</em> is scheduled to launch on October 11, 2024. Pre-orders for both the physical and digital versions are now available. We hope you will pre-order or wishlist today. Those who pre-order will receive the “Archetype EXP Chest Set” and the “<a title="Genres > Adventure [1,603 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">Adventure</a>r’s Journey Pack” as pre-order incentives.

We have a limited number for the Collector’s Edition, so if you would like to secure one, please do so as soon as possible.</p><p><strong>■ Up Next</strong></p><p>In the next exclusive showcase, we will finally reveal what kind of competitors will emerge in the actual campaign, and what kind of supporters will lend us a hand in overcoming those rivals, so please stay tuned.</p><p>In addition, many videos will be released daily by More, the keeper of Akademeia, who will introduce the various world settings of the title to you.
