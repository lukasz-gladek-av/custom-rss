			<p>Horror comes in many different flavours, with Folk Horror being particularly popular in recent years. Defined by a connection with and threat from the land beneath our feet and the beliefs that surround our involvement with it, this form of horror can offer fascinating insights into different cultures. Such is the case with One-Eyed Likho, a dark first person adventure based on a Slavic fairy tale. According to the tale, Likho is the embodiment of misfortune, a one-eyed ogress who haunts the margins of nightmares. Unfortunately for you, the protagonist of the game, you must track her down and find a way to escape her baleful eye.</p>
<p><iframe title="One-Eyed Likho - Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W6YvgF_oIug?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Likho is a window into another time and another culture. The 19th century Russian setting is one that was unfamiliar to me but also one that fits the eerie monochrome aesthetic perfectly. The lack of colour throughout the game gives the whole atmosphere the feel of a classic film, a mood only furthered by the Russian dialog. This combination of visuals and narrative reminded me greatly of 2021’s Mundaun, another folk horror game with a unique European setting.</p>


<p>While the black and white visuals seem limiting at first, the skilful use of light and shade throughout the game make details really pop in a way that they wouldn’t in full colour. The mixture of religious iconography and horror staples such as caves and dungeons creates a constant feeling of claustrophobia and there are some terrifying chase sequences that make full use of this tone.</p>


<p>You play as a smith who foolishly agrees to leave the safety of society to search for his fortune in the Mysterious Forest. Accompanied by a tailor, you soon find yourself embroiled in a nightmarish world of darkness and madness. The tailor seemingly dies at Likho’s hands early on but manages to remain a conscious companion in a freakish new form, the details of which I won’t spoil here. The original tale of Likho revolves around a smith blinding the ogress in order to escape her and one of the most memorable aspects of the game is the way in which it highlights the uncanny repetition found throughout folk stories from different cultures.</p>
<p>Early on in the game you find a strange book that at first appears to be empty. Scattered throughout the various locations are puzzle boxes that hold extra pages for this book – pages that contain a range of stories from across the world that all seem to contain the same basic elements of Likho. The most famous of these is, of course, the tale of Odysseus and the Cyclops and those who are familiar with this version will find some clear overlaps with the events depicted in Likho.</p>

<p>While there is no combat in Likho, you are not completely helpless in your adventure. Equipped with a seemingly bottomless box of matches you’ll frequently find the need to burn dry grass, wooden effigies and other obstacles to progress. This mechanic is your primary way of interacting with the world, but it’s not always about destruction. Lighting your path is often essential with many pitch black areas whilst other times puzzles require you to use light to your advantage.</p>
<p>The puzzles in Likho are mostly environmentally based with statues needing to be moved, keys found, and riddles to be solved. Alongside the main narrative path, there are the aforementioned storybook pages to be found, as well as birch manuscripts that give deeper lore details into the world of the story, and collectable dolls to burn hidden around the various locations. Trying to collect all of these provides some replayability which is welcome as the main story only takes around 4 hours to complete.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		One-Eyed Likho belongs in that rare category of games that take such a dark narrative and setting and manage to infuse it all with a surrealism that often verges on the comic. Even the epic conclusion of the story raised a smile at its presentation and effect. While not a long game and one that follows a very linear path, there are more moments and images here that will stay in your memory than many far longer games can muster.	</p></div>

            <title><![CDATA[Tencent has been Caught Making Changes to the Steam page for Horizon Rip-Off Light of Motiram after Sony’s Lawsuit]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/tencent-changes-light-of-motiram-steam-page-sony-horizon-lawsuit/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tencent-has-been-caught-making-changes-to-the-steam-page-for-horizon-rip-off-light-of-motiram-after-sony%E2%80%99s-lawsuit.1267350/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>When Tencent first announced Light of Motiram, everyone, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-clone-light-of-motiram-announced-for-pc/">Wccftech</a>, immediately saw it as a <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-clone-light-of-motiram-shown-in-new-gameplay-trailer/">clone</a> or rip-off of Sony's Horizon series. Which is why no one was surprised when, at the end of last month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-sues-tencent-over-horizon-copy-light-of-motiram/">a copyright lawsuit from Sony attacked Tencent</a> for Light of Motiram. The lawsuit cites the multiple headlines that drew the same connections we did, and goes as far to call Light of Motiram a "<em>slavish clone</em>" of Guerilla Games' series.</p>



<p>Now that Sony has pulled the lever on a lawsuit, Tencent has been caught making a few potentially legally-significant changes to Light of Motiram's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3319630/LIGHT_OF_MOTIRAM/">Steam page</a>. Spotted by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/after-sony-horizon-lawsuit-light-of-motiram-dev-store-page/">The Game Post</a>, the key art for Light of Motiram has been changed, the game's description has been rewritten, and multiple screenshots, including ones featuring Light of Motiram's own red-haired player character, have been removed.</p>



<p>The game's original description on Steam read as such: </p>



<p>"<em>In a world overrun by colossal machines, explore the vast open world, build your base of operations, advance technology, train Mechanimals, and take on formidable bosses. Starting from the primitive age, forge a new path of development. Defy machination, survive with mechanimals</em>."</p>



<p>The new description for the game now reads: </p>



<p>"<em>Make smart use of everything around you to stay alive and face off against formidable bosses, every step is fraught with danger and requires courage. Only by overcoming the challenges of survival can you carve out a place for yourself in this unforgiving land</em>."</p>



<p>A much more generic game description that doesn't reference the Mechanimals that look directly styled after the robotic dinosaurs featured in Horizon.</p>



<p>Will these changes and removals have any significant impact on the lawsuit? Who knows, it's too early to tell which way things will sway, no matter how obvious the case might seem on the outside. Especially when considering details that the lawsuit revealed, like how Tencent apparently went to Sony asking if the two companies could partner on making a Horizon game. Sony declined, according to the lawsuit, and Tencent followed up that encounter with Light of Motiram.</p>



<p>It might look open-and-shut, and like Tencent decided to copy as much as they could from Horizon in order to leverage the similarities to create a new hit title, but copyright suits are rarely open-and-shut, especially ones where two massive companies are going head-to-head. Whichever way it swings, we can be sure that it will set an interesting precedent for the future.</p>

                                                                          <figcaption id="featured-caption">

              <p>The traditional Metroidvania format works something like this: As you gain new abilities, you gain access to new areas. That platform up there that’s completely unreachable? Come back when you’ve gained double-jump. That sort of thing. <em>Öoo</em> follows the same formula, except when you return to those previously explored levels, you realize that it was only your own imagination holding you back. The magic was in your heart all along.</p> <p><em>Öoo</em> is a puzzle-platformer in which you play a little Kawaii caterpillar whose body segments are made of bombs. At the start of the game you’re just the head, able to move left and right, and that’s it. To jump, Öoo (I’m assuming that’s its name) needs to plop down a bomb and sit on top when it explodes. To jump a gap to the right, put down a bomb and stand on its right side when you explode it. That reasonably simple concept is how you begin exploring an ever-growing map, occasionally picking up yellow fly-like creatures and delivering them to large frogs that are blocking your way so you can proceed. And this all works tremendously well! It’s a novel concept for a platform game, one in which jumping is all about explosions, and you figure out new, inventive ways to use this technique as the puzzles demand it from you. It then gets even more interesting when it adds a second bomb. As is often the case with games like this, if that sounds like your jam, I strongly suggest you stop reading now and go buy it. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2721890/oo/">It’s only $8</a>, and it’s one of my favorite games of the year. The rest of this piece is to convince everyone else of its genius, but also gives the reader a <em>bit</em> more information than I had when I started playing, after completing its stunning demo earlier in the year.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Öooo - Official Short Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jXQmJBsrciI?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>So, you place a bomb with A (and by default are left sitting on top of it) and explode it with X. Place two bombs and then X will explode each in the order you placed them. Put two on top of each other with you sitting at the top and you’ve got a sort of double-jump. Sit on one while the other blows you sideways…well, this is the sort of stuff you need to figure out.</p>

 <p>When the <a href="https://buried-treasure.org/2025/06/next-fest-june-2025s-buried-treasures/"><em>Öoo </em>demo came out earlier this year</a>, it suggested that a second bomb was something you got very early on in the game, which may have led some to suspect that a third and a fourth would be arriving soon after. I’m rather pleased to report that’s not actually the case, or I suspect what has proven to be one of the most meticulously crafted puzzle-platformers I’ve ever played might have become too woefully complicated. While there’s great appeal in sandbox experimentation with four different bombs exploding in order, to discern the one desired combination for a puzzle solution would have been deeply demoralizing. Sticking to two, but having so much imagination for how they can be used in ever-more interesting ways, demonstrates an awful lot of smarts. In fact, you have just two until the very end of the game, but you’ll never stop learning new ways to use them.</p> <p>And this is the key. If this were a game about getting more and more bomb segments, or even being given fresh new abilities with which they interact, then you’d have something like a traditional Metroidvania. But it isn’t and you aren’t. You get that second bomb about half an hour into the game, and then that’s your lot. So why is it that <em>Öoo</em> still plays like a Metroidvania? Because it’s just so utterly, brilliantly designed.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000616906" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616906"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616906">©Nama Takahashi / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Almost from the start, you’ll encounter areas you can’t yet reach. You then play on in another direction, with the gradual introduction of increasingly complex puzzles causing you to think more inventively about your tools and how you can use them. At a certain point, rather than being able to carry on any further, you’ll reach a dead end in one of the game’s occasional teleport rooms, and you’re just left with the option to jump back to a part of the map where you can see an incomplete path. It’ll be one of those areas you couldn’t reach yet. Except, well, now you can. Not because you have a new skill, but because now you can think differently about how to approach the puzzle. And I’ve never experienced anything like this before. It’s quite extraordinary!</p>

 <p>Gosh, that was a long and necessary route to make that one point, so let’s move on to what else makes <em>Öoo</em> such a great game. This is a follow-up to developer Nama Takahashi’s&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/elechead-switch-steam-good-bad-ending-collectibles-1849158240"><em>ElecHead</em></a>, itself a wonderful platform-puzzler, and shares its retro aesthetic, albeit now with a more vibrant color palette. Gorgeous looping animations mean the levels feel buoyant, and Öoo itself is bursting with character, complete with falling asleep and snoring when left idle. And let’s not put aside that the game is called <em>Öoo</em> because that’s exactly what the character looks like.</p> <p>Another hugely important aspect of <em>Öoo</em> is that it has no interest in wasting your time. To solve puzzles you need to experiment, and to do that, you need to take risks. There are a bunch of ways to die, but there’s no significant penalty. Checkpoint flags are everywhere, meaning you’re never forced to mindlessly retrace your steps. The only times you might be more than a screen away are when there’d otherwise not be a means to backtrack–which is to say, everything’s been thought of, and you won’t be infuriatingly trapped. Should you become completely flummoxed by a puzzle, however, Takahashi has recorded <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PA3w0GnpAo">a video of his completing the entire game</a>, which you can easily scrub to find where you’re currently stuck. At which point you will put your head in your hands and lament your folly for not having figured it out for yourself. Because, as I’ve said, this game gives you everything you need right from the start.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000616907" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616907"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616907">©Nama Takahashi / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Worry not when you see that walkthrough video is only 45 minutes long. This is the creator of the game, and in real life you’ll be easily spending at least three or four hours before you’ll reach the end credits. And what a splendid few hours it is! This is such a delightful game, and so wonderfully intelligent in its creation.</p> <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2721890/oo/"><em>Öoo</em> is out now on PC for $8</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Madden 26 Review—A Mixed Bag Of Results]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/madden-26-review-a-mixed-bag-of-results/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/madden-26-review%E2%80%94a-mixed-bag-of-results.1267338/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Every year I go into Madden hoping for two things: that the gameplay will actually feel like football and that the rest of the game around it won’t make me want to pull my hair out (well, if I had any). Madden 26, for the most part, nails the first one better than it has in over a decade, but the second? Well, that’s still a work in progress.</p>



<h2 id="h-madden-26-review">Madden 26 Review</h2>



<p>Let’s start with what works, because on the field, Madden 26 is one of the smoothest, most enjoyable Madden games since the Xbox 360/PS3 days.</p>



<p>Movement is fluid, pocket maneuverability feels fantastic, and the new Wear and Tear system adds real strategy to roster management within the game. You have to think twice about overusing a player, which is a welcomed layer of realism. I wish there were sliders for it like in College Football 26 which has them for Dynasty Mode, but it’s a great addition nonetheless.</p>



<p>The passing game hasn’t been this rewarding (or unforgiving) since Madden 06 introduced the vision cone. Quarterback (QB)-specific throwing animations make each QB feel unique, and you really have to adjust to their mechanics. No matter your play style, you can make it work. The ability to get out of the pocket under pressure with the QB playmaker controls just adds to that level of skill where when it works, it looks and feels fantastic. </p>



<p>The catching animations have also been improved, and it’s nice when you see your big-bodied receiver snag a pass out of the air as only they should.</p>



<p>Overall, there’s a nice speed that’s not quite as fast as College Football has been since its return but not as slow as Madden has been for the last handful of years. It feels like game speed is at a happy medium. </p>



<p>On the flipside, there are gameplay concerns.</p>



<p>On extended plays where you have to scramble to try and find an open man and get a throw off, <strong>some receivers will just stand still</strong>. They’ve reached the end of their route, and they just don’t exist until you force it to them blanketed by a defender or its time to, maybe, block. Speaking of blocking, there are far too many instances of offensive lineman standing around, instead of looking for a player to block. If a defensive player goes a certain way away from them, they’ll stand there in a blocking stance…for nothing.</p>



<p>One other major problem area involves the AI. When playing against the CPU, it feels like AI QBs have the greatest accuracy the sport has ever seen, making zone coverage and even man with the best defensive backs almost impossible. It’s not simply a case of “get good”. It feels like if you don’t decide to spend time fiddling with sliders, you’re experience will suffer because of it. That said, if you want to feel dominant, just hope your CPU opponent likes to run the ball because there seems to be an issue with running backs simply not knowing where to go. </p>



<figure><figcaption>Madden has never looked better</figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-a-fantastic-looking-game-that-s-best-on-mute">A Fantastic Looking Game That’s Best On Mute</h3>



<p>Visually, Madden 26 is gorgeous. I honestly think we’re at the point where you’re not going to see the massive year-over-year leaps in graphics like we did 20 years ago, but the animation work here is noticeably cleaner. Fewer clipping issues, smoother transitions, and some really nice broadcast packages make games look authentic.</p>



<p>The new addition of Scott Hanson and the highlight packages continues to bring TV-like presentation to the virtual world. The Weekly Recap is a feature that’s been requested for 20 years, and it’s a solid foundation. Immersion kind of ends when Hanson calls out the wrong name or it gets choppy, but I’ll hope those get solved in a (hopefully soon) post launch update.</p>



<p>Where the presentation fails is with the play-by-play, it’s year two with the new three-team option, and it’s just not going well. Calls sound too robotic for Mike Tirico and Greg Olsen and Kate Scott and Brock Huard just come across as too overzealous with everything being called. Even during your scouting combine drills in Superstar Mode, Scott is yelling at the top of her lungs about your 40-yard dash. It’s just too much and is better off on mute. </p>



<p>At least with the commentary muted, you can listen more to what might just be the best soundtrack in Madden history. </p>



<p>The game’s menus are a bit faster that prior years, though opening player cards takes far too long and there are regular hiccups and unresponsiveness when trying to do things like edit a player’s equipment.  </p>



<p>Jersey selection is pretty limited like not being able to put a retro helmet with current uniform. For Example, the Buffalo Bills are wearing their classic red helmet with their current jerseys this year. In Madden 26, you can’t do that. You can’t wear classic helmets with current uniforms or vice versa.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Weekly Strategy changes make game planning a key part of your franchise.</figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-madden-26-s-hit-or-miss-modes">Madden 26’s Hit or Miss Modes</h3>



<p>The modes in Madden 26 are hit or miss.</p>



<p>The Skills Trainer is easily the most in-depth tutorial system Madden has ever had, with over 100 drills covering everything from stunts to advanced passing concepts. If you’re new, rusty, or just want to fine-tune, it’s an incredible resource.</p>



<p>Franchise mode does get some much-needed love with weekly prep that is deeper than ever thanks to playsheets that allow you to fine tune your strategy for each opponent better than ever, player statuses and non-determinant injury time, and training to keep your star players fresh and maybe get the fourth stringers some more reps to improve. The scouting improvements like Scout’s Honor ability add layers to roster building, and it feels with all the updates, coaching genuinely matters this year, which is something I never thought I’d say about Madden. With the Wear &amp; Tear system, </p>



<p>But you better like coaching the most, because it’s the only option in Franchise mode you have. After stripping away the ability to play as a player in Franchise mode, this year sees the removal of being a team owner. All you have is the ability to a coach. Now, you can still act as a GM with signing players and making trades, and whatnot, but there are features that are no longer there. You can no longer update facilities in your stadium, you can’t set ticket pricing, and there’s no merchandise control. Little things to some, but enough to be a bothersome removal for something that’s been around for years.</p>



<p>Sticking with problems in Franchise, issues persist with drafting as you’re unable to view your draft class mid-draft and in-season free agent signings remain locked at 1 year deals with no negotiations on years or money. Custom coaches are stuck with templates for faces, physiques are generic, and you can only pick a team’s base playbook. Also, relocation is exactly the same as it’s been for years, with no custom stadiums or integration with Team Builder. And even if you decide to just give your team a new stadium, it’s the same five generic stadiums that have been available for years. </p>



<h3 id="h-the-life-of-an-nfl-superstar">The Life Of An NFL Superstar</h3>



<p>Superstar Mode gets some added RPG flavor with the <strong>Sphere of Influence</strong> system. How you interact with your agent, coach, or even random celebrity dancers changes what perks and abilities you unlock. It may be a little odd to some, but it works, and the chapter structure makes the mode feel more like an actual journey.</p>



<p>There are quests to complete that unlock influence points, leading to new abilities and XP. When it comes to your coach, the higher the influence you have with him, the more playing time you can earn, more plays that you can call, and you can even earn the ability to audible. </p>



<p>The scouting combine drills remain fantastic and it makes me wish you could watch a combine in some way in franchise. I just wish that, after being drafted, I could decide to be like Shemar Stewart and hold out for something better, which may or may not happen. Though, I have a feeling the NFL is the reason that doesn’t exist.</p>



<p>You can still only pick one of five positions—QB, RB, WR, LB, CB—and, no matter where you’re drafted, you call the plays in game. I really would like to see that be something you have to earn. And, as mentioned earlier, the player editor loads at a snail’s pace. That’s something that, hopefully, can be fixed with a title update.</p>



<p>Lastly on the modes, Ultimate Team is exactly what you’d expect. Though, I will say, there are plenty of options for solo/offline players. However, the menus in the mode are sluggish, player cards take long to load, and can we finally get something to completely skip pack opening animations?</p>



<figure><figcaption>One frustrating bug is a disappearing play call screen.</figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-bugs-bugs-bugs">Bugs, Bugs, Bugs</h3>



<p>Another problem I have, and this is a gaming industry problem in general, are the number of bugs that launch despite asking players to spend $100, or more, for early access to the game. With Madden 26, some are smaller than others, but, as a whole, they’re hard to ignore:</p>



<ul>
<li>Travis Hunter covering… Travis Hunter in Jaguar drills</li>



<li>Team helmets changing color at halftime</li>



<li>False starts triggered by certain player motions</li>



<li>Draft Board has no background in-draft, causing it to be tough to read.</li>



<li>Defensive players lining up on offense. QBs lining up at receiver</li>



<li>Playbooks disappearing mid-game or being inaccessible unless a timeout is used</li>



<li>Superstar Mode crashing in the player editor</li>



<li>Deluxe Edition rewards not showing up for Ultimate Team players. And, if you go directly to EA support for help, they will tell you that “we don’t deal with codes” and that they can’t do anything to assist.</li>
</ul>



<p>These aren’t just small immersion breakers, they’re the kind of things that remind you Madden struggles with stability. At least most of these concerns <em>should </em>be addressed with an update. </p>



<h3 id="h-madden-26-review-verdict"><strong>Madden 26 Review Verdict</strong></h3>



<p>To be perfectly honest, I wavered back and forth on whether Madden 26 was a good game or a disappointing one.</p>



<p>What Madden 26 gets right, it really gets right. On the field, I’m generally having more fun than I have since, maybe, Madden 15 or 16. From the updates to how QBs play to the addition of stunts, there are moments where I can clearly see the vision for the game, and it looks fantastic. The game can feel so fluid and strategic that you’ll sit there wondering where this has been all these years. </p>



<p>Within Franchise mode, I never thought I’d spend as much time game planning and taking care of my players as I do, which just makes it more fun. And Superstar mode is just enough for me to enjoy it without it getting too overwhelming with options and what you do off the field. </p>



<p>However, there’s a lot here that stops it from being what I believe it should be. Franchise omissions and removals, gameplay questions that have been there for years, and the number of bugs are head-scratching. </p>



<p>With all of that said, I <em>still </em>lean towards Madden 26 being a good game with some (very) disappointing elements. Many of my issues I expect to be adjusted with updates. So, while I can’t tell you to fully write the game off, I’d maybe wait for the first title update to see what changes, even if I do think that, at it’s core, Madden 26 is a good game.</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Paper Mario was released in Japan 25 years ago today, August 11, 2025. Below, we look back at how the dynamic battle system and an unusual approach to Mario lore influenced the series for years to come.</em></p><p dir="ltr">I would wager that when GameSpot posted <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/paper-mario-preview/1100-2544763/">its first preview of the original Paper Mario</a>--then known as "Super Mario Adventure" in the US and "Super Mario RPG 2" in Japan--two and a half decades ago, no one expected it would become a beloved sub-series that people would still hold in high regard a quarter-century later.</p><p dir="ltr">Yet, here we are, exactly 25 years ago to the day that Paper Mario first hit store shelves in Japan. While the majority of Paper Mario fans dote on Thousand-Year Door as the best game in the long-running series, I've always held a special fondness for the original that started it all.</p><p dir="ltr">Paper Mario tells a story both conventional and fresh. By all accounts, it's a very by-the-books Mario tale: Bowser has procured a magical artifact of unfathomable power, captured Princess Peach, and scattered seven star-shaped MacGuffins around the world that Mario must retrieve in an epic quest to defeat him. There are no huge, defining character moments, no mind-bending plot twists. Just safe, simple Mario fare.</p><p dir="ltr">But also in typical Mario fashion, the simple concept is enhanced by its execution. What could be a bog-standard trek through a desert is enriched by a pitstop at a local outpost, where Mario must find the descendant of a band of thieves who can unlock the path to an ancient temple. Before he can climb a snowy mountain, he must first prove that he's not the culprit of a penguin murder mystery (it, uh, makes sense in context). The journey features just enough bells and whistles to help it stand out from the plumber's platforming escapades.</p><p dir="ltr">Where the game really shines is in its characterizations. Continuing the precedent set by its predecessor, Super Mario RPG, Paper Mario breathed life into the Mario universe that was still relatively unseen up to that point. For the first time, we get to see what exactly Princess Peach does while waiting for Mario to rescue her from Bowser. Far from being a helpless damsel in distress, she's bold and proactive, working to assist Mario in his quest long-distance however she can, typically by sneaking around and relaying information as to where he needs to go next. Bowser is a bigger threat than ever before, using the power of the fabled Star Rod to become virtually invincible. Yet, after stomping Mario and sending him plummeting to certain doom, what's the first thing he does? Write about it in his diary like a giddy schoolgirl. He's a terrifying threat and absolute goofball in equal measure, a memorable portrayal of the classic game villain that subsequent games and even the animated movie have built upon.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQzSVIwYZI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6wQzSVIwYZI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Paper Mario's emphasis on character is well demonstrated in Toad Town, the game's hub area. With Toads in modern Mario titles, if you've seen one, you've basically seen them all. Not so here. Despite relatively similar appearances between them, dozens of Toad Town residents have unique personalities, from the couple by the fountain who always find some way to connect their love for one another to Mario's adventure to the family trying to deal with the shift in the family dynamic due to the father figure being out of a job until Princess Peach's castle is restored. The characters don't remain static, either. Their dialogue is constantly changing as Mario's journey progresses to reflect the current state of the world around them. This makes it feel like there's more to the player's journey than simply saving a princess. This time, they're saving a living, breathing world full of unique, charming characters and families--people they can actually care about.</p><p dir="ltr">But it's the portrayal of the Mushroom Kingdom's non-Toad residents where the game shines brightest. Paper Mario solidified the concept of commonplace Mario creatures having vastly different appearances, personalities, and even allegiances, an aspect of the franchise that fans have clamored to see return for decades. Super Mario RPG toyed with the concept of Bowser's minions like Goombas and Koopa Troopas defecting from his forces and living their lives on their own terms, and Paper Mario takes that concept a step further. The first characters Mario meets when beginning his journey is a family of Goombas, with no ties to Bowser whatsoever, who help nurse him back to health. Other characters, like the rich young Boo heiress Bow or the wannabe Lakitu punk Lakilester, bring fresh new designs and personalities to what were formerly very one-note Mario creatures. Best of all, they can join you as partners on your journey.</p><p dir="ltr">It's these partner characters who help make Paper Mario's RPG battle system so dynamic. Make contact with an enemy in the overworld, and a turn-based battle is initiated. While Mario avails himself of a variety of familiar jump and hammer attacks to dispatch his foes, his partners back him up with their own unique abilities. For example, Goombario specializes in headbonking enemies into unconsciousness, whereas Bombette prefers to blow her opponents up with a full-frontal assault. Enemy placement and type forces players to strategize, switching up their moves and partner characters for whatever--and whoever--is the best fit for each battle.</p><p dir="ltr">Graphics aside, the original Paper Mario still holds up astonishingly well. It's every bit as charming and fun to play as it was when it first released back in 2000. Its simple but engaging story and gameplay make it the perfect entry point for new RPG players and Mario fans alike. With almost every Mario RPG surrounding it having gotten a remake in recent years (including the fantastic Thousand-Year Door remake that fixed what relatively few flaws the original game had), it's certainly not an unreasonable desire for Paper Mario to receive the same treatment. Regardless of whether the game gets remade someday or remains available in its current form, any gamer who has never given the original Paper Mario a shot owes it to themselves to experience a timeless piece of Mario magic that continues to resonate 25 years later.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Image credit: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQzSVIwYZI" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NintendoMovies on YouTube</a></em></p>

Some believe people may spend more conservatively on all range of products, including entertainment like games, which could negatively impact the video game industry overall.</p><p>Now, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick has commented on this economic backdrop, saying the US economy is neither booming nor busting, going on to predict that consumers will be more choosy when it comes to the games they buy. Zelnick said Take-Two is well-positioned here because, in his belief, the company makes must-have games.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Peak has turned up the heat with a new area to explore called Mesa, a sandy biome with the sizzling sun beating down on climbers. Thankfully, the patch notes state that shade can be found as well as sunscreen and parasols as part of the Mesa update, which is available now for the co-op game. </p><p dir="ltr">Developers Aggro Crab and Landfall broke down the major update for Peak <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3527290/view/498328557405079710" rel="nofollow ">on Steam</a>. For the next week, Mesa will actually replace the Alpine biome in runs, and then afterward, they "will rotate randomly." Sunscreen and parasols aren't the only new items in the update. Other additions include aloe vera, scout cannon, and dynamite. There are also a couple of mysteries that aren't detailed.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiNPum3mLD0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UiNPum3mLD0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Along with the Mesa biome, the update introduces the Bug Phobia Mode for people who don't want to see spiders and other multi-legged insects on their climbing runs. You can also now navigate Peak's settings with a controller, and the developers are promising better performance in the game.</p><p dir="ltr">This major update comes just a couple of weeks after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cute-climbing-game-peaks-latest-totally-normal-update-adds-in-totally-not-normal-cannibalism/1100-6533552/">Peak added cannibalism</a>, which the developers jokingly said was a "totally normal update." <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cute-climbing-game-peaks-latest-totally-normal-update-adds-in-totally-not-normal-cannibalism/1100-6533552/">Peak exploded on Steam</a> in June, seeing over 100,000 concurrent players after launching. The game sees players working together (or even alone) to scale a mountain at the center of an island that changes daily. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-the-developers-of-peak-primarily-made-the-game-out-of-jealousy/1100-6532754/">Jealousy was actually one of the driving forces</a> for making the game.</p><p dir="ltr">For more, check out the full patch notes below.</p><h3 dir="ltr">PATCH NOTES v1.20.a</h3><h4 dir="ltr">FEATURES</h4><ul><li dir="ltr">Added a new biome that replaces the Alpine: the MESA.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/mafia-old-country-reviews-metacritic-roundup-ps5-2000616275"><em>Mafia: The Old Country</em> </a>is set on the island of Sicily. Despite your proximity to the Mediterranean, however, there’s no swimming in the latest, not-quite-open-world gangster game. A clip showing the new blockbuster’s lack of “swimming physics” quickly blew up on social media, spurring a debate about whether <em>The Old Country</em> cuts corners. In actuality, I wish more games were fine with cutting junk that doesn’t matter.</p> <p>Swimming is one of the ways an open-world game proves just how premium and expensive it is. Falling in water meant instant death in <em>Infamous 1</em> and <em>2</em>, while in <em>Second Son</em> it merely returned you to the last hard surface you were standing on. But in <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>, light swimming mechanics became part of exploring the world. You couldn’t swim in <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> until <em>San Andreas</em>. One of the more controversial aspects of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> games is that, while you can swim on the surface of the water, you can’t dive underneath like in previous games.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">In case you were wondering, Mafia: The Old Country doesn't have swimming physics just like previous Mafia Games <a href="https://t.co/oUA13X64Q1">pic.twitter.com/oUA13X64Q1</a></p> <p>— NikTek (@NikTekOfficial) <a href="https://twitter.com/NikTekOfficial/status/1953894404588179783?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 8, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Swimming was never a thing in the <em>Mafia</em> games <a href="https://kotaku.com/how-the-makers-of-mafia-iii-lost-their-way-1825242177">until <em>Mafia 3</em></a>, which took place in a canal- and swamp-filled version of New Orleans called New Bordeaux. So it might have made sense to expect that to remain part of the feature set in <em>The Old Country</em>. But the new game is also more streamlined, focusing on its characters, missions, and world rather than on the kind of sandbox bloat that can be fun to mess around with but ultimately doesn’t add a ton to the overall experience. <em>The Old Country</em> is $50 and only 12 hours long. To some that’s a raw deal. But for advocates of quicker, cheaper, more sustainable game development, it seems like the perfect antidote to <a href="https://kotaku.com/former-sony-exec-calls-for-shorter-games-that-are-cheap-1844150846">a lot of the big-budget excess</a> that weighs down so many other projects. So, instead of letting you spear fish or dive for treasure, <em>The Old Country</em> warps you back to land anytime you fall in deep water.</p>

 <p>“This reminds me of when we showed <em>BG3</em> to someone (exec or whatever)–a wealth of mechanics–and with zero emotion he just goes ‘can you swim in the game?’ Like bro this isn’t mechanical whack-a-mole, endlessly layering on mechanics maketh a good game not,” Larian Studios publishing director Michael “Cromwelp” Douse <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1954131668215693599">wrote on X</a> in response to the debate over <em>Old Country</em>‘s old-school swimming band-aid. “The realities of game design are such that each feature has a cost. Manpower-&gt; time-&gt; budget. ‘Why not just[…]’ can set a producer on fire. Try it, its funny. Better to not swim if you’re not going to do anything with it, than to add it simply to have it.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Engagement baiters show invisible walls and "no swimming" but conveniently they forgot to show areas where the need to swim was thought of, and very obviously decided against. Many other games teleport you back to the shore and no one is complaining. <a href="https://t.co/HRfJiU5ARE">pic.twitter.com/HRfJiU5ARE</a></p> <p>— Silent (@__silent_) <a href="https://twitter.com/__silent_/status/1954547676625641537?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Douse pointed to day-and-night cycles as another example. While occasionally pretty and immersive, most games don’t actually do much with them, like change how characters act at night or what enemies you might face. It’s one of those back-of-the-box bullet points that can get wheeled out in pitch meetings to impress a publisher but can end up leading to more headaches and a less focused game in the long run.</p> <p>“I feel like I’m aging out of the gaming sphere because I see this and ask myself ‘Does this game even need a swimming? Should dev time be devoted to it’ and people in the comments are saying ‘This is unacceptable for a 2025 game’ Idk I just don’t think games need every mechanic,” read <a href="https://x.com/Actually_Tina/status/1954232748044112165">one viral response</a> to the swimming debate from X user ActuallyTina. “I would much rather devs spend time on mechanics that actually engagement the player a lot then a big empty world with nothing in it or swimming that is just there because idk its 2025 and you need swimming.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Peak has received its first major content update today, The Mesa, which adds a new biome, some new items, new badges and more mysteries. </p>



<p>Aggro Crabs and Landfall’s latest co-op climbing adventure, Peak, has been going strong on Steam ever since its launch, selling more than <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/peak-5-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">5 million copies</a> within its first month. The developers have been <span>working diligently on the updates, too, and have recently </span>added the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/peak-adds-cannibalism-in-its-latest-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cannibalism</a>&nbsp;feature. However, the latest update has a lot more to unravel. </p>



<h2 id="h-peak-s-the-mesa-update-is-live-now">Peak’s ‘The Mesa’ Update is Live Now</h2>



<h4 id="h-new-peak-content">New Peak Content</h4>



<p>Peak’s latest <a href="https://x.com/AggroCrabGames/status/1954936000045805590" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">update</a> adds a new biome called The Mesa. The Mesa will be replacing Alpine and will be present in every run next week. Post that, maps will rotate randomly between The Mesa and Alpine. As this is a new land to explore, there are 10 new badges to collect, with some providing players with fresh cosmetics as rewards. </p>



<p>As players are now visiting a “sandy terrain under the blistering sun” with Peak’s The Mesa update, they will need new items to keep them safe in the undiscovered environment. These items include Balloons, Scout Cannon, Parasol, Sunscreen, Aloe Vera and Dynamite. Players will also find a surprise waiting for them at The Kiln. Moreover, a tornado was also mentioned in the new trailer. </p>

</p></figure>



<h4 id="h-new-options-and-balancing-changes">New Options and Balancing Changes</h4>



<p>The update also adds a new ‘Bug Phobia Mode’ which is designed for players that don’t do well with “arachnids and other creepy crawlies” as there will be plenty of those in the Mesa. Players can now navigate through the Settings menu with the controller. The fog will now rise slightly slower in the Tropics. The heat status now decays faster, but takes a bit longer to start. Also, hot rocks in the Caldera inflict more heat on the players. </p>

<h4 id="h-bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h4>



<ul>
<li>Improved performance across the board on the mountain.</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where players could teleport after a rusty piton they were hanging onto breaks.</li>



<li>Fixed players sometimes obtaining the Naturalist Badge despite eating packaged food.</li>



<li>Prevented players from interacting with their backpack while passed out.</li>



<li>Adjusted luggage collision to prevent players from getting their legs stuck in it</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where the Bugle of Friendship would still play its audio and visual effects when out of juice.</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where biome-specific loot could sometimes show up in luggage in the wrong biome.</li>
</ul>



<p>Regarding future updates, the developers have stated that they “aren’t quite sure yet” and don’t want to promise something they can’t deliver. They will update the community as soon as they have something new going on, but for now, it will only be bug fixes and stability patches for Peak. </p>



<p>In other news, Peak developers would rather <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/peak-publishers-prefer-piracy-to-roblox-slop-ripoff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">players pirate their game</a> than play a Roblox rip-off. What are your thoughts on Peak’s The Mesa update? </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>After <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/battlefield-2042/battlefield-2042-review-the-battle-of-the-bugs">the bug-riddled launch of Battlefield 2042</a> back in 2021, EA has been working to revitalize the Battlefield series’ name, placing <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2021/12/02/respawns-vince-zampella-becomes-head-of-battlefield-amidst-wider-franchise-changes-that">Respawn’s Vince Zampella as its head amidst the creation of a wider Battlefield universe</a>. If the recent Battlefield 6 beta over the weekend is any indication, those efforts are paying off. Not only did the beta surpass Call of Duty’s all-time player count, but it also reached a new concurrent peak for the Battlefield series.&nbsp;</p><p>EA calls the Battlefield 6 open beta <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/lock-and-load-for-the-open-beta">its biggest ever</a>, and Weekend 1 (Aug. 9-10) just wrapped up. Throughout the weekend, and on Aug. 7 and Aug. 8, when invite-only players could hop in early, I saw screenshots across social media showing queues stretching into the hundreds of thousands – a lot of people were playing this game.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wFGEMfyAQtI"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wFGEMfyAQtI" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Using SteamDB, a database that tracks Steam concurrent player counts, that checks out. On Saturday, the Battlefield 6 open beta peaked with <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3081410/charts/">521,079 players</a>, which is also an all-time peak for the entire Battlefield series. That number eclipses <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1938090/charts/">the peak of Call of Duty at 491,670, </a>too, though it’s important to note these are just Steam numbers and console players could sway this observation in either direction.&nbsp;</p><p>Nonetheless, the point stands – Battlefield 6 is something players are excited about. The real test will be how many of these open beta (see: free) players will convert into paid players when Battlefield 6 launches on October 10 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/24/battlefield-6-gets-debut-trailer-multiplayer-reveal-set-for-july-31">watch the Battlefield 6 debut trailer</a> and then read <a href="https://gameinformer.com/preview/2025/08/01/familiar-yet-cinematic">our preview of Battlefield 6’s multiplayer</a> after going hands-on with it.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>Did you hop into the Battlefield 6 open beta this weekend?

			<p>In the future, there is a perfectly safe sport where you jump into a warp tunnel and then use rockets on your hands to manoeuvre around asteroids, lasers, and other obstacles at breakneck speeds, or blast them out of your way with your space guns. This all sounds like a thoroughly thrilling spectator sport, I’m sure you agree, but donning your VR headset to play Space Drop is sadly rather dull.</p>
<p><iframe title="Space Drop PS5 / PSVR2 Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0YA2PwairFI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Depending on what difficulty you start on, your first impressions may vary. If you start on the easiest difficulty you’re going to be totally underwhelmed by the lack of challenge. I’d recommend starting on the hard, the third difficulty, where you can get used to things with a little challenge. Ultra, the final difficulty, is just ridiculous. It’s not impossible to beat by any means, just incredibly frustrating instead as trial and error is the only real path to success.</p>


<p>The bigger issue is that the obstacles – the asteroids, spinning lasers and laser grids – are all the same regardless of the difficulty, it’s just that there’s more of them. It’s incredibly repetitive after a few runs and only gets more so from there. It’s a bit of a shame because there’s maybe thirty minutes when you first start playing where the game feels like it has some real potential. During this brief window, as you first master weaving through obstacles and blasting others out of the void, you can almost reach a sort of flow state – everything is so quick there’s no space for focusing on anything else. It’s just that after the first few experiences you’ve seen everything the game has to offer, just in slightly different combinations and closer together.</p>


<p>There are a couple of control options, one where you hold a button and aim your guns to move around and another where you don’t hold the button, the latter of which is superior unless you want cramp in your trigger fingers. Movement at least works well enough, giving enough fine control to fit between two lasers whilst still allowing you to quickly get over to the other side of the play area if needed. The guns are at best serviceable, though. They do what they’re supposed to do, though I’d recommend turning off the laser sights if you want any level of challenge.</p>
<p>The game looks relatively good. It’s set in space, obviously, and there’s planets and asteroids to briefly marvel at before each level begins, but even then it’s not like you can stop and enjoy them in a level without getting an asteroid to the face. The music is both incredibly repetitive and completely unremarkable, like the music you’d find in the background of a sci-fi themed mobile game, and whie the sound effects do their job well enough, they also aren’t that notable.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		It's hard to recommend Space Drop. It's very basic in just about every way and quickly becomes too repetitive as you continue playing. Perhaps sidestepping to the rhythm action could have spiced it up, or most kinds of environments and obstacles, it would have kept my interest. As it is, it's just too dull.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Heretic + Hexen Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157958/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>I’m really beginning to wonder just how Nightdive Studios manages to fit in so many awesome projects. Last year, we had no less than <em>five</em> major releases from the team, including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/thing_remastered">The Thing: Remastered</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/doom_plus_doom_ii">DOOM + DOOM II</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/star_wars_dark_forces_remaster">Star Wars: Dark Forces Remaster</a>, and it’s clearly looking to achieve a similar degree of prolificacy in 2025. So far this year, we’ve had <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/i_have_no_mouth_and_i_must_scream">I Have No Mouth, And I Must Scream</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/system_shock_2_25th_anniversary_remaster">System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster</a>, and now – straight out of QuakeCon – <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/heretic_plus_hexen">Heretic + Hexen</a>.</p>
<p>The latter, published by Bethesda Softworks, is a revamped bundle containing two ‘90s shooters from developer Raven Software (now one of the main studios cranking out <strong>Call of Duty</strong> titles for Activision). In addition to Heretic and Hexen, you’ve also got both games’ additional content, respectively titled <strong>‘Shadow of the Serpent Riders’</strong> and <strong>‘Deathkings of the Dark Citadel’</strong>. Much like its work on DOOM + DOOM II in 2024, Nightdive Studios has also produced two completely new episodes with <strong>‘Heretic: Faith Revived’</strong> and <strong>‘Hexen: Vestiges of Grandeur’</strong>.</p>
<figure><a title="Heretic + Hexen Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157959/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s a compelling package, then, with lots of content on offer. I could lament the lack of <strong>Heretic II</strong> and <strong>Hexen II</strong>, but it does make sense to limit this new release to the two id Tech 1 titles. I suspect the sequels may yet return later down the line, should id Software or Nightdive decide to tackle them.</p>
<p>So let’s take a closer look at each main game. <strong>Heretic</strong>, originally released in 1994, gained reasonable popularity compared to most so-called ‘Doom Clones’ back in the day thanks to its more unique fantasy setting and inventory system. The core gameplay remained instantly familiar though, and under the watchful eyes of producer John Romero, Heretic became something of a cult classic.</p>
<p>With the new Nightdive release, the basic experience remains largely the same, albeit enhanced with the studio’s usual modern gameplay conveniences (like gyro aiming, of course) along with some thoughtful changes made to the basic design. For example, the enemies in the original were relentless bullet-sponges, and often made for a frustrating gameplay experience. Here, they’ve been nerfed considerably, which improves the moment-to-moment pacing of the game, but retains a decent sense of challenge. Basic level aesthetics have also been improved, making for a more visually-pleasing experience.</p>
<figure><a title="Heretic + Hexen Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157953/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Moving over to <strong>Hexen</strong>, this pseudo-sequel originally launched in 1995 (with an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/hexen">N64 version</a> following in 1997) and made some pretty drastic changes to its predecessor. You can choose between three classes: Fighter, Cleric, or Mage, with each demonstrating their own strengths and weaknesses. The levels were also fully interconnected, meaning changes made in one area would also reflect in another.</p>
<p>Again, Nightdive has made some welcome improvements to the overall design of Hexen, including the ability to change your class in-game via designated ‘terminals’; this is a great way to mix things up a bit if you’re getting a bit bored of one particular class. The biggest improvement, however, might not seem so drastic on paper, but it makes a huge difference: map markers.</p>
<p>Thanks to the interconnected levels, Hexen can often feel a little confusing and overwhelming. New players might find themselves just running into walls and pressing ‘Y’ in the hope that you might activate something elsewhere. Adding markers to the maps doesn’t eliminate this entirely; you still have to figure out how to navigate the environment and actually reach your destination, but it does at least remove the sense of trial and error that plagued the original release. If you’re a veteran, you can disable this via the options menu, if you wish.</p>
<figure><a title="Heretic + Hexen Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157960/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>As mentioned, both Heretic and Hexen gain brand-new content courtesy of Nightdive Studios. These expansions are both excellent and really demonstrate the developer’s understanding of what makes the original games tick. The levels are exceptionally well-designed and, honestly, you’d be forgiven for thinking they were cut content from the main games. I would have been happy to just play Heretic and Hexen with modern improvements, but the additional content here really elevates the package to a whole new level.</p>
<p>In terms of presentation, Nightdive has included all the usual enhancements I’ve come to expect from its remasters, including the ability to toggle between widescreen and 4:3 aspect ratios, various levels of resolution scaling, and even six different crosshair designs. Performance is locked to 60fps and it feels great, though a part of me does wish that we got a native Switch 2 release with 120fps. One step a time, though; I'm sure it'll come eventually.</p>
<p>Music is also given special treatment here: you’ve got the original soundtracks in all their glory, but you can also swap to an fm synth version, midi synth version, and a completely remixed version from Andrew Hulshult, who also gave us the updated soundtracks for DOOM + DOOM II in 2024. This new version is excellent, and my go-to from now on.</p>
<figure><a title="Heretic + Hexen Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157952/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Multiplayer is also included in both titles, and it works pretty well for the most part. You can hop into an online match fairly easily, just be prepared for a bit of jank. You might find yourself teleporting around depending on where your teammates are, while character models can judder around a bit if the connection isn’t stable enough. It’s not the most ideal way to play Heretic or Hexen, but if you’re able to get some pals together, it makes for a pretty fun time.</p>
<p>Finally, a huge shout-out goes to the Raven Vault, a collection of behind-the-scenes documentation for both titles that provides some key background information. It’s not quite as exhaustive as what you might find in the recent System Shock 2 remaster, but you’ve got a good selection of enemy designs, texture sheets, key artwork, and more. Definitely worth checking out if you’re a fan of the originals.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Heretic + Hexen is yet another slam dunk for Nightdive Studios. This new release revamps both titles with modern controls, bonus content, and thoughtful changes to the core design that make each game a delight to play. Granted, these are still FPS titles from the mid-'90s, so your mileage will definitely vary, but for returning fans and those with a particular fondness for old-school 'boomer shooters', you really can't go wrong. Now let's get a native Switch 2 port with 120fps please, Nightdive.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Mike Ybarra, the current chief executive officer of daily fantasy sports betting app <a href="https://www.prizepicks.com/">PrizePicks</a>, who you're more likely to recognize as the former president of Blizzard Entertainment, has some thoughts about <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6</a> taking on <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-announced-will-arrive-later-in-2025-and-is-still-launching-on-last-gen-consoles/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> this fall, predicting that EA's shooter will "<em>boot stomp</em>" the latest entry in the annual series that helps keep his former company afloat, and that FPS fans will be better off for it.</p>



<p>"<em>Battlefield will boot stomp CoD this year</em>," his post on X (formerly Twitter) reads. "<em>But the real win here is CoD won't be lazy anymore, and we'll all get better FPS games for it</em>."</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Battlefield will boot stomp CoD this year. But the real win here is CoD won’t be lazy anymore, and we’ll all get better FPS games for it.</p>— Mike Ybarra 😇 (@Qwik) <a href="https://twitter.com/Qwik/status/1953621587993014620?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 8, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p><a href="https://x.com/Qwik/status/1953622553894785366">Replying</a> to someone commenting on his post, Ybarra expanded on his thoughts and criticism of the Call of Duty series dating back to 2016, saying, "<em>CoD has gone downhill for years since then</em>. <em>It's a mess. Cheating, heavy UI/install, rainbow colors. People are sick of it. Luckily BF will force them to change it</em>."</p>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/Qwik/status/1954586377036628253">another repl<strong>y</strong></a> to someone accusing him of being "<em>bitter</em>," Ybarra writes, "<em>CoD will get better because BF will be</em> <em>great. You're blind if you don't see that. Bitter? No, glad I'm not part of the end of Xbox. Upset they can't lead teams to make good games? Yes. Because they layoff all those people for leaderships mishaps.</em>"</p>



<p>Strong words from someone who was at the top end of company leadership at Blizzard for a few years, and who also worked at Microsoft for almost two decades before that. Ybarra left Blizzard and subsequently Microsoft in 2024, alongside the <a href="https://wccftech.com/four-months-after-the-merger-with-activision-blizzard-microsoft-is-laying-off-1900-employees/">massive 1,900-employee layoff at Activision Blizzard King</a> that came shortly after Microsoft officially closed on its acquisition of ABK.</p>



<p>Between his time at Microsoft, then Blizzard, and then Microsoft again, Ybarra was on the leadership end of his fair share of mishaps that resulted in layoffs. That's not to say they were all directly his own mishaps, but it feels odd, to say the least, to hear him generalize leadership in this way, as if we're meant to think he wasn't around for any of the bad stuff at Blizzard and Microsoft.</p>



<p>All that said, he has a point that an incredible Battlefield game that gives Call of Duty some serious competition in the shooter market can only make Activision and the Call of Duty team work harder to beat Battlefield the next year, and the same goes for Battlefield Studios working to get the better of Call of Duty. </p>



<p>Healthy competition in the market means better games for players, but for that to happen, Battlefield 6 has to stick the landing when it arrives on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on October 10, 2025.</p>



<p>At least it's had a strong start, since, on Steam, Battlefield 6 <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3081410/charts/">surpassed</a> the record concurrent player count of <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1938090/charts/">Call of Duty</a> in just its first open beta.</p>

            <p>Former <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age">Dragon Age</a> executive producer Mark Darrah has discussed pitching remasters of the first three games in the series to EA, and made clear in the same interview that he's encourage the developers of the next <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> game to "scapegoat" <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-top-tips-beginners">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> "as much as they need to".</p>
<p>Darrah's offered a lot of insight into life at BioWare since departing the studio back in 2022, with the veteran dev having done plenty of that via <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-dragon-age-producer-posts-tell-all-video-about-the-messy-birth-of-ea-and-biowares-anthem">his own YouTube channel</a>. This time, though, he was interviewed by YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pd9OG3HmN0">MrMattyPlays</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Just past the ten minute mark of the chat, Darrah was asked whether he thinks the next Mass Effect game will likely face a "less messy" development cycle than <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-dragon-age-the-veilguard-report-reveals-more-about-turbulent-development-including-forspoken-prompted-shift-from-snark-to-seriousness">the likes of Veilguard have suffered</a>. "To be frank," he responded, "the Mass Effect team is going to be able to point to The Veilguard and say 'We should steer away from some of these things because look what happened.' I would honestly encourage that team to scapegoat Veilguard as much as they need to, to get what they need from the organisation, whether it's true or not."</p>
<p>So, not giving Veilguard's developers - whom Darrah <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/biowares-mark-darrah-thinks-veilguard-is-the-first-dragon-age-where-the-combats-actually-fun">worked with as a consultant</a> and stood up for following the game's release. Instead, just pointing to it in an effort to get dumb execs to stop pushing yet another project in the same problematic directions and learn from some past mistakes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, slightly further on, Darrah added that he thinks the next step for the Dragon Age series should be remastering the first three games: Origins, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-ii">Dragon Age 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-inquisition">Inquisition</a>. He also revealed that remastering these games as a "Champions Trilogy" was discussed and soft pitched to EA while he was there, but didn't end up happening for a few reasons.</p>
<p>"EA's historically been and I don't know why, but they've even said this publicly — they're kind of against remasters," Darrah explained, "I don't really know why, and it's strange for a publicly-traded company to seemingly be against free money but they seem to be against it. So that's part of it.</p>
<p>"The other problem is, Dragon Age is harder than Mass Effect to do. To some degree unknowably harder, maybe only a little bit harder, maybe a lot harder. One of the very earliest things for Joplin [the codename for BioWare's earliest version of Dragon Age 4] was let's do Frostbite tools, and then let's find a mod house that seems talented, and just uplift them, and pay them to do a remake of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-origins">Dragon Age: Origins</a>."</p>
<p>However, as Darrah went on to outline, that wouldn't fly, because of the "advantages" the series about banging ok has over Dragon Age in terms of being easy to remaster:</p>
<blockquote>One, it's all Unreal instead of two different engines. But actually, just the fact that it's Unreal [engine] means that you can remaster Mass Effect essentially for money. If you're willing to spend money on it, you can go to an external house and they can do most of the work, which is sort of what happened with Legendary Edition. There were a bunch of people at BioWare working on it...I don't know remember how many, but it was not a ton. Whereas, if you're going to do [Dragon Age], you either have to spin up a brand new team that's going to learn this really, really crotchety old tech base, or you've got to do it all in-house.</blockquote>
<p>Sounds like a tough sell to spending-averse execs who Darrah suggests elsewhere in the interview have historically struggled to see the Dragon Age games as potential mainstream hits. Regardless of where it's that or something else, here's hoping Veilguard doesn't end up being the last we ever see of BioWare's lizard era.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mass-effect-5-devs-should-scapegoat-veilguard-and-a-dragon-age-trilogy-remaster-was-pitched-to-ea-says-ex-bioware-producer]]></content:encoded>

              <p>Over the weekend, <em>Weapons</em> made a killing at the box office, opening with an impressive $42 million and in the process helping movie studio <a href="https://kotaku.com/wb-warner-bros-discovery-split-hbo-max-ceo-david-zaslav-1851784086">Warner Bros.</a> do something no other studio or distributor has done before in history.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/video-game-cases-loose-discs-bf6-resident-evil-persona-spider-man-news-2000616874#:~:text=Weapons%20Director%20Says%20His%20Resident%20Evil%20Movie%20Will%20Be%20Weird">Zach Cregger’s latest horror film, <em>Weapons</em></a>, tells the story of a group of kids who all left their homes in the middle of the night and never returned. The strange and creepy movie has received high praise from critics, with a 95% on Rotten Tomatoes. And that certainly helped <em>Weapons</em>, with a budget of only $38 million, draw in a ton of people over the August 8th weekend, beating out<em> Fantastic Four</em> and <em>Freakier Friday</em>, two Disney-produced flicks. This is now the sixth film in a row from WB to pull off a $40-million-or-more opening weekend at the box office.</p> <p><a href="https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/weekend-box-office-weapons-racks-up-another-big-win-for-warner-bros/">As reported by Rotten Tomatoes</a>, this is apparently the first time a movie studio has ever been on such a hot streak. It all started with <a href="https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-review-bad-jack-black-kids-movie-steve-1851775345"><em>A Minecraft Movie</em></a> in April. Since then, WB has been on an impressive and historic box office run. Here’s the full breakdown of each movie the studio has released and how much it made during opening weekend:</p> <ul> <li><em>A Minecraft Movie</em> – April – $162 million</li> <li><em>Sinners – April</em> – $48 million</li> <li><em>Final Destination: Bloodlines</em> – $51 million</li> <li><em>F1</em> – $51 million</li> <li><em>Superman</em> – $125 million</li> <li><em>Weapons</em> – $42 million</li> </ul> <p>Making this streak all the more impressive is that half of these are original movies, not sequels, reboots, or spin-offs. This seems to fly in the face of how Hollywood has operated over the last decade, where at times it’s felt as if nearly every movie is some kind of continuation of an existing franchise. Warner Bros., on the other hand, seems to be spreading out its budget across new ideas as well as making IP plays, like <em>Minecraft</em> and its <em>Final Destination </em>reboot.&nbsp; It’s a strategy that’s working. Oh, and <em>Weapons</em> also marks the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/1mmlqv4/wb_is_having_quite_the_year_weapons_is_the/">seventh film in 2025 from Warner Bros. to open at number one</a> at the domestic box office, which is also a first for a movie studio as far as I can tell. (<a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl2465301249/?ref_=bo_wey_table_28"><em>Mickey 17</em></a> wasn’t a huge hit for WB, but it did open at number one during the first weekend of March.)</p> <p>Will this streak continue? Maybe. WB’s next big movie to hit theaters is <em>The Conjuring: Last Rites</em> on September 5. This likely won’t win over critics like <em>Sinners</em> and <em>Weapons </em>did, but the franchise has been a consistent moneymaker for the studio, and horror flicks are hotter than ever right now. So it’s possible that both of WB’s historic streaks at the box office continue. Meanwhile, you have to imagine execs at Disney, MGM, and Sony are watching closely and looking at their upcoming projects to see if they need to inject a bit more originality into their future film slates.</p>

            <p>
Civilization 7 didn't get off to a great start when it launched earlier this year, quickly becoming mired in complaints around its controversial gameplay choices, lack of features, and clumsy UI. But while developer Firaxis is still struggling to win over series fans - particularly on Steam, where its user reviews remain "mixed" - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> boss Strauss Zelnick believes Civilization 7 is still on track to hit its lifetime "value" projections.
</p>
<p>
Civilization 7 released back in February - Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/civilization-7-review">called it</a> a "competent [series] entry with some poorly executed ideas and a striking lack of personality" at the time - and criticism from customers soon followed. Complaints were loud enough, particularly among the series' more visible base of PC players (Civilization 7 also launched on consoles), that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/firaxis-acknowledges-civilization-7-issues-fixes-incoming">Firaxis quickly moved to address fans</a>, promising a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/civilization-7-will-improve-its-much-criticised-ui-across-multiple-future-updates">roadmap of fixes</a> that's still ongoing.
</p>
<p>
And it appears these early troubles have contributed to what Zelnick has now acknowledged to be a "slow start" for the 4X strategy series' latest entry - but he remains optimistic about its future. "I think the key thing is that Civ has always been a slow burn," he <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-strauss-zelnick-insists-projections-for-the-lifetime-value-of-civilization-7-are-very-consistent-with-our-initial-expectations-for-the-title-despite-slow-start">told IGN</a> in a recent interview. "It's always been a title that had - I'm not really a big believer in the long tail theory of the entertainment business - but Civ is an example of that theory. And right now our projections for the lifetime value of the title are very consistent with our initial expectations."

<p>
"So while we were off to a slow start," he continued, "and while we have had to make changes - and there are more changes coming - I feel like consumer uptake is better and better and we feel really good about the title. I think over time it's going to take its place in its Civilization pantheon in a very successful, credible way."
</p>
<p>
Civilization 7's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1295660/view/498327545507219278?l=english">most recent update</a>, officially referred to as version 1.2.3, brought UI and quality-of-life adjustments, alongside a first round of changes aimed at improving the game's controversial Age Transitions - changes intended to introduce a greater sense of continuity and connection as Ages shift. It sounds like Firaxis' most meaningful revisions are still to come however, with the studio confirming it's currently "in the middle of some deeper work on systems like Ages, replayability, and how players connect with their civ across history". However, these, it admitted, are "going to take time".

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/with-battlefield-6-beta-queues-stretching-around-the-block-a-substantial-increase-in-server-capacity-should-just-have-helped">open beta</a> is over, and encouraging whispers of its oo-rahhable player count – peaking at over 500,000 on PC alone, so sayeth <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3081410/charts/">SteamDB</a> – have been tempered with widespread <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cheaters-already-spotted-in-battlefield-6-open-beta-despite-secure-boot-requirement">reports of invading cheaters</a>. That’s despite BF6’s new and unusual requirement to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-open-beta-makes-enabling-secure-boot-on-your-pc-mandatory-because-cheaters">enable Secure Boot</a>, a BIOS-level security feature in Windows, ostensibly to prevent such do-badding.</p>
<p>In response, a <a href="https://forums.ea.com/discussions/battlefield-6-beta-feedback-en/update-battlefield-6-update-on-secure-boot--cheats/12439803">forum post</a> attributed to EA’s anti-cheat team has played up successes in tracking and catching the beta’s cheaters, whose crimes allegedly range from classic wallhacks, speed hacks, and aimbots to cheats that reduce recoil or display enemy health and weapon info. However, it also concedes that Secure Boot "is not, and was not intended to be a silver bullet" – and in doing so, highlights the immense, perhaps impossible task that developers have of keeping cheater users out of their games.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I don’t mean to suggest that cheat makers are a breed of impressive technogeniuses. They trade in malevolence for profit, making them almost as big a bunch of loser babies as their customers. But they are persistent, and prideful, so attempts by publishers and developers to big up their latest anti-cheat as being particularly difficult to crack is often seen as a challenge as much as a deterrent. Vanguard, the AC system Riot Games use for their tactical FPS <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/valorant">Valorant</a>, holds a kind of grudgingly respected reputation among players for its relative efficacy, yet cheaters still show up now and then to spoil its shootouts.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>EA</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It's true that EA, or BF6 developers DICE, never claimed that requiring Secure Boot would keep hackers out for good. The feature is also just one component of the game’s wider AC protection, named Javelin, which that forum post boasts of having stopped 330,000 cheating and tampering attempts like they were .22 rounds pinging off a tank’s backside. That’s about three successful interventions for every five players, which suggests two things: one, Battlefield 6 faces an absolutely enormous number of malicious actors, and two, if you played the open beta at the weekend, there’s a very good chance that at least one of your games was saved from a cheating attempt.</p>
<p>Some of those numbers were undoubtedly passed around BF6 headquarters as evidence of Javelin’s great success. Except it was also beaten, in a matter of hours, and by a fairly wide variety of different cheats. And anti-cheat systems are a lot like Premier League goalkeepers: you can keep out attempt after attempt, but let just one through and people will think you're rubbish.</p>
<p>I’d argue, then, that the biggest challenge facing multiplayer developers isn’t the pursuit of creating a truly hacker-free game. That, based on current evidence, looks close to impossible. Instead, it’s expectation management: what’s a publicly acceptable proportion of hackers to breach the system, and maybe more importantly, how much can you ask of rule-abiding players before they start getting genuinely pissed off by your AC requirements? What’s a palatable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackstone%27s_ratio">Blackstone’s ratio</a> of inconvenienced innocents versus catchable perps?</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>EA</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>So far, there haven’t been any recorded instances of EA – or Riot, whose Vanguard system also goes rooting around in the deepest depths of your PC – using kernel-access anti-cheat for anything untoward. But having to manually enable Secure Boot, especially if you’re not a frequent BIOS spelunker, is enough of a faff that for someone, somewhere, it’s going to chip away at goodwill. There have been recorded instances of user-end problems after the fact, too. The most ironic of which being that Battlefield 6’s anti-cheat can actually <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mlwcbl/battlefield_6_just_told_me_to_uninstall_valorant/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=whitespace&amp;embed_host_url=https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-anti-cheat-faces-issues-with-val">clash with Valorant’s</a>, like two hench bouncers trying to fit through the same doorframe. Last year, a more extreme case of 'acceptable loss' calculations saw <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/respawn-have-killed-apex-legends-steam-deck-support-in-the-name-of-anti-cheat">Steam Deck players booted permanently out of Apex Legends</a>, on the grounds that the handheld's Linux-based OS was making it too hard to keep cheaters away.</p>
<p>For now, developers seem to be weighing security more heavily than convenience. Respawn would later, with barely concealed pride, <a href="https://x.com/Respawn/status/1865148176275247312">wheel out an "infection rate" graph</a> as evidence that dropping Linux support was a worthy sacrifice. And as for Battlefield 6... well, their beta just got half a million concurrents. For all the grumbling about Secure Boot, it sure does look like players are happy to go along with it.</p>
<p>Provided, anyway, that it’s in service of an anti-cheat system that broadly works – or at least one that enough people <em>perceive</em> to work. Secure Boot might not be a particularly strong turn-off, but the one thing that gets players quitting faster than being lasered by some prick with X-ray vision is the belief, justified or otherwise, that he or his ilk will show up in the next game too. Battlefield 6 can’t stop every single cheater. But it’ll need to keep quiet the ones that do.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-battlefield-6-betas-hacking-problem-shows-the-difficulty-in-playing-cat-and-mouse-with-cheaters]]></content:encoded>

According to </span><a href="https://www.bigredfarm.jp/post/%E3%82%B0%E3%83%A9%E3%82%B9%E3%83%AF%E3%83%B3%E3%83%80%E3%83%BC-%E6%AD%BB%E5%8E%BB"><span>the official obituary</span></a><span>, the horse (who is male in real life) passed due to multiple organ failure.

It’s a living canvas that anyone can draw on, and that includes making a tribute to race horses who are no longer with us. A group of Umamusume fans started creating a piece on the map around Dolores, Quezon in the Philippines, where many of the organizing fans are based. The artwork depicts Grass Wonder walking through a field with a bouquet of sunflowers in hand. The text “Farewell, Grass Wonder” is shown above her in a blue sky.

However, this ended after less than a day of availability "due to sales exceeding expectations", according to a <a href="https://www.mcdonalds.co.jp/company/info/2025/0809b/">statement from McDonald's</a>. "We sincerely apologise for not being able to meet the expectations of our customers who have been looking forward to it due to the early end of distribution."</p>
<p>However, as reported by <a href="https://www.pokebeach.com/2025/08/amid-chaos-mcdonalds-japan-sells-out-of-pokemon-tcg-promo-cards-in-less-than-a-day">Poké Beach</a>, the promotion resulted in chaos - long queues, card scalping, and food waste. Images show uneaten food left on the streets to rot as customers seek only the special card.</p>

<p>There are plenty of posts on social media sharing shock at the amount of food waste left by Pokémon fans.</p>

<p>Meanwhile on eBay, the Pikachu promo card is being sold for around £25 each, while the full set of six cards is double that. There are also reports of McDonald's employees illegally selling boxes of the cards.</p>

<p>The promotion follows last year's chaos at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, where an exclusive Pikachu trading card was available among other merchandise and was quickly snapped up by scalpers to be sold for inflated prices.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> has comfortably maintained its position within the top five, while the platform split for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tears of the Kingdom</a> <em>just</em> <em>about</em> favours the original Switch over Switch 2.</p>

			<p>Earlier this year, Embark Studios, the team behind popular free-to-play FPS The Finals, was heavily showcasing its upcoming third-person extraction shooter, ARC Raiders, with a large-scale public playtest this past April, followed by a <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-arrives-on-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc-in-october-2025/">major release date trailer</a> at <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/summer-game-fest/">Summer Game Fest 2025</a>.</p>



<p>Since then, we've not seen anything more of the game, and Embark Studios has just confirmed that we'll continue to see nothing until we're much closer to its October 30th launch date. In a statement published to the game's official X account, Embark Studios has confirmed the team is in a heads-down state leading up to launch.</p>



<p>There won't be another public playtest for the game before launch, and Embark won't be featuring the game at Gamescom 2025, which is a little more than a week away at the time of this writing. </p>



<p>"<em>Our focus is now on polishing and expanding the experience, and putting all the learnings from TT2 into action ahead of release</em>," the statement reads. "<em>Just so you know, we're not planning additional public tests before launch. We've learned from our last announcement that it's crucial to keep expectations in check, so we also want to be clear that we won't be at Gamescom. But don't worry, our launch campaign will kick off before you know it!"</em></p>



<p>"<em>We'll have many more updates for you in the lead-up to launch. Thank you for all the support and encouragement you've been sending our way! It means the world</em>."</p>

<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-tech-test-hands-on-promising-extractions/">Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo got to check out ARC Raiders earlier this year</a>, and in his preview noted it as a "<em>promising</em>" title, though of course there's only so much that can be gleamed from public playtests ahead of launch. That said, Alessio marked that "<em>Embark seems to have mixed in enough familiar and new elements to create an exciting recipe.</em>"</p>

<p>The<i> Puyo Puyo Tetris</i> series combines two classic puzzle franchises into a single fun and vibrant experience, and it tends to be a pretty damn good time. With the Nintendo Switch 2 now out in the wild, fans of the series can get their hands on <i>Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S</i>, an enhanced version of 2020’s <i>Puyo Puyo Tetris 2</i>. You can tell it’s enhanced because of the “S”, which is the universal way to know something is extra cool, I think.</p> <p>Anyway, this new version of the game brings a variety of upgrades and new features, such as the new 2v2 Doubles Mode, a bunch of additional characters, and even mouse controls. But if you’re a diehard fan, you’ll probably be checking out the Adventure Mode, which sends you off on a journey across an overworld map to compete against foes for some puzzle mayhem. How long will you spend seeing things through? How does its mouse mode work? And what should you consider before grabbing a physical version? Let’s take a look.</p> <h2><span id="how-long-does-it-take-to-beat-puyo-puyo-tetris-2s%e2%80%98s-adventure-mode"></span>How long does it take to beat <i>Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S</i>‘s Adventure Mode?<span></span></h2> <p>So, let’s get something out of the way: <i>Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S</i> is a puzzle game with endless replayability, so how many hours of fun you get out of it will be based on how much you enjoy <i>Puyo Puyo</i> and <i>Tetris</i>. However, the Adventure Mode tells a story with missions to tackle, speaking more to folks who like a campaign to tackle. And that campaign is finite, naturally.</p>

 <p><b>Simply reaching the end of </b><b><i>Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S</i></b><b>‘s Adventure Mode can take 10-15 hours</b>, depending on your skill level. But you can stretch things out much further by trying to tackle every optional mission and side story the game has to offer. Additionally, completionists will want to aim to get a full four-star rating on every mission to show they know their shit. Not me, though, because I’m equally dreadful at <i>Puyo Puyo</i> and <i>Tetris</i>.</p> <p>Speaking of being bad at puzzle games, you can mess with the difficulty to help set you up for success if you’re not making any headway in the campaign. I don’t feel much shame admitting that I’m just not very fast or good at stacking all this colorful stuff, and neither should you.</p> <h2><span id="how-well-does-mouse-mode-work-on-puyo-puyo-tertris-2s"></span>How well does mouse mode work on <i>Puyo Puyo Tertris 2S</i>?<span></span></h2> <p>Not only does the <i>2S</i> version of this game toss in the 2v2 Doubles Mode, it also allows you to use the Switch’s “mouse mode” to move your blocks around. In this mode you’ll use your shoulder button to rotate the block, while pulling down with the mouse will accelerate how fast the block falls. While this adds a level of physicality you might otherwise not expect in <i>Tetris</i>, it can be a challenge to pull the mouse down in a perfectly straight line, so don’t be surprised if the blocks land a little to the left or right when using this mode.</p>

 <h2><span id="puyo-puyo-tetris-2s%e2%80%99-physical-version-comes-on-a-gamekey-card"></span><i>Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S</i>’ physical version comes on a Game-Key Card<span></span></h2> <p>If you were hoping to grab a physical copy of this game, you should know that you’ll still need to download the full game with an internet connection. The card that ships in the case is only a key for a license to download the game and doesn’t have the full data available for you to play.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-nintendo-survey-game-key-carts-2000614465">Switch 2 Owners Are Leaping On A Survey To Express Fury Over Game Key Cards</a></p> <p>On the flip side, you can still share or resell this Game-Key card, which you can’t do with a “digital” version. <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-nintendo-survey-game-key-carts-2000614465">Game-Key cards are an ongoing frustration</a> for Switch 2 fans, and <i>Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S </i>is no exception.</p> <hr> <p><i>Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S</i> is available now on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

<p>He’s the leader of the bunch, you know him well, but where is Donkey Kong in the roster of <i>Mario Kart World</i>? When you load up the game and try to find the newly-redesigned DK, you may be disappointed to not be able to find him. Luckily, you can find him without too much trouble! Here’s what you need to know to unlock Donkey Kong in <i>Mario Kart World</i>, which tracks he’s best on, and what karts you should use when playing as him.</p> <h2><span id="how-to-unlock-donkey-kong-in-mario-kart-world"></span>How to Unlock Donkey Kong in Mario Kart World<span></span></h2> <p>To unlock Donkey Kong, you only need to complete the Mushroom Cup in the Grand Prix mode. It might seem like a massive oversight to not have Donkey Kong unlock for completing the Banana Cup, but considering the Mushroom Cup culminates in the track DK Spaceport, it’s a good place to find him.</p> <p>Placement is irrelevant here; you only need to complete the grand prix to qualify. Whether you end up in first place or 24th, you’ll be able to add DK to your playable roster. You might want to try playing the cup again if you ended up in 24th, though.</p>

 <h2><span id="which-karts-are-best-for-donkey-kong"></span>Which karts are best for Donkey Kong?<span></span></h2> <p>There are at least four karts that will serve Donkey Kong well against other racers. Chagrin’ Truck is easily one of the fastest, but the Baby Blooper sacrifices top speed for some increased handling you may find useful. Following these two karts, the Reel Racer and Stellar Sled offer a nice combination of speed and handling.</p> <h2><span id="donkey-kong-unlockable-costumes"></span>Donkey Kong Unlockable Costumes<span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000616899" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616899"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616899">© Screenshot: Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Unfortunately, as if making him unlockable wasn’t enough, the DK disrespect continues with his unlockable costumes. He has one costume for players to find out in the open world. This puts him barely above minor drivers like Cow and Snowman, and below the main cast of characters. I don’t know how it happened that costumes for King Boo somehow rank above the ape that started it all, but here we are.</p> <p>Donkey Kong’s only unlockable costume is All-Terrain. You can find it by eating quite a few different foods from around the map; try out a variety and you’re bound to find it before long. It’s a great looking costume. Just try to block out any memories it surfaces of 2022’s disappointing Mario Strikers: Battle League.</p> <h2><span id="what-tracks-favor-donkey-kong"></span>What tracks favor Donkey Kong?<span></span></h2> <p>For the most part, other heavy-class characters like Bowser might be the pick to hit the best times. But tracks like Crown City, Desert Hills, Wario Shipyard, Koopa Troopa Beach, Dandelion Depths, Choco Mountain all typically favor the heavy class, so Donkey Kong should perform well here.</p> <hr> <p><i>Mario Kart World </i>is available now on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

			<p>The price of the PlayStation 5 in the United States promises to remain stable for the immediate future, as Sony has already taken measures to limit the impact of tariffs.</p>



<p>During the Q1 2026 Earnings Call a couple of days ago, as transcribed by <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4810238-sony-group-corporation-sony-q1-2026-earnings-call-transcript">Seeking Alpha</a>, Sony CFO Lin Tao confirmed the company is diversifying their supply chain, and production has already been transfered outside China for units to be sold in the United States to limit the impact of the tariffs. Regarding peripherals, the shift is still ongoing and will be completed by the end of the first half of the fiscal year. Regarding the company's pricing strategy for consoles, the Sony CFO couldn't make a definitive statement, as factors like annual profit, lifetime value, sell-in volume and expected content sales will be considered, as well as how consumers react to prices. As such, the strategy remains flexible.</p>



<p>The current worldwide economic situation is making it challenging for console manufacturers to keep prices down. Back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-price-increased/">April</a>, the price of the PlayStation 5 was increased in Europe, the UK, and Australia, and although it hasn't in the United States, there's no certainty it will at some point, judging from the statement above. Nintendo, however, did not manage to keep the price of its previous generation system, as the Japanese company has <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-us-price-changes-nintendo-switch-2/">increased</a> the price of all of the original Nintendo Switch models in the US, with price increases ranging from $30 to $50.</p>



<p>Economic uncertainty is definitely influencing how the next console generation will shape up. According to leaks, Sony is designing the PlayStation 6 to deliver a 4K, 120 FPS experience while keeping costs down, <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-will-deliver-5-10x-ray-tracing-performance-over-base-ps5-a-4k-120-fps-console-will-be-a-compelling-proposition-at-anything-below-900/">a proposition that would be enticing at any price below $900</a>, according to a former AMD employee.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/take-two-head-admits-civilization-vii-off-to-a-slow-start.1267188/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Take-Two head Strauss Zelnick has admitted that&nbsp;<em>Civilization VII</em>, the latest game in the long-running&nbsp;<em>Civilization&nbsp;</em>strategy series, is "off to a slow start", but he's confident that 2K and Firaxis can turn the game's fortunes around.</p>

<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-strauss-zelnick-insists-projections-for-the-lifetime-value-of-civilization-7-are-very-consistent-with-our-initial-expectations-for-the-title-despite-slow-start" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">IGN</a>, Zelnick acknowledged that&nbsp;<em>Civilization VII</em>'s beginnings haven't exactly been auspicious, and that the development team has had to "make changes" to the game's initial release version.</p>

<p>He's likely referring to the fact that when&nbsp;<em>Civilization VII&nbsp;</em>launched, it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/civilization-7-early-access-mixed-reviews-50k-players" rel="nofollow">met with a mixed reception</a> from the series' fanbase, with common criticisms including its UI and the sweeping changes made to the game's core gameplay. 2K and Firaxis subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/civilization-7-ui-problems-fixes-coming" rel="nofollow">pledged to address those criticisms</a>&nbsp;and to continue updating and improving the game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/civilization-vii-slow-start-city.jpg?itok=kYZFGVYt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/civilization-vii-slow-start-city.jpg?itok=0gpmKNE- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Civilization VII&nbsp;</em>is off to a "slow start", Take-Two has acknowledged, but boss Strauss Zelnick is optimistic.</figcaption></figure><p>Despite&nbsp;<em>Civ VII</em>'s "slow start", Zelnick remains optimistic about the game's "lifetime value", suggesting that the long-term performance of the game will make up for its less-than-ideal beginnings. He says that "consumer uptake is better and better" when it comes to&nbsp;<em>Civ VII</em>, and that it will eventually "take its place in its civilization pantheon".</p>

<p>Zelnick says the series "has always been a slow burn", and so the fact that <i>Civilization VII</i>'s initial sales have been slow doesn't mean the lifetime sales will be poor as well.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that while&nbsp;<em>Civ VII</em>'s <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1295660/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam numbers</a> are currently hovering around the 7,000 mark, its predecessor is enjoying about <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/289070/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">40,000 active players</a>, and even&nbsp;<em>Civilization V&nbsp;</em>has <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/8930/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">over double the players</a> of the latest game in the series.</p>

<p>Of course,&nbsp;<em>Civilization&nbsp;</em>is a series for which players often pick their favorite title and stay with it rather than immediately "upgrading", and so&nbsp;<em>Civilization VII&nbsp;</em>could well achieve the same player numbers as its successors in time.&nbsp;<em>Civ VII&nbsp;</em>is also available on consoles, so many of its players may be on different platforms, too.</p>
