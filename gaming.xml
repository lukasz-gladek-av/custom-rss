Signs are pointing to supplies being limited and almost everyone is expecting the cards to sell out. As a result, some people are camping outside Micro Centers despite cold weather, rain, and the retailer discouraging the behavior, all for a chance to buy a new, powerful GPU. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>On January 30 <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nvidia-nvda-ai-graphics-card-microsoft-stock-record-1851610332?_gl=1*1aipxgr*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczODA4OTc3My4xNTQuMS4xNzM4MDkwNzk0LjI4LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nvidia-nvda-ai-graphics-card-microsoft-stock-record-1851610332?_gl=1*1aipxgr*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczODA4OTc3My4xNTQuMS4xNzM4MDkwNzk0LjI4LjAuMA..">Nvidia</a></span> will begin selling both the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/nvidia-rtx-50-series-everything-we-know-so-far/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/nvidia-rtx-50-series-everything-we-know-so-far/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$2,000 RTX 5090 GPU</a></span> and the slightly-less-powerful-but-still-beefy $1,000 RTX 5080 GPU.

<p>On the surface, Medieval Dynasty looks like the type of pump-and-dump indie game that studios toss out to earn a quick buck before moving on to the next project. But that’s utterly incorrect in this case, as developer Render Cube continues to impress with content update after update. The most recent release, Medieval Dynasty update 2.3, allows us to paint buildings, construct house presets, stack items, and so much more!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-new-in-medieval-dynasty-update-2-3">What’s New in Medieval Dynasty Update 2.3?</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Right, so the house presets, economy tab, and item stacking are excellent additions that will make life in Medieval Dynasty ten times easier. But let’s be honest, we’re all here for the ability to paint our structures. We can have a brightly-colored town, ready to catch a trader’s eye or perhaps a wolf. It’s likely the latter.</p>

<li><strong>House Presets</strong></li>



<li><strong>Economy Summary Tab</strong></li>

</ul>

There the game's story will continue as players progress their characters to the new level cap of 55, all the while participating in new world events and field dungeons.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIXmI-iiyew" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uIXmI-iiyew" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">There are big changes coming to Throne and Liberty's endgame too, with the update set to introduce a new activity in the form of Solo Dungeons. These are intended as a way to ease players into more difficult endgame group content. Those looking for a true endgame challenge will be able to tackle new 3-Star difficulty dungeons.</p><p dir="ltr">In terms of systems, Throne and Liberty's current Weapon Mastery mechanic will be getting revamped. Details are still light for now, but Amazon states that it will add "another layer of personalization" to progressing weapons, allowing players to alter or empower specific skills. Current Weapon Mastery levels will be converted into experience points in the new system.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to the Weapon Mastery changes, a new Artifact system is also being introduced. In what sounds similar to tier sets from other MMOs like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a>, acquiring sets of Artifact gear will activate bonuses by equipping two, four, and six pieces of the same set. Two pieces of each set consist of a Solar Stone and Lunar Stone, which grant an active skill and passive skill respectively. This new type of gear can only be acquired from Abyss Dungeons in the Talandre region or from Nebula Island, a new time-restricted area that features hourly events and periodic field bosses.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/throne-and-liberty-launches-to-big-concurrent-player-numbers-but-not-as-big-as-new-world-or-lost-ark/1100-6526849/" data-ref-id="1100-6526849">Throne and Liberty launched in October 2024 to big concurrent player numbers on Steam</a>, even if they were smaller compared to Amazon's previous MMO launches for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/new-world/" data-ref-id="5000-489582">New World</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/lost-ark/" data-ref-id="5000-533053">Lost Ark</a>. Though its player counts have been steadily declining, it still regularly ranks among the top 50 most-played games on Steam by player count. Its most recent significant update came in December, when Throne and Liberty added the <a href="https://www.playthroneandliberty.com/en-us/news/articles/the-call-of-the-spear-release-notes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">spear</a> as a new weapon.</p>

It takes the character back to a high school setting in a modern age but an alternate universe from that in the MCU. Voice actor Hudson Thames is reprising his role as Spidey from Marvel’s popular <em>What If ... ?</em> series and recently shared one of his favorite things about the new show.

<p>Nintendo remains one of the largest and most popular gaming companies in the world. Known for its Mario, Legend of Zelda, and Pokémon franchises, Nintendo has become a household name over the last 40+ years. That’s why Nintendo’s quarterly earnings reports are closely watched by analysts, investors, and consumers alike.</p>



<p>It’s important to know when the next earnings report is, what time it starts, and how you can follow it live. These quarterly updates provide insights into Nintendo’s financial health, performance from its hardware and games, and general outlooks for the months ahead.</p>



<p>What is Nintendo’s current focus on the heels of recent game releases and the Nintendo Switch 2 announcement? Are there any concerns to address? All that gets answered with each call.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-next-nintendo-earnings-report-date">When Is The Next Nintendo Earnings Report Date?</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo</a> is currently scheduled to deliver its third quarter (Q3) earnings for fiscal year (FY) 2025 on Tuesday, February 4.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As to why the company is releasing its third quarter earnings in February, Nintendo’s fiscal calendar runs from April 1-March 31. Their third quarter runs from October 1-December 31, meaning the latest call will include information from the holiday sales season.</p>



<p>The company’s quarters are structured as follows:</p>



<ul>
<li>Q1: April 1 – June 30</li>



<li>Q2: July 1 – September 30</li>



<li>Q3: October 1 – December 31</li>



<li>Q4: January 1 – March 31</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-next-nintendo-earnings-report-start-time">Next Nintendo Earnings Report Start Time</h2>



<p>The next Nintendo earnings report is scheduled to start after trading closes in Japan on February 4, 2025. For those in the United States, that would put it somewhere between 2am and 5am ET.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-access-to-nintendo-s-earnings-report">How To Access To Nintendo’s Earnings Report?</h2>



<p>If you want to read Nintendo’s quarterly earnings report, you can do so via the company’s website. You have to simply do the following:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to Nintendo’s <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Investor Relations page</a></li>



<li>Under “What’s New” there will be the option to select the “Nine Months Financial Results…” from the list. There will be options to view presentation material and view the Q&amp;A summary. Just select which material you want to view.</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-what-to-expect-from-nintendo">What To Expect From Nintendo</h2>



<p>In its upcoming earnings call, Nintendo is likely to mention the Nintendo Switch 2, which was revealed in January. The call comes before the full Nintendo Direct presentation for the new console, so specific information on the system might be scarce. We’re also likely to get updates on Nintendo game sales totals for titles like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Super Mario Party Jamboree, and more. Lastly, Nintendo will give an updated forecast for its year-end and fourth quarter financials.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-last-nintendo-earnings-report">The Last Nintendo Earnings Report</h2>



<p>When Nintendo last reported its quarterly earnings, it announced that the Nintendo Switch had sold 146.04 million units in its lifespan. It was also revealed, however, that general revenue was down to $1.82 billion year-over-year, marking a a 19.8% decline. Regarding its games, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom sold 2.58 million copies in just four days of sales while Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD sold 1.57 million copies during the quarter.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-earnings-calls">What Are Earnings Calls?</h2>



<p>Quarterly earnings calls are meetings held publicly traded companies to provide updates on their overall financial performance. Typically, these calls are open to shareholders, analysts, and media to call in and ask questions. The public, regardless if they’re a shareholder or not, is also able to listen to these calls live as they happen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alongside the calls themselves, companies will often put out a press release and presentation with important details included ahead of the call taking place. This allows investors, analysts, and media to prepare coverage or questions based on the information provided.</p>

                <p>One of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft's</a> most famous pieces of cut content, the Karazhan Crypts, is finally playable today as dungeon. The new piece of endgame content is part of WoW's more experimental <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-classic-season-of-discovery-looks-to-make-a-20-year-old-game-surprising-again/1100-6519561/" data-ref-id="1100-6519561">Season of Discovery</a> servers. </p><p dir="ltr">WoW is filled with unused areas or places that were never fully fleshed out, and vanilla WoW's Karazhan Crypts are one of them. It's a dark, moody area below the tower of Karazhan (which itself wouldn't actually become a raid until the game's first expansion) in the original version of WoW that has long captured the imagination of players. Now, as part of a new content phase for WoW Classic's current seasonal servers, the Karazhan Crypts have been transformed into a five-man dungeon for players to explore.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLT6rP4L-Pc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rLT6rP4L-Pc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">As detailed by WoW Youtuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLT6rP4L-Pc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WillIE</a> (in partnership with Blizzard), the dungeon itself is unlike others players may be used to. Inspired by classic dungeon-crawling RPGs, the Karazhan Crypts are shrouded in a darkness that can only be dispelled with a magical torch. There's no mini-map to rely on, so players will need to stick together as they explore the dark reaches of the crypt and encounter new horrors. In keeping with the "discovery" aspect of the season, players will want to keep an eye out for secrets inside the dungeon that may aid their adventuring party.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a dungeon designed for players who have already acquired some endgame gear, and the new loot found within the crypts will be comparable to gear earned from raids like Blackwing Lair and the Temple of Ahn' Qiraj.

            <p>
Following a bit of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3s-eagerly-awaited-patch-8-out-now-on-ps5-but-larian-says-it-shouldnt-be">false start</a> yesterday, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>'s Patch 8 stress test is now officially underway on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC, giving select participants the opportunity to explore a range of new features ahead of its full release - with split-screen co-op support for Xbox Series S being the surprise (and long-awaited) inclusion.
</p>
<p>
Developer Larian <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-is-getting-new-subclasses-cross-play-and-more-next-year">detailed Baldur's Gate 3's Patch 8</a> back in November, promising 12 new sub-classes, cross-play, new camera features, and more. At the time, it revealed it would holding a closed stress test ahead of a full launch - in order to help it "catch things before they can become an issue" - with registrations having been open since then.
</p>
<p>
And now, the first wave of invites has gone out to successful applicants, and Patch 8's stress test is live. Larian covers some key details relating to the release in an <a href="https://baldursgate3.game/news/community-update-33-patch-8-stress-test-now-live_134">accompanying blog post</a>, providing notes on the use of mods during cross-play, as well as instructions on requesting additional keys for participants wishing to explore cross-play with friends not yet in the test.

<p>
The big surprise, though, is confirmation that Patch 8 will also finally introduce split-screen co-op to Xbox Series S after an extremely long wait. The feature has proven to be a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-screen-is-a-must-for-baldurs-gate-3-on-xbox-series-s-says-larian">bit of a headache</a> for Larian, and was initially blamed for Baldur's Gate 3's delayed release on Xbox back in 2023, as the studio struggled to optimise it sufficiently for Microsoft's lower-spec console. In the end, Series S split-screen was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-drops-series-s-split-screen-as-solution-to-bring-baldurs-gate-3-to-xbox-this-year">dropped completely</a> and wasn't included when the game finally launched for Xbox Series X/S in December 2023.
</p><p>
And it seemed like that was that. But now - more than 12 months later - Larian has confirmed the feature has made the cut for Patch 8, meaning it's just squeaked into Baldur's Gate 3's very last content update. There's not much more to report on its inclusion, however, with Larian simply noting stress test participants on Xbox can try it out early starting today.
</p>
<p>
Larian hasn't yet said how long it expects the stress test to last before Patch 8's full release, but Baldur's Gate 3 players eager to get involved can <a href="https://larian.com/stress-test-register">still register their interest</a> on its website.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-perfect-video-game-run-won%E2%80%99t-solve-my-problems.1094067/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/long-dark-dlc-perfect<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the Aftermath newsletter last week, I wrote about the tragic end of a recent run I was on in <em>The Long Dark</em>, my favorite survival game. I almost immediately started a new run, determined to do everything better–no, <em>perfectly–</em>this time. Stop me if you’ve learned this life lesson already, but trying to do everything perfectly isn’t much fun at all.</p><p>In the survival sandbox of <a href="https://www.thelongdark.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Long Dark</em>,</a> you’re given a huge, snowy world to survive in as long as possible, and how you go about doing that is up to you. As I’ve <a href="https://aftermath.site/long-dark-survival" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">written before</a>, despite hundreds of hours in the game, my runs have never lasted very long. My last run was only about 35 in-game days, but it was solid: I had good gear, had crafted a bow and a ton of arrows, and was well on my way to getting to check out the recently-added safehouse customization when I lost it all due to bad luck and panic. Lessons learned, I thought, promptly starting again.</p><p>I hit the wrong button when starting my new run, because I spawned in the game’s remote DLC maps instead of the main map that I intended to. It wasn’t my ideal place to start a run, but it did mean I was well set up to check out the narrative that the DLC added, which I’ve never pursued in earnest. I decided to embrace my mistake and make that my plan, focusing on trekking across the game’s world repairing the required transmitters and finding their related bunkers.</p><p>I’m ashamed to admit I almost immediately took to (let’s call it what it is) cheating by looking up guides to the locations. When I learned that one might take me back into the path of the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rcmacleod.bsky.social/post/3lgk4aeeg4223" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cougar</a> that ended my previous run, I became fixated on the idea of completing that part of the story before the cougar spawned. This wasn’t hard–in the difficulty I’m playing on, I had plenty of time–but it stressed me out a lot. I beelined across the game’s world, grabbing what I could get on my way. This single-minded focus led to a couple mistakes, wearing way too heavy clothes and missing places where I could have grabbed some good loot, including some of the items needed to repair the transmitters. This latter mistake slowed me down once I realized it, but once I repaired the necessary transmitter, I raced toward the bunker. I panicked when I got lost in a transition mine, and I fell through thin ice several times as I split my attention between the radio required to locate the bunker and glancing around wildly for extra-dangerous <a href="https://thelongdark.fandom.com/wiki/Aurora" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">aurora</a> predators.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Right now, my character is in that bunker, well before the cougar has spawned. I know where the other transmitters and their bunkers are because I’ve watched unnecessary hours of YouTube videos and pored over player-made maps. I keep running over my plan in my head: I’ll drop my collected gear at my favorite base, hit the next transmitter early in the morning so I can be right where the next bunker is when the aurora starts, then hit the last transmitter and bunker on my way to another good looting spot. Closing out this part of the DLC will require going back to an area I don’t terribly want to trek to, and I’m torn between locking in the ending so I can pursue the next part of the DLC on a different save if I die, and trusting myself to survive long enough to let it happen naturally.</p><p>Logging out for the night with my character safely ensconced in the bunker, I realized I was feeling distinctly stressed out and <em>weird</em> about the run, and about a game that I really love. In many ways, <em>The Long Dark</em> is a game about fucking up, about embracing impermanence and coming to peace with seeing your hard work vanish in an instant. For the decade I’ve been playing the game, I’ve never been too attached to a run, but now that I’m trying to play it “right,” I find myself feeling like I’m not playing it right at all. I’m afraid to take risks or encounter wildlife, feel like exploring is just wasted time, and trying to optimize every choice and path in ways that seem to come naturally to players far more skilled than me, but which loses the feeling of free-flowing adventure that I like best about the game, even when it leads to disaster.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It has of course occurred to me that I got <em>really into</em> this game again around the recent election and its subsequent horrors. <em>The Long Dark</em> is a wilderness full of unpredictable dangers, which certainly fits the current vibe, and an empty world far away from people, which certainly fits with my desire to fade away into the woods when things in my life get tough. I’m sure a therapist would point out that my fixation on getting everything in a video game to go exactly my way stands in contrast to the helplessness of the current administration’s <a href="https://19thnews.org/2025/01/trump-transgender-executive-order/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">attacks on trans people</a> like me. This is all one big exercise in sublimation and avoidance, though at least it’s one aimed at a video game I really like instead of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/how-to-play-games-sober-1839509936" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more destructive directions</a> I used to favor.</p><p>But I feel like I’m ruining my favorite game for myself by playing it this way; my approach feels like it’s against both the spirit of the game and the way I most like to play it. I’m making myself a little crazy in a way that I at least had the self-awareness to realize is not entirely about a video game, and I have enough stress in my life to not need to make myself stressed about a video game, of all things, too.&nbsp;</p><p>While I don’t tend to go in on the idea of video games as escapism, I want to hold that it’s OK for me to distract myself from the ongoing onslaught of horrors. But if I’m going to use a game in that way, I want to make sure I’m not just making myself feel worse. I want games to feel fun and joyous, or at least the good kind of stressful. I don’t want my run to be about control and perfection; I want to explore more of <em>The Long Dark</em>’s maps and mess around with mechanics I haven’t engaged with much, to see what happens when I play around in one of my favorite video game worlds. And games need to be just one way I find an outlet for my feelings, instead of hanging them all on the perfect run.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-phoenix-labs-layoffs-studio-closure-far-cry-dauntless"><h3>Another Big Day For Layoffs In Another Big Year For Layoffs</h3></a><p>Ubisoft is closing its third studio in two months, and Phoenix Labs is bidding farewell to "the majority" of its workforce</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/quartz-ai-articles-go-media"><h3>G/O Media Is Publishing AI Slop Again</h3></a><p>News site Quartz is publishing a whole lot of AI-generated articles</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Microsoft’s Phil Spencer has given a new interview and explained that Xbox exclusives are a thing of the past as they no longer make financial sense. <a href="https://x.com/DestinLegarie/status/1883243143342231655">Destin Legarie</a> asked Phil if Starfield, one of 2023’s big Xbox exclusive games would be “staying put” and after a few moments Phil replied with a firm “No.”</p>
<p>“There’s no specific game… this kinda goes back to my red line answer, there’s no reason for me to put a ring fence around any game and say this game will not go to a place, where it would find players, where we would have business success for us.” He then adds “To keep games off other platforms, that’s not a path for us.”</p>


<p>The statements come almost exactly <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/15/four-xbox-games-are-coming-to-other-consoles-but-not-starfield-or-indy/">a year after Microsoft’s presentation i</a>n which they announced the first four games that would be coming to PlayStation and Nintendo, during which they specifically stated Starfield was not coming to other consoles, so a lot has changed in the last year.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/10/rumours-suggest-more-xbox-games-will-be-coming-to-ps5-and-switch/"> Rumours suggest</a> Flight Simulator, Hellblade 2, and the Halo Collection will be coming to PlayStation sometime this year.</p>
<p>Two reliable sources – NateTheHate and Windows Central’s Jez Corden – have been posting about the games in question.</p>
<p>“So, games that I have heard will be released multiplatform in 2025 beyond the obvious include Flight Simulator, which will come to PlayStation 5 and Switch 2, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2014/11/07/halo-the-master-chief-collection-review/">Halo: The Master Chief Collection</a>&nbsp;will be coming to PS5 and Switch 2 as well,” states Nate on his&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIhoTirZxlk">podcast.</a></p>
<p>Jez has confirmed he had also heard about Flight Simulator and Halo, and<a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/a-new-rumor-suggests-final-fantasy-7-remake-is-finally-coming-to-xbox-in-2025-with-rebirth-heading-across-in-2026-as-more-xbox-games-head-to-ps5-and-nintendo">&nbsp;adds</a>&nbsp;“I’ve heard that also Hellblade 2, Age of Mythology, and potentially Gears of War 1 Ultimate Edition are all also slated for PlayStation 5 this year, although I’m unsure if that includes the Nintendo Switch 2.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/eve-online-2025-roadmap-shared-in-directors-stream-two-expansions-coming/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, CCP Games shared their 2025 roadmap for the space MMO EVE Online during a Directors' stream. During this stream, it was announced that there will be two major expansions released, as well as the return of a fan-favorite in-game event, such as the EVE Fanfest 2025. This particular event will take place on May 1-3 at Reykjavik's Harpa Concert Hall. For those who want to watch the Directors' Stream from today, it is available to watch on the official CCP Games <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/ccp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitch</a> and<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ccpgames" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> YouTube</a> Channel.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Diving into the roadmap for EVE Online,<a href="https://wccftech.com/eve-online-receives-revenant-expansion-bringing-new-ships-dens-and-more-customizations/"> the Revenant storyline</a> will continue to play out across Q1 as the tensions continue to rise between the Deathless and the Drifters. This will then carry players over to the next expansion for EVE Online, which is set to release in Summer 2025, with a focus on empowering the players, offering new enhanced tools for customization and content creation.</p>
<p>"This year, we're putting even more power in the hands of our capsuleers," said Snorri Arnason, Game Director for EVE Online. "From customizing sovereign space to crafting missions that spark new alliances, the 2025 roadmap is all about letting players create and shape their own moments, their own stories, and ultimately being part of the history books of New Eden itself."</p>
<p>Aside from the summer expansion, as mentioned earlier, fan-favorite events will be making a return to EVE Online. This includes events such as Capsuleer Day, Crimson Harvest, and Winter Nexus. The second expansion for EVE Online is set to release in the Winter of 2025. There haven't been many details about this expansion yet, as more details for the Summer expansion will be yet to come.</p>
<p>For those interested, tickets for EVE Fanfest 2025 are on sale but are nearly sold out. Those who want to attend can purchase tickets from <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/eve-fanfest-2025-tickets-716031949837" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eventbrite</a>, with the price starting at $35. However, for those who want the full experience of Fanfest, the Festival Pass will cost you $295, which includes access to the party at the Top of the World, exclusive in-game content, an EVE Fanfest 2025 t-shirt, and a goodie bag.</p>
<p>"2025 will be monumental for EVE Online. We've listened to player feedback to refine our development process and create high-quality expansions that empower capsuleers. Join us in New Eden to experience a year filled with characters to meet, alliances to forge - or break - and thrilling stories to uncover. It's a year you don't want to miss!" says Bergur Finnbogason, EVE Online's Creative Director.</p>

                <p>Most of the early research into video games seemed to be designed to find a link between in-game violence and its effects on players in the real world. More recently, there have been studies about the adverse affects of gaming addiction. However, there's now research that suggests playing games may actually be beneficial for players, depending upon the type of the game.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/graphics/VIDEO-GAMES/MENTAL-HEALTH/akpeewkqgpr/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reuters</a>, the majority of the research into the benefits of gaming focuses on cozy video games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-island-getaway/1900-6417431/" data-ref-id="1900-6417431">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>. These casual games are designed to be soothing to play and almost impossible to lose. That genre also avoids putting players into overly stressful situations.</p><p>Hiroyuki Egami, an assistant professor at Nihon University, published a study conducted in Japan between 2020-2022 which found that participants experienced greatly reduced stress and an increase in mental health if they spent one extra hour playing games each day. A separate study by McMaster University assistant professor Michael Wong compared the benefits of casual gaming to meditation.</p><p>"To our surprise, there really wasn't a difference between the two forms of interventions," explained Wong. "For blood pressure and heart rate, there was no statistically significant difference between playing a video game and engaging in meditation."</p><p>This is an area of study that still remains largely unexplored, but these results are encouraging for players who have touted the benefits of gaming for years.</p><p>Improved mental health for players isn't the only way games are creating positive change. Players have also come together to help <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/awesome-games-done-quick-2025-raises-over-2-5-million-for-prevent-cancer-foundation/1100-6528769/" data-ref-id="1100-6528769">Awesome Games Done Quick 2025 raise $2.5 million</a> for the Prevent Cancer Foundation.

At its best, gaming can bring people together, and it's a side of the industry worth celebrating when given the chance.</p>

                <p>The Call of Duty series is an annual franchise, so it's expected that Microsoft's Activision division will launch a new Call of Duty this year, like it has every year since 2005. In fact, 2025 will mark 20 years in a row of Activision releasing a new Call of Duty game (the series debuted in 2003 but had no release in 2004).</p><p>It's still early days, and to be clear, Activision has not announced the new Call of Duty game that's expected to release in 2025. But there have been a handful of leaks and rumors about Call of Duty 2025, including a rumor that it's a sequel to Black Ops 2 set in the 2030s.</p><p>In this post, we're rounding up everything we know, and what's been rumored, about the next Call of Duty.</p><h2>What is Call of Duty 2025?</h2><p>If <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-2-call-of-duty-2025/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming</a>'s sources are correct, Call of Duty 2025 is a new Black Ops game, a sequel to 2012's Black Ops II--set in the early 2030s. 2024's Call of Duty game was also a Black Ops game--Black Ops 6--and this would mark the first time Black Ops games were released in back-to-back years. Specifically, Call of Duty 2025 is expected to pick up where Black Ops II left off--that game was set in 2025.</p><h2>When will Call of Duty 2025 be released?</h2><p>If Activision and Microsoft keep to the standard formula, fans can expect Call of Duty 2025 to launch in October or November 2025. It is likely to be announced at least a few months before that, with Activision almost assuredly using Call of Duty: Warzone to tease the next game, as it's done in the past.</p><h2>Will Call of Duty 2025 have a beta?</h2><p>Call of Duty 2025 is expected to have a pre-release multiplayer beta, as all recent entries in the series have. Now that Microsoft owns the franchise, fans can expect the beta to launch on all platforms at the same time, at least if the company sticks to the gameplan from Black Ops 6. Previously, Call of Duty betas were held first on PlayStation due to a co-marketing deal between Activision and Sony. The Black Ops 6 beta took place in August 2024, so it's reasonable to assume the Call of Duty 2025 beta could take place in August 2025.</p><h2>Preorder Call of Duty 2025</h2><p>While a new Call of Duty game coming out each year is one of the safest bets a person could make in the video game landscape, Call of Duty 2025 hasn't been announced yet and thus isn't available for preorder. If history serves as precedent, preorders for the game are likely to open around the time the game is officially announced.</p><h2>Call of Duty 2025 trailer information</h2><p>As of yet, Activision has not released any official trailers for Call of Duty 2025.</p><h2>Call of Duty 2025 platforms</h2><p>Activision has not announced the next Call of Duty, but it's likely to show up for Xbox, PlayStation, and PC. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/it-sure-sounds-like-xbox-games-are-coming-to-switch-2/1100-6529052/" data-ref-id="1100-6529052">alluded to bringing games to Nintendo Switch 2</a>, but whether or not this will include the next Call of Duty is unknown.</p><h2>Will Call of Duty 2025 be on Game Pass?</h2><p>Microsoft put Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 on Game Pass at launch, and it's expected the company will do the same for Call of Duty 2025.</p><h2>Call of Duty 2025 story, setting, and characters</h2><p>Insider Gaming reported that Call of Duty 2025 is a Black Ops II sequel set in the early 2030s, picking up after the events of Black Ops II. The Black Ops storyline is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/get-ready-for-black-ops-6-with-this-explainer-of-the-story-so-far/2900-5855/" data-ref-id="2900-5855">full of twists and turns and wild political conspiracies</a>, and it's expected that the new Call of Duty would continue this trend if it is indeed a new Black Ops game.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1000948621" data-promo-id="0"

            <p>
Developer Techland has teased plans for "multiple unannounced projects" set in the Dying Light universe - including new video games, board games, and a webcomic - as the zombie series celebrates its tenth birthday.
</p>
<p>
Dying Light 1 released on 26th January, 2015 and proved to be a massive hit for Techland, selling <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dying-light-2-has-surpassed-5m-copies-sold-since-launching-in-february">over 20m copies as of 2022</a>. A sequel followed in 2022, and an 18-hour standalone adventure, Dying Light: The Beast, is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dying-light-the-beast-is-a-new-18-hour-standalone-game-that-began-life-as-dlc">set to arrive this summer</a>.
</p>
<p>
And that's far from the end of Techland's Dying Light ambitions. The studio has now revealed it's planning "multiple unannounced projects" as it aims to position the series as the "ultimate zombie experience". According to the developer, these will "go beyond video games", and include the likes of board games, a webcomic series, merchandise, and "more".

<p>
"Our goal is to bring the world of Dying Light to even more people," Techland writes. "From the ongoing support of our currently released games to Dying Light: The Beast and beyond, there's never been a better time to be a Dying Light fan."
</p><p>
In the more immediate term, Techland is releasing new updates for Dying Light 1 &amp; 2 "very soon". The first game is poised to see the return of old events alongside new rewards, and will receive a range of "enhancements", including improved visual quality, a remastered soundtrack, and more. As for Dying Light 2: Stay Human, it's getting "further prologue changes", and its roguelite Tower Raid mode is set to become permanent.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, for those that haven't yet dipped their toes into Techland's open-world zombie series, Dying Light 1 &amp; 2 are both currently discounted on Xbox and PC.

Today is release day for The Game Kitchen's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-stone-of-madness">The Stone Of Madness</a>, an isometric tactical stealth game set in an 18th century monastery - "isometric tactical stealth game" being a pretty clinical way to describe the plight of sundry lost souls exploring a maze of hellish Catholic art populated by guards and ghouls.

<p>
As in Commandos, you control a group of characters with different skills, strengths and weaknesses. Unlike in Commandos, your characters have sanity bars and a range of narratively-grounded foibles and phobias - either present from the get-go, or sprouted in response to the hardships you put them through. Lewis Gordon <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-stone-of-madness-review">done a review for Eurogamer</a> and he makes it sound extremely appealing, half-cooked plot and tricksy controls notwithstanding.
</p>
<p>
I'm interested in The Stone Of Madness partly because it's from the Spanish studio behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blasphemous">Blasphemous</a>, a terrific study in religious horror, and partly because I've been thinking lately about the role of monastic orders in developing "modern" European understandings of time. For the philosopher Michel Foucault, the hourly and daily rites of forgotten generations of monks paved the way for the 9-to-5. Writing in <a href="https://archive.org/details/disciplinepunish0000fouc_j5k6">Discipline And Punish</a>, he describes the monasteries as "the specialists of time, the great technicians of rhythm and regular activities", and explores how they influenced the secular world by way of attached schools and poorhouses and eventually, industrial workplaces that "long retained a religious air".
</p>
<p>
This ancient discipline of timekeeping, as Foucault describes it, can also be traced to the variably time-locked worlds of video games. Being a game set in a monastery, The Stone Of Madness naturally makes the connection explicit. Its challenges and opportunities follow an elaborate day-night cycle, requiring you to match the right character to the right hour if you're to succeed. It takes inspiration on this count from another, much older Spanish production, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Abad%C3%ADa_del_Crimen">The Abbey Of Crime</a>, itself a loose adaptation of Umberto Eco's gargantuan monastic mystery novel The Name Of The Rose.

All this makes me wonder whether "monastic time" is a concept worth pursuing to other, non-monastic games, as both alternative and precursor to the better-known idea of the "game as a job", encapsulated by live service looting simulators. I'll hopefully have something lengthier to say about all that in the next few weeks. For the moment, The Stone Of Madness seems worth a stab. There's still <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1309710/The_Stone_of_Madness/">a Steam demo</a> live at the time of writing.

He’s ben making RPGs there ever since, from cult-classics like Xbox 360 exclusive <em>Lost Odyssey </em>to smaller mobile games like <em>Terra Battle</em>. Most recently his team shipped <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fantasian-final-fantasy-hironobu-sakaguchi-nobuo-uemats-1851729068&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fantasian-final-fantasy-hironobu-sakaguchi-nobuo-uemats-1851729068"><em>Fantasian: Neo Dimension</em>, an excellent old-school RPG</a></span> that began life as an Apple Arcade release in 2021, before recently getting remastered for consoles and PC. </p><p><em>Fantasian</em> definitely felt heavily inspired by <em>Final Fantasy VI</em>. It starred an amnesiac fighter trying to save a world on the brink of chaos, aided by an eclectic group of noble misfits. The details were different but the overall mood and focus on narrative drama felt reminiscent of SNES-era Final Fantasy games. Sakaguchi reportedly replayed <em>Final Fantasy VI</em>, which he helped write and produce, before making <em>Fantasian </em>and considered both games <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/fantasian-tied-final-fantasy-6-hironobu-sakaguchi-love-family?amp=1&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fantasian-tied-final-fantasy-6-hironobu-sakaguchi-love-family?amp=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kindred spirits through their mutual focus on family</a></span>. </p><p>But his next project will apparently feel even more closely inspired by one of his old franchise’s peak games. “It’s generally going to follow a similar style to my previous works, and it’ll be something that can be a successor to<em> Final Fantasy VI</em> in a good way—our goal is to create something old but new at the same time,” the veteran creator <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/24/24350575/hironobu-sakaguchi-interview-fantasian-neo-dimension&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/24/24350575/hironobu-sakaguchi-interview-fantasian-neo-dimension" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently told <em>The Verge</em></a></span>. “It’ll be part two of my farewell note.”</p><p>Sakaguchi said he had intended for <em>Fantasian</em> to be his final game, but had too much fun working with the team behind it to actually retire when it was done. “Humans are greedy creatures, aren’t we?” he told <em>The Verge</em>. “For that reason, I’m currently working on a new project with the same team that worked on <em>Fantasian Neo Dimension</em>.” </p><p>We don’t yet know what being a successor to<em> Final Fantasy VI </em>will mean for Mistalker’s next game. Retro HD-2D graphics? A sprawling cast of disparate characters brought together through shared tragedy and common purpose? A show-stopping opera scene foiled by a giant octopus? Or maybe Sakaguchi intends the connection to be more subtle and philosophical than that. </p><p>Fans will always pine for the direct sequel to <em>Final Fantasy VI</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-6-remake-hd-2d-dragon-quest-3-square-enix-1851702829&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-6-remake-hd-2d-dragon-quest-3-square-enix-1851702829">they’ve dreamed of but never got</a></span>. The legendary RPG maker, on the other hand, has much grander ambitions. He said, “In the distant future, or maybe after I have already left this world, I imagine this game will find its meaning if someone chooses to look into the legacy of either myself or <em>Final Fantasy</em>.”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/martha-is-dead-playstation-cut-content-face-peeling-masturbation/">Wired Productions</a> and Pollar Studio have released the first of three trailers for Karma: The Dark World in the lead-up to the release of the title. Karma: The Dark World is an upcoming first-person psychological horror that's set to channel iconic movie and game directors such as Lynch, Kojima, and Nolan. The first trailer is called 'ROAM.' At the moment, the release date for Karma: The Dark World still hasn't been announced, but it's said that it will soon be announced, most likely coinciding with the trailers that will be released. You can watch the brand-new trailer for the game below.</p>
<p><iframe title="KARMA: The Dark World | ROAM Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gQA9fdoVetQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As said above, this is the first of three trailers to be released for Karma: The Dark World, with the developers planning to release them to release key aspects of the game's story, as well as showing off the immersive world and intense gameplay mechanics that you'll have to contend with when playing the game. This first trailer is used to set the stage for the game, so players know what they are getting into when jumping into this first-person psychological horror.</p>
<p>"We are deeply saddened by the passing of director David Lynch. His art has had a profound influence on our game development, inspiring us to pay tribute to and learn from his work," said Ke Yang, Art Director of Pollard Studio. Even in the above trailer released, a quote by the iconic director is used to help set the scene.</p>
<p>For those who are hearing about this game for the first time, Karma: The Dark World is a psychological horror title where players will be playing as a Roam Agent and investigating the deepest and darkest secrets of their suspects' minds. The game takes place in an alternate timeline after the war in Germany. In the alternate timeline, Germany has instead fallen into a dystopian state that is ruled over by the Leviathan Corporation. The corporation uses mass surveillance and mind-bending technology to keep an eye on the citizens of the country, providing no privacy at all. Playing as Daniel McGovern, you investigate crime scenes and interview suspects to then report your findings back to Leviathan. However, it's not quite as it seems, and the world begins to crumble around him, where he doubts everything and anyone, including himself.</p>
<p>Karma: The Dark World has been developed in Unreal Engine 5 and will be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1376200/KARMA_The_Dark_World/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released soon on PC</a>, PlayStation 5, and Xbox.</p>
<p>Will you be playing Karma: The Dark World when it releases?</p>
