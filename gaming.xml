            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/dragon-age-veilguard-previews<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For the longest time there has been a sort of Holy Trinity when it comes to video games coverage. From magazines to websites, open almost any of them up from any time and you'll find an outlet built on three things: News, Previews and Reviews. </p><p>News, I get! We all love news. We've all done news, we all love news, hell, through all the years and changes this business has gone through even this website still does news. Same goes for reviews; from people who view them as purchasing guides to those who are much cooler about it and see them as a form of criticism, they're fun to write and are still some of the most popular forms of video game writing on the internet. </p><p>But man, previews? Eehhhhh. Previews are a legacy of the darkest days of video game coverage, when the press was essentially a mildly independent arm of the industry's marketing apparatus. For a while there--and I know we distanced ourselves from them at Kotaku for years--a lot of sites wised up to the fact a preview is in most cases just carrying water for the people selling the video game and cut back on doing them. </p><p><a href="https://kotaku.com/apologies-if-we-wasted-your-time-with-that-preview-5985143" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Our former EiC Stephen Totilo even wrote a whole thing about it</a> (I was one of the people who proposed nixing them), and included examples of the previews we started saying no to, the reasons why and the few exceptions to the rule. I think every one of those reasons still stands today:</p><blockquote><p>The concern that we have at&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em>&nbsp;about previews is that you, the reader, will feel misled by them. You'll read an optimistic preview in May and then wonder why the game we previewed seems, in November, to be junk. You'll wonder if the preview was de facto promotion, if it was the result of lazy, unskeptical reporting or even an honest effort made by people too foolish to identify the impossibility of assessing an autumn game in the spring.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>That was written in 2013, when I had hoped more selective preview coverage might become more of a thing, but in hindsight it may as well have been written in a different timeline. I woke up this morning in 2024 to find my social media feed awash with games media getting extremely excited for <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> having played through a seven-hour preview.</p><p>What are we, as press, doing here? This type of broadly uncritical coverage of a select slice of a AAA video game isn't serving anyone's readership, they don't <em>need</em> to know any of this. As for publications, nobody knows what anything outside of those seven hours is like or, say, how many bugs the game will have at launch. Every site previewing <em>Veilguard </em>will presumably also be reviewing it in just a few weeks, they can just pass judgement on it then! The only thing a glowing preview is doing now is generating hype, and ahead of release the only people truly being served by this hype are EA, who are banking on the preorders and wishlists all the positive coverage will generate. </p><p>We, and I mean video games media, can do better than this! Readers deserve better than this! Yet here we are. Times for this industry have rarely been tougher, the line video games media has to toe between serving their readership and keeping companies happy has never been more precarious. Which is why I don't want to pick on any particular site or writer here; this isn't something individuals are responsible for, <a href="https://aftermath.site/games-journalism-an-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it's a broadly systemic problem, like so many other issues facing games media</a>.</p><p>It's still not a great look, though. And if you as a fan read any of these previews and got excited, please remember that, of all the series that exist on this Earth, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=dragon+age+pacing&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_en-GBAU1030AU1030&amp;oq=dragon+age+pacing&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOdIBCDE4ODhqMGo3qAIAsAIA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you might want to wait</a> until someone has paced their way through an entire <em>Dragon Age</em> game before saying it's a Game Of The Year contender.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">Today, during the Netflix Geeked Week 2024 Live presentation, one segment was dedicated to the growing Netflix Games platform on mobile devices. Here, we learned that pre-registrations for Monument Valley 3--the latest in the critically acclaimed mobile puzzle series--are now open ahead of its December 10 launch.</p><p dir="ltr">New footage for Monument Valley 3 was shown behind closed doors during a press briefing earlier this week. One clip showed an extended look at the new sailing traversal mechanic briefly shown in the reveal trailer, as players will hold their finger down and move it around the screen to guide the boat in different directions. Another clip presented an unique puzzle--in the series's trademark isometric view--where some of the pathways were rendered invisible by an intense white light in the background.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB8LxfuXEHs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZB8LxfuXEHs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The release-date announcement comes one month after Monument Valley 3 was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monument-valley-3-announced-exclusively-for-netflix-games-at-gamescom-with-prequel-ports/1100-6525992/">revealed during Gamescom Opening Night Live</a> last month. The first two Monument Valley games will hit the Netflix platform ahead of this new installment--with the original launching today and Monument Valley 2 dropping on October 29.</p><p dir="ltr">The Netflix Geeked Week presentation revealed more games coming to Netflix Games in the coming weeks, including a new Spongebob-themed puzzle game, Spongebob: Bubble Pop F.U.N., as well as Blood Line: A Rebel Moon Game and Squid Game Unleashed, both based on Netflix properties. Other announced titles include Street Fighter IV: Champion Edition and Civilization VI--both listed as "coming soon"--and a new take on the classic board game Battleship, which launches September 24.</p><p dir="ltr">Monument Valley 3 launches December 10 on mobile devices, exclusively through the Netflix app. All games available through Netflix are free to download with any active Netflix subscription.</p>

So far, the story has unfolded as two movies, with the first, Rebel Moon Part 1: A Child of Fire, debuting in December 2023, and the second, The Scargiver, arriving April 2024. However, both films <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rebel-moon-star-says-negative-reviews-zack-snyder-movie-really-affected-her"><u>received negative reviews</u></a> from fans and critics alike upon release.

I'd say, "Guys, we can't. We can't do that." And then they'd come back, "Well, what about this?" And so we were really, I think able to land on something that was really world building, but also consistent with the world.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Rebel Moon –&nbsp;Part One: A Child of Fire Gallery</h3></div></output><p>Stay tuned for more information on how Blood Line will build on the Rebel Moon universe when it launches sometime next year.

                <p>The Gears of War series hasn’t seen much movement in recent years, with Gears 5 dropping in 2019 followed by Gears Tactics in 2020. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-e-day-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526145/" data-ref-id="1100-6526145">Gears of War: E-Day</a> was announced at the Xbox Games Showcase earlier this summer, though it doesn’t yet have a release date. That means fans could be waiting a while for the next installment of the beloved franchise to hit store shelves. If you’re looking for something to help make the wait easier, you should check out <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BXXBX6G3?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Gears of War: The Card Game</a>, which is on sale at Amazon for just $27 (was $35), along with a handful of Gears of War novels--many of which are down to their best prices all year.</p><h2>Gears of War: The Card Game</h2><p><strong>$27 (<del>$35</del>)</strong></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4370134-gowtcghero.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4370134" data-ratio="0.552" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4370134-gowtcghero.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4370134"></a><figcaption>Gears of War: The Card Game</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4370134-gowtcghero.jpg"></figure><p>Created by Steamforged Games, Gears of War: The Card Game is a two-player deck-building game where players take the role of the Humans or the Horde Your goal is to take down your opponent by building a powerful deck from a pool of over 260 cards based on characters and weapons from the series, including iconic faces like Marcus Fenix and High General RAAM. Matches last around an hour, and with so many cards at your disposal, it’s easy to replay again and again.</p><hr><p>For something less competitive, you can check out one of the many <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09MJC5D4Q?binding=paperback&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Gears of War books</a> up for grabs. The mainline Gears of War novel series is particularly enticing, telling stories set in the same universe as the games. They also don’t necessarily have to be read in order, meaning you can jump in at any point. If you’re looking for content related to Gears 5, consider <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/178909478X?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Gears of War: Bloodlines</a>, which follows the game's protagonist Kait Diaz after the collapse of Settlement 2.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/concord%E2%80%99s-director-has-reportedly-stepped-down.986460/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/concords-director-has-reportedly-stepped-down/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Concord was a huge disaster for Sony and was <a href="https://wccftech.com/concord-offline-september-6th/">pulled offline just two weeks</a> after its launch. It is reported that Ryan Ellis, the Game Director for Concord, stepped down after the game was taken offline, and those who purchased it were refunded, as <a href="https://kotaku.com/concord-firewalk-studios-relaunch-ps5-sony-playstation-1851652811" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported by Kotaku</a>. After this event, the developers at Firewalk Studios are now uncertain of the studio's future, considering how badly the launch of Concord went.</p>
<p>Concord was a premium game in a sea of free-to-play hero shooters, making it stand out from the crowd for all of the wrong reasons. The game was also only available on PlayStation 5 and PC and cost $39.99 for players to get stuck into. It ended up getting a Metacritic score of 62 and a Metacritic User score of 1.8.</p>
<p>Ryan Ellis has a detailed resume and over seven years at Bungie, but he has reportedly informed the other staff that his role has changed, although his LinkedIn still lists his title as Game Director.</p>
<p>The blog post by Concord's Director states that the Firewalk team will consider their options regarding what to do next with Concord. However, it's been reported that some of the developers at Firewalk Studios have "been asked to explore pitches for something completely different," with some employees refreshing their portfolios in anticipation of potential layoffs. As a result of Concord's failure, some employees have already left the company.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/03/an-important-update-on-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The blog post</a> that was revealed didn't really go into any details about what's next for the game or for Firewalk Studios, other than explaining how those who did purchase the game can obtain a refund.</p>
<p>Whether people will see Concord again in the future remains to be seen. It has now suffered the same fate as <a href="https://wccftech.com/babylons-fall-service-to-end-on-february-27th-2023/">Babylon's Fall</a>, the multiplayer game made by Square Enix, which also had servers go down quickly.</p>
<p>When it comes to multiplayer titles for PlayStation, it doesn't have the best track record. Once Destiny 2 had partnered up with Sony, they laid off 220 Bungie employees in July, before moving others over to work at PlayStation. Then, Naughty Dog also canceled its planned multiplayer game that was going to be based on The Last of Us.</p>
<p>It would be unsurprising but disappointing if we saw the Firewalk Studios developers experience layoffs, but considering how unsuccessful the game was in every market, it's likely that we'll either see the studio dissolve, the staff get laid off, or potentially moved to different studios within PlayStation.</p>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>'s doing alright for itself, what with its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/space-marine-2-most-successful-steam-launch-for-warhammer-40k-series">franchise-best launch</a> and a whole load of critical acclaim, but developer Saber Interactive isn't stopping yet. The studio has now pledged a whole bunch of fan-requested fixes, starting with connectivity issues as a "top priority" and maybe even the introduction of an FoV slider if it really must.
</p>
<p>
All this comes via a lengthy <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/6356356787200103703">message to the community</a> on Steam, which follows Saber's recent request for fan feedback regarding areas they want to see addressed first. Top of that list are those aforementioned connectivity issues, which the developer acknowledges have resulted in server problems, the inability to connect with friends (technologically rather than emotionally, I assume), plus lost saves. Saber says its "working day and night" to increase server capacity and reduce server load, with a bigger patch to address these issues due "soon".
</p>
<p>
It also addresses the issue of bot teammates, after players complained their general ineffectiveness makes solo games "significantly harder". Saber claims bot behaviour is by design, saying it doesn't want them to "take the spotlight from the player" - but the studio does at least acknowledge bots can sometimes be "a bit too passive". As such, it'll be introducing improvements specifically during campaign boss fights in the next patch, and is also considering ramping up their usefulness during "specific objectives" in the future.

<p>
There's a whole lot more beside those two topics in Saber's post, including a promise to adjust Veteran difficulty in a future patch to help solo players finding it too hard thanks to those bots. "It will remain challenging," says the developer, "but it will be slightly more fair because we will tweak AI aggressiveness on this difficulty."
</p>
<p>
Beyond that, Saber gives a whole lot of yeses, nos, and maybes to player suggestions, confirming the likes of new classes and new melees weapons are under consideration, while marine face customisation and new armour colours are definitely on the way. FoV slider fans have less immediately positive news, however, with Saber saying Fo sliders are "not something [it's] comfortable with, as it can degrade the visual aspect of the game."
</p>
<p>
"And on top of that," the studio continues, "it is very complex. Our game is not a first person shooter, the camera that we have is very cinematic and constantly changes position and FoV based on what you are doing." Despite that reluctance, Saber acknowledges the request is a popular one so is "considering it anyway". A left/right shoulder swap, however, is a definite 'no', because it would need to be supported for all melee animations and transitions.
</p>
<p>
There's plenty more where that came from, and the full Q&amp;A is well worth a read if you love your minutiae. And if you haven't done so already, you might also consider playing Space Marine 2, which Eurogamer contributor Rick Lane called a "spectacular and mostly thrilling follow-up" in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review">four star review</a>. "It's the KFC party bucket of video games," he wrote, "delightfully messy, almost certainly bad for you, and best shared with friends."

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/we-can-simply-go-back-to-2017.986448/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/wolfenstein-new-order-colossus-machinegames<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Despite all the new and very good games that have come out lately, I've spent most of the last month playing through MachineGames' <em>Wolfenstein</em> releases from 2014 and 2017.</p><p>I started playing the first one, <em>Wolfenstein: The New Order</em>,<a href="https://aftermath.site/call-duty-modern-warfare-impressions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> for much the same reason I played through all those <em>Call of Duty</em> games recently</a>. As the AAA games space teeters on the brink of unsustainable oblivion, pushing the boundaries of scale and graphical fidelity well past the point the industry can financially support them, I've been wondering if we can simply...go back. But not just back <em>generally</em>, that's a useless sentiment; I mean back to a specific time when games maybe weren't <em>quite </em>as spectacular as they could be today, but are more than good enough relative to the cost and state of the market.</p><figure></figure><p>I found that point in those <em>Call of Duty</em> games, and in <em>Wolfenstein </em>I found it as well. For something that's now a decade old, <em>New Order</em> is great! It's got big, explosive cutscenes; it's got a rollercoaster action movie storyline that jumps from one exotic location to the next; there was genuine care invested in its characters and writing; and the visuals, especially in 4K, more than hold up.</p><p>Even its arena-based combat still feels strangely modern. If you've never played it, or just can't remember it (it's been a decade, stuff has happened!), <em>New Order</em> wasn't a game where every corridor was full of bad guys. Instead, most of its gunplay took place in large, specially-designed sandboxes where players were free to kill everyone however they wanted, whether stealthily (which emphasised reaching then silencing officers) or all guns blazing.</p><p>Of course in <em>some</em> ways, it still feels like it was made a decade ago--the writing can get a little overwrought at times, in ways I suspect would be polished up nowadays, and manually picking up armour and ammo is a huge drag. But those are criticisms I can't level at its sequel: 2017's <em>The New Colossus</em> took everything people loved about the first game and simply juiced them up. I can't <em>believe </em>how well this game holds up in 2024.</p><figure></figure><p>Its new cast are just as loveable, only now the game is genuinely funny as well. It looks so good I can't visually separate this game from many (if any, <em>CoD's</em> cutscenes aside) of its AAA shooter successors over the past seven years. It maintains the same overall shape of its predecessor--spend some time socialising in a hub then venture out to blast Nazis in explosive setpiece stages--but everything is just a little tighter, a little bigger, a little louder.</p><p>I feel bad for forgetting how fucking good this game was in every way, down to the most intimate details. Like yes, it's a very fun shooter, in terms of the guns feeling weighty and the bad guys doing interesting things. But this is a game more remarkable for how much love was poured into it. Every corner of this alternate timeline has been fully realised, from ships logs to Nazi posters. This isn't an RPG or a strategy game, it's a shooter that you can blast through in only a few hours, but it feels as fully-realised and thought through as something ten times longer.</p><p>Once again, it's not perfect. The manhunt stuff, where you revisit old levels to kill Nazi officers, feels tacked on in the least imaginative way possible, and the game's three powerups are shoehorned in so pointlessly that it doesn't really matter which one you pick. But then, I'm not here looking for perfection. I'm here looking for a game that's close enough.</p><figure></figure><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/sony-concord-shutdown-offline-refund-ps5-pc-live-service" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In the wake of <em>Concord's </em>disastrous excess</a> I’m struck by how, like so many <em>Call of Duty</em> games of a certain vintage, these two <em>Wolfenstein </em>games are fine! We don't need each Nazi to have a slightly more detailed face, or to shoot them in an arena that's got slightly better lighting, using a weapon that has mildly more impressive particle effects.</p><p>While I'm a little bummed we never got more games in this series--please note I have not brought up 2019's <em>Youngblood </em>for a reason--I don't want this to read like I'm complaining about the upcoming<em> Indiana Jones </em>game, which MachineGames is also responsible for and which will also prominently feature combat where you fuck up a bunch of fascists. I'm excited for that game! </p><p>But <em>Wolfenstein </em>is an example that further supports my growing theory that we can't just say "we want shorter games with worse graphics made by people who are paid more to work less and we're not kidding". It might help to put some numbers on those sentiments! And if we have to do so for blockbuster shooters, I think we should set them at whatever the budget and headcount for <em>New Colossus</em> was.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Me, I'm a simple sort. All I want from my flight simulators is an unerringly accurate recreation of dozens of aircraft, a perfect physics model that includes the spectacle of relevant weather events, and a complete, photorealistic and 1:1 scale depiction of the entire planet earth.

<p>I’m a massive fan of the Two Point universe, with countless hours spent playing Two Point Hospital and Two Point Campus over the years, and the moment developer Two Point Studios announced a third title in the franchise, I was sold. It could have been about running a burger shop, and I’d be in line to buy a copy metaphorically on day one. Thankfully, it’s not about running a fast food restaurant, but instead a totally authentic and genuine museum. Here’s what we know about the Two Point Museum release date!</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-two-point-museum-come-out">When Does Two Point Museum Come Out?</h2>



<p>If you’re as excited to play Two Point Museum as I am, unfortunately, I have some sour news for you. You have to wait. The official Two Point Museum release date is <strong>March 4, 2025</strong>. For now, enjoy the announcement trailer once more:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Two Point Museum | Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iGmUKTszyRU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Developer Two Point Studios recently announced the official release date, along with information on the game’s pricing (more on that shortly!), the Explorer Edition, and the Sonic Pre-Order Pack. It would seem that releasing the Two Point titles alongside something Sonic-related is becoming a long-running theme.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-much-does-two-point-museum-cost">How Much Does Two Point Museum Cost?</h2>



<p>As with the past two titles in the now-long-running Two Point franchise, Two Point Museum will launch with a retail price tag of <strong>$29.99</strong> for the Standard Edition and <strong>$39.99</strong> for the Explorer Edition, making it an extremely affordable strategy game with a long lifespan. You can easily spend many tens of hours playing the Two Point titles, and the studio often releases post-launch DLC that expands the game significantly with new maps and items that don’t break the bank, too!</p>

            <p>If I took my kid to a dinosaur museum and the gift shop and hallways were full of Sonic merchandise, I think I'd be kind of confused. I think that makes the inclusion of such items as pre-order bonuses for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/two-point-museum">Two Point Museum</a> - alongside Knuckles staff costumes and Sonic-themed interactive exhibits - a pretty strong extra incentive not to pre-order.
</p>
<p>But hey, at least the next management game in the growing 2.universe now has a release date: March 4th, 2025.

<p>Two Point Museum follows on from Campus and Hospital in offering a spiritual successor to the Bullfrog vein of management gaming. That means a cold-hearted core of financial efficiency as you lay down money-extracting entertainments for your roving customers to enjoy, with a loose layer of light satire and absurdity on top. It's as winning a formula now as it was in the '90s: Ed praised the "easygoing joy" in his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/two-point-campus-review-a-relaxed-management-sim-bursting-with-silliness-and-seminars">Two Point Campus review</a>, while Nic found a healthy patient in his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/two-point-hospital-review">Two Point Hospital review</a> back in 2018.
</p>
<p>This latest construction project will have you building a museum with an apparent natural history focus, your exhibits showing dinosaur bones, ocean fossils and the like. There's seemingly some new systems to fit the theme, too. As museum curator you'll be sending relic hunters out around a gradually uncovered world map to bring back wares, for example, like some sort of plundering employee of the British Museum, and your exhibits can be levelled-up so they generate more "Buzz", which is what prompts your visitors to make larger donations.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/concord-director-steps-down-two-weeks/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/concord-director-steps-down-two-weeks-after-game-goes-offline.986379/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/concord-director-steps-down-two-weeks/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Two weeks ago, Concord had failed so badly that it was taken offline, leaving the team at Firewalk Studios sitting in despair at the situation they’d found themselves in. The game that they’d spent years putting together was DOA, pulling in so few players and missing the mark so monumentally that it failed to gain an ounce of traction at release.</p>



<p>Now, the game’s director, Ryan Ellis, has stepped down from his position and moved into a ‘support role’, per a report from Kotaku.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-going-down">Going Down</h2>



<p>In Kotaku’s report, it was mentioned that Ellis ‘was the main shot caller’ on Concord, which failed miserably from the moment it hit the market last month. It was only this summer that the game received a proper trailer, with many baulking at the price tag attached to what would have fared much better as a free-to-play shooter.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://kotaku.com/concord-firewalk-studios-relaunch-ps5-sony-playstation-1851652811" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a quote handed to Kotaku</a>, it was said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Ryan deeply believed in that project and bringing players together through the joy in it. Regardless of there being things that could have been done differently throughout development… he’s a good human, and full of heart.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was Ellis who published the blog post highlighting the failure and imminent shutdown of Concord. He wrote that the game hadn’t landed the way the team at Firewalk had intended and that it would be taken offline to ‘explore options’. That was two weeks ago, and already, the wider industry has forgotten all about Concord.</p>



<p>Firewalk Studios numbers some 160 developers, many of which are now concerned about their job security. It could go either way at present – the team could alter the operating model and remove the premium price point, or the studio could be shuttered and Concord will become nothing more than a painful memory.</p>

			<p>Two different PlayStation 6 SoCs are said to be in the works, suggesting that the next-generation Sony system will be released in two different SKUs.</p>
<p>Speaking on the <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/kepler-theres-two-socs-in-development-for-next-gen-playstation-not-sure-if-its-a-series-x-s-situation-or-home-console-handheld.1675176/">NeoGAF forums</a>, well-known AMD leaker Kepler revealed there are two SoCs in development for the next-gen system, but the insider cannot confirm if it's an Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S situation or a home console and a handheld. One of the two, the insider added, should be affordable at least, suggesting there's a clear power difference between the two.</p>
<p>Very little is known about the PlayStation 6. <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-powered-amd/">Earlier this week</a>, a new report from Reuters confirmed the system will once again be powered by AMD, although Intel was among the two final contenders to design the system. Apparently, negotiations fell through when a dispute over profits prevented the company from settling on a price. Backward compatibility concerns also arose during negotiations, and reportedly Sony and Intel talked at length about the matter.</p>
<p>With the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-price-test-consequences/">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> right around the corner and the current generation likely lasting a few more years, it may be a long time before we learn more about the PlayStation 6 and the potential two SKUs suggested by the two SoCs in development. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <p>A few months ago, Minecraft's original console developer 4J Studios showed off a new in-house engine they had created, called the Elements Engine. Now they've announced what game they're making with it. It's called Reforj, and it's an "open-world multiplayer survival sandbox." But it's not aiming to be Minecraft 2, they say.
</p>

<p>The screenshot above is from a pre-alpha version of Reforj, which has no release date at this point. The trailer below shows more of the engine in action.

<p>"The fact this is coming from 4J means that the comparisons to Minecraft are unavoidable," Joseph Garrett <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-minecraft-studio-and-minecraft-youtuber-looking-to-transform-sandbox-gaming">told GamesIndustry.biz in a recent interview about the game</a>. Garrett is better known as Stampy, a Minecraft YouTuber, and he's working with 4J on Reforj. "We've already had articles about 4J making Minecraft 2. But that's not what we're trying to do. Despite all of us being huge fans of Minecraft, we don't need to make another one. It already exists."
</p>
<p>Reforj will instead offer "a very different gameplay experience," 4J co-founder Chris van der Kuyl says. The Elements engine has been designed to serve an open world survival game, however, one where players can change the world much like they can in Minecraft.
</p>
<p>4J Studios say they're hoping to release Reforj early and build it in partnership with its community, and that they recognise they're a small team and so their expectations of likely player numbers are low.
</p>
<p>We're long past the point in the industry where there's a new Minecraftbut launching every two months, but it's too early to tell if Reforj will offer something more than Ylands or Trove or any of a thousand of other block-building games which came and went. I will say this: I do not think swapping cubes for smaller, angled pieces is the good idea so many of these games think it is.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Concord game director Ryan Ellis has reportedly stepped down after the beleaguered 5v5 shooter was yanked offline amid apparently disastrous sales, with staff at developer Firewalk Studios said to be in limbo while they await Sony's decision on the future of the game.
</p>
<p>
Concord was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">removed from sale</a> earlier this month, just two weeks after its launch on PS5 and PC, with Sony offering full refunds to players. In a statement released at the time, Ellis wrote, "While many qualities of the experience resonated with players, we also recognise that other aspects of the game and our initial launch didn't land the way we'd intended."
</p>
<p>
Ellis added that Firewalk would "explore options" and "determine the best path ahead"  once the game was offline, but no further statements have been issued since then. According to <a href="https://kotaku.com/concord-firewalk-studios-relaunch-ps5-sony-playstation-1851652811">Kotaku</a>, however, staff at Firewalk have remained "in limbo" in the two weeks following Concord's shutdown as they wait for a decision on both the game and the studio's future.

<p>
Three sources told Kotaku employees are "pessimistic" Concord will return, with some having already been asked to explore pitches the studio might work on next. Some are said to believe mass layoffs are on the cards for the Sony-owned Firewalk - which employs around 150-170 people - given the studio is reportedly one of the most expensive under PlayStation's watch on a per-head basis.
</p>
<p>
Kotaku says there's also speculation among staff that Sony may decide to set Firewalk to work co-developing one of its many other first-party projects - although "a few" employees have reportedly already preemptively exited the studio, while others are waiting to see what a potential severance package may look like before making a decision.
</p>
<p>
As for Ellis - who previously served as creative director on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> - he reportedly told staff last week he would be stepping down from his current role as game director and moving into a support role. "Ryan deeply believed in that project and bringing players together through the joy in it," one former developer told Kotaku. "Regardless of there being things that could have been done differently throughout development...he's a good human, and full of heart."
</p>
<p>
Firewalk was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-acquires-firewalk-studios-as-it-continues-work-on-triple-a-multiplayer-exclusive">acquired by Sony</a> last year, as part of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plans-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-before-march-2026">massive live-service push</a> under former PlayStation boss Jim Ryan. The response to Concord, Firewalk's debut game, was lukewarm at best, with industry analysts estimating it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-has-sold-just-25000-copies-estimate-industry-analysts">sold less that 25,000 copies</a> across PS5 and PC.
