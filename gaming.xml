			<p>Ubisoft's President reportedly agreed to greenlight a new <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-mirage-enhanced-for-ps5-pro-runs-at-4k60-with-pssr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a> DLC, which would be funded by Savvy Games Group from Saudi Arabia.</p>
<h2>The Streets of Baghdad May Expand to New Content as Ubisoft Reportedly Agrees on DLC Development for Assassin's Creed Mirage</h2>
<p>Ubisoft's new installment in the Assassin's Creed franchise might not be the only thing fans will be receiving this year, as the company is rumored to expand the previous one. After more than a year since its launch, we are hearing that the <em>Assassin's Creed Mirage</em> is getting its first-ever DLC.</p>
<p>This might be a bit surprising since <em>Assassin's Creed Shadow</em>s is very close to its launch, and getting DLC for the Mirage edition is a report that nobody saw coming. The Shadows will be launching on 20th March 2025, which is roughly two months from now, and the supposed DLC for the Mirage Edition is also coming this year.</p>
<p>The report comes from the French publication Les Echos via prominent AC leaker '<a href="https://x.com/xj0nathan/status/1882849239434232101" target="_blank" rel="noopener">j0nathan</a>'. The report suggests that after the visit to Saudi Arabia, Ubisoft's president, Yves Guillemot,&nbsp;<span>agreed to the DLC development for&nbsp;<em>AC: Mirage</em>, which Ubisoft wasn't initially </span>interested in. Ubisoft has partnered with Savvy Games, which will be a major contributor to this project.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Assassins-Creed-Mirage-Ray-Tracing-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The game was initially designed to be a DLC itself and was supposed to continue the Valhalla storyline, but eventually made it to the game market as an individual installment. The game launched in October 2023 but hasn't got a single DLC since that time. Therefore, it's quite a surprise since the launch of Shadows is pretty close.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that it is still a rumor, and we still need official confirmation from Ubisoft about this matter. However, considering Odyssey got its crossover three years after its release, which was after the launch of Valhalla, the Mirage DLC doesn't look unfeasible. Still, there are not enough reports to confirm the news, and we have yet to hear about its exact launch date. Until then, stay tuned.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98go-play-fortnite%E2%80%99-optic-methodz-gives-advice-to-young-players-grinding-cod.1092132/</guid>

<p>The Call of Duty esports scene isn’t in the best place, that much is for certain. In the last year or two, Activision has tried to shape up the ecosystem a little and has made some positive changes, but prize pools are getting lower, viewership has taken some hits, and Black Ops 6 is currently in the gutter – just a little bit.</p>



<p>During a recent stream, some of the most prolific OpTic personalities, including Scump, Methodz, and Crimsix, sat around the fireplace to talk about the state of COD esports.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-you-can-actually-make-money">‘You Can Actually Make Money’</h2>



<p>Scump dropped a bombshell (admittedly a somewhat obvious one) by stressing that if <strong>he </strong>were trying to become an esports pro all over again right now, he wouldn’t pick Call of Duty as his game:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>If I was an 18 year right now, or 16, or whatever age you’re starting in gaming and I was trying to pursue being a professional in a video game, Call of Duty would not even be on my radar.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Methodz echoed Scump’s sentiment, stressing that the Call of Duty scene’s minimum age requirement is too much of a blocker that’s potentially preventing young superstars from finding a spot in the CDL.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’ve been saying to go play Fortnite.</p>



<p>I’m saying, listen bro – unfortunately… This is crazy to me, the age limit…</p>



<p>The fact it’s still an 18 age limit – I was a pro at 14. Like, there’s a lot of 14 to 18 year olds that would probably turn some heads that just can’t play. But I’m like, dude, if you’re 15, why the f*** would you be grinding COD?</p>



<p>Go play Fortnite, you can actually make money in that.</p>
</blockquote>











<p>In the current system, pro players can’t enter the Call of Duty League until they’re 18 years old. It’s not mirrored in every other esports title, of course. For instance, Counter-Strike’s ‘donk’ just turned 18 this weekend and spent the last year becoming known as one of the best players in the business, racking up some mind-boggling achievements in his debut year.</p>



<p>The OpTic guys say that there are so many competing titles in the esports space that Call of Duty shouldn’t even be on your list of potential targets. Do you agree? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>On social media, John ‘Bucky’ Buckley, a senior team member at Pocketpair, revealed how he has been inundated with messages and propositions since the firm announced a publishing endeavour. Bucky, who was recently promoted to the role of Communications Director and Publishing Manager, was transparent in a recent post on Twitter (X).</p>



<p>He wrote, ‘I think I might have underestimated how much interest there would be.’</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-do-whatever-you-want">‘Do Whatever You Want’</h2>



<p>Earlier this week, Palworld’s developer, Pocketpair, revealed ‘Pocketpair Publishing’. At the same time, Surgent Studios, the creator of Tales of Kenzera, announced that it would be the first major partner of the publishing arm, working with the team to create a new horror game.</p>



<p>On <a href="https://x.com/Bucky_cm/status/1882582384052457558" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, John ‘Bucky’ Buckley revealed that within 15 hours of publishing the Pocketpair news, he’d received more than 1,600 connection requests, emails, and propositions from small developers wanting to work with the label.</p>



<p>On Twitter, Bucky shot up, pulling in several hundred followers just as the news broke.</p>



<p>In the comments under his post, Bucky was grilled on the nature of Pocketpair’s publishing initiatives, curious to know how involved the company would be with the developer:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We give you money. You make game. </p>



<p>If you want help with marketing or something we’ll help out, but otherwise do whatever you want. </p>



<p>We’re giving devs the financial freedom to make games they want so they DON’T have to get wrapped up with stinky rule makers and bullies.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was revealed recently that Pocketpair Publishing is ‘100% self-funded’. In a statement, the company wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>As a completely independent publisher, we are uniquely positioned to help developers create the games they want, free from the complications of dealing with third parties who may not have their best interests at heart. </p>



<p>Pocketpair and Pocketpair Publishing are beholden to no one. </p>



<p>We remain dedicated to making fun games, and we’re so excited to now be able to help others bring their own fun games to life.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If you want to work with Pocketpair Publishing, it’s as simple as <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/publishing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">heading to the website</a> and selecting ‘Pitch Your Game’.</p>



<p>Is this a huge win from Pocketpair, or do you see them falling prey to the very thing they’re trying to avoid? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Avowed will be released worldwide on February 18, slotting into an already busy month for the RPG genre. For a while now, prospective fans have been eagerly scooping up any tidbits of information about the game, and most recently, the discussion turned to how the game is laid out.</p>



<p>In a recent interview with Xbox Wire, Obsidian’s developers sat down to talk about the lack of an open-world environment in Avowed. It’s very much by design and is a deliberate, strategic decision to encourage players to have e better experience overall.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-you-can-do-whatever-you-want">‘You Can Do Whatever You Want’</h2>



<p>In a recent interview <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/01/24/avowed-choose-your-own-adventure-incredible-freedom/" rel="nofollow">with Xbox Wire</a>, Obsidian’s Berto Ritger, Carrie Patel, and Kate Dollarhyde walked readers through the nature of the ‘zones’ in Avowed.</p>



<p>This ambitious RPG isn’t an open-world game, but instead, it relies on a series of ‘denser’ regions locked behind borders that keep the pacing consistent and manageable.</p>



<p>During the interview, Dollarhyde – who works as a narrative designer – explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Pacing is really tough in open-world games.</p>



<p>You never know where the player is and what they’re doing at any given time. So having these zones that happen in sequence means we always know what content you’ve just come from on the critical path. Maybe not what side quests you’ve done, but we always know you’ve just had this core experience.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That sentiment was echoed by Ritger, region director at Obsidian:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think it’s a good pacing mechanism.</p>



<p>We know roughly what you’ve done before you’ve gone to the next thing. It’s still a very open structure within those zones, where you can do whatever you want for the most part, but it’s not one contiguous area where you could be anywhere at any moment.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Having smaller, more detailed regions or zones has enabled Obsidian to scope in and focus on delivering a more immersive, choice-driven experience for players. Even with the zones being scaled down from the open-world models we might be more used to in these grand RPG titles, we can still expect there to be plenty of meat on Avowed’s bones.</p>



<p>Do you plan on picking up Avowed when it’s released on February 18? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

The RTX 5070 Ti and RTX 5070 will follow that with their own releases in February, but some are already getting a sneak peek at the GPUs’ software benefits through DLSS 4.</p><p>Tom Warren’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349619/nvidia-rtx-5090-review-test-benchmark"><em>Verge</em> review</a> of the $1,999 RTX 5090 indicates it’s expectedly a powerhouse, but not quite the generational leap that the RTX 4090 was over its own predecessor. That didn’t stop <em>The Verge</em>’s Sean Hollister from being impressed with the two-slot RTX 5090 Founders Edition GPU when he stuffed it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349976/nvidia-rtx-5090-fe-small-form-factor-sff-hands-on">into his aging small-form-factor PC</a>. </p><p>Along with the 50-series GPUs comes <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337402/nvidia-dlss-4-upscaling-announcement-ces-2025">DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation</a>, a software trick that may be just as big a story as the hardware itself. This latest version of DLSS uses AI to predictively generate frames, making it possible to run games at higher resolutions without taking the same framerate hit they would without DLSS 4 turned on. Gamers who are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24350558/nvidia-dlss-4-frame-generation-cyberpunk-2077-transformer-graphics-update-patch">already trying DLSS 4 out</a> in <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>using RTX 40-series GPUs report seeing huge improvements already.</p><p>We’ll be keeping up with all the news about Nvidia’s RTX 50-series GPUs right here at <em>The Verge</em>.</p></div><section id="updates-section"><ul><li role="article" id="stream-entry-caa3630a-bcdb-467c-b368-1a677ad29fb9"></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-91bd7a43-471e-47c8-89f2-39e7d6f43bba"></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-5cd0eaef-1c6f-4ba4-b197-57c89fe8f67d"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349619/nvidia-rtx-5090-review-test-benchmark">Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 review: a new king of 4K is here</a></h2><div><figure><span><span></span></span><p><cite>Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge</cite></p></figure></div><p>Nvidia’s RTX 4090 was a beast of a graphics card. It was a huge GPU that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23398201/nvidia-rtx-4090-review-test-benchmark">delivered true 4K gaming</a> for those who really wanted it and a huge jump in performance over the previous-generation RTX 3090. Naturally, the company’s latest top-of-the-line GPU, the GeForce RTX 5090, now has a lot of expectations riding on it when it arrives on January 30th.</p><p>But at $1,999, the RTX 5090 is steep — $400 more than the RTX 4090 Founders Edition at its launch. (It could run you even more in the form of a new power supply or higher electricity bills, especially if you want to run games like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> in 4K.) </p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349619/nvidia-rtx-5090-review-test-benchmark">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-e35ff62d-24fc-46ff-b09f-4328dfb9ee93"></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-b2e686c1-44f6-4156-a308-5b38f054bd07"><div><p>The RTX 5090 might be in short supply.</p><p>Nvidia’s upcoming RTX 5090 launch on January 30th might be met with limited stock, according to some system builders and retailers.

Performance figures, benchmarks, and impressions beyond the hardware are coming later.</p><p>The first thing that’s notable about the RTX 5090 is the packaging design has totally changed since the Founders Edition RTX 40-series. Nvidia has switched to housing the RTX 5090 inside a smaller bone-shaped gray cardboard shell that sits inside a much larger brown cardboard box.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/20/24347693/nvidia-rtx-5090-vs-rtx-4090-design-fans-hardware">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-809426f9-6ed6-4859-a840-6eafd15ecc03"></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-5ab3ae1e-44d8-4375-bf8a-80be65493fd9"><div><p>We finally played with an RTX 5090.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/sean-hollister">Sean</a> has been scouring CES for an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337396/nvidia-rtx-5080-5090-5070-ti-5070-price-release-date">RTX 5090</a> demo with an actually playable game.

It’s a claim that’s been echoed on YouTube, TikTok, and social media networks and has generated a debate over the RTX 50 series and DLSS 4’s Multi Frame Generation. </p><p>So, can a $549 RTX 5070 really deliver the same level of performance as a $1,599 RTX 4090? The answer is yes and no, and it all comes down to a “fake frames” argument about DLSS Frame Generation that might not even be a big problem for a lot of PC gamers.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24338999/nvidia-rtx-5070-vs-rtx4090-performance-price">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-854f6bad-66b8-48c6-a138-a8432971a01c"></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-862bd3ec-0b20-4562-9f56-1e6b976fbbc8"><div><p>Nvidia’s China-only RTX 5090D slashes AI performance.</p><p>The China-only chip comes with 2,375 AI TOPS, compared to the 3,352&nbsp;on the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337396/nvidia-rtx-5080-5090-5070-ti-5070-price-release-date">RTX 5090 that will launch elsewhere</a>, as pointed out by <em>Tom’s Hardware</em>. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/17/23921131/us-china-restrictions-ai-chip-sales-nvidia">US export rules</a> prevent chipmakers like Nvidia from selling high-powered chips to China.</p><p>Despite these requirements, it seems some of the company’s advanced chips have made their way into China through smuggling,<em> </em>according <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/u-s-prompts-nvidia-supermicro-probe-into-how-chips-ended-up-in-china">to<em> The Information</em></a><em>.</em></p><br></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-cf4049a3-cf26-4a8b-ae22-c996ba55f17d"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337402/nvidia-dlss-4-upscaling-announcement-ces-2025">Nvidia announces DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation</a></h2><p>Nvidia is revealing a big upgrade to its Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) technology today. <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Fdlss4-multi-frame-generation-ai-innovations%2F">DLSS 4</a> will include new neural rendering capabilities that, on systems with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337396/nvidia-rtx-5080-5090-5070-ti-5070-price-release-date">the new RTX 50 Series GPUs</a>, can do Multi Frame Generation, generating “up to three additional frames per traditionally rendered frame, working in unison with the complete suite of DLSS technologies to multiply frame rates by up to 8X over traditional brute-force rendering.”</p><p>According to Nvidia, that’s a big enough upgrade to make 4K 240fps, fully ray-traced gaming possible.

            <p>Avowed will not only let you customise your character's appearance but also the background "that will shape how the world perceives and responds to you", too.</p>
<p>In a series of posts on X/Twitter, Obsidian let fans in for an early peek at the fantasy RPG's Character Creation menu, where players can choose between an Arcade Scholar, Court Augur, Vanguard Scout, War Hero, and Noble Scion, all of which determine what dialogue options and starting weapons you'll have available to you when you kick off your adventure.</p>

<p>"You hail from the Aedyran Empir, but who exactly are you, Envoy?" Obsidian teased on social media (thanks, <a href="https://x.com/AvowedtheGame/status/1882518769563512842">TheGamer</a>). "Stranger still, you have never learned which god touched your soul.</p>
<p>"In the Character Creation menu, you'll have the opportunity to customize your Godlike character and choose a background that will shape how the world perceives and responds to you."</p> <div>

</p></div>
<p>For Noble Scion, we got to see exactly what's special about this background, too.</p>
<p>"You were born to a noble house of great influence, middling wealth, and questionable morals," the description said. "When scandals and succession disputes saw your family cast down, you threw yourself on the emperor's mercy, and he shielded you.</p>
<p>"Canny yet refined, you have become a formidable force at court and an invaluable ally to the emperor."</p>
<p>Don't worry about the character creation locking out any equipment and abilities you find in-game, though - Obsidian reassures us that "all equipment and abilities are available to you regardless of your background.</p>
<p>Avowed will released next month, 18th February, on PC (Steam and Battle.net) and Xbox Series X/S, with day-one access for Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass subscribers. Those who pay £90 (or $90) for the game's Premium Edition, however, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avowed-selling-five-days-early-access-if-you-pay-90">can play five days early</a>.</p><p>"'Your worlds, your way' isn't just a motto for Obsidian - it's how they design quests, regions, combat, and more," Xbox teased after this week's Developer Direct. "Learn how player freedom is at the heart of Avowed, making it a quintessential 'Obsidian RPG'."</p> <div>

            <p>Four studios are battling it out to once again reboot Capcom's Resident Evil movie franchise, only this time, PlayStation Productions is also on board.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/resident-evil-reboot-zach-cregger-1236117563/">Hollywood Reporter</a>, Warners Bros. and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> are amongst a number of hopefuls looking to reboot Constantin Film's horror series alongside PlayStation's production company.</p>
<p>Writer and director of 2022's brilliant Barbarian, Zach Cregger, is attached to write and direct and is reportedly keen to keep his Resident Evil adaptation faithful to the games that spawned the multimillion-dollar - and multimedia - franchise.</p>

<p>Whilst little else is known about the project at this time, it's thought Shay Hatten (John Wick: Chapter 4, Army of the Dead) is on board to co-write the seventh major instalment of the horror movie series. The prior six movies all starred Milla Jovovich apart from the last attempted reboot which released in 2021.</p><p>There was also an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-new-resident-evil-show-has-already-been-cancelled">ill-fated Netflix show that was unceremoniously cancelled</a> within a month of its debut episode following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-new-resident-evil-series-is-going-down-badly-with-fans">disappointing reviews</a>, with one commenter stating: "Terrible; followed by more terrible; just when you lose all hope; it smacks you with even more terrible".</p>
<p>PlayStation Productions was established by Sony in 2019 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-opens-playstation-productions-to-develop-multiple-game-franchises-into-tv-and-movies">to convert its video game franchises into blockbuster films and television shows</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Whether they’re <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/15/16151292/undertale-playstation-4-vita-release">pushing the boundaries of the medium</a> and or offering <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24082252/balatro-review-poker-roguelike-videogame">a creative spin on classic ideas</a>, indie games can be just as interesting as big-budget epics.</p><p>Sometimes, though, indie games can fly under the radar. But we here at <em>The Verge</em> love seeking out hidden gems, so we want to use this space to share some of our favorite smaller games that we’re checking out so that you might find something new, or potentially your next obsession.</p><p>We’ll be highlighting interesting games you may not have heard of and sharing a little bit about why you should play them. This list will be updated pretty frequently, too — so check back often to see some new recommendations. </p></div><section id="updates-section"><ul><li role="article" id="stream-entry-536262cb-a0dd-424e-b4ed-acbc0477d41f"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/25/24351112/lok-digital-review-word-game-iphone-android-steam">Lok Digital is a surreal puzzle game full of made-up words</a></h2><p>At a glance, <a href="https://lok-digital.com/"><em>Lok Digital</em></a> seems like another cute and clever word game, a perfect distraction to keep on your phone for idle moments. But look closer, and it’s clear something just isn’t right. Yes, it’s a game about creating words to fill out a puzzle board. Except those words aren’t actually real — and they all have special powers. Think of it like an alien take on Scrabble. It takes a while to wrap your head around, but <em>Lok</em>’s surreal setup makes for an excellent brain-scratching puzzler.</p><p>There is actually a story of sorts here. <em>Lok</em> takes place in a black-and-white fantasy realm, and your goal is to help little worm-like creatures progress through each level. The stages are grids of squares, and your goal is to turn each one black. (I have no idea how this helps the creatures move, but just stay with me here.) You turn them black by placing letters to spell out words.

Somehow, that chaos gels into something that actually makes sense — and, at times, is even calming.</p><p><em>Antonblast</em> just launched in 2024, but it looks like a long-lost side-scrolling platformer from the 16-bit era of the SNES or Sega Genesis.

Much like playing <em>Tetris</em>, I’m at my best when I’m skating almost subconsciously, not thinking and acting in the moment. It’s not an easy zone to get into, and music has always been my shortcut.

That’s according to Developer Second Dinner, which <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1882957014898454727">announced yesterday</a> it was starting the process of restoring the game to Google’s Android app store at 6PM PT / 3PM ET that day. The developer <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1882905320001089938">said in another post</a> it expects the game to return to both Google’s and Apple’s app stores “as early as next week.” </p><p><em>Marvel Snap </em>was caught up in the TikTok outage last weekend because its original publisher, Nuverse, is owned by TikTok parent company ByteDance. The game came <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/20/24348353/marvel-snap-tiktok-ban-back-online">back online for players</a> on Monday and <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1881535498709266691">Second Dinner said</a> it planned to “bring more services in-house and partner with a new publisher.” As of now, <em>Marvel Snap </em>is still “provided, operated, and managed by Nuverse,” according to the <a href="https://sf19-draftcdn-sg.ibytedtos.com/obj/ies-hotsoon-draft-sg/Snap/snap_privacy_policy_en.html">privacy policy</a> on the game’s website.</p><p>An admin of the <a href="https://discord.com/servers/marvel-snap-978545345715908668"><em>Marvel Snap</em> Discord server</a> also announced a set of compensation packages for players affected by the outage. As seen in screenshots <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MarvelSnap/comments/1i99zmp/compensation_galore/">posted to Reddit</a>, that includes in-game credits, tokens, and special variants for accounts that were created in the US or that showed US activity in the 30 days prior to the outage. Non-US players will also get a “Global Gratitude Package” with similar, though fewer, benefits. </p><p>Other apps that went down last weekend, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/21/24348629/capcut-back-online-us-tiktok-bytedance">such as CapCut</a> and Lemon8, have since come back online but still aren’t listed in the iOS and Android app stores. Although President Donald Trump has directed the US Attorney General <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/20/24348213/trump-tiktok-ban-executive-order-sale-delay-china">not to enforce the US TikTok ban</a>, it’s unclear whether he can shield Apple or Google from legal liability if they host the apps in defiance of the law.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But look closer, and it’s clear something just isn’t right. Yes, it’s a game about creating words to fill out a puzzle board. Except those words aren’t actually real — and they all have special powers. Think of it like an alien take on Scrabble. It takes a while to wrap your head around, but <em>Lok</em>’s surreal setup makes for an excellent brain-scratching puzzler.</p><p>There is actually a story of sorts here. <em>Lok</em> takes place in a black-and-white fantasy realm, and your goal is to help little worm-like creatures progress through each level. The stages are grids of squares, and your goal is to turn each one black. (I have no idea how this helps the creatures move, but just stay with me here.) You turn them black by placing letters to spell out words. Completed words will black out squares, and certain words also have the ability to black out even more.</p><p>It sounds kind of weird at first, and that feeling is only exacerbated by the dictionary of words you’re working with. They are gibberish. The game eases you into this fictional language, though, slowly introducing new words that each add a new wrinkle to the puzzles. The word “Lok,” for instance, lets you black out any square on the board, while “Be” lets you write the letter of your choice on a blank square. As your selection of words grows, so do the techniques at your disposal.</p><p>Here’s a GIF that gives an idea of how it plays out:</p><div><p><cite>Image: Letibus Design and Icedrop Games</cite></p></div><p>I didn’t quite understand it at first, but <em>Lok</em> really clicked for me when I stopped thinking of it like other word games, such as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/25/23037899/knotwords-wordle-crossword-puzzle-game-zach-gage-iphone-android-pc"><em>Knotwords</em></a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23660809/wordle-new-york-times-interview-zoe-bell-gdc-2023"><em>Wordle</em></a>. It’s a puzzle game, just one where certain combinations of letters are used to solve problems. You don’t need to think of the best words you know; you need to use the existing ones in clever ways to clear out every square. It feels immensely satisfying when you discover the right way to chain together gibberish to solve a puzzle. And while it can be difficult, the game does a great job of easing you along. It ramps up slowly, has a helpful hint system, and also provides an easy-to-reference list of all the words you’ve uncovered so far.</p><p>As a puzzler, <em>Lok</em> really nails the balance of challenge and scale, giving you bite-sized problems that still feel good to solve. It’s perfect for mobile where you might only have a few minutes to play (though the game is also available on PC and was <a href="https://www.blazgracar.com/lok">originally a physical puzzle book</a>). But it also goes a step further in creating an extremely chill vibe, with its lo-fi soundtrack and cozy monochrome visuals. It really does feel like you’re dropping into an alien world — one where you have to discover a whole new language to make it through.</p><p><small>Lok Digital <em>is available now on iOS, Android, and PC.</em></small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

(It also, naturally, has an RGB strip.)</p><p>With some Razer gaming laptops, it can go even further. When the cooling pad is connected via USB to a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23588660/razer-blade-16-2023-review-specs-features-design">2023</a> or 2024 Razer Blade 16, a feature called <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338041/razers-150-cooling-pad-is-getting-a-software-update-that-makes-its-laptop-gpus-go-faster">Hyperboost</a> automatically adjusts fan speed and cooling mode and lets the laptop allocate up to 20 extra watts each to the CPU and GPU. (Razer is bringing Hyperboost to more models over the coming months.)</p><p>I’ve played around with the Razer Laptop Cooling Pad for the last few weeks, both before and after the Hyperboost update. And while it isn’t quite as impressive as Razer claims, I did notice a significant improvement in 1080p performance in games that were previously held back by a lack of power to the CPU.</p><p>I tested the Razer Laptop Cooling Pad with a top-of-the-line 2024 Razer Blade 16 with a mobile Nvidia RTX 4090 graphics card and Intel Core i9-14900HX CPU, as well as with the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338041/razers-150-cooling-pad-is-getting-a-software-update-that-makes-its-laptop-gpus-go-faster">2024 Asus ROG Zephyrus G16 (AMD version)</a>. It’s possible to cycle through preset fan speeds and RGB lighting configurations using buttons on the side, but fine control requires installing Razer Synapse, which might be a deal-breaker for some people even if the price isn’t.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Hello, Synapse, my old acquaintance.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Let’s address the elephant in the room first: Razer’s cooling pad gets <em>loud</em>. With the 140mm fan spinning full bore, I measured <a href="https://www.iacacoustics.com/blog-full/comparative-examples-of-noise-levels">62 decibels</a> right next to the laptop and about 56 to 58 decibels in what I would consider a realistic gaming position. (My apartment has a noise floor of about 40 decibels.) It’s not ear-splitting, but the fan’s constant volume and mechanical timbre are distracting — it sounds close enough to a vacuum cleaner to startle my cat. For comparison, the built-in fans on both laptops I tested output at less than 50 decibels using their Turbo power profiles.&nbsp;</p><p>Razer’s quest to create a laptop cooling pad that can fit any device also means that it’s large by necessity. Not only does it take up more space on the desk than your laptop alone but it also requires external power and uses a bulky adapter that crowds out the plug next to it on the power strip. It comes with three different top plates that snap to the pad magnetically. The plate for laptops from 14 to 16 inches and the one for 18-inch laptops use memory foam strips to create an airtight seal between the fan chamber and the intake vents at the bottom of the laptop. The third, for fanless or ventless devices like the MacBook Air, is totally flat. The back boasts three USB-A 2.0 ports that remain accessible no matter the size of the laptop on top.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Three USB 2.0 ports mean you can keep your mouse and keyboard plugged into the cooling pad.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>It’s a good thing that Hyperboost works, at least in certain circumstances. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nVfKMjUFQc">In his review of the 2024 Razer Blade 16</a>, YouTuber Jarrod’sTech noted that both it and the 2023 model underperform at 1080p. That’s because, by default, they allocate more of their total power allowance to the GPU, but at lower resolutions, most games are held back by the CPU.&nbsp;</p><p>Hyperboost blows past that. With more power to the CPU, the 2024 Blade 16 put out 123 frames per second in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> at 1080p with every setting maxed out (except ray tracing), compared to the 90fps I measured without Hyperboost. <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em> was similar: at 1080p max settings, I measured 204fps with Hyperboost on and 185 with it disabled.</p><div><p>Once you leave 1080p, the advantage evaporates</p></div><p>Once you leave 1080p, the advantage evaporates; the GPU becomes the limiting factor, and pumping more power into it grants diminishing returns. At the Blade 16’s native 1600p resolution (and above, if you’re using an external monitor), I measured about the same frame rate with or without Hyperboost, give or take a frame or two. Temperatures are still noticeably lower, with the power-hungry Intel Core i9-14900HX staying below 90 degrees Celsius and the RTX 4090 keeping under 70 degrees under torture testing, but the 2024 Blade 16 already had a great cooling system thanks to its thickness. Thermal throttling was never a concern.&nbsp;</p><div><p><figcaption><em>You can use the Razer Laptop Cooling Pad with any laptop. Nobody can stop you.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The Razer Laptop Cooling Pad will do a good job of cooling non-Razer gaming laptops, too — with or without Synapse. It prevented the AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 processor inside the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24324299/asus-rog-zephyrus-g16-2024-gaming-laptop-review-amd-strix-point">Asus ROG Zephyrus G16</a> from reaching its 95 degrees Celsius ceiling when benchmarking, which it usually hits quite fast. Even the strip above the keyboard, which often hits 115 degrees Fahrenheit, topped out at a comparatively balmy 90 degrees under full load.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, I couldn’t get a statistically significant frame rate improvement in games or synthetic tests on the ROG Zephyrus G16 — even after taking advantage of the thermal headroom to overclock the CPU and GPU. </p><div><p><figcaption><em>Pictured: one of the very few laptops that work with Hyperboost.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Therein lies the biggest problem with the Razer Laptop Cooling Pad. It certainly pushes air around, but only people with a Hyperboost-compatible Razer Blade 16 — a <em>very</em> small segment of the overall gaming population — will see a difference in performance, and even then, only in CPU-limited games. </p><p>Of course, it’s possible that Hyperboost will make more of a difference in other Razer laptops, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24335984/razer-blade-16-laptop-thin-ryzen-amd-cpu-nvidia-gpu-240-hz-oled-display">the slimmer Blade 16 that Razer announced at CES</a> the same day it released Hyperboost. The new Blade is about as thick as the ROG Zephyrus G16, which uses drastic power and temperature limits to keep heat under control in its slim chassis. Maybe the new Blade 16 will manage the heat just fine, like the 2024 model, but perhaps the timing isn’t entirely coincidental.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLaptops/comments/1ftiwce/new_razer_cooling_pad_150_usd_thoughts/">Reddit users</a> have pointed out, Razer’s $150 cooling pad has a lot in common with similar cooling stands from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/llano-External-Computer-15-6-21in-Adjustable/dp/B0CMTCB8Q6/?tag=theverge02-20">Llano</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/IETS-Equipped-Turbo-Fan%EF%BC%885-5inch-Diameter%EF%BC%89-14-1-19-3/dp/B0CDC3XW44/?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20">IETS</a>: all require external power, use an adjustable-speed 140mm fan, have RGB and a USB hub, and seal to the laptop with memory foam, but the Llano and IETS coolers cost closer to $100. Many of them even have adjustable tilt levels, which the Razer cooling pad lacks. We haven’t tested them, but unless you have a compatible Razer Blade or <em>really</em> want the RGB lights on your laptop cooling pad to sync with Chroma, something more basic will work just as well for $50 less.</p><p><em>Photography by Jonathan Hilburg for </em>The Verge.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
