            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/10/as-expected-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-support-will-end-with-season-4/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It comes as absolutely no surprise that Season 4 of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a> will be the end of the game’s support as a live service.</p>
<p>Rocksteady has revealed that Season 4 will feature Deathstroke joining the roster, introduce a new Elseworld to explore with a medieval theme, and have some new narrative content attached to that, with Episode 7 arriving on 10th December. The second half of the season will arrive in January in Episode 8, rounding out Warner Bros. and Rocksteady’s obligation to support the game with new content and fulfil the promises of paid battle passes and content road maps.</p>


<p>The update for Season 4 Episode 7 will also introduce an offline mode, allowing all game content (both in the main game and seasonal) to be played without an internet connection – you’ll either have to start a new character profile or duplicate your online profile. See the <a href="https://dcgamessupport.wbgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/36119520746515-OFFLINE-MODE-FAQ">offline play FAQ here</a>.</p>
<p>However, the game servers will remain live and active for the foreseeable future, maintaining the possibility to play the game in online co-op. WB has also stated in <a href="https://dcgamessupport.wbgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/36121518094995-SEASON-4-FAQ">a Season 4 FAQ</a> that they are not planning to remove the game from sale, and that the LutherCoin premium currency will also remain available.</p>
<p>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League was one of the biggest video game flops in recent memory and could have been the most ignominious entertainment industry disasters of the year, were it not for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/concord">Concord</a> and maybe the Joker film sequel. Warner took to discounting the game to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/28/steam-autumn-sale-black-friday-best-deals/">just £3 in the recent Steam Sale</a>.</p>

<p>After years of delays, Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League finally released on February 2nd, 2024 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. Was it worth the wait? Well, in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/05/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review/">Suicide Squad review</a>, Gamoc said, “Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is a perfect example of how live services can sap all the energy out of a game experience. The story, the character and gameplay all range from good to fantastic, but the missions grow stale before too long, the loot system’s few bright spots are tarnished by the chore of everything else you earn, and the story and characters all but evaporate once you reach the endgame.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/10/overthrown-early-access-review-theyre-really-chucking-these-houses-up/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Overthrown has just entered into Early Access, bringing to life a new city builder for people to try. What makes this one different from all the others is that you’re not simply placing buildings and letting the world get on, you’re actively part of it trying to help it flourish. Oh, and you also have a crown that imbues you with all sorts of powers like super strength and super speed, letting you throw buildings all over the place. So, that’s pretty different.</p>
<p><iframe title="Overthrown – Game Preview Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ijjXJK1PZMc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>At the opening, you can choose one of three worlds to generate in which to build up your kingdom. The Lost Isles is the smallest map, followed by the medium-sized Foothills, while the largest is Seaside Cliffs. Each has a different make-up in terms of terrain, but the overall goal is the same. Start with nothing and build up a kingdom that can see off the incoming threats of bandits and wild animals. First, you grab the crown before building a town hall from which your first three inhabitants will emerge. Then, as is custom, you’re tasked with building sawmills to start gathering wood with which you can build houses and outhouses. In multiplayer, only one person can have the crown giving them bonus benefits, but everyone has the same base powers to work together and build up the kingdom.</p>


<p>Overthrown is one of those titles that is simple to get to grips with but becomes steadily more complex as you progress There’s a research tree that opens up more buildings like different food shops, farms, and mines. On top of that, you have the buildings that turn resources into materials to help you build up. People will start coming to your kingdom as it grows, taking on the various jobs that are created by the buildings.</p>


<p>To speed things up, you can just grab a giant sawmill and sprint around to collect wood, cutting down trees like a giant saw. That is one example of how Overthrown encourages you to experiment with the world. One of the first buildings I unlocked was the butchers, which needs a steady supply of meat. Now, since the game is in Early Access not everything is unlocked yet. The research tab helpfully showed me that Woolies, the sheep of this world, will not be available until January. Another solution had to be found for the lack of meat. One of the wild animals that inhabit the world are Tuskers, essentially wild boars. They have nests dotted about, generally pretty far from town. Not that that is an issue when you have super speed. My solution was to pick up a Tusker nest, bring it closer to town, build a fence around it, and pop a sniper tower next to it. Tuskers would regularly generate and my hunter would take them out to provide meat. A good little option to consider if you’ve got a town full of hungry people to feed.</p>
<p>The movement in Overthrown is excellent. Sprinting like a speedster is smooth and the large maps have plenty of open space. If anyone is developing a superhero game, Overthrown’s movement should act as a base to build on. Being able to pick up buildings with your character and just move them if you don’t like where they are makes the building element nice and easy to handle. The combat is merely fine when armed with a sword or greatsword, but it’s also very basic.</p>
<p>Resource management is a major part of the game and things can get complicated fast. The population grows pretty quickly in Overthrown, and you need to balance that with resources to make sure the inhabitants don’t starve, or suffer from exhaustion and collapse. You need to get farms up and running, fuel produced, and create stockpiles ahead of winter. Once winter comes, you cannot produce crops and your stores will get you through. Raiders will attack in an attempt to steal the crown, but you can find their camps in the woods before they mount an attack and dismantle them. If you have a military you will need to balance their pay with the taxes you put on your citizens. Tax too high and people may leave. Don’t pay the military and they may just quit soldiering.</p>

<p>With Overthrown being in early access things have a way to go yet. You’re bombarded with notifications as things develop and your kingdom grows, whether they’re telling you that lines of there’s not enough houses, outhouses, or food being created. While it gives you an idea, it’s not clear enough. For example, one notification showed an insufficient number of houses with the number 1 in a bracket, so I built another house. The notification remained. I built a lot of houses, The notification remained. There are also other notifications like repair required. I thought looking at the overworld map would show me which building needed repair, but it didn’t, requiring me to check each one individually. Similarly, when you come under attack there is a notification of fighting. While the compass banner will show a red dot to indicate an enemy, it will only do so if you are close by. Again, it would be helpful for an enemy dot to appear on the world map to stop any confusion. Overthrown did crash a couple of times too, and in one instance the world just starting flickering while assets disappeared. It is, at least, all things that can be improved by a patch.</p>
<p>Overthrown certainly has potential but after just a few hours I felt like I had seen all I could see in the Early Access stage, at least until the next batch of new content is added in January. It doesn’t take long to unlock all the research available and once you have the town starting to thrive you’re waiting for raids to hit or explore a big but rather sparse world. Regular content updates will be needed to keep people invested in their worlds, otherwise the inhabitants will face more than a harsh winter.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-logos-unleashed-mod/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A Final Fantasy XVI mod currently in development promises to bring its battle system to new heights, introducing features that are common in character action games like Devil May Cry and Bayonetta.</p>
<p>The Logos Unleashed mod, which is being developed by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@mThund3R_" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mThund3R</a>, the same developer behind the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy16/mods/89?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eikonic Equipment</a> mod, which introduces deeper RPG elements in the game, will expand combat options by introducing new Eikonic Feats that can be activated with directional inputs. With the Phoenix Eikon, for example, it will be possible to unleash an air launcher attack, a Shift Wave projectile attack, and a quick lunging finisher by pressing corresponding buttons. With Odin, to give another example, it will be possible to use the useful Rift Slip ability with a direction input without having it equipped.</p>
<p>While the Final Fantasy XVI Logos Unleash mod only integrates parts of certain skills into an Eikon basic moveset, it will open up a lot of interesting gameplay possibilities to make the game's excellent combat system even more engaging. You can check out some of the new options the mod will offer when it launches on a yet to be confirmed date in the video below.</p>

<p>Final Fantasy XVI is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide. You can learn more about the game by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-xvi-the-planets-dyin-clive/">review of the PlayStation 5 version.</a></p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Goblin-hitting bonanza <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/path-of-exile-2">Path Of Exile 2</a> launched into early access last weekend and the devs Grinding Gear Games have dropped some big patch notes that outline some things they've updated already, or things they plan on updating in a future patch. Things like dodge-rolling, checkpoints, items, currencies, and other stuff I can't list here because the intro to this article would expand and pop into a flurry of common rarity boots and bones, maybe with the odd purple rarity sword mixed in.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Among the first things on the agenda are dodge roll changes in response to players being frustrated at the frequency of being trapped by monsters. Once implemented, these tweaks should make the ol' roll a better tool for sneaking out of the grasp of pesky monsters, and even pushing small creatures like the Adorned Beetles in Keth. This doesn't mean you won't ever get trapped - there's no phasing through monsters - but the devs say the changes should mean you "can get through even the smallest gap".</p>
<p>As for checkpoints, they're taking action to save you backtracking to spots you've already discovered. In a future patch, you'll be able to teleport to other checkpoints, and checkpoints will be added to all entrances and exits of zones for those easy teleports.</p>
<p>There's been some major item drop changes, too, since players have felt that the game hasn't been rewarding enough. The devs say they've had to be "very careful when adjusting because it's very hard to reduce drops if we increase them by too much". So here's a quick blast of what they've deployed now:</p>
<ul>
<li>Killing rare monsters has been made betterer. Rewards should naturally scale up as you reach higher levels, with rare monsters having an increased chance of having more modifiers as you progress.</li>
<li>Currency drops have largely been buffed. For instance, Regal orb drop rates have been increased by around 40%, and Gemcutter's Prism drop rates have been upped by 500%.</li>
<li>There's been a significant increase to the value of all prefix map mods.</li>
<li>"Unlucky" drop protection (when a boss drops bad loot) has been increased, so no more than 50% of unique monster drops can be gold. "Act" and "Map" bosses will always drop at least one rare, as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a final flourish, an upcoming Path Of Exile 2 patch will add more rare monsters to the endgame maps.</p>
<p>If you want a quick summary of the changes that are live right now, I recommend having a glance at their official <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3611708">patch notes page here</a>. As for all the planned changes (with those that have been deployed, too), I recommend deep-scanning this <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3611705">official forum thread</a>.

CD Projekt originally planned for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a> to briefly visit Night City from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, years before the latter launched.
</p>
<p>
The idea has been discussed by the developer before, but an impressive datamining project has now uncovered the work-in-progress script for the scene, which would have seen Geralt and Avallac'h turn up in CD Projekt's future setting - and not be overly impressed by what they found.
</p>
<p>
This moment would have come as part of The Witcher 3's Through Time and Space questline, and acted as an Easter egg for fans hoping to get a glimpse at what CD Projekt was building next.

As found by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-witcher/witcher-3-modders-just-upended-everything-we-know-about-how-it-was-made-with-a-584-page-breakdown-of-an-early-prototype-that-had-a-150-hour-main-quest-all-thanks-to-a-database-containing-almost-every-single-line-of-text-from-its-development/">What Lies Unseen</a>, and highlighted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-witcher/witcher-3-modders-datamine-a-quest-where-geralt-would-have-teleported-to-night-city-from-cyberpunk-2077-technologically-advanced-but-broken-dying/">PC Gamer</a>, the script for the sequence - as it was back around 2012, three years before the final version of The Witcher 3 launched - would have been as follows:
</p>
<p><code>Geralt: What... What is this place? Is this the afterlife?<br>
Avallac'h: No. Just another of the realities the Spiral leads through... Technologically advanced, but broken. Dying.<br>
Geralt: Disgusting. This stench, noise... How can you live here?!<br>
Avallac'h: You should know better. This world is inhabited by humans, not elves.<br></code></p><p>
Insight from What Lies Unseen includes that CD Projekt also planned to have Geralt toss a coin to a begger who would then turn up in Cyberpunk 2077, rich from your Novigrad gold.
</p>
<p>
In the end, Through Time and Space remained in The Witcher 3 - albeit with different sequences that saw Geralt pingpong between the Ddiddiwedht Desert, a poisoned valley, an underwater section and an icy tundra. Less exciting.
</p>
<p>Perhaps, now Cyberpunk 2077 is out, this idea might be easier to make happen in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>? CD Projekt recently confirmed its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-has-entered-full-scale-production-cd-projekt-confirms">next project has entered "full production"</a>, and Eurogamer recently revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/technical-ambition-optimism-and-timeframes-what-we-learned-about-the-witcher-4-from-speaking-to-cd-projekt-red">the technical ambition, optimism, and timeframes the developer is working to for it</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/10/borderlands-4-and-mafia-the-old-country-trailers-will-both-be-at-the-game-awards/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Two of 2K Games’ biggest upcoming titles will have new trailers released during The Game Awards 2024 this week, with both <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mafia-the-old-country">Mafia: The Old Country</a> to feature among the many, many, many game trailers and announcements.</p>
<p>The Mafia <a href="https://x.com/mafiagame/status/1866165956134707406">social media</a> account kept things pretty tame, just saying “See you at [The Game Awards].” A full game reveal is expected for the game, which is due to launch in 2025 across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>


<p>It was a lot more… verbose from Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford though, who <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1866164877665919396">eagerly chirped</a>, “It’s happening, you guys! I will be at The Game Awards with a new trailer for Borderlands 4. I can’t wait!”</p>
<p>He continued, “Yes, there is GAME PLAY in the trailer! Also, in addition to a lot of in-game footage, I will share a sick, never-before-seen original cinematic sequence depicting a moment that occurs about half way between the end of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/borderlands-3">Borderlands 3</a> and the beginning of Borderlands 4. I AM EXCITE!”</p>
<p>I think he’s pretty hyped? It’s difficult to tell.</p>

<p>This should hopefully get the franchise and studio back on track, though. Borderlands 3 was a big success for the studio in 2019, followed up a few years later with the well received spin-off <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/03/30/tiny-tinas-wonderlands-review/">Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands</a>, but the company itself has gone through some turbulent times. It was acquired by Embracer in 2021, who decided to balloon it in size by adding sub-studios, bolstering a publishing arm and stuffing it with acquired IP… before the financial house of cards started to teeter and they were <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/11/report-embracer-groups-exploring-sale-of-gearbox-entertainment/">forced to try and sell off divisions</a>. That led to Gearbox being <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/28/embracer-sells-off-gearbox-to-take-two-for-460-million/">acquired by Take-Two</a> earlier this year, which made the most sense since the Borderlands IP had remained tied to 2K Games publishing label anyway.</p>
<p>Through all of this there was the 9 year production of the Borderlands movie, which ended up just being a massive folly, vanity project and waste of money. At least it gave Cate Blanchett something to do after going a little stir crazy during the 2020-21 lockdowns.</p>
<p>The Game Awards 2024 will be marking the show’s 10th anniversary, as Geoff Keighley launched a replacement to the Spike Video Game Awards in 2014. It will be a late one for UK and Europe, the show starting at a hospitable 7:30PM ET / 4:30PM PT for the US, but 12:30AM GMT in the UK. And that’s not even the main show, but rather the “opening act”.</p>
<p>If I were you, I’d just catch up on things the day after.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/epic-games-users-refunds-are-being-issued-by-the-ftc-following-settlement-of-fortnite-case/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The United States Federal Trade Commission started issuing refunds to consumers impacted by Epic Games' practices in Fortnite, which led to unwanted purchases of perks, emotes, and other in-game elements.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ftc-starts-issuing-refunds-to-epic-games-users-following-settlement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GamesIndustry</a>, the FTC confirmed that it is sending its first batch of payments to impacted users, totaling 629,344, half of them in checks and the other in PayPal transfers. The remaining payments will be sent at a later date. The average payment is around $114.</p>
<p>This first batch of refunds for Epic Games users is being set as part of a settlement reached back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-to-pay-520m-to-the-ftc-as-settlement-over-fortnite-privacy-case/">December 2022</a>. The FTC charged the publisher with deploying shady tactics to drive unwanted purchases of virtual currency in Fortnite to purchase outfits, perks, and emotes. For this violation, Epic Games had to pay $245 million in fines, which the FTC is using to issue the refunds that started making their way to impacted users today.</p>
<p>This isn't the only violation Epic Games was fined for by the Federal Trade Commission. The Fortnite publisher was also charged with violating the COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act), collecting information from children under 13 who played the popular battle royale game without verifiable consent from a parent and making parents jump through hoops to have their children's data deleted, an issue that has <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/epic-ftc-settlement-and-moving-beyond-long-standing-industry-practices?sessionInvalidated=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long been addressed</a>. This violation cost Epic Games $275 million, bringing the total fine to $520 million.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ewcf-club-partner-program-expansion/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ewcf-club-partner-program-to-award-%E2%80%98six-figure-funding%E2%80%99-to-40-esports-organisations.1056564/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ewcf-club-partner-program-expansion/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has been revealed by the Esports World Cup Foundation that the EWCF Club Partner Program applications for 2025 are now open – and that the scheme has been massively bolstered. The EWCF Club Partner Program will now invest $20 million into organisations, and this year, the scheme has been expanded to cover 40 members, up from 30 last year.</p>



<p>The top eight teams from the EWC’s Club Championship automatically score an invite, but the remaining 32 slots are up for grabs now.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-prestigious-program">Prestigious Program</h2>



<p>The EWCF Club Partner Program isn’t open to <strong>every organisation</strong>. Some prerequisites must be met by applicants, including having a high level of fan engagement and ‘creative excellence’. </p>



<p>Here’s the spiel from <a href="https://esportsworldcup.com/en/clubprogram" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the press release</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The EWCF Club Partner Program 2025 will focus on Clubs around the world that show high levels of fan engagement and creative excellence. Through this partnership, the EWCF and the participating Clubs will jointly invest to tell the EWC 2025 stories. Partnered Clubs are expected to have an established track record of elite competitive performance across multiple games, as well as a substantial social media presence with the ability to engage and grow a global fanbase. </p>



<p>Participating Clubs will be able to access the Program funding by engaging their fanbase with their brands throughout the esports year – so fans can follow storylines leading up to the Esports World Cup, watching tournaments online and experiencing live matches during the season.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>All participating clubs will receive a six-figure sum to help grow their organisation ahead of the Esports World Cup 2025. If the participants see immense success as part of the EWCF Club Partner Program, they’ll receive additional funding. It was stressed that being a member of the scheme <strong>doesn’t </strong>grant instant qualification into next year’s Esports World Cup, though.</p>



<p>Per the terms of the application process, organisations have until the 10th of January to get their forms filled out. </p>



<p>In a statement, Faisal bin Homran, the CPO of the EWCF, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The EWCF Club Partner Program represents a significant step forward in our ongoing mission to foster a thriving ecosystem for esports Clubs worldwide while unlocking opportunities for organizations from some of the world’s fastest-growing esports markets, like China. </p>



<p>Through this program, we enable partnered Clubs to attract fans with engaging content beyond the games, showcasing the personalities and talent of players, alongside their origin stories, while also developing their Clubs’ brands as fan-favorite powerhouses in esports entertainment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Marvel Rivals developers, Netease, have just released the game’s first post-launch update, version 20241210. The new patch brings some hero balancing changes, map and game mode fixes and more.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-general-changes-nbsp">General Changes&nbsp;</h2>



<ul>
<li>The Marvel Rivals version <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1866393674554527800" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">20241210</a> update introduces a fix for lag and significant crosshair deviation while playing highlights and recordings. Saving highlights will no longer cause the game to crash.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Players observed that heroes equipped with costumes were not visible when joining a quick match as a replacement; this issue has been fixed. Additionally, mission progress on the Season Event screen will be displayed correctly after the latest Marvel Rivals update.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Moreover, fixes related to textual errors, relatively common crash issues, and game freezing have also been released; more will be added in a future update.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-maps-and-game-mode-changes">Maps and Game Mode Changes</h2>



<ul>
<li>Clipping or becoming stuck during special collisions in specific maps, such as Hydra Charteris Base: Hell’s Heaven and Klyntar: Symbiotic Surface, have been mainly fixed. However, some areas are still affected, and the developers will continue to work on fixing these problems.&nbsp;</li>



<li>The new Marvel Rivals update also introduces fixes for foggy areas of the Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda: Hall of Djalia and the Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda: Birnin T’Challa. These places will not have fog disappear from Hela and Storm’s perspectives after the new patch. Also, enemies and teammates will be able to see the effects of Joyful Splash when Jeff the Land Shark is revived while in the fog.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Regarding Hydra Charteris Base: Hell’s Heaven—Frozen Airfield, players will observe that lighting no longer behaves abnormally when a player is knocked out near a target area. Also, disconnecting and reconnecting during matches will not cause the desynchronisation of some doors.&nbsp;</li>



<li>There are several fixes for Hydra Charteris Base: Hell’s Heaven – Eldritch Monument. Adam Warlock’s ultimate will no longer lead to teammates being revived and stuck beneath the terrain when the target area ascends or descends. In the exact location, if Thor and Loki were revived through Hela’s team-up ability, they would not get stuck under the terrain.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Moreover, the Marvel Rivals update also ships characters from getting stuck under the terrain when Jeff the Land Shark uses his Ultimate while ascending or descending. In the same situation, Winter Soldier’s Ultimate will no longer lose damage if it’s right on the target.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Coming to Competitive mode changes, the new Marvel Rivals patch will display the vehicle range when switching between rounds. Also, when you reach the third round, Competitive Convoy or Convergence Heroes will not carry over their Ultimate Energy from the second round.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-hero-changes-nbsp">Hero Changes&nbsp;</h2>



<ul>
<li>When players equipped the Deadpool &amp; Wolverine costume for Wolverine, they observed that no ability voice lines instead of Undying Animal would play. This update fixes this issue. Also, Star Lord Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3’s MVP animation does not have sound effects on the result screen, but it has been fixed.&nbsp;</li>



<li>The Marvel Rivals patch also fixes Iron Fist’s voice lines not playing when using pings. Regarding Black Widow, the description of her ADS sensitivity has been fixed. Also, she will recover energy as intended in every situation.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Coming to the last bit of Heroes changes in the new Marvel Rivals update, Captain America’s Ultimate wouldn’t end as intended in specific extreme situations; this problem has been fixed. Now for the most significant change: Doctor Strange’s portals were causing terrain KOs, which restored the character’s ultimate energy. After the new patch, the portals’ terrain KO attribution was disabled as a temporary fix. A proper fix will be ruled out to restore this attribution in a later update.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-pc-and-console-changes-nbsp">PC and Console Changes&nbsp;</h2>



<ul>
<li>Players would observe memory leaks and blurry models on PCs when using FSR 3 frame generation technology to improve the resolution. The new Marvel Rivals update will fix this issue.&nbsp;</li>



<li>For consoles, players observed that restarting the game when wearing the PlayStation bundle’s Scarlet Spider costume would cause the outfit to not display correctly. This issue has also been fixed.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>This morning, Amazon Studios and Games Workshop finalised a deal that was cooking for an entire year. The completion of this deal means that Amazon Studios now has exclusive rights to any movies or television shows set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe – and per a follow-up update from Games Workshop, there are <strong>multiple </strong>productions in the pipeline.</p>



<p>The news was also shared on social media by Henry Cavill, who has been aligned with a Warhammer 40,000 project for the longest time. He’ll be producing and starring in a series of his own, giving him another outlet through which to explore a passion he’s tracked for 30 years.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-signed-sealed-and-delivered">Signed, Sealed, and Delivered</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/c2ngqfgb/major-update-on-amazon-studios-warhammer-stories/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">an update</a> posted by the Warhammer team, it was confirmed that multiple projects are on the 40,000 roadmap:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s official – Games Workshop and Amazon Studios have finalised their deal – the creative guidelines are nailed down, and we’re all set to bring Warhammer to the screen.</p>



<p>But what does that actually mean?</p>



<p>Well, it means we now have synopsis and ordering for the stories we’re going to tell… yep, we said&nbsp;<em>stories</em>! It might have taken a year but it was a year well spent! And what fun – sifting through the enormity of the Warhammer 40,000 universe, debating characters, story arcs and the thematic grit that underpins it all.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In <a href="https://investor.games-workshop.com/news-posts/agreementwithamazonforfilmsandtelevisionseries101224" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the legal release</a>, it was stated that Amazon also has the option to license rights in the Warhammer Fantasy universe <strong>following the release </strong>of any Warhammer 40,000 production – so this deal could eventually run much deeper.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the team at Games Workshop and Amazon Studios stressed that it’ll be many years before production surfaces in full. What has been dubbed as ‘Project One’ is only just preparing to enter the scripting stage, so there’s still a long time left to wait before the fruits of this deal are realised.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>‘Production processes in respect of films and television series may take a number of years.’</p>
</blockquote>



<p>What do you want to see appear as part of this deal? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <p>Games Workshop and Amazon Studios have now officially finalised their plans to bring Warhammer 40K to film and TV screens.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/henry-cavill-reportedly-set-to-star-in-a-warhammer-40k-series-at-amazon">companies have long been in discussion</a>, with actor and Warhammer superfan Henry Cavill set to star and executive produce thanks to his "lore expertise".</p>
<p>Now we have an official statement, with Games Workshop offering Amazon the exclusive rights to both films and television series, as well as merchandising rights.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://investor.games-workshop.com/news-posts/agreementwithamazonforfilmsandtelevisionseries101224">legal notice</a> adds: "Production processes in respect of films and television series may take a number of years."</p>
<p>However, a more <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/c2ngqfgb/major-update-on-amazon-studios-warhammer-stories/">casual statement to the community</a> notes that multiple "stories" are planned, with synopsis and ordering finalised. The first project is "about to go into development proper" - the script is next on the agenda.</p>
<p>"Of course, as with all carefully crafted things, this all takes time... and trust us when we say, everyone involved is las-focused on getting it all just right," reads the statement.</p>
<p>Cavill also shared the news on Instagram, together with his own "pilgrimage" back to the model shop where he bought his first Warhammer models.</p>
<p>"My incredible team and I, alongside the brilliant minds at Games Workshop, have been working away in concept rooms, breaking down approaches to the enormity and magnificence of the Warhammer world," he wrote in the post.</p>
<p>"Together, we've been sifting through the plethora of incredible characters and poring over old tomes and texts. Our combined efforts have led us to a fantastic place to start our Universe, which has been agreed upon by those up on high at both Amazon and Games Workshop. That starting place shall, for now, remain a secret. Watch this space, though - more to come in time!"</p>

<p>This won't be the first time the companies work together, though, as there's a Warhammer 40K episode in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/four-episodes-of-amazons-secret-level-anthology-hints-at-a-rich-visual-picknmix-but-is-that-enough">Amazon's forthcoming Secret Level series</a>.</p>

<p>However, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saber-ceos-supposed-comments-raise-eyebrows-for-saying-games-should-be-about-glory-kills-not-imposing-morals">comments supposedly from the CEO of developer Saber Interactive</a> raised eyebrows for stating that games should be about "glory kills" instead of "imposing morals on gamers".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Here’s what he said at the time:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Witcher 4 has been announced. I can't say anything about it. What we know is that Geralt will be part of the game, we just don't know how much, and the game won't focus on Geralt. So it's not about him this time. We don't know who it's about. I'm excited to find out. I want to know! I have not seen any script yet — I mean, I couldn't tell you if I did. This is the thing, so I could be lying through my teeth. But I'm not. Or am I?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">CD Projekt had long made clear that Geralt's saga had come to an end, meaning a new protagonist was fully expected for Polaris, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-4-stars-geralt-of-rivia-but-not-as-the-main-character">this was the first confirmation he'd be in the next game at all</a> — and fueled <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/witcher-4-story-fan-theories-ciri-vesemir"><u>some rampant fan theories</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Only a single teaser image, below, has otherwise been revealed for The Witcher 4, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-4-dev-confirms-teaser-is-a-brand-new-witcher-school">but it was enough to suggest Ciri will be the protagonist this time around</a>. What's considered the "true" ending of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, thanks to its story being continued in canon comics, sees her become a witcher herself.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/03/23/untitled-2-1648052443071.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Witcher 4 teaser image. Image credit: CD Projekt.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But now, Cockle has revealed those comments raised a few eyebrows at The Witcher developer CD Projekt, and he now insists he has no idea if Geralt is in The Witcher 4, or who the main character is — although he admits that a non-disclosure agreement would force him to lie about it if he did.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I did go online and I said something about this and then I got slapped by CD Projekt,” Cockle said. “I don't know how true it is. I went off a rumor. I thought I'd seen somebody from CD Projekt say that Geralt will be in Witcher 4 but he won't be the main character. And I don't actually know if that's true now because they came back and they went, ‘We haven't put anything out there, don't say anything.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So the truth is, the answer to your question is, I don't know what it's going to be. I have ideas. I thought I had an idea what it was. And then I was kind of basically told, ‘We haven't told anybody what it is, so where you got that information we don't know.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think it might be from a really really old statement that somebody who no longer works for CD Projekt actually put out about three years ago. So Witcher 4 is a complete mystery to me. I actually don't know.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Later in the interview, Cockle said Ciri as protagonist in The Witcher 4 would make sense, pointing to her ability to travel between worlds. He also reveals that years ago he spoke with someone at CD Projekt about what a future Witcher video game might look like, and discussed a Witcher origin story, among other ideas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ultimately, though, Cockle is keeping his cards close to his chest here. “The truth is I can’t answer the question because I’ve signed an NDA,” he said. “So even if I did know, I’d have to lie to you.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/10/gettyimages-1356685274-1733820615489.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Doug Cockle insists The Witcher 4 is a mystery to him.

			<p>Yesterday, Croatian game developer Croteam announced The Talos Principle: Reawakened, an Unreal Engine 5 remaster of the first entry in the adventure franchise. A substantial visual upgrade is the first thing you'll notice, but there's a lot more, according to the studio.</p>
<p>Reawakened includes the <a href="https://wccftech.com/talos-principle-dlc-road-gehenna-announcned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Road to Gehenna expansion</a> and adds a brand new chapter called In the Beginning. Croteam says the new content explores the Simulation's origins and the challenges of its first test, adding new layers to the game's philosophical and narrative depth. Moreover, the developer will release a puzzle editor with The Talos Principle: Reawakened to empower&nbsp;modders to build unique worlds and challenges for the whole community.</p>

			<p>Once again we find ourselves in the world of retro-tinged horror, with 2024 being especially productive for developers exploring this style of horror. Among Ashes is the latest to enter the conversation as one of the best examples of the genre.</p>
<p><iframe title="Among Ashes - Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RFBzqIK4Q9g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The recent trend towards PS1-era aesthetics is partly repeated here, but the unique selling point for Among Ashes is that it actually contains multiple different perspectives and game types within its four or five hour playtime. You begin by sitting at an in-game PC playing a horror-themed Doom clone before being interrupted by a friend on an instant messaging service that is deliberately designed to look like it’s ripped straight out of the early 2000s. This is an interesting choice of period setting and one that brought me right back to my undergraduate days. Your friend sends you a link to a creepy pasta style forum post about a supposedly haunted game mysteriously released by a solo developer. That game within a game, Night Call, becomes the main focus of your time.</p>


<p>Here you play as a police officer called to investigate strange noises coming from the Stoker house but soon upon arriving your partner is attacked by a zombie and things start to take a turn for the horrific.</p>
<p>Night Call takes on the PS1 blocky graphics and deliberately wooden voice acting of early survival horror, but relocates the traditional American setting to a distinctly British country house. The setting reminded me of the cult classic Clive Barker’s Undying at times, an influence that is replicated through the demonic enemies that plague your time exploring the ubiquitous mysterious mansion.</p>


<p>Navigating the house is done via a first person perspective which suits the 2000s PC setting. At first you’ll have to fend off enemies with a simple police baton (UK police not generally being armed with firearms) but you can use this to defend and block most incoming damage. As the game progresses you’ll find the usual pair of a pistol and shotgun, but ammo is relatively scarce a lot of the time and best saved for the occasional forced encounter. The main enemies you face can only be put down for a short time anyway so it is best to save your bullets.</p>
<p>Alongside the basic but era-appropriate combat you’ll have to solve a number of logic and environmental puzzles to get keys and venture deeper into the mansion. Some of these involve breaking the fourth wall of the game and looking up details on the in-game web browser or messaging your friend. One particular standout sees you having to complete a retro top down game within the game within the game in real Inception fashion, whilst another section involves being chased around a cave system by a terrifying instakill enemy.</p>
<p>The sheer variety of game styles and approaches here ensures that you always have something new to enjoy and nothing ever gets the chance to outstay its welcome. Perhaps the main exception here is that aforementioned cave chase which involved some quite counter-intuitive signposting in its pre-release build. I also encountered one or two minor bugs that were a little frustrating but the devs have been busily updating the game ready for release so these should be squashed.</p>

<p>So, Among Ashes features a number of meta-levels and games within games throughout but the framing narrative also becomes a game of its own. As you push deeper into the retro joys of Night Call, strange things start to happen in the real world of the game and you begin to suspect that the game is trying to communicate with you. Without spoiling anything, I can confirm that the different strands of the game do pull together as the game comes to a close and the result is a nicely balanced mixture of different realities.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Among Ashes is a great addition to this already stellar year of indie horror. It doesn’t quite reach the highs of titles like Hollowbody, but is an enjoyable dose of horror nostalgia that pulls together a range of approaches to create an identity that feels fresh and unique.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-support-ends-in-january-2025-offline-mode-and-deathstroke-out-now/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Rocksteady has <a href="https://www.suicidesquadgame.com/en-us/community/season-4-deep-dive" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that support for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League will end in January 2025 with the release of Season 4's Episode 8. That's not surprising in the least, since the game was a massive flop in terms of sales (it <a href="https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-games-revenue-decline-suicide-squad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cost</a> publisher Warner Bros. Games a 41% decrease in Q2 2024 revenue) and critical reception. Here on Wccftech, reviewer Nathan Birch <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rated</a> it 5 out of 10 at launch:</p>
<p><em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League has a sprinkling of that classic Rocksteady charm, delivering polished visuals, fluid traversal and combat, and some snappy repartee, but the whole experience is bogged down by dreary, repetitive mission design, empty live service elements, and a feel-bad story that’s mean-spirited to the point of feeling oddly resentful. Perhaps most damning, not even the thing promised in the game’s title – fighting and dispatching the Justice League – ends up being particularly fun or memorable. Those who really want to see what becomes of the Arkhamverse may not be able to resist picking this up, but I suggest waiting for a steep discount before subjecting yourself to this tedious team-up.</em></p>
<p>Those steep discounts have arrived, though. For the recently ended Steam Autumn sale, the game was 95% off. Now it's back at full price, but there will likely be another large discount with the Holiday sale that starts in a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Rocksteady also improved Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League in various ways throughout the past year, keeping the full announced plan of four post-launch seasons, which introduced new maps and playable characters: the <a href="https://wccftech.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-gets-season-1-roadmap-joker-coming-on-march-28/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joker</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-season-2-is-out-next-week-will-add-mrs-freeze-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mrs. Freeze</a>, Lawless, and now Deathstroke, who was added with today's update. Deathstroke features a close-range, melee combat playstyle powered by his sword. This is complemented by the following firearms: Assault Rifles, Shotguns, and Sniper Rifles.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/M04_Mayhem_10-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The new seasonal episode also introduces a new medieval-like Elseworld inspired by DC's Dark Knights of Steel comic book series. Last but certainly not least, the new update adds the long-awaited Offline Mode, allowing players to experience all content released for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League without an Internet connection. However, all online features will also remain available for the time being, so co-op play is still going to be an option.</p>
<p>As for what's next for Rocksteady, it's worth reminding that the studio was <a href="https://wccftech.com/rocksteady-reportedly-hit-by-layoffs-following-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-flop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hit</a> by layoffs a few months ago. The rumor is that they've been working <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-directors-cut/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on a Director's Cut for Hogwarts Legacy</a>. Then, perhaps, they'll return to the Batman: Arkham franchise, though it will inevitably take a few years.</p>

            <p>If we follow Marshall McLuhan’s ideas about technology being an extension of the body, then the copy and paste keyboard shortcuts are my equivalent of a trip to one of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>’s ripperdocs. In the writing of this single article, I will use them for links, HTML code, and other ephemera. I even copied McLuhan’s name across from a different tab, which I’m sure he’d appreciate/be horrified by. I love those shortcuts. I need them. They are the wind beneath my wings, and the crud buildup beneath the bottom left of my keyboard.</p>
<p>I cannot say how the first tailor to gaze upon a sewing machine felt, nor the first egg-abacus attendant to behold the sorcerous ticking of the automated egg timer. But I think now that when they saw those things, they were afraid. As I am afraid now.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I am afraid now. I highlight the above words, and reach to press Ctrl+C. My curled pinkie finds its target instantly, but my index finger hesitates. Sense memory rushes through synapses. Somewhere, a rodent’s heart beats as it chews pensively on a bin bag yoghurt splotch. A moth’s wings flutter as it practises scaring the shit out of someone in the shower. A cascade of pigeon poop plummets into a lunching office worker’s quintuple-named Starbucks drink, ironically making it taste slightly more like real coffee. My index finger finds its mark, so quickly as to be indistinguishable to anyone as a lapse in cohesion.</p>
<p>Anyone but me.</p>
<p>I am afraid now. I type these words manually, refusing to cast aside yet more of my fleeting mortality to the micro-micro-microseconds I’ve now identified between my pressing of Ctrl and V. For I now realise what that ‘+’ symbol has taken from me. A gulf of time and possibility. A gaping wound of opportunity. A subtraction in mocking masquerade.</p><p>I have seen the face of the cosmic jester that jabs and japes at the apex of all realities, and his name is the Copy and Paste 2-Key Keyboard SAYO OSU Keypad Hotswap One Handed Mechanical Gaming Keyboard Cherry Switch RGB Backlit Mini USB Keypad for macros or Rhythm Games. Which is just the sort of bollocks you’d expect from him, honestly.</p>
<p>I am afraid now. I am typing this manually again. It feels, in some small way, like an act of reclamation. One less layer of simulacrum in the chain of words on a website, copied from words in a document, copied from words in a dictionary, copied from soundwaves uttered by human mouths, inspired by abstract concepts, material realities glimpsed and filtered through subjective experience, dreams where someone offers you a grape but there’s a tiny version of your own dad living inside the grape and you say “I can’t eat that, it’s my dad!” and your dad shouts from inside the grape “but you must, son. <em>You must</em>.”</p>
<p>Perhaps I must. And perhaps I must also purchase the Copy and Paste 2-Key Keyboard SAYO OSU Keypad Hotswap One Handed Mechanical Gaming Keyboard Cherry Switch RGB Backlit Mini USB Keypad for macros or Rhythm Games. I’m actually genuinely curious to see whether it makes my life any easier. Maybe I could set up little macros for Total Warhammer. Maybe I could finally start to live again.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Recently, a trailer surfaced on YouTube for a new Satisfye product called the Zengrip 2, a case for the Nintendo Switch 2 — or whatever it’s going to be called. The trailer was quickly deleted, but not before eagle-eyed users snapped shots of the footage, which showcased what could be the first look at a finished Switch 2.</p>



<p>It’s highly likely it’s a shot of a mock-up produced by Satisfye based on leaks and Nintendo-provided dimensions, but it <strong>could </strong>also be our first look at Nintendo’s upcoming console.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-bait-and-switch-2">Bait and Switch (2)</h2>



<p>The assumed leak was spotted on Twitter by ‘DP19’, who captured a grainy image of the trailer before it was taken down by Satisfye:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Other users then followed up with successive shots of the same video <a href="https://x.com/nRAYm2002/status/1866295996785074518" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">that were a little clearer</a>. Presently, the driving notion behind this being a real Switch 2 is that the ‘Joycons’ featured in the trailer have ‘the extra button’ that’s sitting front and centre on leaked designs.</p>



<p>Even if it is the Switch 2, it’s almost too blurry to make out any major details. Many have quipped that it ‘looks like a Switch’, which is fairly obvious. It was never expected that Nintendo would make any great or innovative strides when piecing together the next generation of the popular handheld console.</p>



<p>Do you think the Switch 2 leak is to be believed, or could it be a marketing ploy by Satisfye? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>The FTC has announced that the ‘first wave’ of refunds resulting from a $245 million fine to Epic Games <span>is being distributed&nbsp;<strong>now</strong>. In March 2023, Epic Games was ordered to pay back players ‘duped’ into spending money by mistake, and the first round of refunds—totalling $72 million—has</span> started being handed out.</p>



<p>When the dust had settled in the FTC vs. Fortnite case, the gaming titan was found to have been promoting a ‘counterintuitive, inconsistent, and confusing button configuration’ that subsequently led to millions of players making purchases they didn’t want.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-are-you-owed-a-fortnite-refund">Are You Owed a Fortnite Refund?</h2>



<p>In recent years, the United States Federal Trade Commission has been hot on these tactics, which typically involve ‘clever placement’ of buttons and prompts to encourage users to buy things in digital stores without them necessarily meaning to.</p>



<p>The FTC claimed that Epic Games was knowingly allowing children to ‘rack up unauthorised charges without any parental involvement’. It’s not the first company to adopt these tactics, nor will it be the last, but it’s one of the firms hit the hardest by legal action pursued by the Federal Trade Commission.</p>



<p>By way of a resolution, Epic Games agreed to discontinue the use of these shady tactics, and it noted that it would put in place a prompt requesting consent from the consumer before making any purchase. </p>



<p>Next week, 629,344 customers will be refunded an average of $114 – and this is just the first stop of the refund train.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/united-healthcare-luigi-mangione<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>On Monday, police <a href="https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/brian-thompson-unitedhealthcare-death-investigation-12-9-24/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">arrested 26-year-old Luigi Mangione</a> in connection to last week’s shooting of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson. The handsome suspect and his alleged actions <a href="https://gizmodo.com/bitter-americans-react-to-unitedhealthcare-ceos-murder-my-empathy-is-out-of-network-2000534520" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brought the internet together</a>, and now we’ve been brought together again in the age-old practice of combing through Mangione's internet history. The literary-minded are diving into his <a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/luigi-mangione-united-healthcare-goodreads-account.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Goodreads account</a>, politics reporters are looking at his <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/murky-wing-politics-alleged-uhc-193654118.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">politics</a>, and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/luigi-mangione-arrested-uhc-shooting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tech</a> and <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/healthcare-ceo-shooting-suspect-luigi-mangione-has-connections-to-the-videogame-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">games</a> sites are looking at his gaming history.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s not a mystery why sites are doing this. At websites that depend on SEO, and even at news sites more broadly, it’s a pretty obvious thing to do: people are justifiably interested in Mangione, who he is and what might have motivated him. If some facet of that dovetails with the subject of your site, it’s a no-brainer to write it up, both to serve your specific readership and try to catch some of the spike in search interest before it expires.</p><p>And it even makes sense why non-journalists would read these stories, and why they’d do digging of their own. Often, readers do this because a violent event is so shocking, but what felt so unique about Thompson’s shooting was the general relatability of it all, a certain lack of outrage that crossed political divides. It wasn’t really a mystery why someone would do something like this to a health insurance CEO, one who oversaw a company rife with <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/06/business/insurance-claim-denials-unitedhealthcare-ceo/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coverage denials and horror stories</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Nothing that’s been uncovered so far about Mangione, who was arrested on firearms charges but has not been charged with the shooting, changes that fact. Neither his reading or gaming history or the speculation that he <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/unitedhealthcare-shooting-suspect-luigi-mangione-read-books-chronic-pain-1997995" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suffered from back pain</a> is necessary to explain what he might have done. The alleged gaming-related details of his life are pedestrian: He is an <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/luigi-mangione-arrested-uhc-shooting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">app developer</a> who graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 2020, where he helped start a game development club due to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200426034424/https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/student-club-highlights-interdisciplinary-art-making-video-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an interest in indie games</a>. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/healthcare-ceo-shooting-suspect-luigi-mangione-has-connections-to-the-videogame-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC Gamer</a> says his LinkedIn account suggests he interned at Firaxis in 2016 to help with <em>Civilization VI, </em>the kind of thing a young person interested in game development might do. On Reddit, a user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/videogamedunkey/comments/1haj7qb/the_alleged_uhc_assassin_was_a_dunkey_fan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared an image</a> of what could be Mangione’s high school yearbook entry, featuring a silly quote by YouTuber Dunkey that reveals nothing but the possibility that he watched YouTube, the way millions of people do every day.&nbsp;</p><p>Wired identified an <a href="https://www.xboxgamertag.com/search/lmangione" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox account</a> that shares Mangione’s name, which doesn’t seem to have been used in over a decade. That account shows playtime in Call of Duty, Halo, Gears of War, and Alan Wake. PC Gamer also identified a<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198111618038/games/?tab=all" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Steam account</a> potentially belonging to Mangione, noting that it’s the “admin of a small Steam group for the game development club that Mangione belonged to at the University of Pennsylvania.” That account has been more recently used, with top games including <em>PUBG</em>, <em>Terraria</em>, <em>Rocket League</em>, and <em>Civ VI</em>.</p><p>These are all the kinds of games a regular person who plays games plays, the way so many regular people play games. Mangione may have played Call of Duty, so <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2019/08/05/trump-republican-focus-on-video-games-and-call-of-duty-after-mass-shootings-is-a-transparent-distraction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">often</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/05/lawsuit-argues-call-of-duty-helped-cause-the-uvalde-school-shooting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">referenced</a> <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2019/08/07/five-things-to-know-about-video-games-and-mass-shootings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in</a> <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/08/05/748387407/video-games-are-still-blamed-for-gun-violence-despite-studies-showing-no-connect" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shootings</a> as some kind of explanation, but it was over a decade ago, one wildly popular game in a possible history of popular AAA and indie games. These games tell us nothing about why a man was murdered in cold blood, and they don’t need to. We already know why. People are sick of this shit; of this broken system and the seeming invincibility of the people who perpetuate it, of the growing impossibility of living a normal life where you go to school and play video games and listen to audiobooks at the gym and if you hurt your back you’ll be able to get care for it without crawling through a labyrinth of hoops and bankrupting yourself in the process.</p><p>There is no mystery to unravel here, beyond the <a href="https://defector.com/i-would-not-take-my-post-assassination-meal-at-an-altoona-mcdonalds-but-i-guess-im-built-different" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">somewhat baffling choices</a> Mangione may have made post-shooting, and beyond why the <a href="https://hellgatenyc.com/two-manhattan-murder-investigations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NYPD</a> exists at all.
