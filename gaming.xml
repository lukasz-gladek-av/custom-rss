            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">There are few who would dispute that last year’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2</a> was a supremely well-executed remake of the 2001 original, but you could also argue in retrospect that developer Bloober Team’s modernising of a survival horror masterpiece was a pretty safe bet. Silent Hill f, from developer Neobards Entertainment, is a much bolder undertaking by comparison. It offers an entirely new story in a completely foreign setting, with a captivating protagonist who bucks the series’ trend of featuring predominately morose, middle-aged men, and keeps its handguns holstered in favour of a strictly melee-focussed fighting system. Although the cumbersome and inconsistent nature of its pipe-swinging combat made it something I had to grin and bear rather than rip and tear, Silent Hill f is a success in almost every other way and is certainly one of the strongest new games in the series since the PlayStation 2 era.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In case it wasn’t clear, Silent Hill f is a Silent Hill story that doesn’t in any way feature the well-trodden town of its namesake. In fact, it’s the first mainline entry in the iconic Japanese survival horror series that’s actually set in Japan – in this case the fictional village of Ebisugaoka in the 1960s – and it provides a backdrop rich with carefully crafted cultural touches that make it one of the series’ most intriguing locations to explore. Every little detail combines to evoke a strong sense of place, from the muddy rice fields to slosh through to the ramune soda bottles to gulp down and the puzzles inspired by local folklore to solve, some of which proved to be seriously challenging for my ignorant Australian brain. (I’ve tracked down plenty of keys and crests in the survival horror genre over the years, but I’ve never needed to put my controller down and Google what a kudzu plant looks like before.)   </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Silent Hill f - Review Screens</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s also the first time in a long time that a mainline Silent Hill story has allowed us to take control of a lead character with any sort of meaningful depth, in this case high school student Hinako Shimizu. The black sheep of her family, Hinako is clearly the victim of an abusive, alcoholic father and her subservient enabler of a mother. In typical Silent Hill fashion, her many psychological scars manifest themselves into menacing physical threats as her sleepy village adopts an increasingly creepy visage, forcing Hinako to become a doggedly determined agent of her own destiny rather than a mere damsel in distress. From there, Silent Hill f’s story confidently explores the complex themes of gender discrimination, child abuse, and drug dependency – among many other horrific human afflictions – gradually teasing out the root causes of Hinako’s torment through the uncovering of private letters from her school friends and increasingly frequent encounters with malevolent visual metaphors.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There’s one particularly grisly moment in here that makes Heavy Rain’s infamous pinky-severing scene seem like little more than a paper cut.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">What unfolds is an utterly absorbing adventure, tautly paced and packed with surprises including some moments of genuinely unsettling body horror and torture – seriously, there’s one particularly grisly moment in here that makes <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/heavy-rain">Heavy Rain’s</a> infamous pinky-severing scene seem like little more than a paper cut. It all builds to a thoroughly harrowing conclusion at the end of Hinako’s nine-hour journey that left me with plenty of disturbing thoughts to process, as well as a strong urge to head back into New Game+ to explore Hinako’s other potential fates further via the four additional endings to unlock.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Soup Foggy Slog</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As a fog descends on Ebisugaoka and blood-red flowers and veiny tendrils start to entangle its mysteriously abandoned streets, so begins the emergence of various nightmarish creatures that hound Hinako at every turn. Some of the neighbourhood nasties seem pretty <em>fog </em>standard for a Silent Hill campaign, like the mannequin-esque dolls that go for your throat with kitchen knives from around unchecked corners. However, there are a decent number of inspired new creature creations too, such as the twisted scarecrows modelled on Hinako’s schoolmates that shift from contorted stationary poses to startling lunges whenever you turn your back to them, like they’re playing a more stab-happy game of schoolyard statues. Later there are some truly disgusting, slack-mawed beasts covered in bulbous bellies like an enormous cluster of rotting flesh grapes, that give birth to howling demon types in an attempt to overwhelm you. There’s no doubt that Silent Hill f took one look at the series’ dedication to conjuring up the most repulsive monstrosities possible, and asked someone to hold its can of Asahi. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I just wish I had as much fun fighting these magnificent monsters as I did marveling at their exceptionally ghastly forms, because actually taking them on usually isn’t fun and it isn’t particularly frightening. It’s just annoying – and this doesn’t seem like the type of survival horror where you’re supposed to feel outmatched and avoid combat whenever possible, at least not beyond its opening hours. Unlike many previous Silent Hill stories, there isn’t a single shotgun or pistol to be found in Silent Hill f to battle these beasts with. Instead Hinako is only capable of carrying up to three breakable melee weapons like crowbars and baseball bats that she finds in her surroundings – which makes sense in context, since you’d assume that firearms would be harder to stumble upon in a mountainside village in Japan than they would be in the series’ usual home in the United States. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a result, the strictly close-quarters combat encounters largely involve delivering a mix of light and heavy attacks as well as performing dashes and dodges to evade incoming blows, all of which sap Hinako’s aggravatingly stingy stamina bar and momentarily curb her ability to perform any of these actions should you allow it to deplete. There is also a focus ability that allows you to pull off special charged-up hits and easier counters, and even blocks if you're holding a heavy weapon like the sledgehammer, but this too comes at a cost – draining your sanity meter which, once emptied, makes Hinako’s health bar vulnerable to both physical and shrieking psychological attacks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Having to constantly keep tabs on your health, stamina, sanity, and the state of your weapons, all felt like a bit too much to balance for my tastes – certainly off the back of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2’s</a> fear and instinct-driven point-and-shoot simplicity – and I never really settled into an enjoyable groove with Silent Hill f’s comparatively stilted and repetitive combat as a result. These attributes can admittedly be enhanced slightly over time with buffs and consumables you collect, and nailing a perfect dodge does reward you with a handy stamina boost, but more often than I’d have liked Hinako would run out of puff faster than an asthmatic in a smoker’s lounge and I’d be forced to sort of awkwardly shuffle backwards away from a snarling enemy while I waited for her to remember how her arms worked. Even when there was still plenty of stamina up her school uniform’s sleeve, there were countless times where Hinako would just stubbornly pause between strikes for extended periods while I furiously pumped the attack button in vain.     </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Coping with the restrictive nature of the stamina bar wasn’t my main problem with Silent Hill f’s melee combat, though. Nor was it that my slow and energy-sapping swings would often clang harmlessly into nearby walls despite the fact enemies were often somehow able to hit me directly through scenery. It also wasn’t the way the lock-on target switching seemed frustratingly unreliable when the campaign’s second half puts you up against enemy groups in greater numbers, or how monsters would occasionally hack chunks off my health bar when I was defenselessly trapped in animations like entering a doorway. No, my biggest gripe with Silent Hill f’s fighting is that it’s all risk and no reward. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike, say, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a>, where you earn XP from killing enemies in order to level up your character, or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-4">Resident Evil 4</a> where freshly dispatched foes will often drop vital ammo boxes or healing herbs, winning a battle in Silent Hill f means <em>likely </em>losing some of your health bar and <em>definitely </em>doing some damage to your annoyingly brittle weapons. (Hinako is unable to fight with her bare hands.) This was also true of last year’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2</a> remake – if you substitute a loss of ammo in place of wear and tear on your breakable bats and sickles, that is – but the major difference is that I found the breathless and intuitive thrills of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2</a>’s shotgun-toting scraps to be its own reward. Since I didn’t find Silent Hill f’s fighting to be anywhere near as urgent or exciting, I opted to just straight-up avoid enemy encounters wherever I could – especially the more heavy-set foes that can absorb half a lead pipe’s worth of overhead swings before they expired. (Seriously, if I have to use a big stick to violently smack something eight or nine times before it caves in, I’d at least expect it to suddenly spill packets of Skittles all over the floor at a birthday party.)</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>My biggest gripe with Silent Hill f’s fighting is that it’s all risk and no reward.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Surprisingly, this wasn’t too hard to do for the most part given that most enemies can be comfortably juked around with the dodge button, and many of these easily distracted demons give up the chase the instant you slip around a corner and break the line of sight, as though they’re hellborn babies who’re yet to fully comprehend object permanence. I quickly started skipping combat wherever possible by just running past each ghoul on the way to my next story objective, or ducking into a side street to search for supplies before hoofing it right back.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This passive strategy of exploiting the enemies’ weak AI only worked for so long, and indeed in the story’s final hours there are an increasing amount of repetitive gauntlet-run slogs where the path forward is fully blocked until you kill every creature in the vicinity, but there were lengthy stretches in the first half where I was hustling along a sped-up run-through of Ebisugaoka that seemed more Benny Hill than Silent Hill. That made it tough for the town’s increasingly bleak atmosphere to completely work its way under my skin, no matter how insistent its genuinely ominous ambient audio became, but at least I was having fun rather than feeling frustrated.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Phantasmic Mr. Fox</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, the Torii gate and lantern-lined shrine realm that Hinako drifts in and out of over the course of her journey does mitigate some of these combat issues, but it also gradually empowers her to a point where fighting becomes arguably too easy at times. Visits to this ethereal otherworld, which provides a sinister yet strangely beautiful contrast to the village’s increasingly festering streets, sees Hinako slowly slip under the spell of a morally ambiguous mystery man wearing a fox mask, who’s given the decidedly Kojima-esque name of ‘Fox Mask’. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Early on, Hinako is given an indestructible dagger and polearm in these sections, allowing her to tackle the same monster mobs from the real world minus the risk of each weapon splintering to bits in her hands mid-scrap. However, by the story’s midpoint she’s gained the supernatural ability to siphon the soul power from each enemy she kills and channel it into a sort of beast mode that makes her overpowered and invulnerable for short bursts at a time. To be fair, Hinako’s otherworld evolution does make sense thematically, but her newfound, fox-powered fighting ability is kind of at odds with the fundamentals of survival horror, since unleashing it made me feel less like a vulnerable little red riding hood and more like the big bad wolf. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>[I felt] less like a vulnerable little red riding hood and more like the big bad wolf.&nbsp;</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The shrine realm also brought some frustrations with Silent Hill f’s inventory system to the surface. Having limited pocket space in a survival horror adventure is a given, but I wish that there had been an item storage box of some sort at each Shinto shrine save point so that I could carry consumables that made more sense in the ornate otherworld than they did in the village. For example, I tended to stockpile the toolkits required to repair weapons out in Hinako’s hometown, but since they were useless in the shrine realm I was forced to either offload them completely or sacrifice some precious inventory slots to hold onto them until Hinako returned to the real world. I mean, her collection of earthbound weapons are there waiting for her upon her reemergence from the shrine realm, why not the toolkits too?</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Tristan's Favourite Horror Games</h3><p>Intensity in ten entries.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Having said that, Silent Hill f’s otherworld does at least play host to the bulk of its boss fights, which offer bursts of flashy spectacle on par with other melee-focussed adventures like Elden Ring or Lies of P, but thankfully without being nearly as punishing to overcome – at least, not on the standard combat difficulty setting. Again, there are some really striking character designs on display here, such as the aggressive apparition that shrouds the arena with a red mist to mask its sneaky teleportations, attacks from long distance with a spiked flail, and wraps Hinako in a bear hug to gnaw on her face if you get too close. While these battles still rely on the same sluggish slashing and dodging as every other enemy encounter, they at least provide a bit more in the way of strategic depth.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">More importantly, the bulk of the shrine realm’s levels are structured as elaborate puzzle boxes that are consistently satisfying to solve, from disorientating switch-based mazes to confoundingly cryptic treasure hunts. In fact, in general the puzzles in Silent Hill f do an excellent job of momentarily sidelining combat for a more cerebral challenge, and also serving as crucial storytelling devices. Playing on the hard puzzle difficulty setting, I was regularly forced to pore over every scrap of information in Hinako’s journal for clues, and there are some really clever puzzle sequences to explore here, such as collecting scattered calendar pages in Hinako’s family home and then using them to jump through different time periods to hunt down the disturbing ghosts from her past. If the next Silent Hill focuses more on this sort of thing than on aggravating combat, it will really be onto something. </p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-review]]></content:encoded>

<p>Released in 1987, Zelda II is often cited as one of the most divisive entries in the series thanks to its side-scrolling combat sections. It was a drastic shift away from the original game's approach, and Nintendo soon course-corrected with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/legend_of_zelda_a_link_to_the_past">A Link to the Past</a> in 1991.</p>

			<p>Yes, people are very much still modding The Witcher III: Wild Hunt, even more so after CD Projekt RED <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-redkit-q-further-improvements-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a> the REDkit mod tool last year. On the visual side, HalkHogan's <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-hd-reworked-project-nextgen-edition-is-finally-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Witcher 3 HD Reworked Project NextGen Edition</a> is pretty much a must, but even the experienced modder's latest release does not overhaul every single item in the big open world roleplaying game.</p>



<p>So, as is often the case, fellow modder kwest0rek stepped in to create '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/11259?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Witcher III: Wild Hunt Remastered - NextGen</a>', which specifically targets 41 models that were untouched by HalkHogan's work, replacing them with completely new ones that also feature higher resolution textures. Here's a list of what's been retouched so far:</p>



<ul>
<li>Apple (whole, bitten, and piles of apples)</li>



<li>Loaf of bread</li>



<li>Cabbage (fresh and rotten)</li>



<li>New fruits (green and red grapes, watermelon)</li>



<li>Various herb bags and a jug of herbs (open and closed)</li>



<li>Meats and dishes (bone with leftover meat, baked pig, roasted chicken)</li>



<li>New types of bread (round loaf, baguette)</li>



<li>Various vegetables (carrots, garlic, whole and half onions, potatoes, pumpkin)</li>



<li>Decorative and utility items (metal mug, wooden cup, ceiling wine rack)</li>



<li>Large pile of garlic</li>



<li>Small pile of garlic</li>



<li>Oranges</li>



<li>Large pile of potatoes</li>
</ul>



<p>As you can see below, the improvement is rather noticeable. </p>



<figure></figure>



<figure></figure>



<p>In the comments section of the mod page, the modder said they'd focus on finishing the food models and then move on to remake models of dead NPCs and animals, which could also use some upgrading in The Witcher III: Wild Hunt, even in the Next-Gen Edition.</p>



<p>In other The Witcher news, CD Projekt RED recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-take-some-cues-sapkowski-latest-book/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hinted</a> that the highly anticipated fourth mainline installment will take some cues from author Andrzej Sapkowski's latest novel, Crossroads of Ravens, which has just launched in its English translation. Meanwhile, the fourth season of the Netflix adaptation <a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-the-witcher-season-4-liam-hemsworth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will start airing in October</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/22/silent-hill-f-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/silent-hill-f-review-%E2%80%93-flawless-fear.1304061/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Last year, Konami took a big risk with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/14/silent-hill-2-2024-review/">Silent Hill 2</a>. Not only were they remaking the most beloved game in the franchise, they handed the reins over to Bloober Team, entrusting them with their biggest game to date. That risk paid off, and Silent Hill 2 was a massive success. But where next for this beloved horror franchise? There hadn’t been a new mainline game in many years, and the last two were… well… questionable. Cue Silent Hill f.</p>
<p><iframe title="Silent Hill f - Story Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KWKLv3osnsA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Silent Hill f’s announcement left fans with a lot of questions about its direction. Konami stepped away from the Western setting, embracing Japanese Horror, setting the game in the 1960s, and jumping from Silent Hill to the fictional town of Ebisugaoka.</p>


<p>You take on the role of Hinako Shimizu, a high school student who takes a stroll into town to meet her friends. When she arrives, in typical Silent Hill fashion, everything is not as it seems, a mysterious fog descends upon her friends group, covering the immediate area with beautifully grotesque flora which consumes anything it touches. After Hinako escapes, she realises everyone has disappeared, and proceeds to try and track down her friends and find out what the hell is going on.</p>
<p>Silent Hill 2 remains the benchmark for this series, and Silent Hill f seems to have gone back to its style of storytelling,&nbsp;giving us a tale that slowly unfolds over the course of the game, introducing new details and keeping us guessing right till the very end. It helps that they got Ryukishi07 (of Higurashi When They Cry fame) onboard to write the story, and his DNA is definitely present here.</p>


<p>A lot of the fun is in discovering what’s actually happening to Hinako, although the game does thematically lean towards making your own choices and being your own person. The messaging is powerful, and like Silent Hill 2, will have you emotionally charged throughout. There are a couple of symbolic scenes in the game that had my jaw on the floor, and when I fully understood what those scenes meant, left me feeling morose, and needing time to contemplate what I had just seen. There’s some really powerful imagery that, while initially a little confusing, has more meaning as you discover the secrets of each character.</p>
<p>It leads to a prescribed ending on your first playthrough that, in all honest, doesn’t feel like a great outcome for our protagonist, though you will realise that certain actions have had an impact on the outcome. My mind was blown and I was taken back to Silent Hill 2, and how what you do on your playthrough affects the kind of ending you get. Yes, this is just what I wanted. The game then gives you clear guidelines for what you need to do to see the other endings, so you can reach a better outcome for our heroine.</p>
<p>Now, what <em>really</em> got me, was that New Game+ brought new cutscenes and lore to be discovered, adding proper flavour to what we knew already, in some cases, adding slightly new mechanics as well. I felt like I was playing a new game, and seeing things through a new lens, which I think is the point.</p>

<p>Silent Hill f feels like a traditional Silent Hill experience, going back to the classic third-person view of the original games, instead of the tighter over-the-shoulder style made popular by Resident Evil 4. The action introduces something a little new in the form of dodges and counters, which I quickly fell in love with it. When the horrible beasties come at you, some of their attacks will have a momentary pause, outlining them in a shimmer. Attacking during this time will net you a power blow, sending them reeling and, in some cases, stunning the monster. If you’re quick enough, you can always dodge the attack, with a perfect dodge completely refilling your stamina bar. You can’t just go swinging wildly and hoping for the best; running out of stamina is dangerous, leaving you incapable of attacking or running away.</p>
<p>Along with the stamina bar is the sanity meter, which comes into play when you do focus attacks or when the enemies psychologically attack you. The sanity meter will drain but when the focus meter is full, you can unleash a devastating attack on enemies. If you are interrupted while doing this, it will reduce your max sanity until you can refill it with items. While it’s a great tool for dealing damage, having no sanity means any psychological attacks on you will drain your health, so play around with it carefully.</p>

<p>Of course, you’ll be defending yourself with the many weapons you’ll find lying around. You can carry up to three weapons and they will break after too much use, so you either need to find more or use a repair kit. I’m not normally a fan of weapon degradation, but Silent Hill f strikes a nice balance to make it less of a chore.</p>
<p>You can also upgrade your stats, increasing things like sanity, health, stamina by way of Faith, a currency earned by making offerings at the Hokora save points. Some items you pick up just give big Faith bonuses, but you can trade some health items in as well. You can also increase the amount of Omamori slots you have, equipping these charms to give various bonuses, such as decreased charge time for focus attacks, or just flat stat increases. It would normally feel out of place in a Silent Hill game, but it felt natural here. Thankfully, these upgrades accumulate across multiple playthroughs as it’s impossible to do it all in one run.</p>
<p>There’s a nice variety of enemies on offer, each one terrifying to look at and erratic to fight. The symbolism in enemies has seemingly returned in Silent Hill f, with each creature having a detailed explanation in Hinako’s journal. This is one of the best inclusions because it doesn’t feel like some tacked-on menu item, but more of a look inside Hinako’s mind. As you discover things in game, Hinako will write about it in her book, drawing pictures to supplement the words on paper. It’s really neat and gives you an idea about not only what some of these monsters mean, but also her thought process and logic when it comes to puzzles and local lore.</p>
<p>And you want to read everything. Taking a leaf out of Soulsborne games, there’s a lot to be discovered in the written word of others and Hinako’s journal, so I made sure I searched every nook and cranny to find every piece of obscure information that might help unravel the mystery.</p>

<p>In traditional Silent Hill fashion, there’s an abundance of puzzles to solve, ranging from easy logic to difficult brain destroyers. One puzzle you come across later requires using a cipher to work out code, which my tired brain couldn’t quite figure out. Of course I got it in the end but, for I thought that was me done for a moment! What didn’t help, is that I’d missed a random note, which had another part of the cipher, reinforcing the fact that you want to search everywhere. Credit to the team for actually making the puzzles a challenge.</p>
<p>Design wise, Silent Hill f is absolutely stunning. Even running the game on a lower setting, I was still blown away with how gorgeous it looks. The visuals are beautiful yet terrifying. You want to see everything yet it’s haunting and unsettling. The details on characters’ faces are also very impressive, with each character’s emotions unquestionably represented in Unreal Engine 5. NeoBards really did a sterling job.</p>
<p>The music was composed by series’ veteran Akira Yamaoka and Kensuke Inage who is known for his work on games such as Tekken 8 and Samurai Showdown. Yamaoka’s eerily subtle work can be heard in the Fog World, while Inage provides the sounds for the Otherworld – two contrasting tones, masterfully provided by two titans in the industry. The soundtrack is just perfection and provides added tension to already tense situations, but also serenity when needed.</p>

<p>In past games, there has always been a massive distinction between The Fog World and the Otherworld, and one of the most interesting things about Silent Hill f is just how different those two worlds are. In previous games, Otherworlds are generally grotesque versions of the real world, but this game takes you somewhere completely different. It actually makes a lot of sense from a story perspective, and I can’t wait to see players crack open the symbolic meaning behind all of it.</p>
<p>The core questions the game leaves us with is who are you really? Should you submit to the will of another? Abandon everything you know and love? It’s these mysteries and more that keep me wanting to play Silent Hill f over and over again, because like Silent Hill 2, there’s a lot to unpack, and it’s incredibly well done.</p>

			<p>At a time when the horror genre was thriving, KONAMI’s continued neglect of the Silent Hill series was baffling. While Resident Evil reclaimed its place as one of the greatest survival-horror franchises with its <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-7-survival-horror-king/">seventh entry</a> and successful <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-2-remake/">remakes</a>, and new IPs blossomed, one of the genre’s cornerstones remained dormant. With KONAMI showing little interest in reviving its legacy franchises, it often felt like we’d never return to that fog-shrouded town. Thankfully, that wasn’t the case: last year, Bloober Team’s excellent <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/">Silent Hill 2 remake</a> brought the series back to life.</p>



<p>Besides remaking older entries in the series, KONAMI's plans regarding Silent Hill's revival include the development of new games, and the first one of these new games to launch is Silent Hill f, a survival-horror game that sets itself apart from the rest of the series with its setting, choice of main character, and gameplay features. However, don't let these fool you. Silent Hill f is unmistakably a Silent Hill game through and through, one that balances new features with a very familiar framework to deliver not only a great survival horror experience, but also one of the best in the series to date.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Ebisugaoka is not Silent Hill, but the resemblance is often uncanny.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Set in a small rural Japanese town called Ebisugaoka in the 60s, Silent Hill stars Hinako Shimizu, a young schoolgirl with more than a few troubles fitting into a society that wants her silent, obedient, and complacent. After another heated argument with her parents - her father a drunkard, her mother unable to stand up for herself - Hinako storms out of her home. But right from her first step outside, it's clear that something is terribly amiss. Fog has enveloped the town, and its inhabitants seem to have shut themselves inside their homes, giving the rural village a haunting beauty. After meeting her friend Shu, whom she calls partner, Sakuko, the daughter of the local temple keepers, and Rinko, who clearly harbors feelings for Shu, Hinako realizes her uneasiness is more than justified. A monster born out of the fog attacks the group, forcing them apart, and starting a chain of events that will force Hinako on a journey through all sorts of horrors with some unpredictable consequences.</p>



<p>Written by Ryukishi07, known for the Higurashi and Umineko visual novels, Silent Hill f's story fully delivers on pretty much every front, featuring an engaging dual narrative centered on Hinako, a sort of twisted coming-of-age holding some terrible secrets based on a ritual held in a mysterious temple located in the Otheworld, the dark alternate dimension that debuted with the series back in 1999, where Hinako is guided by yet polite young man wearing a fox mask that provides ample opportunities for some haunting and very disturbing sequences, and for some twisted character development in true series fashion. Saying precisely why the story delivers so much would be going into heavy spoiler territory, but you can rest assured that there are plenty of times when it is difficult to even look at the screen due to some extremely disturbing events, which hold strong symbolic significance that, while a little on the nose, are highly effective. Some unexpected twists, which are properly foreshadowed before their reveal, also contribute to making the experience memorable</p>



<p>Much of the quality of the Silent Hill f story also depends on how it is narrated. Besides regular cutscenes, which use some cinematic camera cuts and Unreal Engine 5's Lumen for greater impact, the game also embraces environmental narration via documents scattered all over Ebisugaoka and some environmental elements that do tell a story if the player is ready to listen. Representing isolation with a lone school desk inside a bigger classroom may be a little too obvious, but it adds a certain depth to the narration and the game as a whole, bridging the disconnect that is too often found in certain games between narrative and gameplay, giving meaning to elements that only look decorative at a glance. A player journal deepens immersion further, offering insights into Hinako’s perceptions of the people closest to her - including her absent sister Junko, whose departure after marriage left a lasting wound - and revealing stark differences between how Hinako sees herself and how others see her.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The mysterious young man wearing a fox mask is one of the central characters in Silent Hill f</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>While the Silent Hill f story sets the new entry in the series apart from every other game that came before it, the gameplay is possibly an even bigger divergence, but mainly only regarding combat. Regarding traversal and puzzle solving, Silent Hill f is as much an entry in the series as the first two Silent Hill games are, featuring multiple locations with complex designs to explore with the aid of a map, an abundance of locked or blocked doors, plenty of puzzles to complete of varying difficulty, and resources to collect, including the ever important restorative items. The puzzles, in particular, are excellent, and at Hard puzzle difficulty, they really put the player's skills to the test without being overly complicated, though there's a specific puzzle-heavy sequence at the halfway point of the game that feels a little frustrating and impacts an otherwise excellent pacing, which masterfully balances story, traversal, and combat. Thankfully, powering through this sequence is rather rewarding, thanks to the events that take place right after it, which represent one of the highlights of the experience, with some haunting and disturbing sequences that are very hard to forget.</p>



<p>Although different types of restorative items have become the norm in survival horror games, in Silent Hill f they are some of the elements that better represent the bigger divergence the game takes from the established formula. Besides items that restore Hinako's health, you will find items that restore her Stamina and Sanity, two values that power some of the game's core combat mechanics. Unlike other entries in the series, Silent Hill doesn't feature any firearms, and Hinako has to rely on the makeshift weapons she can find all around Ebisugaoka - steel pipes, kitchen knives, sledgehammers, axes, and so on. To preserve the resource management mechanics so central to a survival horror experience, every weapon in the game, with only a few noteworthy exceptions, has a limited durability that can only be partially restored using rare repair kits. As such, you will still have to pick your fights and preserve your most powerful weapons for the forced combat encounters, of which the game has quite a few.</p>



<p>Due to the inclusion of a Stamina gauge, Silent Hill f was <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-f-producer-game-is-not-a-soulslike/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">likened to a soulslike game before release</a>, but the first couple of fights against some rather disturbing doll-like enemies with some great animations show how the similarities are limited to the ability to use light and heavy attacks and a rather effective dodge maneuver, which becomes a Stamina-restoring perfect dodge when timed correctly. These simple action combat mechanics are elevated by the inclusion of a Focus mode powered by the Sanity gauge, which allows Hinako to charge a powerful Focus attack that can briefly stun enemies and slow down time when the enemy is about to launch an attack that can be countered with a Heavy Attack.</p>



<p>Though undoubtedly more mechanically rich than your typical survival-horror combat system, Silent Hill's combat is never truly the focus, as all these mechanics are deeply rooted in the resource management principle at the core of a survival horror experience. Stamina, for example, depletes very quickly, and using all of it up will leave Hinako pretty much defenseless for a few seconds, which is a huge problem at hard combat difficult where enemies hit rather hard; similarly, using all Sanity not only disables Focus mode, but may also cause Hinako to receive additional damage when under psychological stress, something that happens quite often during the game. And while her stats and capabilities can be enhanced by finding empty Ema and spending Faith points at shrines and equipping the Omamori accessories for passive skills, there's never a situation where these mechanics make the schoolgirl capable of easily taking on every enemy without suffering any consequence. </p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Silent Hill f combat system is the game's most significant divergence from the rest of the series.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Striking a balance between more involving combat and retaining that sense of fear and helplessness is very difficult to achieve, but I feel developer NeoBards Entertainment managed to do so in the best way possible, even though it is undeniable that the execution is not always perfect, like with the dodge mechanic, which is, maybe, a little too effective for a survival horror game. The other aspect of the combat system, which sparked the most discussion pre-release, is the excessive reliance on hitstop and the supposed lack of enemy reactions to attacks. On the other hand, this is not as problematic as it looks in promotional footage. While it is true that enemies do not react to light attacks, the game provides a lot of options to stagger enemies, like heavy attacks, Focus attacks and counter attacks, the latter possible even without using Focus mode.</p>



<p>With so many options at Hinako's disposal, enemy design had to take this into account, and thankfully, it does so in a consistent way. Although enemy variety isn't big, there are enough enemies to keep things fresh for the duration of the first playthrough, ranging from the aforementioned doll-like enemies to more deformed monsters who all come with a few attack patterns and unique quirks that players need to memorize to take full advantage of the many combat mechanics the game offers. For example, there's a hulking enemy carrying a giant knife in its right arm that blocks any attack coming from Hinako's left, which forces correct positioning together with proper timing of offense and defense. Though few, there are also boss battles built around unique mechanics that are quite effective. As such, enemy design holds up for a single playthrough, which shouldn't be longer than 12 hours for most players. While this definitely is on the short side, the game sports great replayability with a meaningful New Game Plus and multiple endings, so there's still a lot to be discovered, including answers to some questions left unanswered during the first playthrough, after the credits roll for the first time.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Though different, Silent Hill f's combat system works surprisingly well with the rest of the game.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Before its release, Silent Hill f made a few heads turn for possibly being one of the <span>few games powered by Unreal Engine 5 that wouldn't be impacted by some of the engine's&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-f-unreal-engine-5-stuttering-smooth/" target="_blank">known issues</a>, such as visual noise and stuttering</span>. Regarding the first, that is indeed the case. The new entry in the series looks extremely clean, with great texture work that greatly enhances the traditional Japanese rural feel of Ebisugaoka and its surroundings, and the wise usage of volumetrics and Lumen greatly enhances the series' typical haunting atmosphere. Though far from being the best we have seen in the past few years, character models are also detailed and generally well done, and look quite believable thanks to generally solid animation work, especially for some enemies. Audio production also dramatically enhances the experience with great usage of haunting environmental sounds, and some great music pieces, some created by the series's longtime composer, Akira Yamaoka.</p>



<p>Regarding performance, however, on PC, that's not entirely the case, although the situation is far better than in most other UE5 games. The few minutes of loading that happen the first time the game is launched suggest the game has a shader pre-compilation step, which definitely helps, as I haven't experienced shader stuttering in my time with the game outside of a single significant late-game instance which may have been caused by something else. However, traversal stuttering and some microstuttering issues are present, mostly in the main village area. These stuttering issues are not terribly aggravating, but they are easily noticeable, and they do have an impact, minimal as they may be, on an experience meant to be immersive.</p>

			    	</p></div>
</div>
</figure>



<p>Aside from these stuttering issues, which are thankfully limited to a small number of areas, Silent Hill f seems to be optimized well. At 4K resolution with NVIDIA DLSS in Quality mode and the settings above, the game ran at an average of 116 FPS, 59 1% Low on my system (i7-13700F, RTX 4080, 32 GB RAM) in a benchmarking session held in Ebisugaoka at the start of the game, right after the first attack of one of the Fog Monsters, which are, all around, pretty decent results, considering the performance cost Lumen generally has. With the game running as expected on my system, tweaking the settings, especially the lighting setting, the rendering resolution, and the upscaler setting (TSR and FSR are available besides DLSS) should be more than enough for most users with a relatively modern machine to run the game smoothly.</p>



<p>With an engaging story full of haunting, disturbing sequences, a finely tuned balance of everything that makes survival horror great, and combat deeply rooted in resource management, Silent Hill f is a triumphant return for the series after its long hiatus. Its short length and minor PC performance issues may disappoint some, but no fan of the franchise, or the genre, should miss one of the best survival horror releases in years.</p>

			<p>Team Cherry's Hollow Knight: Silksong is a smashing success, as evidenced by the overwhelmingly positive reviews and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-5-million-audience-overlaps-soulslike/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">estimated five million players across all platforms</a>. With that said, there is one thing that the game lacks: multiplayer of any kind.</p>



<p>However, a <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/90?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mod</a> now seeks to rectify that, at least on PC. Created by XvX, it aims to support basic Player versus Player online multiplayer fights. In the embedded video, we can see that it supports up to 30 players, though such a large number of players inevitably makes it very chaotic. The mod actually also enables co-op, but only for a single boss, Fourth Chorus, which has been modified to receive synchronized damage from all the players. Over time, the goal is to provide a full co-op experience as well.</p>

<p>If you're interested in trying this Hollow Knight: Silksong mod (which only works with the Steam version, at least for now), follow the creator's instructions that we have reported below.</p>



<ol>
<li><em>Unzip to the root directory (don't just dump the folder in with it).</em></li>



<li><em>Once all players have into the main interface, the host clicks "Create Room(创建房间)" and then "Invite Players(邀请玩家)"</em></li>



<li><em>After everyone agrees to the game invitation, enter the game.</em></li>



<li><em>This only works with the official Steam version. </em></li>



<li><em>The PvP configuration file is located in: Hollow Knight Silksong\BepInEx\config\com.XvX.cfg</em></li>
</ol>



<p><em>Version 0.7.1 Warning: This version is of uncertain stability and is for testing purposes only.<br>In order to synchronize Fourth Chorus with this version, all players' save files must not have defeated Fourth Chorus. Everyone except the host must activate the boss first, then the host can activate it. The host's death will cause the boss to become uncontrollable. It is recommended that the host install a cheat. After others have revived, please do not return to the boss scene, as this may cause problems.</em></p>



<p>This is but one of several PC mods created for Hollow Knight: Silksong in the few weeks since its debut. There's the <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-breaks-players-peak-gets-luma-hdr-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Luma HDR mod</a>, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-relaxed-mode-improvements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Relaxed Mode mod</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-mods-enjoyable-challenge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">others</a> that introduce various quality of life tweaks.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/silent-hill-f-has-two-killer-ingredients-mystery-and-rage.1304052/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Even suffused in otherworldly fog, <em>Silent Hill F</em>’s picturesque period setting gleams with authenticity. Traditional hardwood buildings line narrow alleyways, while babbling brooks and small footpaths crisscross soaking paddy fields. The ephemera of 1960s everyday life is everywhere: glossy magazines, vintage toasters, exquisite flower arrangements. Yet beyond this moody sense of place, the details that feel most authentic in <em>Silent Hill F</em> are of a kind that video games rarely excel at. It’s the anxiety on the faces of its teen characters as they trade barbed taunts, the outpourings of emotion scribbled onto notes passed around at school.</p><p>We see this finely drawn, and frequently painful, world through the eyes of high school student Hinako Shimizu. She is a “tough girl,” according to her friends. Quickly enough, the series’ iconic mist descends and Hinako is forced to make use of her athletic streak, vaulting over obstacles to flee the malignant haze. She picks up pipes and bludgeons skittering, long-legged monsters; she finds arcane keys to unlock ominously decorated doors. We are yet again exploring a town twisted into grotesquely personal shapes by the intense emotions of our protagonist. The classic ingredients of <em>Silent Hill</em> return, yet there is newfound freshness and vitality here.</p><p>Partly, this is down to ravishing visuals: verging on photorealism yet painterly in their eerie prettiness. Light diffuses naturally down every cold and brooding street, bouncing off Hinako’s prim-and-proper bob and buttoned-up uniform. A carpet of red spider lilies frequently unfurls across the fictional mountain village of Ebisugaoka, transforming the setting into a kind of eco-horror hallucination. In an otherwise artfully desaturated palette, the plants are a vivid, violent interruption.</p><p>Moreover, <em>Silent Hill F</em> feels revitalized thanks to a story penned by renowned Japanese manga author Ryukishi07. Hinako is at a pivotal moment in her life, still at school yet on the cusp of an arranged marriage by her abusive, alcoholic father. She is tormented by social anxieties: the gossiping of friends and absence of her older sister. This plot is revealed patiently through cutscenes and scattered letters. It’s typical video game storytelling, but <em>Silent Hill F</em> offers a beguiling marriage of game space and narrative. The town of Ebisugaoka opens up alongside the mysteries; the streets seem to double back on themselves like this tricksy story.</p><p>You discover further tantalizing tidbits: details about arsenic pollution, toxic gas leaks, and the building of a massive dam. Are these central to the monstrous manifestations Hinako must endure or merely red herrings? I’m still not sure, even having rolled credits around hour 10.</p><p>Think of <em>Silent Hill F</em> as survival horror meets <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/apr/27/honkaku-a-century-of-the-japanese-whodunnits-keeping-readers-guessing">the honkaku mystery fiction of Japan</a>, one whose story continues to be illuminated with each subsequent playthrough (all told through five possible endings). While wandering through creepy woods during my first session, I came across a giant, sacred tree. But I couldn’t interact with it. The tree remained an enigma until I started the game anew, quickly discovering a new puzzle which seemed to center it. More details and cutscenes arrive in subsequent playthroughs (and there is even a feature that distinguishes new cutscenes from old so you can hit the skip button).</p><p>The depth and nuance of the mystery is striking, but so is the lack of genuine scares. <em>Silent Hill F</em> is sinister, tense, melancholic, and, in a handful of scenes, wince-inducingly nasty. But scary? Not very. There’s nothing here that matches the terrifying abyssal descent into the bedrock below town in <em>Silent Hill 2</em>, <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=Z-jvrvNZ2mI&amp;feature=youtu.be"><em>that</em> staircase</a> that seemed to tunnel directly into James’ troubled subconscious. The closest <em>Silent Hill F</em> comes is Hinako’s family home. Doors and rooms multiply; corridors lengthen. The space — endlessly repeating until you complete all its puzzles — bristles with nightmarish logic.</p><p>The lack of frights stems mostly from a tilt toward action. Hinako lands critical hits, executes slo-mo dodges, and even wields a pole weapon with a curved blade called a naginata. She is no action hero at first, straining to lift weapons and sometimes flailing at thin air. But the teenager is committed. “Do not get in my way,” she says at one point, growing ever more assertive.</p><p>During bouts, Hinako consumes whatever remedies she can lay her hands on — kudzu tea, red pills, chocolate — and at shrines, which double as save spots, she can make sacrifices to the gods, thus upgrading her health, stamina, and even sanity. This journey, then, is a test of faith for the youngster who has one foot in tradition and another in modernity (a point reflected in the terrific score, which blends traditional Japanese folk music with ’60s psychedelia).</p><p>“The road twists and turns,” says Hinako in a moment of quiet reflection toward the end of the game. “It’s like I’m walking through my head.” The line is a clunky outlier in a script that typically has the smarts not to spell out its Freudian subtext. Still, the remark begs a question: what lurks in the darkest, most private recesses of Hinako’s mind? Through expressive level design, a deftly told story, and thrashing combat, we find a young woman locked into battle with societal expectations.</p><p><em>Silent Hill F</em> beautifully communicates her emotional arc, from vying desperately for survival to unleashing violent fury. Hinako doesn’t so much blossom as erupt. She becomes a mighty force of nature in her own right.</p><p><sub>Silent Hill F <em>launches on September 25th on the PS5, Xbox, and PC.</em></sub></p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/782012/silent-hill-f-review-ps5-xbox-steam#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6NTQzMA=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Lewis Gordon</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/782012/silent-hill-f-review-ps5-xbox-steam]]></content:encoded>

              <p>Immersing yourself in <i>Silent Hill f</i> is like drinking a powerfully fragrant tea steeped in bloody metaphor and symbolism. The first new, full <i>Silent Hill</i> game in 13 years, <i>f</i> wields a powerful, standalone narrative about the expectations of gender-based roles, the challenge of maintaining relationships in the presence of such roles, and the foggy nature of transitioning from teenage life into adulthood.</p> <p>The game satisfyingly eschews surface-level storytelling through its various twists and turns. As if retreating into its own mysterious fog, <i>f</i> isn’t easy to fully understand at first. Various plot threads and themes intersect and overlap in a dreamlike fashion. By the game’s ending (of which there are multiple), I had so many questions that weren’t answered–in a <i>good </i>way. I walked away unsure of what I had experienced, where the metaphors began and ended, and just what exactly happened in this sleepy mountainside village. <i>Silent Hill f</i> is a gorgeous and exquisite work of psychological horror that had me desperate to relive its narrative again after the credits rolled. And I don’t think I’ll stop until I squeeze every drop out of this game.</p> <p>In its moment-to-moment gameplay, <i>Silent Hill f</i> challenges you to fight or evade various horrifying monsters, solve cryptic puzzles, and attempt to piece together a complicated, bi-directional narrative of resistance and submission, both against supernatural horrors and the pressures society places on people, particularly women. <i>Silent Hill f</i> takes a few big risks in its relocation of the series to a new setting and in its slightly more action-focused combat, but these elements all pay off and earn their stay. Its story, though ripe for pitfalls in how it depicts violence and subjugation of women, manages to deliver a shellshock of a horror experience with a rich atmosphere and unsettling tale that entertains on its own terms, and terrifies with depictions of violence and repression that are all too resonant with our experiences of the real world.</p>

 <p>Developed by a studio new to the series and following the <a href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-2-remake-bloober-review-ps5-pc-horror-2024-1851665482">successful remake of <i>Silent Hill 2</i></a>, <i>f</i> sees <i>Silent Hill</i> pack its bags and take us on a trip to a fictional rural mountainside village in Japan called Ebisugaoka. Set in the 1960s, the game’s narrative centers the experience of living as a woman in a society that values us only for our potential to be married.</p>

 <p><i>Silent Hill f</i> casts you in the role of teenager Hinako Shimizu as she navigates an unfolding and perplexing set of ghastly horrors. Somewhat of a tomboy, Hinako is at odds with what the rigid expectations her society, and family, place on her as someone assigned female at birth. Early on, we learn that Hinako’s sister has left home after being married off, and that her alcoholic, abusive, and financially reckless father has similar wishes for her.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000627507" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000627507"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000627507">© Screenshot: NeoBards Entertainment / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>After a bitter argument with her parents, she leaves home to find her village slowly being overtaken by a thick fog; strange floral and fleshy overgrowths; contorted, animated mannequins wielding massive kitchen knives; and all sorts of other unspeakable horrors.</p>

 <p>Hinako quickly realizes that the only solution is to escape the town she once called home, now transformed into a hellscape. Puzzles and hostile creatures stand in her way as she travels through foggy streets and alleyways, abandoned buildings, and a nightmare-esque realm known as the Dark Shrine.</p>

 <p>The monsters stalking the oppressive alleyways of Ebisugaoka and the mire of the Dark Shrine aren’t the only things keeping Hinako company. She’s joined by three friends: two other teenage girls named Sakuko and Rinko, and a boy named Shu. Together, the four of them must survive an indescribable nightmare as they search for a way out of the altered town. Hinako also comes to meet another individual who promises to help her, a mysterious and charming gentleman referred to in writing as simply Fox Mask.</p> <p><i>f</i>’s narrative ups and downs can inspire a bloodlust in you that makes Hinako’s&nbsp; maneuverability and lethality–which far exceed those of her generally clunky predecessor protagonists–all the more rewarding. A sometimes-frustrating weapon degradation system keeps the survival part of the horror grounded, but in moments when the story filled me with an emotional urgency, I was excited to be a more nimble and deadly fighter.</p> <h2>A steel pipe and the audacity to persist</h2> <p>In combat, Hinako is on her own when it comes to dealing with the menacing creatures of the fog. Far more mobile than protagonists in survival horror games usually are, I worried that Hinako’s dexterity might dilute the shambling dread often associated with the genre, but <i>f</i> earns its right to a more action-focused combat system.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000627508" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000627508"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000627508">© © Screenshot: NeoBards Entertainment / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>It’s not that Hinako feels like an elite soldier or something; the camera controls, quick dodge move, and stamina meter make her feel locked in to her survival, but the combat retains a sense of vulnerability essential for communicating terror and dread. <i>f</i>’s combat can be rather fluid and snappy when it wants to be. As in modern soulslikes, you can target a single enemy at a time which keeps the combat focused and intense. Hinako’s generous and speedy dodge costs her stamina, as do her light and heavy attacks.</p> <p>Still, weapon scarcity and degradation make any scuffle with the game’s various monsters risky. Not every fight with a random wandering monster is worth having, but during scripted battles or when it makes sense to dispose of a creature, you’ll have to do so while managing your stamina meter as you sprint, dodge, and attack. Dodge at the right time when an enemy strikes and you’ll refill your stamina to resume your assault or expedite your retreat.</p>

 <p>Hinako also has a meter for her “Sanity,” which allows her to use special “Focus” moves such as a counterattack and a charged-up version of her light melee strike. As you progress, you’ll be able to increase your health, stamina, and sanity meters by offering various objects at shrines which double as save points. You can also augment Hinako’s abilities with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omamori">omamori</a> found in the environment or drawn from a shrine; these benefits include boons like increased max health, recovering health when defeating an enemy, a quicker charge of Hinako’s attacks, and more. These gentle augmentations of Hinako’s abilities offer a welcome micro level of adjustment over the difficulty that I’m sure I’ll lean into more in my Hard mode run.</p> <p>You can consume various items to replenish your meters, though while it worked fine when playing with mouse and keyboard, I found that even after 20 hours, item management while using a controller felt cumbersome.</p> <p>Aside from some creatures that waited around corners to jump me, I would typically hear monsters before I saw them, their presence usually revealed by the sounds of painful moans, clanking footsteps, or the gentle and satisfying static that plays when you’re in the proximity of an enemy. The audio cues reminded me to check my health level and weapon condition, all while observing a few exit strategies if I suddenly found myself in over my head. In each scuffle, aside from the scripted scenarios that have you fighting bosses or enemies you have to defeat before you can proceed, combat remained as intense and methodical as I like it in a survival horror game.</p> <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>"The f is for fun!

Aside from your three meters, you won’t need to worry about Hinako’s stats or fuss too much over which weapons you’re carrying. And unlike more action-focused games, your central task isn’t to defeat enemies, it’s to <i>survive </i>them. That sometimes means killing them, but it’s not wise to spend all your time and resources on every monster in your path. In fact, you’ll quickly find yourself screwed if you take that approach.</p>

 <p>Dealing with enemies is still a challenge despite how quick Hinako can be, and weapon degradation was an early sore spot for me. Fragile weapons combine well with the sense of dread the game’s aesthetic conjures and nicely limits your capabilities within the otherwise rather smooth combat system. This grounds the game, though some later sections let you cut loose on monsters in a satisfying, vengeful way. The game offers two kinds of difficulty at first, “Story” and “Hard,” and you can set the combat difficulty and puzzle difficulty independent of each other. On my first run, I played “Story” for combat and “Hard” for puzzles.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000627509" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000627509"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000627509">© Screenshot: NeoBards Entertainment / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>This choice let me be pretty sloppy in combat and still only die a handful of times. My second run, on Hard mode, has proven a tougher challenge, though it rarely feels unfair (my Hard mode run is a little bit easier given that I’m taking advantage of the stat carryover from New Game Plus). That said, I can already anticipate some late-game segments might border on frustration. We’ll see how that goes for me.</p> <p>At first, I found the unexpectedly speedy combat to be a little discordant with the premise of being a teenage girl taking on vicious, otherworldly monsters, often with little more than a steel pipe. The beautifully dark and lush atmosphere of the game filled me with the dread I desire from this genre, but once combat started, I found myself feeling almost a bit too superhuman in how deftly I could dodge out of the way of a bloody knife.</p> <p>As Hinako’s story and struggle progressed, however, I found <i>f</i>’s combat system to mesh well with her emotional state. Hinako makes it clear early on that she won’t go down without a fight, and a childhood spent mostly playing rough with boys along with her experience in track and field show she’s not afraid of a scuffle or two. The combat also, at times, gave me a sense of power over some monsters in a way that satisfyingly intersects with the game’s themes. I was skeptical of its approach to combat in those early skirmishes, but <i>f</i> earns its speedier battles with satisfying emotional arcs.</p>

 <p>Fighting off bloody bastards isn’t the only challenge ahead of you in Ebisugaoka either. True to its form as a <i>Silent Hill</i> game, <i>f</i> features an assortment of puzzles you’ll have to solve, each one a treat containing some wonderful 3D models and mental challenges that aren’t easy to brute force your way through. You’ll collect clues in your journal which aren’t always the most obvious, and many of these puzzles stumped me at first. In two cases, I was forced to get help from people to figure them out, but this was mostly out of a need to finish the game in a timely fashion.</p> <p>While I often love survival horror games for the unique intersection of terror and challenge they provide, I typically find the struggle of survival only as interesting as the environment they’re set in and the story they weave. And in this regard, <i>Silent Hill f</i> does not disappoint.</p>

 <h2>A dark narrative to commit yourself to</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000627511" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000627511"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000627511">© Screenshot: NeoBards Entertainment / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>To be honest, the less I say about the particulars of <i>Silent Hill</i> <i>f</i>’s narrative, the better. You can only experience this game the first time through once, and as soon as you do, everything you just experienced gets reframed, and not in a concrete, easily digestible way. <i>f </i>resisted my attempts to understand it, left me with horrific depictions of violence strung up on narrative threads that involve real-world, relatable struggles of being a woman in society, what the value that society ascribes to her even means, the impact of cultural traditions, and a fear of the unknown. Throughout the game, mythology creeps into reality to make you doubt your own reasoning mind. This is all set to a captivatingly dark yet beautiful soundtrack from series composer Akira Yamaoka.</p> <p>And while the game features difficult and lasting depictions of violence and suffering, <i>Silent Hill f</i> never feels like torture porn. Its gore never feels frivolous. That it manages to pull this off in a game focused on the violence imposed on women in a conservative society is a testament to the quality of writing on display here. <i>Silent Hill f</i> delivers gut-wrenching metaphors and symbols of resistance and submission that terrify and excite all at once.</p>

 <p>I felt this acutely during the game’s Dark Shrine segments. The realm’s imposing and ominous fox statues and masks inspire an alluring sense of empowerment and protection, but they also felt like a clear warning that I was seconds away from being snatched up in their jaws. The same is true of Fox Mask, who appears early on as a heroic figure, but soon seems to have an agenda of his own that may not have Hinako’s best interests in mind. His piercing, glowing eyes and soft-spoken voice had me hypnotized as much as they did Hinako. As she followed him into the depths of the unknown, so too did I.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000627512" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000627512"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000627512">© Screenshot: NeoBards Entertainment / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><i>f</i>’s narrative remains satisfyingly hard to predict throughout the whole ride. As soon as I thought I had a sense of what was going on, the story would resist falling into the predictable plot patterns I’d begun to anticipate. Even the premise of rebelling against the gendered expectations of womanhood is handled in a far more complex way than you might expect. It’s not just a story of Hinako giving the proverbial middle finger to what society asks of her. Though she is rebelling and is conscious of how her gender renders her a second-class citizen, themes of commitment, of holding onto who you are as you form bonds with other people, and just what it means to sustain any kind of relationship in the face of struggle swirl around in the fog in ways that I often found deeply relatable.</p> <p>One scene in particular involving a bloody reconfiguration of a character’s body parts struck me so squarely in its depiction of commitment and physical trauma that it’s become a new metaphor for how I view a particular chapter of my own life. Though it depicts people of a different culture and time, there’s a universally human story at the core of <i>f</i>.</p> <p>Even when <i>f</i> hits its narrative climax, when I thought I understood as much as I possibly could from a single playthrough, the ending that I ended up triggering based on what seemed a normal, non-consequential decision early on revealed one of the most unexpected twists I’ve encountered in recent memory. And still, true to the lush depths of obfuscating fog <i>Silent Hill</i> is known for, I barely understand what happened. But I couldn’t look at the story the same way twice after experiencing it. My own innocence was robbed.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000627513" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000627513"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000627513">© Screenshot: NeoBards Entertainment / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>In addition to what’s revealed through your interactions and encounters with other characters and your journey through Ebisugaoka, a considerable amount of worldbuilding is also found in collectible notes scattered throughout the game’s world and in other bits of environmental storytelling. No meaningful playthrough of <i>Silent Hill f</i> will be complete without collecting and reading as many of them as possible–and New Game Plus will offer you new surprises here, too. These notes are all concise, written well enough, and don’t feel overbearing. They’re well worth pausing the action for.</p> <p>These documents include women’s etiquette magazines, beer ads that promise a certain status of masculinity to those who consume it, and meditations on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitsune_no_yomeiri">kitsune no yomeiri</a> and other elements of Japanese culture and folklore, as well as fictional accounts of the history of the game’s setting. It all strings together a dark, kaleidoscopic narrative web that stirs intrigue and sparks the imagination. That it’s set in the 1960s also positions the characters and the town itself&nbsp; between a rural, agrarian environment with conservative cultural values and affectations, and an encroaching layer of modernization through expanding industrial development and scientific medicine. <i>Silent Hill f</i> is never about any one of these things individually, but its various narrative layers let you drift among them as you would a sequence of thematically similar dreams.</p> <p><i>Silent Hill f</i> is ambitious in its desires. It asks for permission to deviate from the series’ traditional setting while offering up quicker, more action-focused combat. It leaves behind its titular setting in favor of a new horizon. It succeeds on all these fronts as a spin-off that explores <i>Silent Hill</i>’s classic gloom and internal psychological struggle, toying with themes of friendship, gendered expectations, commitment, and individual worth like a cat, or a fox, playing with its prey. It is a horrorscape I was terrified of and yet unable to look away from, one that’s resonated with me long after the credits rolled, and that quickly pulled me back in for another trip down the miserable foggy alleyways of this strange mountainside village.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>A demo of <em>Itachi: Haunted Abodes – Wandering Through 2000s Tokyo Culture</em> will be playable at the room6 booth at Tokyo Game Show 2025, which will run from September 25 to 28 at Makuhari Messe in Chiba, Japan. Stickers will also be distributed to those who add the game to their wishlist.</p><div><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><em>Itachi: Hunted Abodes</em> is a paranormal suspense adventure that has you wandering through 2000s Tokyo’s subculture scenes!</p><p><strong>A Paranormal Subculture Story Starting with a Stigmatized Property</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Welcome to early 2000s Tokyo.</p><p>Meet Itachi, a college student without a place to stay. He finds a part-time job that provides him a house… specifically, a stigmatized property. That is, a house with a dark past.</p><p>No experience is needed, all expenses are paid for, and all that’s required of him is to live in the house, normally, for a week. And he gets paid quite well for it, too.</p><p>The only slightly annoying thing is that he has to live with Tanuki, an employee from the real estate company giving him this job.</p><p>Well, there’s one more “slightly annoying” thing. What he doesn’t know is that he was actually hired to be a lure for “Landgods,” a type of spectre haunting the houses of those who died away from their hometown.</p><p>The idea is to drive these Landgods away so that the house can be sold safely… regardless of what happens to Itachi in the process.</p><p>Join “weasel” Itachi and “raccoon dog” Tanuki in this adventure through Tokyo’s subculture scenes.</p><p>Your own job? Finding clues on the previous tenant’s untimely death.</p><p><strong>Two Opposite Perspectives</strong></p><p>During the investigation parts, you’ll be able to switch between Itachi’s and Tanuki’s points of view. Itachi is just a normal human being who can’t even see the Landgods, but he’s great at talking to people. Band followers, girls in maid costumes—he could make anyone spill the beans.</p><p>Tanuki’s not so good with people, but he can see the Landgods. He can stop their attacks to collect information directly from them.</p><p>Only by combining these two opposite perspectives will you be able to see the whole truth.</p><p>Itachi’s job is to live in that creepy apartment, but he won’t be spending the whole day there. Go on a trip through Tokyo, looking for hints in the most disparate subculture scenes.</p><p>Live music clubs with visual-kei bands? Check.</p><p>Maid cafés where everything is cutesy to a fault? Check.</p><p>Harajuku and its frilly, over-the-top fashion? Check.</p><p>Go back in history, explore these unique 2000s scenes, and you might find the dark secrets you’re looking for.</p><p><strong>Send Those Monsters Back to Their Land</strong></p><p>Once you have enough information, Tanuki can start a ritual to exorcise the Landgods back to where they came from.</p><p>You’ll need to show them that you know who they are: their name, their place of origin, and the cause of death of the person they followed to this house.</p><p>Use all the information you have to complete the ritual, but be careful… If you make too many mistakes, Itachi is the one who’ll pay for it.</p><p><strong>The Abodes You’ll Visit</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Sudden Bassist Death Syndrome</strong> – What do the visual-kei groupies know?</li><li><strong>A Maid Made to Die</strong> – Not all of this maid’s secrets were so cute.</li><li><strong>Workaholics Anonymous</strong> – Why work when you can play dress up in Harajuku?</li><li><strong>Baggage From Home</strong> – Uncover an old grudge with the goths’ help.</li></ul></div><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/paranormal-suspense-adventure-game-itachi-haunted-abodes-wandering-through-2000s-tokyo-culture-announced-for-pc]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-wants-you-to-ditch-your-old-laptop-and-upgrade-to-the-new-macbook-air-at-a-record-low-2000627500</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-wants-you-to-ditch-your-old-laptop-and-upgrade-to-the-new-macbook-air-at-a-record-low.1303956/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple’s latest MacBook Air (launched in March) has been among the company’s most popular laptops for some time now, but price has usually been the stumbling block. On Apple’s website, this MacBook Air with the M4 chip in its base configuration (16GB of RAM and 256GB SSD storage) starts at $999.</p>
<p>But today, Amazon has <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3761/">knocked everyone back by lowering the very same model to an all-time low price of $799</a>. It includes the same warranty, the same box-fresh product and even more convenient delivery and return arrangements.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3761/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Lightest MacBook Just Got Serious Power</h2>
<p>The new M4 chip is at the heart of it and brings faster performance across the board. For everyday use, it makes juggling multiple apps smoother and faster. But it also goes into denser ground like photo and video editing or even graphics-intensive games. On top of that, Apple’s new Intelligence features which rely on the M4 to make writing assistance, automating operations and privacy-first AI capabilities possible.</p>



<p>While the performance boost is significant, design is still focused on portability: Winging in at over 2.7 pounds and under half an inch thick, this MacBook Air is meant to slide into a bag and almost disappear until you need it. Battery life is another bonus with up to 18 hours on one charge. That means you really can make it through a whole workday without having to plug in. It still has the same MagSafe charging port that’s so fashionable again, plus two Thunderbolt 4 ports, a headphone jack, Wi-Fi 6E, and Bluetooth 5.3 support. For extreme users, you can even connect up to two external monitors.</p>
<p>The screen is also somewhere where the Air does better than you might guess at this price: The 13.6-inch Liquid Retina screen displays a billion colors and has amazing brightness and contrast. Text is razor-sharp for everyday use like reading and writing. But when streaming TV shows or looking at photos, the color accuracy is actually superb.</p>
<p>Apple has also put major work into the camera and audio system, changes that are more vital than ever with so much of life happening on video calls. The 12MP camera with Center Stage keeps you centered and properly focused and the three-microphone array ensures voices sound loud and clear. Four built-in speakers handle audio with support for Spatial Audio, and thus music or conference calls can sound surprisingly immersive.</p>
<p>What should seal the deal for many is the value angle. At $999, the MacBook Air M4 is already positioned as Apple’s most balanced machine between performance and portability. But at $799 on Amazon, you’re essentially getting premium performance, build quality, and the ecosystem advantages of macOS at a price that undercuts many Windows ultrabooks with weaker specs. Throw in Amazon’s delivery speed and return policy, and it’s difficult to argue full price up front from Apple’s website at this point.</p>
<p>The MacBook Air has long had the reputation of being the Mac for everyday use. With the M4 chip now inside and a historic price cut dropping it under $800, the 2025 MacBook Air feels like a golden moment for upgrading.</p>

              <p>One of Apple’s most practical products is not a MacBook or an iPhone. It’s something much smaller that addresses a headache just about everyone experiences: losing things. Apple’s AirTag has become an international best-seller because it makes keeping track of your things so easy, whether that’s your keys, your suitcases while traveling or even your kid’s backpack at school.</p>
<p>Right now, Amazon has an all-time-low deal with a <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4215/">single AirTag dropping to just $21 (down from $29)</a> and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/">the 4-pack decreasing to $74 (normally $99)</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4215/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See Single AirTag at Amazon</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See 4-pack AirTags at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>AirTags Are the Everyday Fix You Didn’t Know You Needed</h2>
<p>If you have ever spent mornings searching for your keys or nervously hoped your suitcase made it onto the right plane, AirTags can make your life a lot easier. The technology that goes into them is really cool for devices so tiny. <strong>All AirTags use Apple’s Find My network which taps into hundreds of millions of iPhones, iPads, and Macs around the globe</strong>. You’re not just using your phone by itself to locate your item, then – there’s an entire crowd-sourced network trying to help you locate it. And in everyday use, it functions with incredible accuracy.</p>



<p>It doesn’t get much simpler to set one up. Place the AirTag alongside your iPhone or iPad, tap once as prompted, and it’s set. Then you can attach it to whatever you need to track. Most begin with wallets, keys or bags, but you’ll find many creative uses. Parents have been known to attach one to a child’s school bag, travelers place one in checked luggage and some even attach them to expensive gear or bikes for extra security. Because the AirTag itself is just over an inch in diameter and weighs only 0.39 ounces, it never feels obtrusive or out of place.</p>
<p>An individual AirTag uses a standard CR2032 coin battery that will survive for about a year before you’ll want to replace it. That means you won’t need to stress about charging it constantly unlike so many other intelligent gadgets. The AirTag also has an IP67 water and dust resistance rating so it will be okay if it’s caught in the rain or dropped in a puddle. For iPhone 11 and later users, Precision Finding uses ultra-wideband technology to give you on-screen arrows and even haptic feedback to guide you to your lost item, which offers you the exact direction and distance to it.</p>
<p>Amazon’s discount makes them even more appealing. One AirTag available for $21 lets you get your foot in the door for not a lot. But the best deal is the 4-pack for $74, which comes out to just over $18 per tag. Considering how many items in your life that could use a bit of an extra safety net, more than one is easily worth it.</p>

            <p>Konami wants your opinion on which Metal Gear game you think should get the remake treatment next.</p>
<p>In a new survey entitled "Metal Gear – Production Hotline at TGS2025 Post-viewing survey", the publisher asked a number of questions about how it communicates with fans, but most interestingly, it also polls players for information about which Metal Gear titles they'd like to see "remade".</p>

<p>The options provided on the survey included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Metal Gear</li>
<li>Metal Gear 2 Solid Snake</li>
<li>Metal Gear Solid</li>
<li>Metal Gear Solid 2 Sons of Liberty</li>
<li>Metal Gear Solid 4 Guns of the Patriot</li>
<li>Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker</li>
<li>Metal Gear Solid 5: Ground Zeroes</li>
<li>Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain</li>
</ul>
<p>There was also a text box inviting "other" suggestions, too, so if you've a burning desire to see <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-survive">Metal Gear Survive</a> remade, you'll have to pop it in there (thanks, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/konami-asked-fans-which-metal-gear-remade/">InsiderGaming</a>).</p>
<p>Expect more at the next Metal Gear Production Hotline livestream, scheduled for 25th September (which just so happens to be the launch date of the next instalment of Konami's other big franchise, Silent Hill).</p> <div>
