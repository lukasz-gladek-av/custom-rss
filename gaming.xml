<p>SEGA’s trademarks for “Ecco the Dolphin” and “Ecco” went public today, and players believe this could be the surprise game at the upcoming Xbox Developer Direct.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted on r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1i0onuf/sega_has_filled_a_new_trademark_for_ecco_the/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamingLeaksAndRumours</a>, a post on X by <a href="https://x.com/gematsu/status/1878873951344185652" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gematsu</a> revealed that on December 27, 2024, SEGA filed trademarks for “Ecco the Dolphin” and “Ecco” in Japan, and this information was made public today. Players believe that this could be the secret game at Xbox Developer Direct as it matches the description of being an iconic Japanese IP with a lot of history.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A few days ago, Xbox <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-developer-direct-announced-for-january-23/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that a Developer Direct is scheduled for January 23, 2025, during which they will reveal more details about South of Midnight, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, DOOM: The Dark Ages, and a secret game. Right after the announcement, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-to-get-a-new-game-from-legendary-japanese-franchise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a> claimed that the secret title would be “a new entry in a legendary Japanese IP which has decades of history. ” Players speculate that this IP is none other than Ecco the Dolphin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ecco the Dolphin is a video game series created by Ed Annunziata for the Sega Genesis console. In this game, you play the role of a bottlenose dolphin called Ecco, who is searching the vast ocean for his missing pod. The series received several instalments until 2000, including Ecco: The Tides of Time, Ecco Jr., and more. However, the franchise has been dormant since then.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’ll be interesting to see if SEGA’s new trademark is indeed Xbox’s secret title. However, we will have to wait for an official announcement to know for sure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, a recent report stated that Sega could be working <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sega-subscription-service-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on a new game subscription service</a>. Also, two Xbox exclusives <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/at-least-two-xbox-exclusives-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">might be coming to Nintendo Switch 2</a>. What are your thoughts on SEGA’s new trademark? Is it Xbox’s secret title?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments below or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>Here are the nominees for TechRaptor's 2024 Best Soundtrack Award for outstanding overall score.</p>

<hr><h2>Third Place -&nbsp;Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</h2>



<p>Developer: MachineGames | Release Date: December 9th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Andrew Stretch</p>

<p>There's something so magical about a John Williams score. His style is what made things like the <em>Indiana Jones</em> and<em> Star Wars</em> theme so memorable to this day. I was so excited to hear that theme when loading up <em>Indiana Jones</em>, but what was even more impressive was the way composer Gordy Haab was able to capture that epicness throughout the whole score.</p>

<p>It wasn't just the loud moments, filled with the sounds of horns and strings as Indy ran from traps or fought Nazis, but also the soft chimes of solving a puzzle. The music constantly enhanced the experience while keeping the player grounded in the world as Indiana Jones.</p>

<h2>Second Place - Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</h2>



<p>Developer: Square Enix | Release Date: February 29th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Austin Suther</p>

<p>Within the past few years I started a collection of some of my favorite video game soundtracks. After playing<em> Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>, I knew what my next addition to the collection would be. With dozens upon dozens of tracks, there’s a unique song to accompany almost every occasion in <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>.</p>

<p>The expansive overworld has its own themes outside of combat, and once you initiate combat, a more “amped up” version of that song plays. Mini-games have their own music, characters have their own themes too, and so much more. Quantity does not always equal quality, but in <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>’s case, every song is a banger.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Winner - Metaphor: ReFantazio</h2>



<p>Developer: Atlus | Release Date: October 11th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Robert Scarpinito</p>

<p>As expected with veteran composer Shoji Meguro, the music in <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> works overtime to claim your attention. The biggest, and most notable, earworm is of course <em>Warriors in Valour</em>, the main battle theme.</p>

<p>Because of the game's structure, you're less likely to get fatigued over it because battles won't happen as often, thanks to the overworld mechanics. But when they do happen? You've got the most energetic monk in your corner, chanting for your victory.</p>

<p>You've surely noticed it if you played the game—it's a triumphant mood shift from a decent battle theme to a rousing cheer toward triumph. To call it "epic" doesn't begin to describe how it gets the blood pumping.</p>

<p>Another song worth shouting out is the final boss theme. Without spoiling anything of course, it masterfully blends themes that you've heard throughout the the long, 80+ hour journey. While taking down the final boss, the music reflects back on every step you've taken to get to there.</p>

<p>When the music tells its own story on top of the main narrative, it absolutely earns your attention--and our praise.</p>
</div><div><p><span><div>
       
    <p>There's no I in TEAM!! We're all on the case, and this is how you know it :)</p>

            <p>Ah <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/starfield">Starfield</a>, the game that left the collective consciousness long ago. In her <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/starfield-review">review</a>, Alice Bee (RPS in peace) said that it was such a large thing it ultimately felt "small, cold and unlived in". I remember thinking the same. Would I have thought differently if it had copious amounts of gore? No. But would I have had a better time? Probably yes. Well, a former senior artist at Bethesda has revealed in an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebSmOGZnmeM">Kiwi Talkz podcast</a> (cheers <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/starfield-was-originally-going-to-be-much-gorier-former-bethesda-artist-reveals/">VGC</a> for the spot) that they'd originally planned for it to have decapitations but decided against them in the end.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Dennis Mejillones, who worked at Bethesda for almost 12 years - was asked why Starfield didn't end up as bloodthirsty as other games in the back catalogue, like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a>. He explained that it had more to do with technical limitations than anything else, specifically "implications with the different suits" and how certain helmets might react to being cut and having the "meat caps for the bottom where the flesh is".</p>
<p>Eventually, Mejillones says, the systems "turned into a big rat's nest of all these things you had to account for". The game's character creator also "evolved quite a bit" during development, which played a big part in the difficulties.</p>

 </a>

<p>Mejillones goes on to contrast Starfield's style with that of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout">Fallout</a>, with Fallout full of "tongue-in-cheek humour" like the Bloody Mess perk where folks just "blow up into goo". Starfield "was meant to be more lowkey and realistic", he said.</p><p>"We were inspired a lot by things like The Expanse and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-trek">Star Trek</a>, stuff like that, so I think it just didn’t fit thematically," Mejillones explained. "And on top of that you have the technical overhead cost to get it to work, so we were kind of like ‘it’s probably better not to include it in this game’."</p>
<p>Deep down I know that a gorier Starfield wouldn't have made up for the game being a drag, but man, it would've been a little less of a drag if I could've rended some space lad's head from his shoulders with a space shovel or something. At least the streaks of red would've added a splash of colour to the grey.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Marvel Rivals players are using Invisible Woman to spot bots in their matches.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/marvel-rivals-players-using-invisible-woman-confuse-bots/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGamer</a>, RivalsAssembled (via barky1616) recently shared an interesting video on <a href="https://x.com/RivalsAssembled/status/1878843645740380395" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> of a player uniquely using Susan Storm’s abilities. As the Invisible Woman, one of her abilities allows the character to turn invisible. Marvel Rivals players are using this ability to confuse the bots and bring them to a standstill.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the video, this Marvel Rivals player uses Invisible Woman’s ability to prop themselves near a staircase, which confuses the bots. The bots are programmed to follow a set trajectory to reach the location, and Invisible Woman’s ability acts like an invisible barrier in their way. A typical player could tell that there’s something off, but as they are bots, they do nothing but stand still until Susan’s ability wears off.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The opponent team consisted of the Hulk, Adam Warlock, Iron Man, Winter Soldier, Peni Parker, and Mantis. Four of the six came to a standstill when Invisible Woman blocked them. Peni Parker and Iron Man were the only heroes who progressed. Once the ability wore off, all four characters started attacking Invisible Woman.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s not new to fill lobbies with bots to shorten the wait times for quick matches, and it seems Marvel Rivals has been implementing them, too. However, if players are able to block their paths completely, it won’t take long for them to obliterate these lobbies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-heroes-professor-x/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">5 more heroes, including Professor X</a>, are reportedly coming to Marvel Rivals. Also, the game just hit <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-new-peak-player-count-steam-charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new peak player count</a> and has topped the Steam charts.

            <p>In an alternate timeline, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a> could have been a much gorier game than the one we actually got.</p>
<p>According to former Bethesda character artist Dennis Mejillones, there were once plans for Starfield to have a much more graphic depiction of violence. That included the evergreen gore-filled death - decapitation.</p>
<p>However, heads would not literally roll in Starfield for a number of reasons. The first was due to technical implications with things such as the different space suits. Speaking on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebSmOGZnmeM">Kiwi Talkz podcast</a>, Mejillones explained that if Bethesda ultimately went down the decapitation route, it would have required the developer to factor in all the suits and how they would react to being severed.</p>

</figure>
<p>"From a technical perspective there's a lot that has to go with it, you know... If you have to cut the helmet in a certain way, and it's got to come off, and you've got to have meat caps for the bottom where the flesh is," Mejillones said when asked about the game's lack of gore.</p><p>Bethesda did have "systems for all of that", he continued, but getting it implemented began to turn into a "big rat's nest of these things" the team had to take into account. He highlighted the helmets' "crazy hoses" as one such consideration.</p>
<p>Mejillones added the character creator in Starfield had evolved from the studio's previous games and now characters' bodies could be more different shapes and sizes, so that was also a factor.</p>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer/Bethesda</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Away from technical implications, Mejillones also reasoned Starfield has a very different overall tone compared to other Bethesda games, such as the ever chaotic Fallout. "Fallout is very stylised in this regard. It's meant to be... that's part of the tongue in cheek humour," he said, commenting on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-walkthrough-and-guide-4019">Fallout 4</a>'s Bloody Mess perk.</p><p>If you weren't aware, this perk increases the chances of enemies exploding into, well, a bloody mess (see video below). This over-the-top gore and theatrics is part of the fun of Fallout, and something which translated really rather well into Amazon's TV adaptation.</p>

<p>"It's like those old-school animes like Fist of the North Star - they punch each other, and gushes of blood would forever come out. It's just, nobody can hold that much blood but you're like 'oh man, that's cool'. It adds to that style," Mejillones continued, before concluding:</p>
<p>"I think for Starfield it was definitely meant to be more low-fi and realistic. We were inspired a lot by things like The Expanse and Star Trek, stuff like that. So I think [over the top gore] just didn't fit thematically... And on top of that you have the cost, the technical overhead cost to get that to work, so we were kind of like 'it's probably better not to include it in this game'."</p>
<p>So, would you have preferred Starfield to have featured more gore, or do you agree it needed to keep with its more grounded tone?</p>

<p>The digital card game launched with unique immersive cards to take players inside the artwork, but it's the more basic cards that have caught the attention of fans.</p>
<p>Over on reddit, user asch_win has used card artwork to spot the exact location of the characters. For instance, the Spearow card has buildings and trees in the background that are likely part of Pokémon Fire Red / Leaf Green's Celadon City, outside of which Spearow can be caught.</p>

		<p>Everyone knows that Nintendo like’s to take their time making games, but even by their standards, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> has been a long time coming. As it’s finally expected to release this year, it’s easily one of our most-anticipated games, not least because of the impending announcement and release of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>…</p>
<p><iframe title="Metroid Prime 4: Beyond – Announcement Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mMAgmdR8jwU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/06/13/metroid-prime-4-in-development-for-nintendo-switch/">Metroid Prime 4 was first announced back at E3 2017</a> but the project did not progress as well as expected, Nintendo taking the drastic measure of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/01/25/nintendo-reboot-metroid-prime-4-development-with-retro-studios/">restarting the project in 2019</a> with series producer Kensuke Tanabe reuniting with Retro Studios, who had first revitalised the Metroid series in the early 2000s with the original Metroid Prime on GameCube.</p>


<p>After 2019, Nintendo kept very, very quiet about Metroid Prime 4 until they were ready to do <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/18/metroid-prime-4-beyond-gameplay-has-been-revealed-its-coming-out-in-2025/">a whole new game announcement and reveal last June</a>. In the intervening years, there was the popular launch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/10/06/metroid-dread-review-switch/">Metroid Dread</a> in 2022, as well as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/10/metroid-prime-remastered-is-a-perfect-reminder-of-this-gamecube-great/">Metroid Prime Remastered</a> in early 2023 to keep fans of the series engaged.</p>
<p>So, what can we expect from Metroid Prime 4: Beyond? Well, the brief snippets of gameplay in last year’s re-reveal featured the classic Metroid Prime morph ball mode, locking onto enemies during combat, and spooky alien environments with a haunting synth-y soundtrack. Given that it’s now 17 years on from Metroid Prime 3’s release, it’s no surprise that the game looks significantly more expansive than what was possible on the Nintendo Wii, with some much larger environments and more dynamic AI running around and battling. There was a glimpse of returning antagonist and rival bounty hunter Sylux, who comes with Metroids in tow. Samus will have her bounty hunting hands full!</p>

<p>As exciting as Metroid Prime 4 is in its own right, perhaps what’s more intriguing about the game is how it can and will tie in with the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2. We’re publishing this Most Wanted on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/14/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-heavily-rumoured-for-thursday/">what is reportedly the eve of the Nintendo Switch 2’s announcement</a>, and given that there’s no release date for Metroid Prime 4 just yet, it’s easy to speculate that this will be a cross-gen release that makes the most of both Switch and Switch 2, taking on the role that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> had for the transition from Wii U to Switch.</p>
<p>That could be a pretty hefty burden to put on Samus Aran’s shoulders – Breath of the Wild had an attach rate of over 100% to the Switch in the early days of that console’s release – but the Switch 2’s launch will be rather different when Nintendo has confirmed backward compatibility. There’s less pressure to be a must-buy exclusive because of that, and there’s as-yet-unconfirmed rumblings of some other more mainstream games, as well.</p>

            <p>Here be your first moving-picture look at The Blood of Dawnwalker, the dark fantasy RPG in the works at Rebel Wolves – the studio founded by a bunch of former <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> devs. As hinted at a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-witcher-3-director-forms-new-studio-with-cdpr-veterans-making-a-dark-fantasy-rpg">couple</a> of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dawnwalker-is-the-revolutionary-dark-fantasy-rpg-from-former-witcher-devs-rebel-wolves">times</a> over previous years, when it was known simply as Dawnwalker, you’ll be playing as a vampire, employing various spooky powers to fight militiamen (and, it seems, at least one giant mechanical spider-thing) amidst a deadly plague outbreak.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, in retrospect, the trailer also has big The Witcher vibes. The stringy orchestral music? The dramatic monologues? The horrible things happening to armoured grunts? This thing’s really playing the Polish fantasy hits.</p>

<p>"You play as Coen, a young man turned into a Dawnwalker, forever treading the line between the world of day and the realm of night", so says the trailer blurb. "Use your skills and combine vampiric strength with human resolve as you take on a quest to save the ones you love. Face your foes – be they human, monster, or the ticking clock itself. But remember – the real evil may bask in the sun's light, and the most loyal of allies could lurk under the cover of night."</p><p>Given that some of the air-quotes "gameplay" glimpsed at the end takes place in daylight, I’m interested to see how that fun-hating bastard The Sun affects your vampiric form. You obviously don’t crumble to ash at the slightest glimmer of UV light, but maybe your smoke-transmogrifying, magically head-exploding powers don’t work outside the night. Which would be a pretty big advantage loss, given that the vamps here have an enviable range of abilities, up to and including curing lethal illnesses by touch. I had a cold for literally all of December so hell, I’d be happy with just that one, let alone all the superhuman fighty stuff.</p>
<p>Rebel Wolves have also said that The Blood of Dawnwalker is the first entry in a "saga", which is an ambitious framing for an infant studio, although if they’re dead set on making a spiritual successor to The Witcher then it probably would need to be a trilogy. No release date yet so it’ll be a while before we can see if this first game lays an appropriate foundation for said saga, though more in-game footage is promised for Summer 2025.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/legend-zelda-wind-waker">The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</a> has today had its soundtrack added to the Nintendo Music app.
</p>
<p>
An impressive 133 tracks are included, lasting 3 hours and 40 minutes from start to finish. 
</p>
<p>
Nintendo's GameCube classic - later remastered for Wii U - remains one of the most beloved entries in the Zelda series, with some truly iconic themes, such as Dragon Roost Island, The Great Sea and that toe-tapping tune that plays when you're inside the pirate ship (titled "Inside the Pirate Ship").

<p>
If you're out of the loop, the Nintendo Music app is a relatively new extra for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers, available on iPhone or Android devices via the App Store and Google Play.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo Music offers a decent alternative to listening to soundtracks on YouTube or cover versions on Spotify, and allows you to lengthen some tracks to loop for up to an hour. (And yes, you can do this for Beedle's Shop Ship theme.)
</p>
<p>
Alternatively, you can dip into music from specific moments within the game, such as the cue that plays at daybreak each morning while sailing. (The climactic Setting Sail is also a bit of a tearjerker).
</p>
<p>
Amidst a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-imminent-reports-suggest">busy week of Nintendo news as we prepare for the reveal of Switch 2</a>, here are the tunes now available on Nintendo Music for The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker:

		<p>The simulator genre is an unusual and ever-evolving array of experiences. Some might task you with specific or bespoke roles that people dream about, like becoming a paramedic or a train driver, while others let you become a car mechanic and dive into the nitty-gritty of how an engine works. Shine Research’s latest, with support from publisher Nacon sees you becoming an architect, with Architect Life: A House Design Simulator giving people the opportunity to build and design incredible homes without the lengthy or expensive university education. Sounds like a pretty good deal, right?</p>
<p><iframe title="Architect Life: A House Design Simulator | Official Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HXyH9aJs2qA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The official trailer immediately shows off the kind of builds that are going to be possible, aping ultra-modern or Grand Designs-styled properties with clarity. It’s clear that you’re going to be put to work by a range of clients, whose every wish you have to try and turn into a series of workable walls with a roof on top of them. It’s an intriguing set-up, and who knows, maybe you’ll find you have a taste for working in this field. Equally, you might discover that you hate people, but we’ll wait and see how needy these particular clients turn out to be.</p>
<p>It’s all very precise, with each section of the build displaying the kind of measurement details and iconography that you’d expect to see in a blueprint or architectural diagram. Don’t let that put you off though, as it seems as though the building itself looks very intuitive, at least with a keyboard and mouse in tow, though the team have been clear to say that it’s just as easy to control with a controller. Once you’ve built the building itself, you have to dress it as well, channelling your inner interior designer for maximum effect.</p>


<p>There’s two main modes, with a 60-mission campaign – that’s a lot of clients – and a sandbox mode where you can let your imagination run riot without constraints or someone breathing down your neck. Things can still go wrong though, and you have to also become a site manager, ensuring that the build continues on schedule despite inclement weather or supply delays.</p>
<p>Architect Life : A House Design Simulator will be available on PC, PS5, Xbox Series and Nintendo Switch in June 2025.</p>

            <p>
The "spance" of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/annihilate-the-spance">Annihilate The Spance</a> is apparently “an ancient, roiling storm of matter and energy” that harbours both “extreme and inexplicable phenomena” and “unfathomable riches”. I’m happy to discover this explanation, because at first I thought that “spance” was just a litigation-avoiding, supermarket rebrand of “space”. I was bracing to send the good news to developers Skyglow Softworks that, so far, nobody has managed to copyright “space”, though I’m sure somebody’s tried. Maybe, um, God? 
</p>
<p>
It’s a relief to know that God won’t be suing Skyglow Softworks for breach of copyright, because off the back of two demo missions, Annihilate The Spance is worryingly compelling. It’s a mixture of space RTS and autobattler, wherein you construct bases that produce spanceships who autopilot towards the nearest and largest concentration of enemies. According to the developers, it’s inspired by the 2011 Flash game <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/582330">Obliterate Everything</a> by CWWallis (RIP), which I dimly recall playing while I was running a browser game blog for AOL. Anyway, here’s a trailer.

<p>
As you’ve hopefully deduced, the rough flow here is that you clip modules for building, resource generation, and turret defence to the outside of your base core. It’s as though you’re growing a pearl from a chunk of asteroid dust. A pearl that proceeds to spawn huge armadas of spanceships. The ships range from zippy, brittle fighter craft through tougher, point-defence escorts to armoured cruisers and heavy beam artillery. You can give them waypoints by circle-painting an area of your base, then dragging out a line, but they’ll do all the warring themselves. You can also decide which shipyards produce what, and synchronise construction outputs to firm up your offensive.
</p><p>
It’s almost reminiscent of crowd control in Humanity, though the better comparison is of course another autobattler, such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mechabellum">Mechabellum</a>. Nic will be spitting mad that I’ve played this before Mechabellum, after all his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mechabellum-review">strenuous advocacy</a>. And in fairness to Battlemaster Reuben, Annihilate The Spance doesn’t seem as polished: the controls and presentation are on the functional side, with drag-selection a chore when your base hits a certain size. There’s also a surprising amount of plot involved, with some robustly written, ponderously scrolling mission briefings that may annoy those who just want to see two rolling hillocks of spanceships, sutured together by webs of laser fire.</p>
<p>Still, I had a blast playing the demo last night – there’s a nice rhythm of fussing over construction, then sitting back to watch your cloud of astral locusts softly consume another base. It seems targeted at older players who get back cramp if they have to micromanage too often. The kind of older player who can remember the golden age of Flash. Awww.
</p>
<p>
The game’s out in early access today, boasting 22 campaign missions, two playable factions, 50 or so warships and 20 base structures. The 1.0 release, slated for end of 2026, will add a third playable faction, the remaining story missions, and a level editor. There’s still <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1706360/Annihilate_The_Spance/">a demo on Steam</a> at the time of writing.

            <p>Two new Sony patents have been spotted that would allow players to aim their DualSense like a gun, and use AI to predict player inputs.</p>
<p>The first of these, spotted by <a href="https://gamerant.com/sony-dualsense-gun-accessory/">GameRant</a>, was filed in June last year and made public earlier this month. The patent is for a trigger attachment for the DualSense controller to add realism to gunplay.</p>
<p>Players would theoretically hold the controller sideways with one controller arm, using the space between the R1 and R2 shoulder buttons as an aiming sight.</p>

<p>The patent also suggests this could be paired with other hardware or accessories, including a VR headset. Though with PS VR2's Sense controllers I don't know why this would be necessary.</p>
<p>What's more, the controller arms don't seem long enough to me to house player hands and a trigger system, while the weight of the controller would be uneven to hold up for long periods.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/sony-dulasense-controller-gun-attachment-accessory-fig-14-15.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Sony</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The second patent is, perhaps, more interesting as it could be used to reduce lag in online games by using AI to predict player inputs ahead of time (thanks <a href="https://tech4gamers.com/sony-patents-latency-predicting-inputs/">tech4gamers</a>).</p>
<p>The patent involves using a camera to view the player and controller, record actions, and let AI predict what inputs will be pressed next. Another option would be to use incomplete controller actions instead, allowing AI to guess players' intentions.</p>
<p>Essentially this would help to reduce latency - the delay between player input and in-game action - which can be a major issue during online games.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/The-flowchart-explains-the-new-method-to-deal-with-latency-issues-in-multiplayer-titles-1920x2717.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Sony</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Other recent patents spotted by tech4gamers include using AI accounts to impersonate players and catch cheaters, and providing real-time in-game location information to assist frustrated players - as well as detecting erratic button mashing and verbal outbursts.</p>
<p>Of course, these patents don't mean these ideas will necessarily come to fruition, but it's always interesting to see what companies may be working on.</p>
<p>Previous Sony patents include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-latest-patent-suggests-its-developing-a-dualsense-controller-that-can-provide-gameplay-hints">predictive AI assistance features</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-patents-ability-for-games-to-adjust-difficulty-levels-on-the-fly">adaptive difficulty</a>, or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-patents-game-replay-from-trigger-points-over-streaming">allowing players to replay a game from specific trigger points</a>. Many patents appear to be addressing accessibility issues.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>I can refuel a spaceship. That’s right, a ship that can go into space. Can you? Uncle Chop’s Rocket Shop is a game about being a mechanic and, weird flex aside, it’s actually capable of teaching you important and useful skills. Admittedly, these are more about being able to follow instructions and retain information rather than actually refuelling spaceships. Still, NASA know where you are if they need you, right?</p>
<p><iframe title="Uncle Chop's Rocket Shop | Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0RsRnMhqQgI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You play Wilbur, a four-eyed space fox with more than a little Wes Anderson film about him, who somehow falls into mechanical-based servitude to Uncle Chop. You rent a space above the café, and each morning, you clock in for work and attempt to repair and maintain a steady stream of extraterrestrial craft. The better job you do and the faster you perform, the more money you earn, which in turn lets you pay your R.E.N.T. and continue to survive for another day or two. Phew, I’m glad the real world isn’t quite like that.</p>


<p>This isn’t the only brush with the real world that Uncle Chop’s Rocket Shop has, as you have to research and remember the correct way to maintain all these spaceships. That means opening your Grimoire and finding the correct section on whatever part or subsection needs looking at. At first, that’s just figuring out how to refuel the ship, but as you progress the tasks become longer, tougher and more complicated.</p>


<p>What makes Uncle Chop’s Rocket Shop so special is how tactile these tasks are. You have to physically complete them, with Kasedo Games translating each of these to the physical controls on your controller. So, analogue sticks operate as levers or socket wrenches and screwdrivers, all of which need to be selected, grabbed and physically moved. Even clocking in requires you to pick up your card, stamp it in the machine with an oh-so-satisfying pull of the lever, and then slot it into the waiting slot on the other side. It’s clever and utterly unique.</p>
<p>As you leaf through your Grimoire, you really have to learn the different methods and machines that will enable you to complete the task. Each page has a batch of infographics, and while they’re not always completely explicit, relying as much on arrows and ticks to show you the right place or correct way of doing things, they help you come to understand the task at hand.</p>
<p>You’ll fumble through the first few, before, without warning, you can suddenly replace a spaceship’s oil in the fastest, most efficient way possible. It’s bizarre how easily this previously complicated task becomes, and frankly, maybe we should put a bit of Uncle Chop’s Rocket Shop into our secondary curriculum planning. They’re definitely onto something educational, though the puzzling action can be slightly more frantic than you’d probably want a classroom to be. Its academic chops are also hidden away behind an alien fox and more than a couple of rude words.</p>

<p>Uncle Chop’s Rocket Shop is set up as a Roguelite, and while it might feel like this has become the most ubiquitous gameplay mechanic of recent years, it does at least make sense and have some narrative drive behind it, as each run lets you gain more currency to unlock permanent upgrades and boons. Spaceships are procedurally generated too, so each time you start a new run, you’ll encounter all-new layouts and different customers behind the wheel.</p>
<p>Everything is complimented by the off-kilter, irreverent humour. There’s plenty of expletives, wry nods to the camera and a bucketload of self-awareness that has the game taking aim at those in positions of power, capitalism and the conditions that the working classes endure. It’s fun and knowing, and it’ll put a smile on your face while giving you something to think about, which is what good comedy is all about. The soundtrack is flipping fantastic too, with a Western guitar drawl that feels cool and laidback, even when everything is going to hell and you’re fumbling with the socket wrench again.</p>

<p>I yearn for a 161 of Clubs in Balatro, and not a day goes by where I don’t dream of it. It’s a dream no longer though as it turns out it exists! The 161 of Clubs is a real card in Balatro, well, kind of.</p>



<p>Jokers are the lifeblood of Balatro. Even the most mediocre of runs can be bolstered by a game-changing Joker. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-astronomer-joker-balatro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Astronomer Joker</a> makes runs cheaper, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-hit-the-road-joker-balatro/">Hit The Ro</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-hit-the-road-joker-balatro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-hit-the-road-joker-balatro/">d</a> exchanges certain Cards for huge xMult increases, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-brainstorm-joker-in-balatro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brainstorm</a> can give you twice as much Joker power. Traditional Cards are left unchanged though. Yes, you can add various bonuses, and duplicate and destroy Cards, but never-before-seen Cards don’t exist in Balatro.</p>



<p>This was until the 12 of Hearts and bizarre 161 of Clubs caught my attention.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-balatro-s-161-of-clubs">What is Balatro’s 161 of Clubs?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Ridiculous. Image via “I hope I’m doing this correctly” Balatro Reddit post</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The 161 of Clubs is a meme in Balatro started by a Reddit Post.</strong></p>



<p>I did some digging, and after seeing the term “161 of Clubs” continually crop up, I was beginning to wonder if some newfangled Card existed. Or maybe there’s a secret Joker to unlock. The 161 of Clubs is nothing but a popular meme that has spread like a knife with hot butter.</p>



<p>The first known existence of the 161 Clubs came to light with the “I hope I’m doing this correctly,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/balatro/comments/1ht9pde/i_hope_im_doing_this_correctly/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post on the Balatro subreddit</a>. It features an eye-catching screenshot of the user’s hand midgame. It has usual Cards such as an Ace of Diamonds, two 4 of Clubs, and a 10 of Diamonds.</p>



<p>We quickly go from the ridiculous to the sublime as the hand escalates: An <strong>11 of Clubs</strong> (should be a Jack), <strong>12 of Hearts</strong> (should be a Queen), <strong>23 of Spades</strong> (I give up), and the now-legendary <strong>161 of Clubs</strong> are present.</p>



<p>It appears the post was shared to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/comedyheaven/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Comedy Heaven su</a><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/comedyheaven/">breddit</a>—which has 2 million members—and quickly gained traction.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-get-161-of-clubs-in-balatro">Can You Get 161 of Clubs in Balatro?</h2>



<p><strong>Officially, you can’t get the 161 of Clubs in Balatro as it’s from a mod.</strong> If you get your hands on the mod, <strong>you too can wield the historic 161 of Clubs to score many Chips.</strong></p>



<p>The original Reddit post is marked with the “<strong>modded</strong>” tag. It’s not “leaked DLC” as some satirical comments suggest, and despite one hundred comments and several thousand likes, <strong>the mod has yet to be identified</strong>.</p>



<p>This is a shame as I feel the world is clamoring out for a ridiculous deck with a 161 of Clubs. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-balatro-seeds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best Balatro Seeds</a> break the game, so you can only imagine this Card’s potential.</p>



<hr>



<p>If anyone knows the mod to get the 161 of Clubs, please drop it below for others to use. Balatro is entertaining enough, but I think we all agree this is a needed necessity. What other outlandish Cards would you like to see and use in Balatro?</p>

            <p>
PlayStation maker Sony is among the companies that have announced donations to help with relief and rebuilding efforts in the wake of Los Angeles' devastating wildfires. 
</p>
<p>
A week on, several areas of the city are still burning - and there's now fresh fear of further destruction as forecasters expect "close to hurricane force" winds to spread the fires once again over the coming days (via <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/cew52g8r8e7t">BBC News</a>). At least 24 people are known to have died, 23 more are missing, and 12,401 structures have been lost.
</p>
<p>
As firefighters continue to tackle the blazes, Sony has announced a $5m donation to support first responders and the community affected by the fires.
</p>
<p>
"Los Angeles has been the home of our entertainment businesses for more than 35 years," Sony chairman and CEO Kenichiro Yoshida and Sony president and COO Hiroki Totoki said in a joint <a href="https://x.com/Sony/status/1878965120178753577">statement</a> shared on social media. 
</p>
<p>
"We will continue work with our local business leadership to determine how best Sony group can support relief and recovery efforts in the days ahead."
</p>
<p>
Other entertainment companies have also announced donations, including $10m donations each from Amazon, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> and NBCUniversal owner Comcast, plus $15m from Warner Bros Discovery. 
</p>
<p>
Paramount is chipping in $1m, while Beyoncé has said she's donating $2.5m.
</p>
<p>
Away from the disaster's human cost, the early impact of the fires was also seen in a spate of delays to Los Angeles' film and TV industries, including a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/devastating-los-angeles-fires-shut-down-fallout-season-2">pause in production of Fallout season two</a>.

            <p>Sony is continuing its game to big (and small) screen push, last week announcing films based on both its Horizon and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> series. Details were still fairly thin on the ground at this time, but now Arrowhead CCO Johan Pilestedt has confirmed one thing about the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> adaptation: the developer will be involved with the upcoming film, but in a somewhat limited capacity.</p>
<p>And, that's the way it should be, the exec says.</p>

</figure>
<p>This little titbit comes from an exchange on social media platform X, which was spotted by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-developers-dont-and-shouldnt-have-final-say-on-the-upcoming-movie">IGN</a>. When one fan asked whether or not the Helldivers 2 studio would be involved in the film's production to ensure the adaptation stays faithful to the source material, Pilestedt admitted he had been "dodging this question" since the announcement.</p>
<p>"The short answer is yes. The long answer is that we'll see," the CCO replied, before acknowledging the Helldivers 2 development team "are not Hollywood people", and therefore "don't know what it takes to make a movie".</p>
<p>Baring all this in mind, Pilestedt therefore said the studio won't have the final say on the film. And, in his opinion, nor should it really, which I guess makes sense.</p>
<p>It still hasn't been revealed who will be taking on the role of director for the Helldivers 2 film. In fact, other than word that a film is in the pipeline as part of a collaboration between Sony Productions and Sony Pictures, there is not much else concrete to say at the present time.</p>
<p>"I'm excited to announce we are working with Sony Pictures on developing a film adaptation of our amazingly popular PlayStation game, Helldivers 2," was all <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawn-and-helldivers-2-are-getting-film-adaptations">PlayStation's Asad Qizilbash said during its reveal at CES last week</a>.</p>
<div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Hey! I've been dodging this question. The short answer is yes. The long answer is that we'll see.

		<p>Capcom has released a new gameplay trailer for Fatal Fury’s Mai, who is part of Street Fighter VI’s Year 2 Character Pass. The trailer shows her facing off against Chun Li and Ryu in two different bouts, wearing two different outfits, both from her Fatal Fury wardrobe. Mai has been part of the Fatal Fury series since Fatal Fury 2, which released back in 1992.</p>
<p><iframe title="Street Fighter 6 - Mai Gameplay Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RhcsgO4jse4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>As you can see from the trailer, Mai brings her Shiranui Ninja style into the fighter mix of Street Fighter VI. It is a hand to hand style that also encompasses throws, kicks, elbows, fire, and paper fans. Players who like putting together combos will have plenty to work with when it comes to Mai’s fighting style, and it looks like it will favour those who prefer fast moving characters. Mai will be available from February 5th in Street Fighter VI.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/30/street-fighter-6-review/">In our Street Fighter 6 Review,</a>&nbsp;Nick said,&nbsp;<em>“Street Fighter 6 doesn’t need recommending to hardcore fighting fans – you all already know how incredible it is – but do I recommend it for more casual players? Street Fighter 6 has a real sense of community, welcoming all players old and new, teaching new tricks and providing something for those that just want a bit of fun. This is truly a fighting game for everyone.”</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-open-world-rpg-revealed-with-gorgeous-trailer-and-in-game-sneak-peek/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday evening, Polish developer Rebel Wolves finally unveiled its debut project, a single player open world roleplaying game titled The Blood of Dawnwalker. During a livestreamed event, fans were able to learn more about the game, watch the gorgeous CGI trailer, and even get a brief sneak peek at in-game footage.</p>
<p>Rebel Wolves was <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-director-new-studio-rebel-wolves/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">founded</a> three years ago by former The Witcher III: Wild Hunt director Konrad Tomaszkiewicz following his departure from CD Projekt RED. After <a href="https://wccftech.com/rebel-wolves-founded-by-ex-cdpr-devs-gets-netease-investment-for-aaa-rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">securing investment</a> from NetEase, the studio signed a deal to publish their first title <a href="https://wccftech.com/rebel-wolves-signs-publishing-deal-with-bandai-namco-for-upcoming-rpg-dawnwalker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with Bandai Namco</a>.</p>
<p>The influence of The Witcher III is pretty clear, although there are more than a few twists. The Blood of Dawnwalker is set in 14th-century Carpathia, in the fictional region of Vale Lenora. While not a high fantasy game, the setting definitely supports magic and supernatural inspired by dark fantasy universes. The story begins when, at the height of the Black Plague, a group of powerful vampires leaps out of the shadows to overthrow the feudal lords and take the Vale for themselves. They're led by an old and very powerful vampire called Brencis, who promises security to the battered inhabitants. Of course, that protection comes at a heavy cost - regular blood masses where humans have to donate their blood, no matter the consequences for them.</p>
<p>In the CGI trailer, we see protagonist Coen's first encounter with the vampires. Just as the human lords are about to burn Coen's sister, who is infected with the Black Plague, the vampires arrive and slaughter them all. Then, they hear Coen's plea to save her and proceed to heal the little girl with their blood (which does not turn her into a vampire).</p>
<p>The game begins around two years after that event. Coen has since been turned into kind of a vampire himself, but as you might have guessed from the title, he's a special one. Due to his argyria, a silver poisoning he got when working in the silver mines, he is weaker than a regular vampire but also not fully transformed, which means he can still walk among humans during the day.</p>
<p>The Blood of Dawnwalker will reportedly feature two different loops for day and night. During the day, Coen will essentially fight like a human (barring some occult magic he'll be able to learn throughout the game); however, during the night, he'll be able to use his vampire powers. He'll need them, as there are other supernatural foes than just vampires that have come out since Brencis took over: undead, Kobolds, and some creatures called uriashes.</p>
<p>Being an open world roleplaying game, it's not surprising to hear confirmation that players will be able to befriend or become the enemy of various characters. The former would probably be smarter to further Coen's ultimate goal of taking down Brencis and freeing his family, though he can go entirely solo as well. However, players will only have 30 days and nights to make him succeed. This also inevitably means they won't be able to complete all the stories (which Rebel Wolves is not splitting traditionally into main and side quests) in a single playthrough. There's one more mechanics that needs to be monitored at all times: blood hunger. Not only will Coen be weaker in combat if not fed, but he might lose control and kill even a friend, potentially also failing a quest.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Blood of Dawnwalker — Cinematic Trailer &amp; Gameplay Teaser" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MWsyV7yQIBQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>All of this sounds very interesting, to say the least. This Unreal Engine 5 powered game will receive its full gameplay reveal this Summer. There's no release window yet, but we already know The Blood of Dawnwalker will be available for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

            <p>A recent batch of trademarks filed by Sega suggests another classic video game series could be set to make a return.</p>
<p>As spotted by Gematsu, Sega filed two trademarks towards the end of last month. Those trademarks? "Ecco the Dolphin" and "Ecco".</p>
<p>The filings were made in Japan on 27th December, before they were subsequently made public yesterday.</p>

<p>Ecco the Dolphin was released all the way back in 1992 for the Sega Mega Drive (or Genesis, for those over the pond).</p>
<p>As I am sure you have no doubt figured, the game stars a dolphin by the name of Ecco. Our poor lead gets separated from his pod at the start of the game, and as such must find his way through the waters to reunite with them. This sees (or seas) Ecco negotiating underwater cave systems while booping jelly fish and such out of his way. Ecco eventually comes across other unexpected areas and creatures, but I will keep those as a surprise for those who don't already know.</p><p>Ecco the Dolphin was developed by Novotrade International and published by SEGA. A sequel - Ecco: The Tides of Time - was then released in 1994. Two spinoffs in the Ecco Jr line were released in 1995, before a reboot known as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ecco-defender-future">Ecco the Dolphin: Defender of the Future</a> was then released in 2000 for the Dreamcast. This is the last game in the series, as development on another instalment was cancelled back in 2001.</p>
<p>More recently, Ecco the Dolphin and Ecco: The Tides of Time were delisted from Steam, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-delisting-over-60-classic-games-from-virtual-stores-including-jet-set-radio-and-crazy-taxi">Sega set about removing over 60 of its classic games from virtual stores</a>.</p>
<p>So, could we see the return of Ecco in the near future? I shore am excited to find out.</p>

		<p>Back in October, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/21/bandai-namco-will-publish-rebel-wolves-rpg-dawnwalker/">Bandai Namco and new studio Rebel Wolves</a> agreed a publishing deal for Rebel Wolves new RPG, at the time named Dawnwalker. Rebel Wolves was founded in 2022 by the game director of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, Konrad Tomaszkiewicz. He has been joined by other CD Projekt RED alumni, including Chief Publishing Officer Tomasz Tinc, and Narrative Director Jakub Szamałek. Today, the first cinematic and gameplay teaser for The Blood of Dawnwalker has been released.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Blood of Dawnwalker — Cinematic Trailer &amp; Gameplay Teaser" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HkICrJEVTjI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Blood of Dawnwalker is set in Europe during the 14th century, with the Black Plague wiping out people at a high rate. One of the people affected is Lunka, the sister of main character Coen. In the trailer, you can see him fleeing a patrol to stop them from killing his sister and ending up in a ruined church. Cornered, Coen is saved by an unlikely source. That is a vampire and his allies. The vampire saves Lunka’s life, but has his own motivations to take advantage of humanity’s time of weakness to grab power and gain freedom, along with other creatures of the night.</p>
<p>While the cinematic ends on a bit of a cliffhanger, the trailer shows some gameplay with Coen wielding dark powers. Coen is the Daywalker, and the assumption is that the vampire made him this way as payment for saving Lunka. Coen has vampiric powers but can navigate the world during the day. As the story of The Blood of Dawnwalker&nbsp; progresses, players will make choices on whether to try and remain human or use the vampiric dark powers, moving further away from humanity. You will also be able to use a combo of human and vampire skills in combat, with all sorts of foes from soldiers to other monsters being enemies. Allies could be found among any group too, be they human or a creature of the night. It all depends on the decisions you make as Coen.</p>

<p>The Blood of Dawnwalker does not have a release date yet, and a gameplay reveal will be coming in the summer. The Blood of Dawnwalker has been confirmed for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

<p>In a post on social media, FuturLab’s CEO, Kirsty Rigden, revealed that the team is unable to support PowerWash Simulator VR going forward. This decision was made to support the job security of staff across the company, and instead of making layoffs, the team working on the VR version of the game has been ‘redeployed’ on other projects and roles.</p>



<p>This means that while the game remains available on storefronts, it will no longer receive any further updates, support, or DLC.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/PowerWashSim/status/1878840388578169168" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the post on Twitter</a> (X), Rigden wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I am so sorry to let you know that we won’t be continuing support of PowerWash Simulator VR. We absolutely love and believe in VR, so this doesn’t mean that we won’t support it in the future but we aren’t able to continue with support right now.</p>



<p>We have been faced with a cross roads: we have a truly excellent and kind VR team who were working on a platform which costs us more than it makes, while also having a list of job opening that were looking to be filled on other projects.</p>



<p>We took the decision to redeploy our VR team into those other projects/roles. Whilst I would love to live in a world where we could support PowerWash Simulator on every platform going, I will always choose job security for my team.</p>



<p>While I know that you must be so disappointed, I also know that if you were in my position, you would have made the same decision.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I’ve played a little PowerWash Simulator VR on the Meta Quest 3, and it’s a fantastic experience that’s possibly one of the most therapeutic things I’ve ever had the pleasure of enjoying. The base game was good enough, but VR enabled me to get up close with what I was cleaning – and it helped when it came to detecting those last spots of grime on unseen surfaces.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sledgehammer%E2%80%99s-multiplayer-creative-director-leaves-after-15-years.1081563/</guid>

<p>Sledgehammer Games, one of the key contributing studios at the heart of the Call of Duty franchise, has had a rocky time with the series over the last decade or so. The studio is best known for titles like Advanced Warfare, WWII, and Vanguard, which represents a real mixed bag of Call of Duty games.</p>



<p>In a recent post on social media, Sledgehammer’s Greg Reisdorf, who was with the firm for 15 years and rose to the role of Multiplayer Creative Director, revealed he has stepped down from the company.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-whatever-comes-next">Whatever Comes Next</h2>



<p>In the post on Twitter (X), Greg Reisdorf wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Friday was my last day at Sledgehammer Games after 15 years. I’m incredibly grateful for the opportunities and amazing developers I worked with.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He then dove deep into the history of Sledgehammer Games, giving up various tidbits and treasures from his time at the company. He revealed he created the iconic sequence where Soap succumbs to his wounds in Modern Warfare 3 (2011). He also mentioned that Advanced Warfare ‘was a challenge – but we made it happen’.</p>



<p>Looking back, Reisdorf suggested that the ‘Pick 13’ loadout model ‘should not have happened’. That’s one of the most divisive topics in the Call of Duty community year on year.</p>



<p>Reisdorf also revealed that he was instrumental in revisiting the MW2 maps in Modern Warfare III (2023). It’s widely considered the worst Call of Duty game to emerge in recent years, but the fan service was nothing short of a treat, and Reisdorf was responsible for many of the easter eggs and smaller details or ‘nods’ for true COD fans.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://x.com/gregreisdorf/status/1878849641715753391" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">full thread of posts by Reisdorf</a> is a veritable treasure trove of memory lane snippets, perfect reading material for the average Call of Duty fan.</p>
