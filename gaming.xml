<p>The StarLadder Budapest Major 2025 has concluded with a series between two titans: Team Vitality, the tournament favorite, and FaZe Clan, an unexpected entrant to the grand final. In the end, Vitality proved unstoppable, defeating FaZe Clan with a memorable 3-1 finish and securing back-to-back Major trophies.</p>



<p>The Major might be over, but Counter-Strike 2 isn’t. Insider Gaming, together with the international betting brand GG.BET, brings you to the heart of unforgettable moments of the StarLadder Major Budapest 2025. Visit&nbsp;<a href="https://gg.bet/news/betbuilder-now-on-ggbet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gg.bet</a>&nbsp;to dive deeper, place your bets, and feel the adrenaline of esports!</p>

<h2 id="h-team-vitality-just-got-500-000-richer">Team Vitality Just Got $500,000 Richer</h2>



<p>The grand final began with FaZe Clan picking Nuke, where they managed to edge out Team Vitality with a strong scoreline, presenting fans with promise in the earliest map of the final. However, Vitality quickly regained control, crushing FaZe 13-3 in the follow-up. From there, the French-led roster never looked back.</p>



<p>It was a decisive victory for Team Vitality, which has gone down in the history books after putting up one of the best single seasons in the world of esports this year. The team claimed the half-a-million-dollar prize and lifted <strong>another trophy </strong>in 2025.</p>



<p>This makes Vitality the first team since 2019 to secure consecutive Major titles, which is a perfect way to end the season. For FaZe, the loss is a bittersweet one. It was a rocky year for the team, and many had their doubts going into the tournament, let alone the grand final.</p>



<p>Fans of the organization were begging for a redemption shot at the final Major of 2025, but it just wasn’t to be.</p>



<p>Now, we start looking to the 2026 esports calendar and whatever comes next.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nioh 3 – Everything We Know about Team Ninja’s Supernatural Action RPG]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/roundup/nioh-3-everything-we-know-about-team-ninjas-supernatural-action-rpg/</link>
            <guid>1383028</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="overview">
			
<p>Several years after the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nioh-2-the-complete-edition-grave-no-bar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nioh 2</a>, Team Ninja returns to the series with <strong>Nioh 3</strong>, after cleansing their palate with many other franchises. Except for 2021, the highly prolific division of Koei Tecmo has released a new game every year, starting with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stranger-of-paradise-final-fantasy-origin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin</a> in 2022, then <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-shadows-dont-die-twice/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty</a> in 2023, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/rise-of-the-ronin-neo-edo-open-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rise of the Ronin</a> in 2024, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ninja-gaiden-4-bathed-in-blood/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ninja Gaiden 4</a> in 2025. Most of these games had their own twists: Stranger of Paradise was a peculiar (and controversial) reinterpretation of the original Final Fantasy featuring a whole party of characters; Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty was the studio's first foray into a Chinese fantasy setting; Rise of the Ronin was an ambitious open world action RPG similar to the recent Assassin's Creed games; and of course, Ninja Gaiden 4 allowed the studio to reintroduce its most prized IP to newer generations with the help of PlatinumGames.</p>



<p>Ninja Gaiden may be witnessing a resurgence in popularity, but the Nioh series also gained a significant following over time. Koei Tecmo is now self-publishing the new game, too, so they have an even greater interest in making a bigger splash with this new entry.</p>



<h2 id="h-release-date-platforms-pricing-editions">Release Date, Platforms, Pricing, Editions</h2>



<p>Nioh 3 was <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-announced-with-action-packed-trailer-launches-in-early-2026-on-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> during June 2025's State of Play event. Right away, Koei Tecmo confirmed the early 2026 target release window. In September, Amazon Japan <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-launches-february-6-2026-amazon-japan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked</a> the final release date of <strong>February 6, 2026</strong>, which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-new-trailer-provides-new-quick-look-at-story-and-gameplay-confirms-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> a few hours later during September's State of Play.</p>



<p>Players will be able to test the game ahead of its release, thanks to a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-new-demo-ps5-pc-january-29-2026-carries-full-game-crossplay-missing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free demo</a> launching on <strong>January 29, 2026</strong>. The demo's save file will carry over to the full version, allowing demo players to continue the journey right away.</p>



<p>As mentioned earlier, whereas the first two Nioh titles were published by Sony and released on PlayStation 5 several months before the PC version as part of the exclusivity agreement, this new game is being published by Koei Tecmo and is therefore the first in the franchise to get a <strong>simultaneous release on PlayStation 5 and PC</strong> (via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3681010/Nioh_3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>).</p>



<p>Nioh 3 can already be pre-purchased on both platforms. There are two editions: the Standard one, priced at <strong>$69.99</strong>, and the Digital Deluxe Edition, priced at <strong>$109.99</strong>. The latter includes the following items:</p>



<ul>
<li>Base game</li>



<li>Season pass comprising two DLCs, one due by the end of September 2026 and the second by the end of February 2027</li>



<li>Season pass bonus "Chijiko Netsuke Charm" (accessory)</li>



<li>Infernal Weapons Set (14 types)</li>



<li>Kodama Netsuke Charm (accessory)</li>
</ul>

<p>Both editions have a Pre-Order Bonus and an Early Purchase Bonus. The former will activate if you buy the game before the launch date, whereas the latter can still be received as long as you purchase Nioh 3 by <strong>February 19, 2026</strong>. The Pre-Order Bonus provides the Hellfire Equipment Set (Hellfire Warrior Armor set + Hellfire Ninja Attire set) and Scampuss Furball Netsuke Charm (accessory), whereas the Early Purchase Bonus grants you access to the Hellfrost Equipment Set (Hellfrost Warrior Armor set + Hellfrost Ninja Attire set). Koei Tecmo clarified that these bonuses could be sold separately or given away for free at a later date.</p>



<h2 id="h-genre-setting-and-story-premise">Genre, Setting, and Story Premise</h2>



<p>Like its predecessors, Nioh 3 can be described as a challenging<strong> action RPG</strong>, primarily focused around punishing one-on-one duels and boss encounters rooted in Japanese swordplay and yokai folklore. After the intermission of Nioh 2 (which served as a prequel to the first Nioh chronologically), the story returns to the late <strong>Sengoku period</strong> (16th century). The main protagonist is <strong>Tokugawa Takechiyo</strong>, a young warrior poised to become <span>the Shogun, while his embittered younger brother,&nbsp;<strong>Tokugawa Kunimatsu,</strong>&nbsp;secretly conspires to overthrow him</span> with a horde of yokai (demons in Japanese folklore). Besieged by his brother, Takechiyo travels through time to alter the course of destiny and preserve Japan with the help of his guardian spirit, Kusanagi.</p>



<p>Throughout the course of the narrative, Takechiyo will traverse the Sengoku, Heian, Bakumatsu, and early Edo eras. The developers have confirmed that throughout the game, players will encounter a plethora of historical figures, including, but not limited to, Himiko, Saito Fuku, Hattori Hanzo, Honda Tadakatsu, Minamoto no Yoshitsune, Yagyu Munenori, and Takasugi Shinsaku.</p>



<h2 id="h-gameplay">Gameplay</h2>



<p>Team Ninja pitched Nioh 3 to fans as an evolution of the series' stance-based combat into a dual-style system where players can freely swap between <strong>Samurai</strong> and <strong>Ninja</strong> modes mid-fight. The <strong>Samurai</strong> style broadly resembles Nioh 1 and 2, emphasizing precision melee with katana and traditional arms, ki (stamina) management, and stance variations, enhanced by new techniques and counters introduced in this new title. The new <strong>Ninja</strong> style, on the other hand, offers a distinctly different experience that emphasizes speed, evasive maneuvers, aerial attacks, and trick-based offense, encouraging hit-and-run and mobility-heavy builds. Players can chain style swaps on the fly, opening hybrid combos that weave heavy samurai strikes into evasive ninja strings. Most of the other familiar series pillars, like guardian spirits, yokai abilities, and loot-driven progression, are returning, albeit now largely tied into a new endgame challenge framework dubbed <strong>The Crucible</strong>, which appears to function as a high-risk, high-reward gauntlet layered on top of the campaign.</p>



<p>The other major innovation is that Team Ninja moved away from the strictly mission-based map of earlier entries toward what they are calling an <strong>“open field”</strong> structure. This doesn't mean a traditional open world; instead, you can expect larger interconnected regions dotted with settlements, roaming yokai, and optional encounters, providing more continuous exploration without abandoning curated combat arenas. As noted <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-is-the-culmination-of-every-team-ninja-action-rpg-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in our most recent hands-on preview</a>, main and sub-missions still anchor the experience, but surfacing them organically in the landscape makes progressing through a region feel less like hopping between menus and more like inhabiting a continuous war-torn countryside. Every detour—whether it is sweeping up loot, tackling Myths sidequests from NPCs, clearing Enemy Bases, or hunting down Crucible Wraiths—pushes up a regional Exploration Level that hands out permanent perks, from raw stat bumps to a fully revealed map dotted with markers for points of interest. On top of the usual torrent of gear and materials, those activities drip-feed skill points for the game’s sprawling trees and layer in extra blessings from friendly yokai and Jizo Statues. </p>



<p>Speaking during a recent interview, producer Fumihiko Yasuda also <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-dev-made-sure-there-wont-be-sudden-difficulty-spikes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that while the game will respect the series tradition of being quite hard, there won't be any sudden difficulty spikes. This should lessen frustration for newcomers to Nioh.  </p>



<h2 id="h-tech-and-specs">Tech and Specs</h2>



<p>Team Ninja is one of the few triple-A studios that has not switched to Epic's Unreal Engine. Nioh 3 will still run on the studio's proprietary Katana Engine, last seen in the recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>. Based on the studio's previous games, the PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro are likely to offer Performance and Quality modes, although this has yet to be confirmed for this title.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-pc-system-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC system requirements of Nioh 3</a> confirmed that Frame Generation will be supported, though they do not specify whether it's AMD's, NVIDIA's, Intel's, or some combination of the three. An SSD is required.</p>

<p>The game supports cooperative multiplayer, but cross-play, as confirmed by Koei Tecmo to Wccftech, won't be available. To play with friends, you'll have to buy Nioh 3 on the same platform.</p>

            <p>Veteran developer and the director behind the upcoming Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic, Casey Hudson, has dismissed rumours that players will have to wait years for the new game's release.</p>
<p>While Bloomberg's Jason Schreier <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3m7sj6bcoxk2o">suggested</a> that a release by 2030 "is an *optimistic* guess" given Hudson's studio, Arcanaut, was only founded in July, Hudson was quick to correct the record.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-revealed-from-knights-of-the-old-republic-and-mass-effect-director-casey-hudson">The new Star Wars single-player RPG was revealed at The Game Awards</a> just <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-a-big-star-wars-game-announcement-on-the-way-and-the-title-ends-with-the-old-republic-teases-leaker">days after rumours swirled that a new KOTOR game could be on the way</a>.</p>
<p>Now confirmed as a spiritual successor to BioWare's Knights of the Old Republic, Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic hails from Arcanaut Studios and Casey Hudson, who was director of BioWare's Star Wars game and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>. It's set to be "an epic interactive adventure across a galaxy on the brink of rebirth where every decision shapes your path towards light or darkness".</p><p>"When we developed the original KOTOR, we wanted to create a definitive Star Wars experience - crafting an adventure that consisted of all the things we dreamed of doing as Star Wars fans," Hudson said when the game was announced.
</p>
<p>"Now, 25 years after we started work on that game, our aspirations are equally ambitious. Fate of the Old Republic represents an opportunity to explore a contemporary vision of a definitive Star Wars experience, using state-of-the-art technology and game design, and an all-new story crafted specifically to deliver on the combination of player agency and immersion in Star Wars that was at the heart of KOTOR."</p>

            <p>New Vampire Survivors-a-like Codex Mortis is perhaps one of the first games to proudly declare that everything, from its assets and code to the music, is "100 percent AI-driven".</p>
<p>Developer Grolaf, aka Crunchfest, admits the game – which has taken three months to make – is created entirely with AI, with artwork created in Chat GPT, and animations created using "a shader written by Claude Code".</p>
<p>No game engine was used – "it's pure TypeScript", apparently – with the developer explaining "I use PIXI.js for rendering, bitECS for the entity-component-system backend, and Electron to wrap it as a desktop app. The whole thing was vibe-coded with Claude Code (mostly Opus 4.1 and 4.5)." You can see it in action in the video below.</p>

<p>"In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4084120/CODEX_MORTIS/">Codex Mortis,</a> Death is your weapon," the blurb teases (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/roguelike/this-roguelite-claims-to-have-the-dubious-honor-of-being-the-worlds-first-fully-playable-game-created-100-percent-through-ai-in-a-milestone-for-slop-everywhere/">PC Gamer</a>). "Mix five schools of dark magic, unleash devastating spell synergies, and raise undead armies in this necromantic bullet hell. Infinite builds, solo or co-op – embrace the forbidden and dominate. 100% AI-driven development."</p>
<p>The developer said they started with a prototype "just to see if this was even feasible", and iterated from there.</p>
<p>"Maintaining a consistent art style was tricky, but GPT managed to remember what visual style I liked and kept it consistent across different sessions," he told one commenter. "I just used regular GPT, not the image API. I also couldn't get character animations to work properly, so I went with shader-based wobbling instead.</p>
<p>"First time building something without an engine. Integrating Steam with Electron wasn't as smooth as it is with Unity or Unreal. I tried Tauri first but it doesn't play nice with Steam at all.</p>
<p>"And the most important takeaway: compared to traditional app development, this is way less mentally draining – kind of like giving an exoskeleton to a construction worker lol."</p>
<p>While the game is yet to release, its Steam discussion forums are full with threads entitled "<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/4084120/discussions/0/842866343519723340/">Lmao, this looks like ass</a>", "<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/4084120/discussions/0/842866343519724563/">Garbage AI slop</a>", "<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/4084120/discussions/0/842866343519752152/">Dangerous slippery slope</a>", and "<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/4084120/discussions/0/842866343519717962/">100% AI generated - don't buy and don't support this</a>".</p>
<p>There's only one thread that I could find that was ambivalent about its development, which simply asks: "<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/4084120/discussions/0/842866071372396630/">Why everyone is butthurt about IA [sic] in game development?</a>"</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/aigamedev/comments/1pidb5g/my_first_vibecoded_game_codex_mortis_demo_is_live/">Commenters over on r/aigamedev were a little less hostile</a>, although several responses have been deleted, so make of that what you will.</p>
<p>Those intrigued can try out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4095390/CODEX_MORTIS_Demo/">free Steam demo</a>, although that's currently sitting on a 'Mixed' rating, with one <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/Wraitholme/recommended/4095390/">reviewer</a> writing "The [free] demo is, at least, worth the price".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> just swept at The Game Awards. French studio Sandfall Interactive—the devs behind this stylistic turn-based RPG—set a record for the show winning in nine separate categories including Game of the Year. Want to see what all the fuss is about? Secure yourself an Xbox Series X to play it in beautiful 4K. The full MSRP as of late has been $650 for Xbox’s most elite gaming console. However for a limited time, Amazon is selling it for an 8% discount. This shaves the price down by $50, bringing it to just $600.</p>
<p>Okay, let’s take a quick detour into the Xbox Series X’s price history. Back when the Xbox Series X and Series S first launched in 2020, the former of which was priced at just $500. Back in May, Microsoft announced the company would be increasing the console prices, which raised the Series X by a whole $100 to $600. Then just a couple months back, they did it again—by $50 to $650. This might just be the only console generation to see it’s systems go up in price rather than down. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6384/">So with all that said, this discount does save you $50, by bringing the Xbox consoles back down to it’s Spring and Summer MSRP.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6384/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Xbox Series X vs. Xbox Series S</h2>
<p>When looking at the Xbox Series X next to it’s more affordable counterpart—the Xbox Series S—you’ll find some substantial perks that justifies the price gap. For one, the Xbox Series X can play games in 4K resolutions. Both consoles are capable of running games with fast refresh rates of up to 120fps and support HDR content.</p>
<p>The Series X is also equipped with a disc drive. If you value keeping a physical collection of your games, the the Xbox Series X is the way to go. It’s also good to have at least one Blu-ray player in the house and this console can be that for your home.</p>



<p>Both the Xbox Series X and the Xbox Series S makes use of the Xbox Velocity Architecture. This Microsoft tech is what makes the consoles super-fast load times possible. It also allows support for Quick Resume. This feature allows you to hop back and forth between games without having to close out or restart them. They will suspend your progress and return you right to where you were when you last had on the game. No need to hunt down a save point before shutting down for the day.</p>
<p>Enjoy streaming your favorite TV shows and movies right from the Xbox. You can download all the apps like YouTube, Netflix, HBO Max, or Dropout, and watch supported content in full 4K and HDR.</p>
<p>To get the full experience Xbox has to offer, subscribe to Game Pass Ultimate. This comes with the ability to play multiplayer games over Xbox Live as well as a lengthy catalogue of games to play at your fingertips. It’s Netflix, but for video games. And guess what? The multi-award-winning <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> is part of the Game Pass library. Pop in and see for yourself why its so critically acclaimed.</p>

            <p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's new patch shadow-dropped earlier this week, and Sandfall Interactive sure wasn't kidding when it promised "challenging boss battles for late-game players to overcome within the Endless Tower".</p>
<p>Along with new playable environment Verso's Drafts, localisation efforts, and costumes, Patch 1.5.0 introduced "new boss battles for late-game players to overcome in the Endless Tower", described as "variations of iconic bosses from the main game, designed to be even more challenging". This includes a brutal reimagining of Simon, one of the RPG's hardest bosses.</p>

<p>Almost unbelievably, the Divergent Star version of Simon is even more challenging than his brutal vanilla appearance, and social media is filling up with players who are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/expedition33/comments/1pmh5y4/the_new_dlc_is_incredible_the_new_endless_tower/">stumped</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/expedition33/comments/1pmfxij/ok_so_how_are_we_supposed_to_tackle_this/">shocked</a>, and struggling not just with Simon, but the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/expedition33/comments/1plaela/comment/nttdjz4/">new red ring</a> diving board <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/expedition33/comments/1pmfgxo/33_centimeters_away_from_glory/">challenge</a>, too.</p><p>"I honestly played many games considered 'hard', but this is driving me insane....," said one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/expedition33/comments/1pmf9va/are_dlc_bosses_one_of_the_hardest_in_video_game/">player</a>. "I beated [sic] Simon in expert within 10 tries, then Osquio also in expert on my second attempt. But these 4 bosses in the Endless Tower are something else... I don't think i've ever encountered anything that hard ever, Simon specially."</p>
<p>Another, in a thread entitled <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/expedition33/comments/1pmefqk/this_dlc_thing_is_a_joke/">"This DLC thing is a joke?"</a>, wrote: "I finally 'beat' Osqio after hours upon hours of trying. The last battle took about 1.5h, no joke. And then I mistime a gradient attack at the end and it’s all over? No reserve team, no resurrection? So I’ll have to go through those 1.5h again without failing just to get another chance, and probably fail, the gradient parry again?</p>
<p>"I mean overall this DLC is amazing, but this is something I honestly hate. I won’t give this more tries probably, I don’t have 8 hours to waste to get maybe 5 tries at parrying something that leads to instant death."</p>
<p>The previously revealed expansion to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> is available right now, as announced at The Game Awards.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/forget-samsung-odyssey-alienware-restocks-its-34-curved-gaming-monitor-at-an-all-time-low-after-sellout-2000651038</link>
            <guid>1382893</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="129" data-end="949">If you’ve never spent time using a curved monitor, it’s easy to assume the design is just a marketing trick. I used to think the same until I started gaming on one myself. Once you’re positioned at the ideal distance and angle, the curve subtly pulls you into whatever you’re playing or watching in a way that a flat screen doesn’t quite match. The viewing experience feels more natural as the display envelopes your view. Curved monitors have come down in price over the last several years, so they’re far more accessible additions to gaming setups today. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6383/">A great example is the Alienware 34-inch curved gaming monitor, which is currently 28% off.</a> Although it normally lists for $699 on Amazon, the discount drops it to just $500—leaving you with an extra $199 in your pocket.</p>
<p data-start="993" data-end="1509">Alienware’s 34-inch OLED monitor makes a strong first impression through its sheer size and shape. The ultrawide screen features a 1800R curvature, a design meant to better align with the natural way our eyes perceive the world. We don’t see our surroundings in a flat rectangle; our view is curved and panoramic. That’s why displays like this can make games feel more cinematic and immersive. The curved layout draws your attention toward the center while still keeping peripheral details within comfortable view.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6383/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="993" data-end="1509">Lag-Free Gameplay</h2>
<p data-start="1511" data-end="1948">In terms of performance, the monitor delivers a crisp QHD 1440p resolution, backed by a fast 165 Hz maximum refresh rate. This combination ensures smooth, responsive motion, which is especially valuable in fast-paced games. AMD FreeSync Premium and VESA Adaptive Sync both work to reduce stuttering and eliminate screen tearing for a consistently fluid gaming experience.</p>
<p data-start="1511" data-end="1948">Remarkably, this monitor’s input time i just 0.1ms. You read that right. Not 1ms, but 0.1ms. You kind of don’t realize just what a game changer a good response time is until you’ve experienced it, and this is the industry’s fastest.</p>


<p data-start="1950" data-end="2355">We also know extended screen time can strain your eyes, particularly with bright displays. For long sessions—whether you’re gaming, editing, or working—the Alienware curved monitor includes hardware-driven blue light reduction settings accessible through its onboard console. This helps maintain visual comfort while still delivering rich colors and contrast, so you don’t have to sacrifice image quality.</p>
<p data-start="2357" data-end="2881">Connectivity is another strong point. On the back, you’ll find an HDMI ports and two DisplayPorts, allowing you to connect multiple devices simultaneously. You might use it primarily with your gaming PC, while also keeping something like a Nintendo Switch 2 plugged in and ready. Switching between inputs is seamless, saving you from unplugging cables or rearranging your entire setup. The monitor also includes multiple USB ports for added convenience.</p>
<p data-start="3089" data-end="3252" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6383/">For a limited time, you can pick up the Alienware 34-inch curved gaming monitor for just $500—a strong value for anyone looking to make the best of their gaming experience.</a></p>

            <p>Saber Interactive and Boss Team Games has released a developer diary for the upcoming horror, Clive Barker's Hellraiser: Revival, revealing a little more about what we can expect from the all-new story and its, uh, "mature" themes.</p>
<p>Revealed at last night's 2025 Horror Game Awards, the seven-minute teaser includes an interview with Hellraiser himself, Doug Bradley, who reprises the titular role. In the interview, he revealed that when he heard that a Hellraiser game was on the way, his first thought was: "At last! What kept you?"</p>

<p>As art director Petra Nikolic explained, the game has "a lot of sexual[ly] explicit stuff, and a lot of gore, and a lot of violence", so make sure you aren't next to your kids or your boss before the video clicking above. In fact, game director Emil Esov advises anyone "sensitive" to mature themes should "be wary".</p><p>Esov describes Hellraiser: Revival as a "discomforting and dark story about people with inner voids. It's like a mix between violence and action, all wrapped in leather, flesh, and chains" and said it should appeal to fans of psychological horror and Pinhead himself.</p>
<p>The team also discussed working with noted horror writer Clive Barker, who was keen that the developers "understood the soul" of the work before taking on the game.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/first-ever-hellraiser-game-announced-with-doug-bradley-returning-as-pinhead">The first-ever Hellraiser game – described as a single-player, survival horror action release – was announced in July</a>, with the team behind it all promising the chance to experience the series "like never before". It will deliver a totally new Hellraiser story starring Aidan, who is on a journey to save his girlfriend Sunny from Hell and "the realm of terrors ahead".</p>
<p>"Using the Genesis Configuration puzzle box, unlock dark and mysterious powers as you face dark cultist worshippers, sex-crazed deviants, and infernal monstrosities," the blurb teases. "Arm yourself with various jaw-dropping weapons - some cruel, some strangely fun - but will it be enough to spare you from an eternity of torment?"</p>
<p> Clive Barker's Hellraiser: Revival has no release date at present, but is slated to come to PC via Steam, PS5, and Xbox Series.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[I’m finally beginning to trust Microsoft’s handheld Xbox]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/843010/xbox-ally-x-sleep-battery-drain-two-months-later</link>
            <guid>1382869</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I still wouldn’t buy an Xbox Ally, and I still don’t think the tweaked version of Windows that shipped with it is ready for primetime. The Xbox Full Screen Experience (FSE) needs work. But two months after I <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/799698/xbox-ally-x-review-asus-microsoft-full-screen-experience">panned the cheaper $600 white Xbox Ally and wasn’t quite sold on the $1,000 black one</a>, one of my most-hated Windows issues is getting better.</p><p>I didn’t stop testing these handhelds <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/799698/xbox-ally-x-review-asus-microsoft-full-screen-experience">after my October review</a>; I’ve been playing <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> and <em>Blue Prince</em> on them ever since. I installed FSE on an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/769609/msi-claw-8-ai-plus-intel-review">MSI Claw 8 AI Plus</a>, too. And after too many updates to count, I’m finally beginning to trust two of these handhelds to save my game (and battery life) when I put them to sleep. Even the third isn’t as bad as it was.</p><p>Sleep has been the biggest reason to buy a Steam Deck or a Nintendo Switch over a Windows handheld. For me, it’s the whole point of handheld gaming. If I can pause and resume at any time just by pressing the power button, I can tackle big games five, 10, 20 minutes at a time and actually finish them. It’s a whole different gaming lifestyle when you don’t have to save and quit every session, and when you can just press one button to do it.</p><p>Windows has been <em>terrible</em> at sleep for years, but in December, I haven’t lost my game once with the pricier black Xbox Ally X when trusting it to sleep. I recently left a game open for almost exactly nine full days, and the game was right where I left off when I came back. Battery drain while sleeping seems reasonable, too: I’m only losing 4 to 8 percent of its battery from one day to the next. (I lost 40 percent of the battery during that nine-day span.)</p><p>There are other bugs: Sometimes I don’t have control right away after resuming from sleep; sometimes the Xbox and Asus buttons stop working for a bit when Windows decides to automatically update things in the background. And, after that nine-day stretch, Windows spontaneously decided I had to authenticate and reset my PIN before it’d let me log in.</p><p>Also, the SSD in my colleague Tom Warren’s Xbox Ally X died, so there’s that, but sleep worked reliably for him before then. Assuming the SSD is the drive maker’s fault, the Xbox Ally X is feeling like a product I can live with. (We’ve asked Asus about the SSD.)</p><p>The white vanilla Xbox Ally, with AMD’s Z2 A chip, is a different story. I’ve been testing <em>two</em> of them for months, and even after installing every Windows, Asus, Game Bar, and Xbox App update, including several that claimed to address sleep, I’ve watched both units repeatedly wake up without ever being touched. I’d leave them on my desk all day while I worked and watch them light up all by themselves, draining their batteries in the process.</p><p>On November 19th, I put a black Xbox Ally X and a white Xbox Ally to sleep, side by side, with 96 percent and 93 percent battery, respectively. Thirteen hours later, the white unit was completely dead, while the black unit was still at 91 percent.</p><p>On November 20th, I tried again at 88 percent and 82 percent battery, respectively. Nearly four days later, the white one was dead; the black one had 61 percent left.</p><p>I tried factory resetting one of the white units, and I think something has improved since then. I’ve had many days where my game’s waiting for me when I wake it from sleep. But on December 6th, I found it roasting itself inside my shoulder bag at 10:55AM. Logs showed me it woke itself up around midnight the previous evening and turned off its own screen at around 1AM, but never went back to sleep. Because its screen was off and its fan near silent, I didn’t notice it was still on next morning when I put it in the bag.</p><p>And on December 7th, that same factory-reset, fully updated Xbox Ally mysteriously stopped charging overnight at 54 percent.</p><p>Asus claimed it wasn’t yet able to reproduce my issues. But I’m seeing these problems across two different units, I’ve seen scattered reports elsewhere on the web, and we know that the Xbox Ally’s AMD Z2 A processor fundamentally supports fewer sleep modes than the Xbox Ally X. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/807711/xbox-ally-sleep-fail-bazzite-fix-performance#:~:text=Two%20days%20after%20programmer%20Antheas%20Kapenekakis%20obtained%20the%20hardware%20and%20consulted%20with%20two%20contacts%20at%20AMD%2C%20the%20three%20fixed%20it">Bazzite had to consult with AMD</a> to get sleep working in Linux on the Z2 A chip.</p><p>I’m not sure why Microsoft is taking so long to fix it in Windows, or how complicated the issue might be there. Microsoft didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment, and hasn’t offered me a substantive comment in the past. But I wonder if it might be unique to that Z2 A chip, because I’m not having much trouble with the Intel Lunar Lake inside the MSI Claw 8 AI Plus, either, now that I’ve manually <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/812970/xbox-full-screen-experience-is-worse-on-my-msi-claw-than-it-is-on-the-xbox-ally">updated to a later BIOS that wasn’t showing up</a> when I first tested the Xbox experience there.</p><p>With the Intel Claw 8, a handheld <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/769609/msi-claw-8-ai-plus-intel-review">I originally couldn’t trust to sleep</a>, I now can — and I’ve seen battery drain as little as 2 percent per day while it’s snoozing. I ran into bugs in the Insider Preview, including one black screen and a persistent issue that capped my frame rate at 30fps until I changed power modes, but bugs are to be expected there.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/22960536/steam-deck-faq-valve-one-month-later">It took time for the Steam Deck</a> to be fully baked, and perhaps Microsoft needs some time too. If it’s finally figured out how to put a PC to sleep, and the vanilla Xbox Ally is just one exception, that’ll change the whole conversation around Windows handhelds.</p><p>Even today, the vanilla Xbox Ally may no longer be a bad deal. You can currently find it <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0FM6C3ZMN?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">for $489 at Amazon</a>, or <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.asus.com%2Fus%2Frog-xbox-ally.html" rel="sponsored">$499 at Asus</a>, and just <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.asus.com%2Fus%2Frog-xbox-ally.html" rel="sponsored">install Bazzite instead</a>. Bazzite is more reliable than Windows, has higher performance, and is just all around better in my tests, unless you play games that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/31/24284644/apex-legends-loses-linux-steam-deck-support-anti-cheat">use incompatible anti-cheat software</a> or you’re tightly tied to a library of “Xbox” PC games.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/843010/xbox-ally-x-sleep-battery-drain-two-months-later]]></content:encoded>

              <p>Forza Horizon 5 hit the PlayStation 5 storefront earlier this year. You best dip in to experience one of the best racing games of the generation. And if you want to make the experience extra special, get yourself the right tool to make it feel like you’re really behind the wheel—because you’re really be behind the wheel. A wheel. The Logitech G923 racing wheel and pedals for PlayStation consoles, PC, and Mac is heavily discounted at the moment. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6381/">The pair is normally sold for $400 at Amazon, but right now, it’s been brought down by 30%.</a> That cuts out a whole $130, bringing the price to just $280 for a limited time.</p>
<p>Not on PlayStation yourself? You’re an Xbox kid? Say no more. Amazon also has the same Logitech G923 racing wheel and pedals kit but for Xbox consoles.&nbsp; If you’re on PC, you get your pick of the litter. Either model will work for you. Just decide which you like better. Xbox’s AXYB setup, or PlayStation’s X, square, circle, triangle setup.</p>
<p>This racing kit is designed for ultra-realism. It’s all built out of premium materials. Brushed metal wheel with a hand-stitched black leather cover and polished metal petals.&nbsp; That’s nicer than what the wheel of my actual car looks like.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6381/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Fully Immersive Racing</h2>
<p>You need the weight of a real wheel in your hand to translate to full immersion with your racing game. Your movements are processed by the wheel at 4,000 times per second, ensuring you have the best control over your in-game car, and the provide feedback through the hardware to make it feel like you’re really putting rubber to the pavement. You’ll feel every little bump along the racetrack like you would in the seat of a real race car.</p>
<p>The wheel has a programmable dual clutch, allowing you to kick out of the starting line clean and fast. It simulates a real race car launch assist when playing with games that support it.</p>



<p>The pedals are pressure sensitive, allowing you to brake slowly or immediately like you would driving a real vehicle.</p>
<p>The levels of force feedback and wheel sensitivity is fully customizable. You can make any tweak you need from major to minor right in the Logitech G Hub app, which can be launched with one button press on the controller.</p>
<p>Now, pockets of the gaming community love to get their hands on weird controllers to speed run notoriously difficult games with them. Folks have become Elden Lord on a DDR pad or slain Crota with a Rock Band drum set. Are you one of these gamers? Maybe you can be the first to dethrone Grandmother Silk with a racing wheel and pedal kit. Just got to set your mind to it.</p>
