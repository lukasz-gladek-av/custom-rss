<p>This week has been surprisingly busy, huh? We've had a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/super-mario-galaxy-movie-trailer-reveals-rosalina-bowser-jr-and-more">brand-new trailer</a> for <strong>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong> along with confirmation that Brie Larson and Benny Safdie are joining the cast as Rosalina and Bowser Jr. We also finally received the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> trailer <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/metroid-prime-4-beyond-finally-gets-the-trailer-weve-been-waiting-for">we've been waiting for</a>, while the lovely Alex has provided his thoughts on the game so far in our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/metroid-prime-4-beyond-is-great-but-i-want-to-kill-one-of-its-characters">early preview</a>.</p>
<p>Red Dead Redemption has also been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/its-official-red-dead-redemption-is-coming-to-switch-2-this-december">confirmed for the Switch 2</a>, while Nintendo also launched a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/nintendo-launches-switch-2-backwards-compatibility-search-page">backward compatibility tool</a> in which you can check if your favourite Switch games work correctly on Switch 2. Neat!</p>
<p>Oh, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</a> is a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/pokemon-pokopia-is-nintendos-first-game-key-card-release">Game-Key Card</a>. Have a good one, folks!</p>
<p>Now, with that out of the way, let's see what we're getting up to this weekend...</p>
<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>Still lots of Resident Evil this weekend. I'm playing through <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_5">Resident Evil 5</a> again, which is comfortably one of my least favourite entries. It's still a good time, mind you, if only because the developers basically looked at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_4">Resident Evil 4</a> and said "hey, let's just do that again!". So the basics are solid.</p>
<p>I've been dipping back into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> recently too, and it's really quite fun. I've even grown somewhat fond of free-roam mode. Bonkers.</p>

<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>Well, I finally bit the bullet and bought <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/absolum">Absolum</a>. I hope you’re happy. I know that I certainly won’t be, when I arrive back on Monday morning having spent 15+ hours getting overly emotionally-invested in a fictional frog wizard.</p>
<p>This game looks like it will scratch such an itch for me, so brace for ‘Jim becoming increasingly insufferable’ in the coming days.</p>
<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>The end-of-the-year release rush has begun! This will be my first time with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-2">Yakuza Kiwami 2</a> so I am quite eager to jump back into the streets of Kamurochō. Same applies for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-ball-sparking-zero">Dragon Ball Sparking! Zero</a>. Great progress last week in with both Prometheus and Chronos defeated at long last. But of course Melinöe’s journey is not over yet… and neither is Princess Zelda’s in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a> where I hope to clear Chapter 4 over this weekend.</p>
<p>Game of the week is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/inazuma_eleven_victory_road">Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</a>. I wasn’t quite sure this would ever get out of development hell and despite the lack of physical edition I dived head-first into it. I am rather surprised with the story mode because it is everything a current gen Pokémon game should be. Of course the over-the-top “Captain Tsubasa” style football (“soccer” for our American readers in the audience) action is where its at! Well played Level-5!</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-server-capacity-tripled-for-launch/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlestate-games-has-tripled-escape-from-tarkov%E2%80%99s-server-capacity-ahead-of-1-0-release.1354528/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>One of the biggest issues that plagues Escape from Tarkov players every time there’s a new update is server queues. The game suffers under the weight of incoming players, and those same players feel that burn. From lengthy queue times to network instability, Tarkov’s servers often crumble around a wipe or new major update.</p>



<p>Battlestate Games has well and truly prepared for that ahead of the game’s 1.0 release, dropping later today. In an episode of Tarkov TV, Nikita Buyanov, the head of the studio, confirmed that Escape from Tarkov’s server capacity has been <strong>tripled </strong>ahead of the release.</p>







<h2 id="h-tarkov-s-major-networking-issues-eliminated">Tarkov’s Major Networking Issues Eliminated</h2>



<p>It’s a huge time for Escape from Tarkov. The game is finally graduating from the beta state it has sat in for almost eight years, becoming a full release and landing on Steam, amongst other things. The super-sized update introduces a new map, a non-linear campaign, fresh weapons, and more than 1,000 bug fixes.</p>



<p>In the most recent episode <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/battlestategames" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">of Tarkov TV</a>, Nikita also confirmed that a huge investment has been made in the game’s server capacity and infrastructure, and that the server makeup has been <strong>tripled </strong>ahead of launch.</p>



<p>This was preceded by a tongue-in-cheek reference by Nikita that begged players not to ‘overload their servers, please.’</p>







<p>Every time a major update has hit the Escape from Tarkov ecosystem, it has led to massive server queues and instability, placated only by users inevitably drifting away because of those issues.</p>



<p>The 1.0 update of Escape from Tarkov arrives after more than a decade of development, which has seen the face of the spearhead extraction shooter evolve numerous times.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Mark Rubin Said Ubisoft Did NOT Cancel Splinter Cell to Make XDefiant]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/mark-rubin-splinter-cell-ubisoft-xdefiant/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mark-rubin-said-ubisoft-did-not-cancel-splinter-cell-to-make-xdefiant.1354525/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a recent interview, it was suggested that Ubisoft was working on a new Splinter Cell game that was canceled before it saw the light of day. This tidbit came from Nick Herman, the co-founder of AdHoc Studio, the creator of the recent title ‘Dispatch’, starring Aaron Paul. Herman stressed that he left Ubisoft after the project was canceled and opened a new studio, AdHoc, in 2018.</p>



<p>However, Mark Rubin, who is best known as the executive producer on the failed arena shooter, XDefiant, took to social media to refute claims that his team was making Splinter Cell and was ordered to pivot and focus instead on XDefiant.</p>







<h2 id="h-splinter-cell-did-not-become-xdefiant">Splinter Cell Did Not Become XDefiant</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, Mark Rubin stressed that a recent rumor published first by Bloomberg is <strong>not true</strong>. This rumor suggests that Ubisoft was working on Splinter Cell but ‘switched’ to XDefiant. Rubin categorically denies that it was the case, stating that they were working on a game for a year, but the team was ‘struggling to find the fun.’</p>



<p>He then pushed the point again that it ‘was NOT a Splinter Cell game.’</p>



<p>Here’s the <a href="https://x.com/PixelsofMark/status/1989545807247487122" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full quote</a> from Rubin:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Saw the rumor from Bloomberg that we were working on Splinter Cell game before switching to XDefiant. I can say that is not true.</p>



<p>When I got to Ubisoft they had been working on a game for a year that was very ambitious but was struggling to find the fun. And it was NOT a Splinter Cell game. </p>



<p>I then canceled that one and let the team pitch any game ideas they wanted. There were some cool ones but I felt the scope/difficulty was too hard on some ideas so we stuck with an arena shooter and we found the fun quickly. </p>



<p>So no we didn’t pivot off Splinter Cell to make XDefiant. Now maybe they were thinking about working on Splinter Cell before I got there but it was never a thing while I was there. My experience with Ubisoft was they are very open to whatever the studio wants to do which is great but I do wish we could have used external engines.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-splinter-cell-ubisoft-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent claim from Nick Herman</a>, co-founder of AdHoc Studios, was that Ubisoft ‘stopped caring about’ the game the team was working on. Herman would leave around a year before Mark Rubin arrived in 2019.</p>







<p>Ubisoft is still working on a remake of the original Splinter Cell title, which is working with a reported release window of 2026.</p>



<p>Do you wish we’d gotten a new Splinter Cell game in the last ten years or so? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

			<p>Valve fans had a field day <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-unveils-steam-frame-steam-machine-steam-controller-launch-early-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with the announcements of the Steam Frame, Steam Machine, and Steam Controller</a>, with the notable exception of those who have been pining for Half-Life 3.</p>



<p>The near-mythological third (and <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-last-entry-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">supposedly final</a>) installment in the sci-fi first-person shooter franchise was still nowhere to be mentioned by Valve, but that doesn't mean it's not coming. In fact, several insiders have doubled down to reiterate that a dedicated game announcement is on its way in relatively short order.</p>



<p>What they do not quite agree on is the timing of the news. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HalfLife/comments/1ox4jzk/more_hopium/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to Gabe Follower</a>, a Counter-Strike 2 content creator who correctly leaked information on Deadlock (the studio's next third-person multiplayer shooter/MOBA game in early development), Half-Life 3, codenamed HLX, will still be announced before the end of the year. Another Valve insider, Tyler McVicker, who leaked some Half-Life: Alyx details, maintained <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2618496266" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a Twitch stream</a> that he expects the news to drop within the next two to three weeks.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/uwn_XYk8Is8?si=51br6QSKysH8bA3f&amp;t=2122" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">On the latest episode of Insider Gaming Weekly</a>, though, the resident insiders shared a different opinion based on their own sources. Mike Straw, who previously mentioned the hardware announcements weren't all Valve had to unveil, said this particular news will not be made official during Geoff Keighley's The Game Awards 2025 event next month.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming founder and renowned leaker Tom Henderson added that he heard there's a big (currently unannounced) game coming in March. With the Steam Machine/Frame/Controller scheduled to launch in early 2026, it makes sense that Half-Life 3 would be a launch title, especially for the new Steam Machine.</p>



<p>After all, Valve publicly <a href="https://wccftech.com/bigger-game-catalogue-steam-machine-success/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> that it believes having more games will be key to the success of the Steam Machine compared to its previous iteration. While they were mainly referring to the massive Steam library, new launches of gaming platforms have benefited from having the so-called killer application since time immemorial in this industry. If Half-Life 3 were only available on Steam platforms, it'd mean the only console-like platform able to play it would be the Steam Machine, thus undoubtedly boosting its initial sales.</p>

<p>Use these Warframe monthly redeem codes for November 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Weapons, Decorations, Glyphs, and much more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Warframe is a popular third-person online shooter set in a different solar system known as the Origin system. Having originally been released on both PC as well as console in 2013, Warframe has since captured the imaginations of thousands of gamers, with a dedicated player community existing even today. It received ports for the latest generation of consoles in the last few years, and even got an iOS version in 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Being a fully free-to-play game, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warframes-switch-2-port-delayed-by-backlog-of-dev-kits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warframe</a> boasts solid accessibility, with the fast-paced gameplay and combat experience also being praised by passionate fans over the years. Although Warframe, like most F2P games nowadays, does offer microtransactions, all of the key elements of the game can be earned by simply playing and progressing through the various modes and events. Some cosmetic items can even be claimed for free by players, using the various redeem codes that the developers release.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A lawsuit between Bungie and writer Matthew Martineau has been settled. The case, which revolved around possible copyright violations of Destiny 2 from Martineau’s work, has been going on for around a year.</p>







<p>Destiny 2 is one of Bungie’s biggest and most recent games, released in 2017. With several expansions, the free-to-play title is still going <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-confirms-new-details-on-bungie-restructuring-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">somewhat strong</a>. However, last year, a writer named Matthew Martineau <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-being-sued-for-copyright-infringement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed a lawsuit</a> against Bungie for possible copyright infringement. His claim was that the company stole various narrative elements from his work for the Red Legion plot and The Curse of Osiris expansion. Surprisingly, the case survived Bungie’s dismissal and was on its way to court. Now, it seems it has been settled and over with.</p>

<p>Obtained by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/destiny-2-red-war-lawsuit-ends-bungie-full-settlement-author/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Game Post</a>, the lawsuit between Bungie and Matthew Martineau has been settled. The case has been dismissed and will not go to court. In a statement from the court filing, it says,</p>



<p>“The court having been advised that all parties have firmly agreed upon a compromise in this matter; it is ordered that this action be and is hereby dismissed as to all parties, without costs and without prejudice to the right, upon good cause shown, within sixty days, to reopen the action if the settlement is not consummated,” the order reads. “In addition, the court specifically retains jurisdiction to enforce the settlement agreement if settlement is not consummated within sixty days.”</p>



<p>However, if the settlement is not completed in 60 days, the case will go to trial. As it stands, though, a compromise has been made, and no legal action will occur. Without speculation, a settlement usually means both parties are at fault.</p>



<p>While the claims made by Matthew Martineau do seem a bit much, Bungie isn’t a stranger to copyright infringements. During the alpha of Marathon, the company was caught <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-respond-art-theft-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stealing assets</a> from artist ANTIREAL for several designs. After the controversy, the game was delayed and has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-bungie-befre-march-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">yet to be released</a>.&nbsp;</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-zombies-review-in-progress.1354465/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Note: This review specifically covers the Zombies mode in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. For our thoughts on the other modes, see our </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-review"><em>campaign review</em></a><em> or our </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-multiplayer-review"><em>multiplayer review</em></a><em>.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite playing a new one every year, I never know what to make of modern Call of Duty – a first-person shooter so big, so successful that it is no longer a standalone game but a platform with file sizes so large it asks you to choose the other two things you’d like to have installed on your PC or console. This year’s PC release comes with a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/How_to_Enable_Secure_Boot_on_PC_for_BO7"><u>frustrating new anti-cheat</u></a> that seemingly caused my CPU fan to choose death instead, so while I would normally base my playtime on that version, as God intended, I am initially slumming it on PlayStation 5 to bring you some early impressions of this year’s Zombies mode. I still have tons left to see as the community collectively hunts for Easter eggs and solves mysteries, but so far I’m interested in digging into what’s here, even if it may take a bit to get to the vital organs underneath these bones.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zombies is my favorite part of Call of Duty, simultaneously the stupidest, silliest side thing the series has ever done and probably big enough to be a small video game in its own right. I remarked on a similar feeling in last year's review, but remember when this was a serious game series about war, and you were storming the beaches of Normandy, machine gun fire spraying sand in your face? When you died, you used to get quotes about how terrible war was from men who had lived it. Now, I play roulette on a big mystery box covered with skulls for weapons, the best of which is a ray gun, so I can shoot zombies in the face while a disembodied voice who calls himself the Warden taunts me from afar; my character quips about how said voice reminds him of his high school gym teacher. Zombies has been doing this for a while now, but I still don’t know whether to laugh or weep.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is allegedly a story here – Raul Menendez, who apparently has been alive and drinking beer on his porch for the last decade, is back and threatening to cause chaos the world over, there’s a shady security company somehow involved, and massive, violent zombie death, of course. All of it is very well-produced and so goofy that the only thing I could do was watch the introductory cutscene while emulating the face that I imagine a cow would make if you gave it cocaine, chuckle a little, and get on with it. I suppose I answered my own question there, huh?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This year’s Zombies is hard to get a handle on so far because so much of what Zombies does will come down to the community working out the new maps in the coming days and perhaps weeks. Right now, we’re all kind of bumbling about, figuring out what’s what, which is simultaneously fun and frustrating. Many of the pain points from last year remain early on – for instance, you can’t make your loadout until you hit level four, which means if Zombies is all you want to do (and for me, it is), you’re stuck with a pistol and whatever you can earn by buying stuff on the walls after you’ve dispatched enough undead. Remember when games just let you have fun from the outset instead of unlocking it?</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I still love sliding at a group of zombies and firing a shotgun until they’re paste.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Otherwise, the underpinnings of Zombies feel much the same. You’re on a map, you open up new doors and paths with currency you earn, and you’ve got Pack-a-Punch machines to upgrade your guns. There’s additional armor you can apply plastered to the walls, an Arsenal to really crank up specific aspects of your weapons, Gobblegums for a little flavor if your mouth is lonely and you want a mid-battle pick-me-up, and so on. And of course, while you’re managing all of this, the undead rise and hunger for flesh. Ghouls, man. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The gameplay here is similar to last year’s – I still love sliding at a group of zombies and firing off a shotgun until they’re just paste and all that. No, what’s new are the maps. I’ve played both maps in their round-based modes, Ashes of the Damned and Vandorn Farm (the latter seems to be a part of the former, but I haven’t reached it in the standard mode yet), and so far I prefer the farm. Ashes of the Damned seems to be home to what will be the more traditional “find the secrets to finish the map” fare, while Vandorn Farm is more of a “you’re locked in here with the undead, kid, so try not to die too much” deal.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Our run on the former ended when one of my teammates, who didn’t communicate with the rest of us, grabbed a truck and started driving it to the next objective… before he decided it might be more fun to smash into the zombies until it exploded. The rest of us spent most of the map either trying to catch up to the truck or waiting in vain to be revived after we all died. It went about as well as you’d think. I’m interested in seeing what Ashes of the Damned has to offer with a more talkative crew; right now, if you’d told me I’d hallucinated the whole thing, I’d believe you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The farm is more old-school. Zombies hang from the rafters in the big barn, the smaller one houses the Mystery Box where each of my teammates made offerings in the fleeting hope of a Ray Gun, and there was a house with a skeleton family sitting at the dinner table and a roof in desperate need of, well, more roof. It was a much more interesting map than Ashes of the Damned, and I enjoyed navigating its twists and turns, learning where everything was, and spending the in-between time killing the misbegotten horrors that were formerly people.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>As is usually the case, success will largely depend on how the maps shake out.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The problem, once again, was that we couldn’t figure out what to do yet. There was some mysterious infection growing on one of the machines that seemed to power the farm, but after we destroyed it, our objective told us to wait for it to come back. So we did, killing zombies and upping the round count. The issue is the infection never did reappear. Normally, this is a good thing. The antibiotics worked and the patient is recovering well, thank you. In this case, it meant we got to round eight, nothing happened, the four of us spent several minutes looking for any zombies we somehow missed or a way to progress, and then all three of my teammates left the game after we couldn’t figure out what came next. Hard to blame them. The farm’s cool, but I'd prefer something with some warmer colors and fewer rotting corpses, you know?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like I said, I’m never sure what to make of Call of Duty, and that extends to this year’s Zombies. It certainly plays well and you can see the absurd amount of money spent to develop it on-screen – but the ooey, gooey, juicy parts of the mode haven’t revealed themselves to me quite yet. As is usually the case, its success will largely depend on how the maps shake out. I’ll need a bonesaw and a ribspreader to get to the still-beating heart of this thing, but that’s fine. I can’t say I’m not interested in seeing what’s in there. I just hope I don’t get anything on me in the process.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-zombies-review]]></content:encoded>

              <p>Apple products have long carried a premium price tag that puts them out of reach for many shoppers, forcing budget-conscious buyers toward mid-range Windows laptops instead. The landscape shifts dramatically this Black Friday as Amazon drops<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5068/"> the 2025 MacBook Air with M4 chip and 256GB SSD storage to $749, slashed from its regular $999 price</a>. This 25% discount is an <strong>all-time low that arrived on Friday</strong>, November 14th, and makes Apple’s latest-generation laptop accessible at the same price point as solid mid-range Windows alternatives. Apple famously avoids Black Friday sales in its own retail stores which means you need to check authorized retailers like Amazon to catch these deals when they surface.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5068/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>M4 Performance That Redefines Ultraportable Computing</h2>
<p>The M4 chip provides a significant performance jump over previous MacBook Airs due to the improved architecture of the CPU and GPU that handle demanding workloads with ease. The eight-core CPU splits into performance and efficiency cores, with the system apportioning intensive tasks to high-power cores and routing background processes to power-sipping efficient cores.</p>



<p>The 16GB of unified memory is a significant boost compared to the base configuration of 8GB that shipped with previous models, offering plenty of RAM overhead for professional applications and serious multitasking. Unified memory architecture means the CPU and GPU share one pool of memory, averting the data transfer bottlenecks inherent in systems where graphics processors must copy data from system RAM into dedicated video memory.</p>



<p>Storage comes by way of a 256GB SSD, providing ample room for the operating system, essential applications, and working files; however, heavy media creators or users with considerable local storage needs may want to look into external storage options. The SSD uses Apple’s custom controllers, which have a read speed of over 2,000MB/s, making the MacBook Air launch applications instantly and transfer large files in seconds.</p>
<p>The <strong>Liquid Retina display is 13.6 inches with a resolution of 2560×1664 and a support for one billion colors</strong> for excellent color accuracy and detail that is rivaled only by displays on much more expensive professional laptops. It will automatically adjust the white balance using True Tone technology if the ambient lighting changes. This reduces eye strain during marathon work sessions since color temperature is consistently maintained independent of your surroundings.</p>
<p><strong>Apple Intelligence integration brings AI-powered writing assistance</strong>, content generation and automation of tasks right into macOS through on-device processing that keeps your data private. This personal intelligence system helps in drafting emails, summarizing documents, generating images, and organizing information-all without sending your data to cloud servers.</p>



<p><strong>Battery life reaches up to 18 hours of mixed use</strong> which translates to full workdays without hunting for power outlets or carrying charging cables. This endurance comes from the efficiency of Apple Silicon combined with macOS optimization that manages background processes aggressively. The laptop delivers consistent performance whether plugged in or running on battery, unlike many Windows laptops, which throttle performance significantly when unplugged as a means of preserving battery life.</p>
<p>At $749, this MacBook Air is cheaper than many premium Windows ultrabooks.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-drops-its-first-major-black-friday-deal-on-a-power-station-now-selling-for-pennies-at-1500w-output.1354420/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Power outages leave you sitting in the dark with dead phones and spoiling food in the fridge while camping trips often mean sacrificing modern conveniences or lugging noisy generators. Jackery’s Explorer 1000 portable power station solves both problems by <strong>delivering 1,500W of clean and quiet power</strong> that runs refrigerators, charges laptops and keeps essential devices operational wherever you need electricity. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3722/">has slashed the price to $349 from the usual $699 for Black Friday, which marks an all-time low that undercuts even Prime Day pricing</a>. This 50% discount makes backup power accessible at a price point where you’d normally find much smaller capacity units with limited output capabilities.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3722/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Serious Power Output in a Portable Package</h2>
<p>The <strong>1,500W of continuous AC output</strong> tackles demanding appliances that smaller power stations can’t touch: air conditioners, full-size refrigerators, electric kettles, and power tools. The <strong>3,000W surge peak</strong> covers the inrush of power at startup for appliances with motors, which generally requires two to three times the running wattage for a brief moment. That surge capacity means you can cold-start a refrigerator or air conditioner without tripping the protection circuits on the power station-a problem that frequently occurs with underpowered portable generators.</p>
<p>The battery capacity, <strong>1,070Wh</strong>, translates to approximately 1.07 kilowatt-hours of stored energy-sufficient to keep an average refrigerator running for about 12 to 15 hours, charge a laptop eight to ten times, or run LED lights for days. This capacity sits in the sweet spot between smaller units that drain too quickly and larger systems that become impractical to move around. At <strong>just 23.8 pounds</strong> with a foldable handle, the power station remains genuinely portable rather than being a stationary unit that requires two people to relocate.</p>



<p>Jackery fitted this model with LiFePO4 battery chemistry instead of the more conventional lithium-ion, which grants it much better longevity and safety characteristics. The LiFePO4 cells retain more than 70% of their original capacity after 4,000 charge cycles, which equates to well over a decade of regular use before you’d notice significant capacity degradation.</p>



<p><strong>The capability for one-hour fast charging</strong> requires the emergency charging mode, which can be turned on via the Jackery app and will push this power station from empty to full in sixty minutes when you need a quick turnaround. The default for the system is a 1.7-hour charging mode that optimizes battery health by reducing stress on the cells during charging, adding to the long lifespan.</p>
<p>Port selection largely covers most device types: <strong>two USB-C ports providing 100W each, one USB-A port, one DC car port, and three pure sine wave AC outlets</strong>. The 100W USB-C ports can charge modern laptops at full speed with no need for bulky power adapters, while pure sine wave AC output safely powers sensitive electronics like medical devices or audio equipment that can be damaged by modified sine wave inverters found in cheaper units.</p>
<p>For sale at $349, this power station is half its regular price and brings with it capabilities that easily command between $600 to $800 in today’s market.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[This HP Laptop with Serious Specs (Ryzen 7, 1TB SSD, 32GB) Is Down $2,200, Now 73% Off on Amazon]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-hp-laptop-with-serious-specs-ryzen-7-1tb-ssd-32gb-is-2200-off-but-hp-is-keeping-it-quiet-on-amazon-2000644474</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-hp-laptop-with-serious-specs-ryzen-7-1tb-ssd-32gb-is-down-2-200-now-73-off-on-amazon.1354396/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Budget laptops usually force you to compromise on something important whether that’s skimping on RAM, settling for slow storage or accepting some dim screen that strains your eyes. <strong>HP’s 2025 laptop breaks that pattern by packing 32GB of RAM, a 1TB SSD, and an AMD Ryzen 7 7730U</strong> processor into a package that Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5596/">currently offers for $799, slashed from the typical $2,999 price</a>. This 73% discount is an all-time low and brings professional-grade specifications to a price point where you’d normally find an entry-level machine with half the memory and storage.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5596/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Professional Workloads</h2>
<p>The base frequency of the AMD Ryzen 7 7730U is 2 GHz with <strong>up to 4.5 GHz turbo, 8 cores, and 16 threads for powerful computing</strong> that will make short work of even the most demanding applications. This multi-core architecture is great for running parallel workloads such as video encoding, 3D rendering, or virtual machines. With 16 threads, the processor can support twice as many simultaneous operations as it has physical cores, meaning smoother multitasking when you’re working with dozens of open browser tabs along with office and productivity programs in addition to background applications.</p>



<p>The 32GB of high-speed RAM includes generous headroom for memory-intensive workflows that would choke on the 8GB or 16GB found in most budget laptops. Professional software like Adobe Creative Suite, statistical analysis tools, or development environments utilizing multiple running containers all benefit from this expanded memory capacity. You can keep numerous applications active simultaneously without experiencing the slowdowns that occur when systems run out of physical RAM and resort to slower disk-based virtual memory.</p>



<p>Storage comes via a 1TB PCIe SSD which affords rapid boot times and near-instant application launches compared to traditional hard drives or even older SATA SSDs. PCIe solid-state drives connect directly to the motherboard through high-speed lanes that enable transfer rates often exceeding 3,000MB/s, meaning large file operations complete quickly rather than devolve into progress bar watching sessions.</p>
<p>The <strong>display is a 15.6-inch FHD touchscreen that operates at 1920×1080 with IPS technology</strong> so colors are accurate and viewing angles are wide. The micro-edge design minimizes the bezels around the screen to create a more immersive viewing experience and makes it feel larger than its actual diagonal measurement. Touch functionality adds another input method that feels natural for certain tasks like scrolling through long documents, zooming into images, or interacting with the touch-optimized interface elements under Windows 11.</p>
<p>For $799, this laptop is priced lower than many mid-range options, yet has specs typical of laptops costing between $1,500 and $2,000. The 73% discount places it in the unusual position of actually getting you legitimately premium components at budget pricing, not the other way around, where you pay premium prices for budget hardware.</p>

Our creative process continues to be led by the talented individuals in our studios."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's worth pointing out that the Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Steam page also includes the following disclaimer: "Our team uses generative AI tools to help develop some in game assets." Not exactly descriptive!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This isn't the first time Call of Duty has come under fire for this, either. This <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-finally-admits-it-uses-generative-ai-for-some-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-assets-after-backlash-following-ai-slop-zombie-santa-loading-screen">exact scenario played out back in February</a>, when Activision admitted that it had used generative AI in the development of Black Ops 6, including in a zombie Santa loading screen that angry fans referred to as "AI slop."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-dev-responds-to-generative-ai-backlash-not-replace-but-streamline">just this past August</a>, Black Ops 7 associate creative director Miles Leslie clarified the team's stance on the technology further:</p><blockquote>“We live in a world now, where there are AI tools. I think our official statement we said last year, around Black Ops 6, is that everything that goes into the game is touched by the team a hundred percent. We have generative AI tools to help us, but none of that goes in-game.</blockquote><blockquote>"And then you're going to say, ‘Yeah, but it has.' I'll say it has by accident. And that was never the intention. We've come out and been very clear that we use these as tools to help the team, but they do not replace any of the fantastic team members we have that are doing the final touches and building that content to put it in the game.</blockquote><blockquote>“So everything you play: human-created and touched. AI tools in the world we live in: it's how do we streamline it? That's really the goal. Not replace, but streamline.”</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">In response, IGN asked why the zombie Santa and other generative AI images hadn't been removed from the game yet, to which Leslie said that was not his department, and that "the team is actively looking at that stuff." It is unclear if, why, or how Activision's stance on this has changed over time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is out now. We've given the campaign a try and aren't totally crazy about it, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-review">with our reviewer saying</a> it's " a wild one thanks to the scope of its ambition, but the big swings it takes don't always land, leaving it an uneven step down from last year."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">We've just gotten a look at a brand new poster for The Super Mario Galaxy Movie, and it's giving off big...Super Mario Odyssey vibes?</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/14/mog-tsrsheet4-pyramid-rgb-1-1763159409909.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The new poster, released today, shows Mario and Luigi standing in what is unmistakably Super Mario Odyssey's Sand Kingdom, complete with the Inverted Pyramid, the buildings of Tostarena, and the Day of the Dead-inspired Tostarenans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We did know that the Sand Kingdom would feature in The Super Mario Galaxy Movie in some way, as we saw it briefly in the trailer revealed earlier this week. In a brief shot, we saw Mario and Luigi riding motorcycles across the desert in the outfits they're wearing above, before shooting off a sand dune and revealing the same Inverted Pyramid in a valley below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, at the time, that just seemed like one piece of a larger montage of areas the brothers might visit during their adventures across the galaxy. Dedicating an entire poster to it prompts questions as to whether or not The Super Mario Galaxy Movie might significantly feature components of Super Mario Odyssey's story. Will we see more kingdoms? Perhaps Cappy?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, both The Super Mario Bros. Movie and what we know of this new sequel do play fast and loose with what Mario games they borrow from. The Super Mario Bros. Movie was full of references and didn't really follow the loose plot (such as they are) of any game in particular, and we already know The Super Mario Galaxy Movie will feature Bowser Jr. as a prominent villain, complete with his Super Mario Sunshine paintbrush. We even <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/everything-we-spotted-in-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-trailer">suspect he's using Wonder abilities from Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a>!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-super-mario-galaxy-movies-rosalina-will-be-voiced-by-brie-larson">latest trailer for The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</a> gave us a ton of new info on the film, including two new actors joining the cast: Brie Larson as Rosalina, and Benny Safdie as Bowser Jr. Still <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/latest-super-mario-galaxy-leak-comes-from-pillsbury-cookies-offers-our-best-look-yet-at-yoshi-and-all-but-confirms-two-more-fan-favorite-characters">waiting to get a look at Yoshi in action</a>, though.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Super Mario Galaxy Movie hits theaters on April 3, 2026 in the U.S.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

                <p>Earlier this week, Embark Studios debuted <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a>' first major update, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/everything-new-in-arc-raiders-north-line-update-full-details/1100-6536145/" data-ref-id="1100-6536145">North Line</a>. It includes a new map called Stella Montis, which was locked behind a community event that had to be finished first. However, Arc Raiders players didn't waste any time and unlocked Stella Montis in under 38 hours.</p><p>To reach Stella Montis--a map located in the "cold pristine" part of the Rust Belt, players had to donate a sizable amount of resources to tunnel through to that location. On <a href="https://discord.com/invite/arcraiders" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Discord</a>, Embark noted that it raised the requirements to enter Stella Montis because players were being more generous with resources than the studio anticipated. Despite that, players still powered through the goal.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> ARC Raiders - Stella Montis | New Map Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Now that Stella Montis is open for exploration, players can visit the map and start earning XP there. The map's description calls the ruins in the map "eerily pristine," as well as "cold, sterile, and steeped in mystery." There are ARC enemies to battle there, and two new types have joined the game: The Matriarch and the Shredder.</p><p>In addition to the Stella Montis quests, players can get a new energy burst battle rifle, as well as a trio of quick-use items: an impulse mine, a timed mine, and a gas jump mine. The game is also introducing two new playstyles, Lone Wolf and Trailblazer.</p><p>Last weekend, Arc Raiders set a new benchmark for itself with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-is-on-an-upward-arc-surpassing-helldivers-2-all-time-peak-concurrent-players-on-steam/1100-6536086/" data-ref-id="1100-6536086">462,488 concurrent players on Steam</a>. That's a record for an extraction shooter. It also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-reportedly-hits-a-major-sales-milestone-as-player-numbers-stay-strong/1100-6536011/" data-ref-id="1100-6536011">sold 2.5 million copies</a> in its first week alone. However, the game has come under fire <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-sparks-debate-over-ai-voice-acting-in-games/1100-6536146/" data-ref-id="1100-6536146">for using AI voice actors</a>.</p>

Over time, the Splinter Cell project transformed into what would become xDefiant, a free-to-play first-person shooter that launched to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xdefiant-review">middling reviews</a> last year and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-is-discontinuing-xdefiant-in-2025-new-purchases-disabled">shut down just this past June, taking two entire studios with it</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The trio eventually reunited with Michael Choung, another former colleague from Telltale, to start AdHoc Studio in 2018. While working on a version of what would eventually become Dispatch, they also took on a scriptwriting co-dev gig on The Wolf Among Us 2, only to pull out of the project after writing an 800-page script due to frustrations with a lack of creative control. That project, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/telltale-games-has-allegedly-laid-off-most-of-its-workers">last we heard of it</a>, seemed similarly ill-fated.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Eventually, though, the group was able to pull together the final version of Dispatch with the support of both a publisher and a number of well-known actors thanks to casting director Linda Lamontagne. A last-minute deal with Critical Role for another game helped get them across the finish line.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Splinter Cell, fans remain bereft of a new game, with the last new Splinter Cell title being Blacklist from way, way back in 2013. There's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-shares-very-early-look-at-splinter-cell-remake">allegedly a remake of the original 2002 game in the works</a>, but Ubisoft has been so quiet about it since 2022 that it's hard to say whether or not it will ever fully emerge.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dispatch, meanwhile, is excellent. We're <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dispatch-review">working on a review in progress</a> as each episode comes out, but you can read our thoughts on the first two episodes here for now, where our reviewer says they're "totally enthralled in this world, and I’m keen to get tangled up in Robert’s fractured personal life."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>The Edge of Fate</em> was supposed to be a bold new foundation for <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-bungie-marathon-destiny-2-acquisition-fiscal-2000642935"><em>Destiny 2</em>‘s future</a>. Instead, it was the beginning of the decade-old sci-fi shooter’s most disappointing stretch yet. Back in September, Bungie promised a roadmap laying out the vision for the live-service MMO in the year ahead. Two months later, the plans are still in flux. Bungie now says it won’t be ready to reveal what <em>Destiny 2</em> looks like moving forward until early 2026. In the meantime, it’s scrambling to engineer a 180 with its upcoming <em>Star Wars </em>expansion.</p> <p>“As we continue to act on your feedback, we’re taking additional time to craft our long-term strategy for the future of <em>Destiny</em> before we share a full State of the Game and multi-year roadmap next year,” the studio revealed this week. It treated fans to what it’s called a new “Content Calendar” instead. No big ideas. No major overhauls. But it did preview everything fans can expect from the <a href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-star-wars-renegades-lightsaber-x-wing-ash-iron-2000624489">December 2 <em>Renegades</em> expansion</a> and its first significant update.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Destiny 2: Renegades Content Calendar has been published.</p> <p>We need more time for the roadmap, plain and simple. Expect a true Roadmap, and State of the Game, next year.</p> <p>Again, many apologies. <a href="https://t.co/fw9R49MriX">https://t.co/fw9R49MriX</a> <a href="https://t.co/eKkSURkpjE">pic.twitter.com/eKkSURkpjE</a></p> <p>— dmg04 (@A_dmg04) <a href="https://twitter.com/A_dmg04/status/1989091556884889623?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 13, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The big takeaways? All players will be able to hit the new Power cap just by playing <em>Renegades</em> activities, vault capacity will go up to 1,000 slots to accommodate all the new loot, and all Exotic Armor ornaments can now be swapped between gear of the same class and slot, giving a big boost to <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s fashion meta. The seasonal Dawning, Iron Banner, and Call to Arms events will also be returning. Any lapsed players probably have no idea what to make of Bungie saying stuff like “Vanguard Alerts will bring back some Nightfall vibes,” but long story short: <em>Renegades</em> should hopefully cut a lot of the grindy bullshit <a href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-edge-fate-matterspark-kelper-metroid-ball-1851786415">fans faced in <em>Edge of Fate</em> back in July</a>.</p>

 <p>Here’s Bungie’s brief postmortem on what feels like <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s least played, most panned expansion since launch:</p> <blockquote><p>With <em>Edge of Fate,</em> we presented a different vision for the future of <em>Destiny 2</em>’s core game. One intended to refocus our releases and player call-to-action on a familiar but deeper pursuit of Power and ascending to higher Tiers of gear across a wider range of activities supporting customizable challenge and commensurate rewards.</p> <p>Very quickly, the feedback made it clear that this was the wrong path for <em>Destiny</em>.</p> <p>Even if our execution had been perfect, and we see plainly that it was not, it is clear that grinding Power will never be a substitute for earning a trophy. Climbing though throwaway tiers en-route to the gear you want to build around isn’t aspirational. And the Portal itself surrenders too much of <em>Destiny</em>’s feeling of place and exploration. These lessons, and many others besides them, have been taken to heart by our team over the last three months.</p></blockquote> <p>I have no doubt that <a href="https://kotaku.com/bungie-destiny-2-sony-final-shape-playstation-1851077097">Bungie has taken</a> all of the negative feedback to heart. I imagine this has probably been one of the toughest stretches, purely in terms of morale, in the game’s post-launch life. But it remains to be seen if the studio can still engineer a way out of <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s 2025 nosedive. The challenge, as ever, is in how you make doing the same stuff over and over again still feel fresh more than a decade later. Maybe you can’t. Or maybe<em> Destiny 2</em> just needs a humble back-to-basics reboot, at least for its progression and weekly grind. I’m still rooting for it.</p>

                <p>The Unexpected Initiative quest in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> sends you to the Buried City map in search of Fertilizer and a Water Pump. You'll need to visit two separate--though thankfully close by--locations to interact with and loot these items, so you may be here wanting to know precisely where. You're in luck because we're going to fill you in.</p><p>Note that the game will provide both Fertilizer and a Water Pump to you as part of this quest, but you can also find these in other places and turn them in from your own stash if you prefer. However, since the quest has to be done in a single Buried City raid to count, you do still have to visit both locations and loot them to check off the objectives either way. Either way, it's a good idea to bring in an augment with two safe pockets so that you keep both the Fertilizer and Water Pump you find, even if you don't manage to extract safely.</p><p>Let's dive into where to find the Fertilizer and Water Pump for the Unexpected Initiatives quest.</p><h2>Where to find Fertilizer at the Grandioso Apartments</h2><p>The Grandioso Apartments are located on the western side of the Buried City map. This is a large residential POI that is commonly visited by other raiders for its above-average loot. Keep an eye out for suspicious folks and be ready for a fight if absolutely necessary.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4602689-share_20251114_0831100.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4602689" data-ratio="0.56276686592656" data-width="2342" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4602689-share_20251114_0831100.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4602689"></a><figcaption>Grandioso Apartments location</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4602689-share_20251114_0831100.jpeg"></figure><p>When you arrive, take the inner zipline up to the top floor, then take the nearby stairs up to the roof.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4602712-share_20251114_0831133.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4602712" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4602712-share_20251114_0831133.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4602712"></a><figcaption>Fertilizer location</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4602712-share_20251114_0831133.jpeg"></figure><p>Here, you'll find Fertilizer in some orange planting pots. Toss it in a safe pocket, then head to the Piazza Roma region for the next step.</p><h2>Where to find a Water Pump at the broken rooftop gardens at Piazza Roma</h2><p>Piazza Roma is just northeast of the Grandioso Apartments, making it only a short trek there after grabbing the Fertilizer. There are multiple buildings in this area, but you're headed for the building circled in the photo below. It's not a high-traffic POI, so there's a reasonable chance you won't run into anyone else here unless they're also doing the quest.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4602698-share_20251114_0831111.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4602698" data-ratio="0.56004901960784" data-width="2448" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4602698-share_20251114_0831111.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4602698"></a><figcaption>Piazza Roma building location</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4602698-share_20251114_0831111.jpeg"></figure><p>When you arrive, walk between this building and the one below it to find a yellow ladder that will take you all the way to the roof. You can also work your way through the building normally if you prefer, but this is by far the most efficient route to the top.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4602709-share_20251114_0831122.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4602709" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4602709-share_20251114_0831122.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4602709"></a><figcaption>Take the yellow ladder to reach the roof efficiently.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4602709-share_20251114_0831122.jpeg"></figure><p>On the roof, check the water pump in the corner next to all of the large planters.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p><em>Concord</em>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/podcasts/aftermath-hours-podcast-concord-failure-sony-steam/"><u>Sony Interactive Entertainment and Firewalk Studios' Overwatch-like shooter</u></a>, was live for just two weeks before it was pulled offline. Though <a href="https://www.polygon.com/playstation/448419/concord-gameplay-final-hours-close-servers-offline-time-date/?ref=aftermath.site"><u><em>Concord</em> certainly had <em>some</em> dedicated players</u></a>, it didn't have many—which is why it may be surprising to hear that a group of players are reverse-engineering the game and its servers to bring it back to life.</p><p>Publisher Sony removed <em>Concord </em>from stores and digital marketplaces, automatically refunded some, and, later, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282900/sony-shutting-down-concord-firewalk-studios?ref=aftermath.site"><u>shut down Firewalk Studios</u></a>. Two hundred or so people were laid off, and any hopes of <em>Concord</em>'s return were dashed. Poor sales—<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-estimated-to-have-sold-only-25000-units-heres-why-analysts-think-its-failing?ref=aftermath.site"><u>estimated to be under 25,000 copies sold</u></a>—and low player numbers marred the release. Firewalk Studios' <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/03/an-important-update-on-concord/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>game director Ryan Ellis said</u></a> in a blog post that pieces of the game "resonated with players," but "other aspects of the game and [<em>Concord</em>'s] initial launch didn't land the way [<em>Firewalk Studios</em>] intended."</p><p><em>Concord</em> wasn't a bad game, but it just didn't generate enough interest with enough players. Now, a group of three hobbyist reverse-engineers, who go by real, Red, and gwog online, are trying to make it playable again. They explained the process to Aftermath in an interview over Discord.&nbsp;</p><p>"I just like the virtual equivalent of taking things apart and putting them together," gwog said.</p><p>The group got a build of <em>Concord</em> running this week and posted a video of the match on YouTube. Red, who led a project to bring <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1c42pwg/lawbreakers_is_playable_again_unofficially/?ref=aftermath.site"><u><em>LawBreakers</em> back online</u></a>, said it was the first time he'd played <em>Concord</em>. When Red heard the game had died, he sought it out.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Make some explosive plays with Roka's Blast Dive! 💥 <a href="https://t.co/BD7gxAPBhC?ref=aftermath.site">pic.twitter.com/BD7gxAPBhC</a></p>— Concord (@PlayConcord) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayConcord/status/1826650547312619635?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">August 22, 2024</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>"I pretty much always do this when games die," he said. "There's also part of it that is due to the technical challenge that <em>Concord </em>brings with it, it's probably the most complex project I've worked on so far, and that really motivated me to keep going."</p><p>Red said there are two ways to reverse engineer a game like this and have it run on a server. He used a method that turned the game into its own server. Red said most games and game servers share code.</p><p>"Sometimes there's enough of the server left in the game, that we can 'activate' that code and make the game believe it's a server," Red said. "We do pretty much always need to fill in the gaps though, that involves a 'trying to find a needle in a haystack' approach of just trying to find something that doesn't exist, and recreating it. This is typically the most challenging part of these projects."</p><p><em>Concord</em> used an anti-tamper software to keep people from cheating, which also creates a problem for people reverse engineering. It's "nearly impossible" to crack, Red said, so the group didn't—they found an exploit to "forcefully decrypt the game's code" to "restore the game and start working on servers." Red said he started working on reverse engineering <em>Concord</em> as soon as the game went down, but the team was stuck for a long time on the anti-tamper software. Most of the progress, he said, took place over the past two months.</p><p>Real, who had never worked on a reverse engineering project before but recreated the backend API, said this work "feels like building something without the instructions."</p><p>"Sometimes you have a picture of what it's supposed to be," he said. "Sometimes you only have the pieces. You slowly (or sometimes if you get lucky, quickly) build it up until it looks exactly like (or close enough to) the metaphorical picture of what it's supposed to be. I worked on a lot of the backend server elements, think of them like save data. It contains stuff like what items you have unlocked, what level you are and how much XP you have."</p><p>Friday morning, a video of the playtest was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ConcordGame/comments/1owxnp4/concord_is_now_running_on_custom_servers/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>posted to the <em>Concord</em> Reddit page</u></a>. The Discord channel, where people can learn more about future private playtests has grown quickly; hundreds of people have joined for a chance to play <em>Concord</em> again. It's not open to the public, but people can sign up for future tests. Even former Firewalk Studios employees have joined the server. They're excited to see <em>Concord</em> come back to life, too, the developers said.&nbsp;</p><p>Red, who is passionate about game preservation <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>and the Stop Killing Games movement</u></a>, said the next step is adding <em>Concord</em> to a platform he created to host dead games, <a href="https://ancify.io/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">called Ancify</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>"It's intended to serve as a platform for dead games so that several games can share authentication, matchmaking, server deployment, and other such infrastructure to prevent us from having to put in duplicate work for each project," he said. <em>Radical Heights</em>, <em>Hyenas</em>, and <em>LawBreakers</em> are all on there now, in different states of functionality. There's no exact timeline for the addition of <em>Concord</em> but Red said to expect it “soon.”.</p><p>"I think a big part of [reverse engineering] is just being curious and motivated," Real said. "I'm very interested in '<a href="https://aftermath.site/the-person-saving-the-media-you-love-is-you-vhs-decode-domesday-duplicator-ld-decode-laserdisc/"><u>lost media</u></a>' and the like so I initially gravitated towards <em>Concord</em> because of the very large wave it made online as well as its incredibly short lifespan. Over the course of the project I began to respect a lot of the design choices I initially questioned and I think that also motivated me to keep working on it. I think part of it is wanting other people to see what I saw."</p><p>And for the people questioning why <em>Concord</em>, Red had a message.&nbsp;</p><p>"I just hope people can be respectful about this. Regardless of whether someone likes the game or not, there'll always be people liking a specific game, and you never know, the game you like might be the one dying next."</p>

			<p>Battlefield REDSEC, the new battle royale mode from EA and Battlefield Studios to go along with what has been a stellar return for the series with Battlefield 6, in many ways, is like every other battle royale you've already played.</p>



<p>You jump out of a plane and onto a massive map that continuously shrinks, and you have to immediately find a weapon, build your loadout, and do whatever you can to survive and be the last squad/person standing.</p>



<p>You should always be looking for a way to get an edge over the rest of the lobby, to give yourself the best chance at success. Part of that is having the right loadout for victory, which you could actually prepare ahead of time and acquire while on the battlefield of Fort Lyndon.</p>



<p>That said, getting your custom loadout while in the middle of a match isn't the same as it is in other battle royale titles. This guide will show you what you need to do to get your custom loadout and weapons in a game of Battlefield REDSEC.</p>

<figure><figcaption><em>Custom weapon drops in Battlefield REDSEC are very common, and your best path to getting a custom loadout.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>This should go without saying, but I'll say it anyway: you have to set up your loadout in the menu before you jump into a match. You do this by selecting the weapons you use for your loadout as one of your 'Favorite' weapons and by selecting the loadout you want to use as a 'Favorite.' </p>



<p>Once you're set up and ready to go, there are two ways to get a custom loadout in Battlefield REDSEC: </p>



<ol>
<li>Complete missions that reward you with a custom loadout</li>



<li>Track down custom weapon drops and piece-meal your loadout from there</li>
</ol>



<p>Completing missions that grant custom loadout rewards is a potential avenue for getting your custom loadout in Battlefield REDSEC, but it's not necessarily one to rely on. It's not the most common reward, and while you could get lucky and see it happen in multiple back-to-back matches, that's not guaranteed.</p>



<p>Custom Weapon Drops, however, happen in random places on the map each round, and you can trust you'll be able to run over to one in each match. Once you find one, you'll be able to select one weapon per drop, which means you'll have to try and reach multiple drops to put together a full custom loadout.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>You'll only be able to select the weapons you listed as your 'Favorites' when you grab a custom weapon drop.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Still, it's the most reliable way to get your custom weapons into Battlefield REDSEC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After two years, the <em>Disney Lorcana</em> lawsuit between Ravensburger and Upper Deck is coming to a close. Yet, after winning its cases, Ravensburger is pushing Upper Deck to pay the legal fees for its defense.</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://boardgamewire.com/index.php/2025/11/08/ravensburger-pushes-for-upper-deck-to-pay-3-8m-legal-fees-it-racked-up-defeating-groundless-but-unrelenting-disney-lorcana-lawsuit/" rel="nofollow">Board Game Wire</a>, a US federal judge ruled in favor of Ravensburger in all of Upper Deck's claims against the company. Those claims included copyright infringement, fraudulent misrepresentation and concealment, and unfair competition.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disney-lorcana-lawsuit-rush-of-ikorr-box-promo.jpg?itok=OfcN_kMN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disney-lorcana-lawsuit-rush-of-ikorr-box-promo.jpg?itok=ROfxGsOm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The lawsuit began in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/ravensburger-sued-by-upper-deck-over-disney-lorcana" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">summer of 2023</a>. Basically, Upper Deck sued&nbsp; <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/disney-lorcana" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Disney Lorcana's</em></a> lead designer, Ryan Miller, and Ravensburger for allegedly stealing and repackaging one of their in-development card games, <em>Rush of Ikorr</em>, into the popular Disney-themed TCG. These alleged copyright damages, according to Upper Deck's legal expert, were worth around $240 million.</p>

<p>Upper Deck argued that Miller was working for Upper Deck at the time, spending a year working on <em>Rush of Ikorr</em>, and that Disney Lorcana had "remarkable, uncanny similarities" to that game..</p>

<p>In fact, Ravensburger stated that Upper Deck should pay Ravensburger's legal fees for wasting their time with the Disney Lorcana lawsuit, requesting $3.8 billion in legal fees. The claim states,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"A complete defence verdict on an objectively meritless case warrants a full fee award.&nbsp;Upper Deck’s case was frivolous in conception, objectively unreasonable in prosecution and pursued in a manner that multiplied costs while consuming vast judicial resources."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For context, Upper Deck alleged copyright infringement on 43 separate game elements in Disney Lorcana. One of these mechanics included "taking alternate turns." The defense of these claims involved the exchange of 7,000 documents, and extended quizzing on all witnesses present for those 43 potentially infringing elements.</p>

<p>Given the fact that gameplay mechanics cannot be copyrighted, plus the extended procedures involved, Ravensburger's statements of this case being meritless does hold significance.</p>

<p>Upper Deck is continuing their legal fight against Ravensburger, filing an additional lawsuit in the Netherlands.&nbsp;</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Microsoft Releases Xbox Publishing Guide Online for Free]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-xbox-publishing-guide-free/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-releases-xbox-publishing-guide-online-for-free.1354309/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Microsoft has dropped its Xbox Games Publishing Guide for everyone to see. The guide, which was strictly under NDAs and such, is now fully available, coincidentally around the Steam Machine’s reveal.</p>







<p>For many indie developers, Steam has been a beacon for those who want to publish their first title. Via SteamDirect, one can, realistically, make a game, submit it, and it’ll be on the gaming platform in a little over a month. However, for other companies like PlayStation and Nintendo, it can be a bit more trickier to do. However, one company that has been a bit hard to tackle for indies is Microsoft. Despite the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/idxbox-showcase-october-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ID@Xbox program</a>, many games are just not releasing on the consoles, with many citing the difficult process. Now, in the advent of the Steam Machine, Microsoft has decided to pull back the curtain and make the once-hidden guide available to all.</p>



<h2 id="h-microsoft-makes-xbox-games-publishing-guide-available-for-everyone">Microsoft Makes Xbox Games Publishing Guide Available for Everyone</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/games/articles/2025/11/unlocking-access-to-game-publishing-documentation-for-all-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Microsoft Game Dev Blog</a>, Senior Program Manager at ID@Xbox, Ed Stewart, announced that <strong>the official Xbox Games Publishing Guide</strong> is <strong>available for free</strong> to everyone. The guide can be found <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/gaming/game-publishing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a> for those interested. Speaking on the opening, Stewart said the following,</p>



<p>“<strong>By opening our Game Publishing Documentation, we’re removing barriers to learning and making it easier for teams of all sizes to understand what it takes to ship a game on Xbox</strong>,” Ed Stewart says in the blog. “<strong>Whether you’re a first-time independent developer or a seasoned publisher, you can now browse the guide freely, share it with your team, and reference it throughout development.</strong>“</p>



<p>The move does take a page right out of Steam’s playbook, which couldn’t be more convenient. The PC-only company recently announced it’s taking on the console market with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-reveals-steam-machine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam Machine</a>. Its console will be able to play Steam games from your PC onto the TV. Microsoft is aware of it, as Xbox’s Phil Spencer congratulated the team. Perhaps this is the company wanting to become Steam or like them. Seeing as it’s putting exclusives like Halo and Gears of War on different consoles, it could be the future for Xbox.</p>







<p>What do you think of Microsoft releasing its Xbox Games Publishing Guide? Do you think more indies will make it onto Xbox? Think Microsoft wants to be Steam? Let us know in the comments and on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>.</p>
