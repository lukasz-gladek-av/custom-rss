            <p>
80s movie favourite The Karate Kid is being turned into a 16-bit-style side-scrolling beat-'em-up, and it's heading to PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on 20th September this year.
</p>
<p>
The Karate Kid: Street Rumble comes from GameMill Entertainment, the publisher behind Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl, and is firmly setting its sights on the 80s era of Karate Kid rather than Netflix's Cobra Kai continuation - which has already spawned two games itself.
</p>
<p>
Street Rumble is, somewhat surprisingly, only the second game to be directly based on the 80s movie series (the first, Atlus' NES action game The Karate Kid, arrived in 1987) and promises to feature a whole bunch of familiar faces as its 80s-set mulitplayer action unfolds.

<p>
As per Street Rumble's <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-karate-kid-street-rumble-a-pixel-art-beat-em-up-announced-for-pc-and-consoles">IGN reveal</a>, Daniel Russo, Mr. Miyagi, Kumiko, and Ali Mills are all playable across the game's 12 belt-scrolling-style stages, for instance, while the likes of Johnny Lawrence, John Kreese, and Terry Silver will feature as foes.
</p>
<p>
There's not a lot else to report at present, but The Karate Kid: Street Rumble is scheduled to release for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and Steam on 20th September - and you'll find some gamplay footage in the reveal trailer above.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-division-2-team-reconsiders-seasons-2-0%E2%80%99s-seasonal-characters.926115/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-division-2-team-reconsiders-seasons-2-0s-seasonal-characters/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Division 2 team recently uploaded a <a href="https://x.com/TheDivisionGame/status/1811751120508764170/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new update to X</a> in which they discuss their plans for Seasons 2.0 and the addition of Seasonal Characters. This comes after the broad feedback they received from the gaming community.</p>
<p>This comes after they received heavy backlash after announcing that they planned for everyone's character to reset to level 1 with each new season. Ubisoft commented that this was so that it felt like there was still a challenge to the game and that they wouldn't be able to steamroll through new content.</p>
<p>However, the community did not enjoy this prospect. As a result, Ubisoft Massive has reverted its original plan, opting to go forward <em>without</em> seasonal characters, a massive change for The Division 2 community. The developers have assured fans that "this change will not affect Year 6 plans, but it will require us to assess the changes necessary to the new Seasonal Experience."</p>
<p>While unsure what changes they will make to make Seasons 2.0 successful, they promise to return with news once they have ironed out the details. Once they have the information, a live stream and public test server (PTS) will be available for players to check out to get thorough research and feedback on their changes.</p>
<p>The response to the X post has been positive. The audience is mainly happy that they have decided to remove the changes they planned to implement. Currently, there are no concrete details as to what changes Ubisoft has made, but it sounds like players can keep their characters between seasons and can steamroll through the content if that is what they desire.</p>
<p>For the vast majority, the players are happy with the fact that they have reversed this decision. However, some players remain on tenterhooks while waiting for information from Ubisoft regarding what changes will be coming next. Will they be able to have fresh characters for each season and their main character, or will they be locked strictly into using their main character for the season?</p>
<p>At the moment, the community has many unanswered questions regarding the changes for Seasons 2.0 and seasonal characters. However, six years on, The Division 2 is still going strong and has a solid community, and even drastic changes cannot deter them from continuing to play the game and invest hours into it. The journey for Ubisoft hasn't been easy in creating content for this game, and trying to keep a live service game fun and fresh for <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-division-2-year-6-begins-today-with-first-rogues-endgame-overhaul/">six years</a> is impressive. We eagerly await what changes Ubisoft will bring for the next season.</p>

On Friday, Nexon responded to this controversy, saying they took it “seriously” and promised to change the icons while calling <em>Destiny 2</em> a “globally renowned looter shooter” that was “respected” by the developers and which also inspired them “during the development process.” </p><p>Meanwhile, complaints have been raised by players that <em>First Descendant’</em>s drop rates are too low for much-needed resources to craft and unlock new characters. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thegamer.com/the-first-descendants-drop-rates-are-fine/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thegamer.com/the-first-descendants-drop-rates-are-fine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nexon says that the drop rates are working as intended</a></span>, but did suggest it would make changes to the game to make farming and grinding easier. </p><p>There has also been criticism of the game’s microtransactions. One big complaint is that shaders or paints for cosmetics must be bought over and over for each new skin and character. Players have also connected the poor drop rate of materials used to unlock characters with the fact that Nexon will gladly take your money in exchange for skipping all that and unlocking new characters instantly. </p><p>For now,<em> The First Descendant</em> is still doing well on Steam with, as I write this, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://steamdb.info/app/2074920/charts/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://steamdb.info/app/2074920/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">over 170k players</a></span> currently looting and/or shooting it up in the sci-fi game.

However, the particular details for the Olympic Esports Games, such as its city, date, qualifications for prospective players, and game titles, have yet to be hashed out.</p><p>“As a ‘first’ ever Esports Olympic Games, obviously there is still much to consider and plan with the IOC, but we are committed to hosting a special event that respects and celebrates the Olympic values while boldly seizing the momentum to drive esports forward with the international platform the sport and its athletes deserve,” Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Al Faisal, president of the Saudi Arabian Olympic and Paralympic Committee said. “The world will have an open invitation to join us in 2025 and celebrate this moment together.“</p><p>“We are very fortunate to be able to work with the Saudi NOC on the Olympic Esports Games, because it has great – if not unique – expertise in the field of esports with all its stakeholders. The Olympic Esports Games will greatly benefit from this experience,” IOC President Thomas Bach wrote. “By partnering with the Saudi NOC we have also ensured that the Olympic values are respected, in particular, with regard to the game titles on the programme, the promotion of gender equality and engagement with the young audience, which is embracing esports.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/12/gssnmb-waaarlng-1720805563099.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The Inagural Olympic Esports Games will take place in Saudi Arabia in 2025.</figcaption></figure></output><p>In its announcement, the IOC also revealed plans for the International Federation and the National Olympic Committees’ “e-version” of sports to include in the Olympic Esports Games.

<p>The company’s latest Pocket iteration might appeal more to people who prefer the solidity and durability of anodized aluminum to the cheap practicality of plastic. <a href="https://x.com/analogue/status/1811777618447888740">On July 15</a>, the company will release <a href="https://www.analogue.co/editions/pocket-aluminum">a limited run of all-aluminum Analogue Pocket consoles</a> in four different colors: white, gray, black, and a Game Boy Advance-esque indigo. The company says that "every single piece" of these consoles is "entirely CNC'd from aluminum," including not just the frame but also all of the buttons.</p>
<p>The new material will cost you though: each aluminum Pocket sells for $500, over twice as much as the $220 price of a regular plastic Pocket.</p>
<p>The aluminum versions of the Pocket will run the exact same software as the standard plastic ones, and will be compatible with all the same cartridges and accessories. Analogue's site doesn't compare the weight of the aluminum and plastic Pocket consoles, though intuitively we'd expect the metal one to be heavier. The aluminum consoles begin shipping on July 17.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/analogue-pocket-metal-2.jpg" data-height="1200" data-width="1821" alt="An exploded version of the new Pocket; even the buttons are aluminum."></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/analogue-pocket-metal-2.jpg" data-height="1200" data-width="1821">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> An exploded version of the new Pocket; even the buttons are aluminum.</p><p>Analogue</p></figcaption></figure>

<p>When the Pocket first launched in late 2021, ongoing supply chain disruptions and high demand led to monthslong wait times for the initial models. Things have gotten slightly better since then—you can't simply open Analogue's store on any given day and just buy one, but the basic black and white plastic models restock with some regularity. Analogue has also released multiple special edition runs of the handheld, including <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/08/analogues-supercharged-modern-day-game-boy-now-glows-in-the-dark/">one made of glow-in-the-dark plastic</a> and <a href="https://x.com/analogue/status/1725544375134921084">a colorful series of models</a> that recall <a href="https://gameboy.fandom.com/wiki/Game_Boy_Play_it_Loud_campaign">Nintendo's mid-90s "Play It Loud!" hardware refresh</a> for the original Game Boy.</p>
<p>As much as we liked the Pocket in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/12/analogue-pocket-review-the-greatest-game-boy-ever-made/">our original review</a>, the hardware has gotten much more capable thanks to a series of post-launch firmware updates. In the summer of 2022, Analogue added OpenFPGA support to the pocket, allowing its FPGA chip to emulate consoles like the NES, SNES, Sega Genesis, and others aside from the portable systems that the Pocket was designed to emulate. Updates toward the end of 2023 allowed those third-party emulation cores to use their own display filters, replicating the look of classic CRT TVs and other displays.</p>
<p>The updates have also fixed multiple bugs in the system. The latest update is version 2.2, released back in March, which primarily adds support for the Analogue Pocket Adapter Set that allows other kinds of vintage game cartridges to plug in to the Pocket's cartridge slot.</p>

			<p>NEXON's The First Descendant launched last week on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. The free-to-play looter shooter game immediately <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-descendant-enters-steam-top-10-chart-on-launch-day-despite-mixed-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">entered</a> Steam's Top 10 live chart (despite mixed reviews from users on Steam), and it looks like it has continued to perform well. Today, the official Twitter/X account of The First Descendant <a href="https://x.com/FirstDescendant/status/1811716560031215773" target="_blank" rel="noopener">celebrated</a> reaching 10 million players across all platforms in the first week.</p>
<p>We don't have split numbers, of course. However, SteamDB <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2074920/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">registered</a> a concurrent player peak of 264K five days ago. Estimates of 'owners' on Valve's Steam range from 1.37 million players (<a href="https://vginsights.com/game/2074920?utm_source=SteamDB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to VG Insights</a>) to 3.19 million (<a href="https://gamalytic.com/game/2074920?utm_source=SteamDB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as reported by Gamalytic</a>).</p>
<p>NEXON's game also caused some controversy when it was found (<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/07/07/the-first-descendant-is-using-barely-changed-destiny-2-icons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via Forbes</a>) to have employed several skill icons that resembled those used by Bungie in Destiny 2. The development team has now shared a statement <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-descendant-dev-nexon-promises-to-change-controversial-icons-after-destiny-plagiarism-accusations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to IGN</a> addressing those allegations:</p>
<p><em>The First Descendant, as a looter shooter game, was developed with a deep affection and respect for other games in the genre. Destiny 2, being a globally renowned looter shooter game, is also personally admired and respected by the team, and it has served as an inspiration during the development process. We have taken the concerns raised seriously and decided to make adjustments to ensure that the imagery that may appear similar clearly reflects the unique identity of our game. We will continue to improve the game for fans of the looter shooter genre.</em></p>
<p>Regardless of the inspiration for the icons, there's no doubt that The First Descendant drew a lot from what is still the king of looter shooter games despite Bungie's many ups and <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-destiny-2-total-sony-takeover-feared-soul-crushing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">downs</a>.</p>
<p>By the way, the developers deployed a hotfix (version 1.0.2) yesterday, adding the 'Start Public Operation' function (matchmaking) to Infiltration Operations (Hard). There's also a brief Director's comment on the changes:</p>
<p><em>The Dev Team acknowledges the community's concern about the monotonous patterns of Named Monsters and strives to enhance them. In particular, we've noted that the pattern involving breaking spheres in a specific order isn't appropriate for public matching and have decided to remove it immediately.</em><br>
<em>As new patterns are developed, we will soon update the patterns of existing Named Monsters one by one. As Named Monsters frequently appear in Hard difficulty and Special Operations, we will continue working towards diversifying their patterns.</em></p>
<p>On the optimization front, the developers at NEXON improved the stability of the shader preparation process by reducing the CPU load during shader generation. They also reduced GPU memory usage when set to&nbsp;High or higher quality.</p>
<p>Today, NEXON also announced the permanent ban of 3481 users from The First Descendant, with a publicly available list <a href="https://tfd.nexon.com/en/news/2601613" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the official website</a>. These users either created, distributed, or used unauthorized software (e.g., cheats and hacks).</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Techland Is The Latest Dev To Issue a Return to Office Order]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/techland-return-to-work-order/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/techland-is-the-latest-dev-to-issue-a-return-to-office-order.926064/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/techland-return-to-work-order/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>It has been reported by a Polish news outlet that Techland has issued a ‘return to office’ order ‘suddenly and without consultation’, requesting that remote working staff change their operating model and head back into bricks-and-mortar offices. The report claims that anonymous sources close to the company voiced their fair share of concerns about the move, citing inadequate office facilities, amongst other things.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-going-old-school">Going Old School</h2>



<p>COVID-19 forced a work-from-home revolution that saw hundreds of millions of people worldwide start logging into their workplaces from their living rooms and home offices. It was a prominent move for developers, with some games being built by fully remote teams – which at the time was an amazing thing. </p>



<p>However, now that times have changed, major developers are pushing their employees <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-return-to-office-mandates-are-about-control-and-nothing-else/">back into the office</a>. Months ago, Rockstar issued a return-to-office order, stating that security was the driving reason for the change. Ubisoft also requested that employees head back into the many offices located around the world.</p>



<p>As financial concerns rose for some developers, the lack of workers in the office meant that many studios and locations were shut down, with companies opting to scrap offices to recoup some losses rather than force employees back into them.</p>



<p>In a new report, it has been explained that Techland is bringing employees back into the office with a few caveats. This report was published <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/techland-moving-most-roles-to-on-site-or-hybrid-model" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by GamesIndustry</a>, with Techland explaining:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>While remote work remains an option, we’re transitioning most roles to either an on-site or hybrid model. Employees who live near our offices will be asked to work from the office three days a week. For those working remotely from abroad, we’re asking them to come to the office regularly to foster stronger connections.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was claimed in <a href="https://www.cdaction.pl/newsy/techland-konczy-z-praca-zdalna-pracownicy-zmiana-wprowadzona-nagle-i-bez-konsultacji" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the initial report</a> that access to videoconferencing facilities and even toilets are restricted in Techland’s offices, especially when ‘too many’ staff are working on-site. Presently, Techland’s teams are working on an open-world fantasy RPG that’s yet to be revealed in full, but the company is best known for Dying Light, a post-apocalyptic, zombie-slashing series that debuted in 2015.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-descendant-10-million-players/</link>

<p>The First Descendant, a free-to-play ‘looter shooter’ from Nexon, was released on July 2 to mixed reviews. For many, it felt like it was a rehash of some other titles, namely Destiny and Warframe, and the most recent topic of debate is circulating around whether or not Nexon simply flipped assets or plagiarised Bungie’s sci-fi shooter in a few ways while creating The First Descendant.</p>



<p>Despite the meddling controversies, it seems The First Descendant has been a whopping success. Nexon recently revealed that 10 million players found their way into the game across all platforms in just one week.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-make-it-free-and-that-ll-happen">Make It Free and That’ll Happen</h2>



<p>Much of the success of The First Descendant can be attributed to the fact that the game doesn’t cost a penny to play. That alone will entice millions of players. The real test is keeping those players engaged – you can bet your last dollar that the player count will crash after just a couple of weeks on the market.</p>



<p>In a post on X, Nexon wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’ve reached 10 million Descendants in just 7 days! Thank you all for your tremendous support and love. It means everything to us. We will do our best to bring you great experiences. Can’t wait to continue this journey together!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This free-to-play, live-service title has had some teething issues, with players issuing mixed reviews across the board. It’s no big secret that The First Descendant operates a fairly expansive monetisation model that has packed the game to the brim with microtransactions, but by now, that’s part and parcel of the free-to-play life. </p>



<p>Plenty of comments have also been made regarding some of the character designs in The First Descendant. Instead of a solid story or satisfying quests, Nexon opted to include beautiful character models, some of which boast revealing outfits that rival Stellar Blade’s Eve. It takes more than an attractive group of playable characters to pull the wool over the eyes of the gaming community these days.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-xbox-game-pass-amazon-prime-cancel<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This week, both Microsoft and EA <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-game-pass-rot-economy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">embraced the rot economy</a>, purposefully enshittifying Xbox Game Pass and <em>Apex Legends</em>’ battle pass, respectively, in hopes that some number somewhere will continue to go up. It’s grim stuff, but there’s a silver lining: This strategy has a breaking point, and it’s within our power to decide where it lies. On this week’s Aftermath Hours, we talk about that.</p><p>This time around, we discuss the progressive worsening of services both in and out of games, but also the fact that we don’t need all of these things – many of which are redundant – and that it can be freeing to cut yourself loose from them. People are getting fed up en masse; milking the whales for every last penny only works when there are still whales left to milk.&nbsp;</p><p>Then we talk about the <a href="https://aftermath.site/kotaku-australia-closed-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sudden death of Kotaku Australia</a>, a site which – contrary to popular belief – Luke does not and never has worked for. After that, we discuss some TV shows, one of which, <em>The Boys</em>, has <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-boys-season-4-impressions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">really fallen off</a>, and the other of which, <em>The Acolyte</em>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-acolyte-star-wars-controversy-ratings-this-is-all-terrible" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">never really got going to begin with</a>. Lastly: Cubes.</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that more people can hear the good word of Aftermath, a subscription-based service that will shut down before it succumbs to enshittification, largely because we are not competent enough business people to enact such a scheme.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> In the comments under my blog, some people were discussing how we’re not really trapped in this and you don’t have to use these services. You can cancel Amazon Prime, a thing I constantly think of doing because I never use it. I wonder if there’s a critical mass [where that starts to have an impact]. Remember when Kash Hill <a href="https://gizmodo.com/i-tried-to-block-amazon-from-my-life-it-was-impossible-1830565336" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote that article</a> never trying to use Amazon products for Gizmodo? And it was impossible. Her whole life toppled over. I wonder if you cancel all your services and you never use Google and you just get away from every enshittified service, where does that lead?</p><p><strong>Luke: </strong>Yeah, I canceled my Amazon the day after <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/lukeplunkett.com/post/3kwoqwvrqtq2f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that ad thing</a> came up [on Prime Video]. I was just like “Fuck it. I don’t need it anymore.” I just felt like, on principle, that it was really time to stop having this shit shoveled to me. And that’s why I talked about it as the straw that broke my back. Now that I’m talking about it out loud, this is like therapy. It was a much bigger deal than I thought at the time.</p><p>I used to be a Game Pass subscriber a long time ago, and I was like “There’s no value for me in this versus what I’m paying.” I used to be a PlayStation Plus subscriber. Same deal. There’s a cost of living crisis, or my mortgage has gone up, or my bills have gone up, and you’re trying to squeeze me for more money for less stuff for fucking video games? Absolutely not.</p><p>It feels good to do it. It feels… liberating is probably too strong a word, but you don’t have to use any of these services. That Amazon blog that you talked about, you don’t have to use Amazon. You don’t have to use anything. You don’t have to use Uber. Life has long existed without these services and will exist without them again at some point in the future.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>I think the only counterargument – and the sort of larger problem – is that those services destroyed what people were doing before. It’s much harder to find a taxi now because Uber showed up. It’s much harder to find reliable brick-and-mortar retailers because Amazon exists, and a lot of places have gone out of business.</p><p><strong>Luke:</strong> Right, but here’s what I was getting to with that: If you extrapolate my breaking point to everybody else, everybody else is gonna have a breaking point. While these services have made life difficult – especially in the United States; I’ll grant that what I’m saying is tainted by my own experiences here [in Australia] where we have nowhere near that level of submission to these kinds of corporate elements – everybody is going to have a breaking point. This is what the whole “rot economy” is about: They can’t keep jacking up prices while offering less for everything, because everyone will break at some point. There will eventually be a point where you say “no.” That’s gonna come for all these services.&nbsp;</p><p>Is that exciting? Is it destructive? I don’t know. We’ve seen how destructive the slow inroads that Uber and Amazon and other huge line-goes-up corporations have made into our daily lives [are]. What happens when we stop using those, and they don’t work, but the things that they broke aren’t here anymore either? I don’t know.&nbsp;</p><p>But on a personal basis, I can’t vouch for it enough. It feels great to feel like you’re part of that move away, even if it’s the tiniest step. You sort of feel like “Well, it’s not just me. It’s not like I’m going vegan, and it’s an entirely personal decision.” It’s if everybody is making a decision that affects the bottom line of these companies, then eventually that does have an impact on them. I just wonder where everyone else’s breaking point will be. Is it when an Uber is $40 to go five minutes? Is it when Netflix costs $40 a month? I don’t know. But no one’s gonna keep paying more and more for everything, because that’s not how things work.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>I think an easy starting point also is recognizing that a lot of these services are entirely redundant. A few months ago, I canceled Hulu and then realized that I was barely ever using it anyway. Once it was out of my life, I was like “What was I doing with it in the first place? Why did I spend hundreds of dollars on this thing that I barely ever use?” Recently I did the same thing with Netflix, and then I realized that I hadn’t used Netflix in, like, six months for anything of real substance. Game Pass I hadn’t used since <em>Starfield </em>came out. These things are built in part to just sort of sit around and not be used by you, but still extract money from you.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s also just the simple matter that you don’t need a Netflix and a Hulu. There’s so much content on both of them. You only have so many hours in the day. I barely spend any of my time watching TV or playing games relative to everything else that I do, because life is full of activities and obligations. Really, you just need, like, one service, maybe. And then half the time, you’re just gonna end up scrolling on your phone anyway, so you won’t use that either.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Call of Duty is getting another major crossover when Season 5 kicks off at the end of the month. In a post on social media, it’s been announced that Call of Duty and WWE are joining forces to bring the world of pro wrestling to Modern Warfare 3.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The simple tease that was posted mentions that more information is coming soon with them coming to the game “starting July 24.”</p>



<p>“It’s about to be a smackdown,” the official post reads.</p>



<p>It’s unclear exactly what will be a part of this crossover, but it should be expected that the game will get some sort of WWE operator. We’ll have to wait and see exactly what else comes when the reveal happens in the next couple of weeks.</p>



<p>This isn’t the first time that WWE has done a crossover with games. Earlier this year, the company did a crossover with Fortnite to bring Bianca Belair and Becky Lynch skins into the game.</p>



<figure><figcaption>WWE has a history collaborating with popular games</figcaption></figure>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/12/24197221/apex-legends-battle-pass-incorrect-esports-payments<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Apex Legends</em> can’t seem to catch a break. The game has been plagued with a pair of high-profile issues for the last few weeks.</p><p>First up, earlier this week, the hero shooter’s developer, Respawn Entertainment, announced <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/battle-pass-update">it was retooling the game’s battle pass</a>. For season 22 and beyond, the battle pass will now be split into two halves, with 60 levels for each half. Additionally, players will no longer be able to purchase a battle pass with AC or <em>Apex</em>’s in-game currency. “The decision to move from AC to real world currency is not one that we made lightly, but it does allow us to decrease the price of Premium+ for our community,” the announcement read.</p><p>Players responded negatively to the changes, accusing Respawn and publisher EA of nickel-and-diming its customers. Respawn touts that the new system is a way to “increase value” for players. But eliminating the ability to pay for the battle pass with currency earned in-game (previously, players could earn enough coins by completing the battle pass progression to purchase another one without spending more real money) is seen by many as a way for the studio to squeeze more money out of a dwindling player base. The backlash progressed to the point where players <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/battle-royale/apex-legends-gets-the-ol-steam-review-bomb-treatment/">began review-bombing the game on Steam</a>, taking its former, mostly positive rating down to mostly negative. </p><p>On the esports side, <em>Apex Legends</em> suffered another embarrassment as players participating in the <em>Apex Legends</em> Global Series tournament <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24196854/apex-legends-global-series-agls-pro-league-wrong-prize-payment">reported incorrect payments to their accounts</a>. One player received $100,000 in their account after only a few days of play. Other players reported similar erroneous payments totaling either too much or too little. The tournament’s organizer, ESL Faceit, took responsibility, calling it a “systems error” that resulted in incorrect payments. In a statement to <em>Polygon</em> a spokesperson for the tournament wrote, “As the partner responsible for prize fulfillment, we’re working to quickly resolve this issue and ensure that all players receive the correct prize payouts.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Playing as the eponymous character, you find yourself in Heaven, only you’re an assassin-for-hire helping to clean out all the demons in the lower levels of the kingdom of God. In order to do so, you and the other Neons—sinners plucked from Hell to earn a spot in Heaven for killing the most demons—must use Soul Cards scattered around nearly 100 levels to exorcize the demons and get to the bottom of what the hell is exactly going on.<br></p><p>This premise sets <em>Neon White</em>, a speedrunning first-person shooter, into motion. However, it’s even more complicated and fascinating than that. Soul Cards basically function as stand-ins for guns, and each has a set number of uses, as well as an alternate ability if they are discarded. For example, the pistol is a card called Elevate, because discarding it gives you an extra jump. An SMG can be discarded in order to do a ground pound, and discarding a shotgun propels you forward as a fireball. Eventually, levels become so multi-tiered, not to mention replete with mixtures of these cards, that it stops feeling like a shooter and much more like the wildest 3D platformer with the slickest movement mechanics.<br></p><p>If that sounds involved, that’s because it is, and it’s only one facet of a busy, <em>busy </em>game. <em>Neon White </em>also doubles as a visual novel with dating sim elements, including hunting down gifts to give to characters around the hub area, which unlocks personal side quests and missions themed for the character’s personality. This is how you get to know the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/neon-white-steam-reviews-pc-overwhelmingly-positive-1849089380&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/neon-white-steam-reviews-pc-overwhelmingly-positive-1849089380">exceptionally horny</a></span> cast of <em>Neon White</em>, which is composed of other Neons who White seems to know from his days in the world of the living. Among them is Neon Green, who serves as the game’s primary antagonist, the bro-ish himbo Neon Yellow, your incredibly sultry ex Neon Red, and Neon Violet, the poster child of DDLG relationship dynamics. No, I will not spell that out for you, that’s between you, God, and your Google search bar.</p><p>In tandem, it all makes for a game that is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/neon-white-fps-platformer-puzzle-speedrun-dating-sim-sw-1849107271&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/neon-white-fps-platformer-puzzle-speedrun-dating-sim-sw-1849107271"><em>delightfully</em> all over the place</a></span>. One moment you’re pulling the sickest shit in some level to try and get the best time possible—maybe even trying to outrank your friends on <em>Neon White</em>’s leaderboards—and the next you’re in a fan-service anime beach episode with Neon Red and Violet, complete with artwork of them in bathing suits. One second you’re in a life-or-death boss battle, and the very next you could be in a scene where White is canonically belting My Chemical Romance’s “Welcome To The Black Parade” at a karaoke bar in Heaven of all places.</p><p>All of this is set to one of the coolest electronic soundtracks composed by the duo Machine Girl, and did I mention that White is voiced by Steven Blum, the voice of <em>Cowboy Bebop</em>’s Spike Spiegel? So many aspects of <em>Neon White</em> feel wrapped up in this fevered Y2K aesthetic, which extends to many of the characters designs and direction, as well as its broader cringe-inducing tone. My advice? It <em>wants </em>to be that corny, so steer into the skid rather than fight it. You’ll enjoy the game so much more this way.</p><p>What are you waiting for?

<p>Thirteen years after it released, Terraria has reached another major sales milestone. In a new State of the Game post on its <a href="https://forums.terraria.org/index.php?threads/terraria-state-of-the-game-june-2024.136658/#community" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official forum</a>, it was announced that Terraria has sold over 58 million copies in its life span.</p>



<p>To be more specific, 58.7 million copies have been sold of the game. Roughly 32 million of those sales come from the PC version of the game.</p>



<p>“Once again, we are beyond humbled and thankful for your continued support – it is the force that drives us every day to make even more awesome Terraria experiences,” developer Re-Logic said. “I wonder what might happen when we get to sixty million…”</p>



<p>Reaching nearly 60 million copies sold of any game is a major accomplishment. That puts it ahead of games like Overwatch, The Witcher 3,  Animal Crossing: New Horizons, and more. </p>



<p>Re-Logic has announced plans for Terraria 2. However, information on the game has been limited aside from the plans to have it built on new engine.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/introducing-the-syndicates-of-star-wars-outlaws-ign-first<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Star Wars Outlaws takes scoundrel Kay Vess on a planet-hopping adventure as she goes in search of one big heist that will get her out of the trouble she finds herself in. Set between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, the Imperial forces are at the peak of their powers and naturally will serve as an enemy faction. But more integral to the Outlaws experience are the crime syndicates that Kay will encounter and the scum and villainy that comes with them. Dotted throughout the galaxy, each has its own stories to tell and – more importantly – can be used to Kay’s benefit when you see fit thanks to Outlaw’s reputation system.</p><p>“Across all of [the syndicates], there are fierce rivalries that Kay is going to have to navigate,” explains narrative director Navid Khavari. “And the player's going to have to engage with the reputation system in order to get what she wants.” </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/12/jabba-palace-1720787600965.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>You're going to be hanging out in a lot of places like this in Star Wars Outlaws.</figcaption></figure></output><p>“You're not friends, you're not employed, you're not pledging allegiance, you are someone surviving and trying to grow a name [and a] reputation in this world,” adds Mathias Karlson, Outlaws’ game director.  “Think of them as a little bit of a means to an end. What do they have to offer and what do I need and want right now?”. We’ve delved deeper into the gameplay impact of the reputation system (and how you can manipulate the syndicates) earlier in this month’s Star Wars Outlaws IGN First. But, who are these syndicates? We talked to members of the development team at Massive Entertainment to learn about the visual design of each and their place in the world of Star Wars Outlaws.</p><h2>The Hutt Cartel</h2><p>Perhaps the most well-known of the Star Wars criminal syndicates, The Hutts are led by everybody’s favourite giant slug man Jabba the Hutt. Flanked by Bib Fortuna, Salacious Crumb, and other hilariously named cronies, they first appeared in 1983’s Return of the Jedi as the crime lords of Tatooine. Straightforward and not afraid to dispatch with anyone who plays games with them, they love galactic credits and the power they bring.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/12/star-wars-jabba-1720777448322.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>This guy needs no introduction.</figcaption></figure></output><p>“The idea with the Hutts is really what you see is what you get,” states Khavari. “They aren't afraid to use force, they take what they want and they're just incredibly powerful.”.</p><p>“Jabba the Hutt is a very famous character in the Star Wars galaxy and so the Hutt Syndicate is definitely inspired by [what you’ve seen before]”, explains Marthe Jonkers, associate art director at Massive.” So you will see enforcers and you'll see characters from the movies as well, Gamorian guards for example.” </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/12/han-solo-carbonite-1720786998321.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>You don't want to cross the Hutts, otherwise...</figcaption></figure></output><p>“Their look is definitely Tatooine-inspired,” Jonkers says. “I think it's interesting to say that the Hutts have probably the most dirt and wear and tear on their clothing of all the syndicates.”</p><p>But while the Hutts are based on Tatooine, Jonkers says that “you will find them in different locations as well All the syndicates have power that goes beyond the planet where they're from.”</p><h2>Pyke Syndicate</h2><p>The Pyke Syndicate will be a recognisable name to anyone who watched The Book of Boba Fett or Star Wars: The Clone Wars TV series, but don’t expect them to look exactly like how you remember.</p><p>“They have a very distinctive look”, says Jonkers. “They are Pykes, but they're different from the Pykes you've seen in different shows. We really went in a different direction with color palettes. So they have a lot more dark blues, but also we went really into more of a graphic design for them. So you will see on the helmets and the clothing they wear, they have different patterns which will show which rank they are or which group they belong to. They're not as organized I would say as a military group, but they do have different units that have different weapons, for example, different skills, and you will see a distinction in that.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/12/outlaws-screen-toshara-8f599f4b-1720777517192.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>You'll find the Pykes in many places, including the moon of Toshara.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Through spice production and trading, the Pykes amassed a fortune from their home world of Oba Diah. But by the time of Outlaws, the syndicate finds itself spread out throughout the galaxy, including an operation on the freshly created Moon of Toshara.</p><p>“The Pike Syndicate is incredibly wealthy and powerful in this time period”, says Khavari. “And we sort of center around their underboss, Gorak, who is very much in charge of Pike operations on the moon of Toshara. And so while that is under Imperial control, just like the rest of the galaxy, we get to see the corrupt side of that because the Pykes have worked out a deal with the Empire there, where they get to do what they need to do and the Empire always gets its cut.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/12/pike-syndicate-1720787499108.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Gorak is the leader of the Pike syndicate.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Fuelled by an unrelenting desire to turn profits, no matter what moral lines may need to be crossed, the Pykes’ love of luxury and all things shiny is best demonstrated in the appearance of Gorak.</p><p>“We really wanted him to look very much like the boss,” explains Jonkers. “So he's much bigger than the regular Pyke characters that you will meet. [...] He's definitely not the one who fights. He's the one who tells people what to do. He has also a lot of jewelry. He's very rich. We really wanted to tell a story just by seeing, you definitely see that Gorak is the leader.”</p><h2><strong>Crimson Dawn</strong></h2><p>As more Star Wars stories are written, the more important Crimson Dawn’s influence in the galaxy appears to grow. Led by Lady Qi’ra, Emilia Clarke’s character from Solo: A Star Wars Story, Crimson Dawn is the syndicate responsible for auctioning off Han Solo’s frozen carbonite wall decoration in the comic books – a prize won by Jabba and the Hutts, who outbid the Pyke Syndicate.</p><p>A mysterious organisation operating in the shadows of power, many of Crimson Dawn’s intentions remain shrouded when it comes to Outlaws’ story. Khavari gives us some hints, however, noting that the syndicate is “really focused on intelligence spreading” and “aligning a little bit with [the] wider network” of organised criminals.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/12/sw-outlaws-gameplay-gallery-crimson-dawn-0e8cdd59-1720777580403.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Crimson Dawn is the crime syndicate that auctioned off Han Solo frozen in Carbonite.</figcaption></figure></output><p>“Crimson Dawn, especially if you look at some of the wider media, is up to something very, very interesting that I'll leave to others to explore and dive into,” he notes. “But this period is very, very important in terms of the character Lady Qi’ra.”</p><p>The shadowy nature of the group is reflected in their visual design, allowing them to blend into any location they might find themselves in but also place their stamp when they want to make their presence known.</p><p>“You'll be able to meet them in certain places and it's not always necessarily a place that's entirely theirs,” says Jonkers “Maybe they took over someplace. Now you can see certain elements of them on top of something that used to be something else”</p><p>“They're more fashionable, I would say, compared to the other syndicates, and we try to translate that as well in their clothing,” she explains. “The clothing is very practical but very clean as well, cleaner than any of the other syndicates really to show that they have access to better materials and it's maybe also part of their style.”</p><h2>Ashiga Clan</h2><p>The Ashiga Clan is a new syndicate created by Massive in collaboration with LucasFilm, and can be found on the freezing planet of Kijimi – one of five playable planets and moons in Star Wars Outlaws and last seen in The Rise of Skywalker. Although brand new when it comes to Star Wars canon, those more knowledgeable about the galaxy far, far away might be familiar with the alien species they hail from.</p><p>“They're completely new, but we did use an existing species called the Melitto for the Ashiga clan, and there are many different aspects of them,” Jonkers explains. “They don't have eyes, so they use different senses and that was really interesting to design a whole syndicate that doesn't use eyesight. So all of their designs have a lot of tactile elements.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/12/outlaws-screen-kijimi-syndicate-e4c48c87-1720777616349.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Kijimii, like the Ashiga clan itself, is inspired by Samurai movies.</figcaption></figure></output><p>They're based on Kijimii, so in the areas they control, you can see these lines on the floor, that's sort of their way of navigating [...] they're feeling around almost where to go.</p><p>Their style [is] really connected to Kijimi City. We wanted to show that they've been there for a long time. So the city itself influenced their look as well. And as Kijimi City is heavily inspired by samurai movies and has a lot of these Japanese influences, we use these same sources of inspiration for the Ashiga Clan as well. And you will see that in their silhouettes [which] have a lot of references to samurai armor or kimono type of clothing.”</p><p>The insect-like nature of the Melitto race not only provided some interesting visual challenges for the team, but also influenced how the syndicate is structured, and what its goals include. Whereas others such as the Pykes, Hutts, and Crimson Dawn value money, power, and information as ways to grow their influence, The Ashiga Clan is much more focused on itself and its small pocket of the galaxy.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Ashiga Clan can be found on the freezing planet of Kijimi – one of five playable planets and moons in Star Wars Outlaws</p></div><p>“The Ashiga Clan are really interesting because they follow this very strict hierarchical structure”, Kavari tells us. “Every single member of the clan is serving the wider group under the control of Queen Ashiga, more than any other syndicate where you might have some characters and some subordinates off to their own devices. In The Ashiga Clan, it's serving the Queen. And that's it. And that gave a really fascinating dynamic.”</p><p>“They have a strict code of honor,” adds Jonkers. “They're very like a hive mind, and they have one very powerful queen who is in charge. So there are definitely references to that as well in the way they organize their locations, for example, which will remind you a little bit more of an ant hill.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The Ashiga clan is really trying to keep control over Kijimi, which is a very important city, and trying to really get their revenue through that. And they're also a syndicate that you will maybe encounter less in different locations because they're so connected to the city. So it's really their power over the city that gives them their meaning.”</p><h2>Zerek Besh</h2><p>Sitting outside of the reputation system is the Zerek Besh, a mysterious syndicate that serves as Outlaws’ primary antagonist. Where you will be able to interact with the other four crime gangs and forge/break bonds of your choosing as the story progresses, the Zerek Besh serves more as a distant, looming threat. They are run Sliro, a man who has placed a “death mark” on Kay at the beginning of her story, forcing her to go on the run. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/12/zerek-besh-1720786909561.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The Zerek Besh are the primary antagonists you'll face in Star Wars Outlaws.</figcaption></figure></output><p>“It's an incredibly wealthy organization,” says Navari about the Zerek Besh. “They have their own plans and are more of a new player to the galaxy and the syndicates. We very much wanted to treat them like they were the new player on the block. So for Kay, she's really on the run from them, and from Sliro. They are actively hunting her down and she's using the other syndicates to kind of get what she needs to pull off a heist that's going to secure her freedom from them.”</p><p>A deadly group not meant to be messed with, the Zerek Besh needed an ominous appearance to match, something that Jonkers and the team have worked hard on: “I mean, they look very threatening,” she says. “That's definitely one of the starting points for their design. We really wanted an imposing silhouette for them. We wanted them to look intimidating and they have big helmets, not to get a bigger silhouette, but [because] it creates a bit of a distance between you and them because really you don't know who's inside. So that was really for us, an important thing that they would feel like you need to get out of their way if you ever encounter them.” </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/12/zerek-besh-sliro-1720786942600.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The Zerek Besh are led by Sliro.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Much about Sliro and his gang remains a mystery for now, with Massive reluctant to give away many more details about your encounters with them. We’ll learn much more about them, though, and why they’re at the core of Kay’s story when Star Wars Outlaws releases on August 30th.</p><p><em>Simon Cardy once got kicked out of a school assembly for calling somebody Salacious Crumb.

Xur will still sell Legendary armor and weapons, as well as engrams that can yield any item in those pools at random. Like other vendors, Xur also has his own reputation track now and the more you spend, the more reputation rewards you'll earn, including an Exotic Cipher after every rank reset.</p><p>Additionally, Xur's loyalty program kicks in after you spend 47 Strange Coins, granting you a Strange Favor buff. This lasts for 11 days and can be stacked up to three times--once per week--giving you a chance to earn a bonus Strange Coin from activities that reward you with the currency. Xur is present every weekend in Destiny 2, starting with the daily reset at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET each Friday.</p>

		<p>I have a bit of soft spot for Wind Rose as during the pandemic when all the heavy metal concerts were cancelled, they took their mining anthem Diggy Diggy Hole and made an a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnBvEddq7nw">banging EDM version of the track</a> as nightclubs were still open in some countries. Well, they’re back and this time they have teamed up with the video game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/deep-rock-galactic/">Deep Rock Galactic</a> for another song about smashing rocks.</p>
<p>The new track, “Rock and Stone” finds the band members being kidnapped by aliens in to the world of Deep Rock Galactic&nbsp; and “it’s not long before the band is called to arms and forced to face down hordes of terrifying Glyhpoid foes in true Deep Rock Galactic fashion to ensure they can keep rocking out.”</p>

            <p>
As an old person who's still not over the novelty of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles being allowed to be called the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in the UK without anyone getting funny about the word "ninja", it'd be fair to say I'm a little behind on the franchise. So the news there's a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game out this October based on a movie I didn't know existed using an art style I'm totally unfamiliar with has brought a whole succession of revelations.
</p>
<p>
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed, as the game is known, was actually announced earlier this year, but developer A Heartful of Games and publisher Outright Games have now released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTQ-DC3dOpk">first trailer</a>, which you can see below. Mutants Unleashed - a "story-driven 3D brawler/platformer" - is coming to PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC, and promises "action-packed combat, hilarious teen spirit, and a whole load of pizza" as Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Donatello traverse an "immersive" New York City.
</p>
<p>
You'll be able to "skate through the streets, grind on rails, and zipline between buildings amid a dynamic night and day cycle" as the gang hunts collectibles and embarks on missions set after the events of this year's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem movie. Series regulars like Master Splinter, April, Bebop, and Rocksteady will also pop in to say hello.

<p>
As for the turtles themselves, each will have his own distinctive play-style, and there's talk of combat XP, skill trees, plus the chance to level up ally friendships in order to unlock new locations. It's playable either solo or in two-player co-op, and the movie's cast - Nicolas Cantu, Brady Noon, Micah Abbey, and Shamon Brown Jr. - all return to voice their respective turtles.
</p>
<p>
While writing this, I just had a flashback to the time I won a ticket in my local newspaper to see 1991's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2: The Secret of the Ooze, and got to enjoy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOV6H4NcGEs">Vanilla Ice's Ninja Rap</a> in a completely empty cinema because I guess the novelty of talking turtles was waning by then. Now, though, they look to have well and truly returned; there's a new movie coming in 2026 and two confirmed games in development - the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tmnt-graphic-novel-the-last-ronin-will-become-a-dark-god-of-war-style-video-game">God of War-inspired The Last Ronin</a> and Mutants Unleashed. The latter launches on 18th October, when it'll be available for Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, and Steam.

Rogers told <em>Comicbook</em> “there was not a shortage of ideas” for the <em>Transformers </em>event, and the two mentioned three ideas specifically that were on the table.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="17c9514770feca878f5963ab0344a5d2" data-recommend-id="image://17c9514770feca878f5963ab0344a5d2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Pharah next to Starscream." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Pharah next to Starscream." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard Entertainment / Hasbro / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="17c9514770feca878f5963ab0344a5d2" data-recommend-id="image://17c9514770feca878f5963ab0344a5d2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Pharah next to Starscream." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Pharah, the flying, rocket-launching, damage-focused hero is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-pharah-meta-season-11-patch-notes-nerf-buff-1851572626&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-pharah-meta-season-11-patch-notes-nerf-buff-1851572626">at the top of a lot of <em>Overwatch 2</em> players’ shit lists right now</a></span>, but she was also nearly part of the <em>Transformers </em>collaboration with a Starscream skin. Even just looking at an image of the character, you can already envision his look on Pharah’s silhouette. The wings on his back and the launchers on his arms already look like Pharah’s flying suit, so you can see how Blizzard looked at Starscream and immediately thought of her.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6c6abc1cb9482b3b945404cd85219edd" data-recommend-id="image://6c6abc1cb9482b3b945404cd85219edd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Lucio next to Soundwave." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Lucio next to Soundwave." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard Entertainment / Hasbro / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6c6abc1cb9482b3b945404cd85219edd" data-recommend-id="image://6c6abc1cb9482b3b945404cd85219edd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Lucio next to Soundwave." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As the name suggests, Soundwave is a Decepticon that uses audio waves in combat. Lúcio would have been the natural pick to represent him in <em>Overwatch 2</em>, as he’s the one hero whose entire kit is based on soundwaves. His alternate fire that pushes enemies away from him (and likely off the map) is literally called “Soundwave,” so it was destined to be…except not, because Blizzard ended up scrapping the idea in favor of the other four.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="45fa4aded02a95c21d14c9afeb96d874" data-recommend-id="image://45fa4aded02a95c21d14c9afeb96d874" data-format="jpg" data-width="1350" data-height="760" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Wrecking Ball next to Unicron." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Wrecking Ball next to Unicron." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard Entertainment / Hasbro / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="45fa4aded02a95c21d14c9afeb96d874" data-recommend-id="image://45fa4aded02a95c21d14c9afeb96d874" data-format="jpg" data-width="1350" data-height="760" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Wrecking Ball next to Unicron." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The last scrapped idea Blizzard mentions in the interview was dressing up Wrecking Ball as Unicron. This antagonist is a planet-sized Transformer that appears in a spherical shape before changing into his still very large but more recognizable robot form. This would have worked perfectly with Wrecking Ball, a hamster who pilots a ball-shaped mech. Dennett said that while fans would have loved it, Blizzard knew they had to balance the time and resources they had.<br></p><hr><p>So those are just a few of the possibilities that didn’t make the cut, but the skins we have now for Ramattra, Reinhardt, Bastion, and Illari are still pretty great, and managed to capture some of the most recognizable robots in disguise.
