			<p>According to reliable leaker <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/de-nouveaux-packs-ps5-inattendus-bientot-devoiles-avec-des-promos-a-la-cle-60148">billbil-kun on Dealabs</a>, PlayStation 5 console bundles with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-raining-fire/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> are due to be announced soon.</p>
<p>Billbil-kun doesn't list a specific release date, but speculates that they could be announced later on this month for PlayStation's upcoming Days of Play promotion. There's also no word of a PS5 Pro bundle coming, just standard and digital edition PS5s. They estimate that the standard PS5 with Black Ops 6 bundle will be $449.99 USD, while the digital edition bundle will be $399.99 USD.</p>
<p>It's not a big surprise that we're getting a PS5 console bundle with Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, especially considering that there was a PS5 bundle for 2022's Modern Warfare 2 and 2023's Modern Warfare 3.</p>
<p>Even though it's more business as usual between Sony and Activision, it does have the air of being another sign as to how committed Xbox is to continuing as a third-party publisher with a software-first approach. At the prices listed by billbil-kun, these bundles are much better deals than going out and buying a brand-new Xbox Series X/S. So you won't go out and get the Xbox hardware, but these bundles will come with Xbox-owned software.</p>
<p>Xbox-owned games also <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-dominate-ps5s-download-charts-for-april-2025-oblivion-remastered-already-the-uss-third-best-selling-game-of-2025/">dominated the sales charts for PlayStation games in April 2025</a>, and long-time Xbox exclusive series, <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-launches-on-pc-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-this-summer-with-full-cross-progression-and-cross-platform-multiplayer/">Gears of War</a>, will officially be coming to PlayStation this summer. All of these things feel like events you wouldn't believe if you were hearing it from someone in 2019.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/technology/reviews/dxracer-martian-series-review-premium-product-with-few-interesting-twists<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Racing chairs have become synonymous with gaming, with companies like DXRacer releasing a variety of models tailored for fans of these products. With the launch of their new high-end Martian series, we were able to get our hands on it, and we're not looking to go back.</p>

<h2>The Look and Style</h2>

<p>The Martian series is the new top-of-the-line model of DXRacer chair. This chair, sold in a black EPU Leatherette or Woven Fabric, is a more discreet racing chair. You won't find the flashy colors or branding to align with your favorite video game or energy drink of choice, but for a work-from-home lifestyle, I was extremely appreciative of its low-key design.</p>

<p>Unlike other racing chairs I've seen on the market the back of the Martian series has a far more open face, as a tall and large guy, this open face did a lot to combat the sometimes cramped feeling that other racing seat chairs may result in. It feels more like my back is being cupped, as opposed to compressed.</p>

<p>The key features of the DXRacer Martian Series is in the magnetic headrest that is able to be easily attached and detached while remaining in place and supporting your neck, and the various features of this powered chair.</p>

<p>The back piece is extremely firm, so if you enjoy a chair you can sink into, this definitely isn't going to be your first choice, but if you like feeling that firm support, then this will be more up your alley.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dxracer-backrest-airbag.jpg?itok=VQc4wxTC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dxracer-backrest-airbag.jpg?itok=zl0J9D-U 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Buttons on the side move your lumbar support into four different modes.</figcaption></figure><h2>Time to Plug In my Chair</h2>

<p>You heard me right, this chair has a built-in battery that powers the recline of the seat back, the airbag-like lumbar support, and the light up logo on the chair.</p>

<p>Much like you'd expect to have in a car, on the left side of the chair, where the seat meets the back, there is a toggle that you can tilt forward and back to control the rise and fall of the back. Unlike standard desk chairs where tilting up and down is done in increments, the Martian XL lets you smoothly raise and lower as you see fit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The level of precision is such a small thing, but it's extremely nice during the long hours of sitting at your desk when you want to be seated just right.</p>

<p>The other electronic feature of the Martian Series is an airbag lumbar support feature. Here, two thin airbags are situated in the lower-back area of the chair. Using four buttons on the right side of the chair, you can adjust whether the lumbar support is minimized, maximized, more pronounced at the top, or more pronounced at the bottom.</p>

<p>The large positive of this is that the lumbar support is built into the chair directly. It makes the experience feel more like you're just sitting in a chair, as opposed to having a chair and an addon. Unfortunately though, the lumbar support is far more situational. If one of those four presets aren't a good shape or height for you, then this feature will be good but not great.</p>

<p>While a chair with a headrest on elastic bands is going to be more frustrating for your head support, with so much movement, the adjustability of lumbar support on elastic bands gives more freedom of movement while being in a position that once you're settled, it will stay in place.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dxracer-martian-review-wheel-comparison.jpg?itok=vQ3p5uJB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dxracer-martian-review-wheel-comparison.jpg?itok=lhu7Na_E 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Left are the wheels that the DXRacer came with. Luckily, I could swap my rollerblade wheels to my new chair with ease</figcaption></figure><p>The most unfortunate aspect of the DXRacer Martian is the wheels. The wheels that the Martian comes with are unfortunately very basic desk-chair wheels. If you have a plastic mat or a carpet, it will be OK, but if you have wood floors, then you should replace these as soon as you can.</p>

<h2>Assembly Is Simple</h2>

<p>The DXRacer came in a huge box, one I was prepared to spend a lot of time digging through and putting together, but the chair was surprisingly easy to assemble. The large box was a side effect of just how large the seat and back of the chair was.</p>

<p>Opening up the box, you'll receive MASSIVE instructions on how to put it together that are extremely simple to follow. Each screw was pre-screwed into their destination, a very nice touch that allows the user to unscrew and then immediately re-screw the chair into place.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dxracer-martian-review-instructions.jpg?itok=dlxxFdNE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dxracer-martian-review-instructions.jpg?itok=bot3EEVZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Large and simple to understand.</figcaption></figure><p>Even hooking up the battery was an easy process with cables labeled clearly; A to A, B to B, etc. Once the battery and cables were slotted into place, you can cover it all up with fabric that snaps together under the chair.</p>

<p>As for battery life, I've got the chair's charger still sitting on my desk, but at over a month of use, I have yet to need to plug it in. The use of the battery is quite minimal, between the raising and lowering of the chair and altering the lumbar support, but even then I've been impressed.</p>

<h2>DXRacer Martian Series Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>DXRacer really has made a top-of-the-line chair with the Martian. The frame is firm but comfortable, not crushing you in but letting you comfortably sit. The headrest is extremely versatile to cradle your neck no matter where you're sitting, and the powered back lets you perfectly adjust for how you want to sit.</p>

<p>The lumbar support is nice, but isn't as exact in its positioning as the back or headrest, and unfortunately, the wheels are scraping the bottom of the barrel.</p>

<p>If you're going to be spending a long time at your desk and are OK picking up a set of rollerblade wheels to fit into this chair, this is going to be a fantastic and unassuming chair that you'll want to keep for years on end.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/661382/the-new-backbone-pro-could-be-the-one-controller-for-all-your-gaming<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Backbone’s new gaming controller looks like it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/6/24122784/iphone-emulators-great-ios-controllers">should have a phone inside</a>. The Backbone Pro has the same basic shape as the company’s previous device, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525741/backbone-one-iphone-ios-controller-gaming-portable-review">the excellent Backbone One</a> — its two oblong halves are connected by a strip of plastic and metal that expands enough to dock your smartphone into the exposed USB-C port. The Pro is heavier than the previous model, and feels a bit more solid both to use and to pull apart, but the idea is the same.</p><p>The key difference with the Pro, though, is that you don’t need to dock a phone to use the controller. The Backbone Pro can also connect over Bluetooth to lots of other consoles and devices — Backbone calls this Wireless Mode, and the phone dock is Handheld Mode. In Wireless Mode, Backbone CEO Maneet Khaira says, the Pro can connect to everything from a Steam Deck to an iPad to a smart TV. And there’s more in the works.</p><p>When Khaira first showed me the new controller, he practically gushed over how much work the Pro was, despite its physical similarities to the previous model. He says this is the controller Backbone has been trying to build for years. It has two full-size thumbsticks, one on each side of the controller, plus a D-pad on the left and A, B, X, and Y buttons on the right. There are two shoulder buttons on the top of each side, and a trigger button on the inside. There’s a headphone jack and a USB-C port, and apparently enough battery to last 40 hours on a charge. Khaira told me a few times about the three circuit boards on each side, and how hard it was to get all that stuff into such a small space.</p><p>This product is as much about software as hardware, though. Backbone’s app makes the system work: it aims to be a universal library of all your games on all your devices, and attempts to remember which consoles you’re connected to, the specific control layout for each one, and where you were in each game. (Backbone even built its own emulator for playing retro games inside the app.) When it all works, you should be able to pause a game on one screen and pick it up on another without putting your controller down.</p><p>The device is compatible with lots of game-streaming services, both major mobile platforms, and many consoles and devices. But it won’t work with everything: it’s not an officially supported PlayStation controller, for instance, because its buttons don’t match Sony’s. And it doesn’t work with the Nintendo Switch, either. These are obviously hugely popular platforms, and it has always been virtually impossible to build anything that works with all the big names. Backbone will likely end up making console-specific versions of those controllers, and Khaira points out you can technically use a Backbone for PlayStation remote play, but he also seems to hope he can eventually truly support everything in one place.</p><p>Khaira’s big idea, and the one that animates Backbone’s hardware and software teams, is that the controller should be the console. Before founding Backbone, Khaira worked on gaming at Google, which had a similarly cross-platform, controller-centric idea about the future. It was called Stadia, and it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23380140/google-stadia-ending-shutdown-latest-news-gaming-tech">is now, of course, dead</a>. Khaira thinks Backbone is going to pull it off.</p><p>The Backbone Pro is on sale now, but the price of the thing has been a moving target for tariff reasons. The current price is $169, but Khaira warned that that could change quickly as tariffs do. No matter what, it’ll be substantially more expensive than the $100 Backbone One. That one will still be for sale, too. But Backbone hopes the new one might eventually replace it — and every other game pad you have lying around.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Former PlayStation boss Shuhei Yoshida has discussed two hot-button issues in the video game industry, sharing his thoughts on rising video game prices and artificial intelligence.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://playstationinside.fr/interview-shuhei-yoshida-playstation-inside-english-version" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PlayStation Inside</a>, Yoshida said he expected video game prices to go up, but he was surprised to see Nintendo be the first-mover in the push to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/" data-ref-id="1100-6528874">$80 games with Mario Kart World</a>. After Nintendo confirmed a higher price point for the next Mario Kart, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/" data-ref-id="1100-6531257">Microsoft followed by announcing $80 games, too.</a></p><p>"It was going to happen eventually. We live in contrasting times, where inflation is real and significant, but people expect games that are ever more ambitious and therefore expensive to develop to cost the same. It's an impossible equation," he explained.</p><p>"Everything" related to video game development today is "more advanced and more technologically demanding than ever before," Yoshida added.</p><p>"Each publisher or manufacturer sets the price of its games, of course, but in the end the heart of the matter lies in production costs. And that's why industry actors are so keen to diversify their revenues, in order to continue producing the AAA games that the public buys before anything else," he said.</p><p>Due to these rising costs, Yoshida said it makes sense to see a "proliferation of remasters and remakes" due to their relatively lower cost. Companies are not remastering or remaking games just for the sake of giving older games a fresh coat of paint and a chance to reach a new audience, he believes. It's because remakes and remasters are "a kind of 'easy' solution to bring in profits," Yoshida said. These profits can then help fund new games, Yoshida said, and the same way of thinking applies to PC ports of older titles.</p><p>Yoshida went on to say he's not sure if <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-costing-100-could-reward-players-too-analysts-argue/1100-6529948/" data-ref-id="1100-6529948">Rockstar Games will price GTA 6 at $100</a> as some think the company might. That would indeed be the biggest step up so far in terms of a price increase for a new AAA game. When GTA 5 was released in 2013, it cost $60 to buy; that same $60 is about $80 today when factoring in inflation.</p><p>Whatever the case, Yoshida said "a balance must be found" between production costs and the the price of a game. He cited Expedition 33 as a "way forward" for the video game industry, mentioning how the game was developed by a relatively small team and sold for $50 (it also launched into Xbox Game Pass). Expedition 33 is an example of how a studio "can make excellent games with tighter teams and budgets without compromising quality."</p><h2><strong>"AI will become a very important tool"</strong></h2><p>On the subject of AI, meanwhile, Yoshida said he expects generative AI in game development to be "used creatively to improve games," but the first step is understanding how to best use the technology.</p><p>"The possibilities offered by AI are tools, not ends in themselves. AI will become a very important tool in the future if developers learn to use its good features. We're already seeing this today, and in any case it should be seen as a simple continuation of what has always been done in video games, because AI has been used in video games for as long as they have existed in reality," he said.</p><p>Some have cited concerns about potential job losses due to the rise in AI technologies. For his part, Yoshida said human developers themselves must stay "at the heart of the project," with AI systems and technologies deployed to "speed up processes and tedious tasks that don't impact on the artistic aspect of games."</p><p>Also in the interview, Yoshida praised the recent viral trend of people using AI systems to create "Studio Ghibli-style" versions of things, saying it was "very well done" and funny. Yoshida said he doesn't necessarily agree that AI systems could encourage plagiarism, but he does believe "imitation" issues are a genuine concern.</p><p>"I'm actually more worried about the imitation aspect of AI, because beyond plagiarism, AI can now imitate a work at a lower cost. Fortunately, these imitations never reach the level of the original games," he said.</p><p>Yoshida left Sony earlier this year after 30 years at the company. He's now advising publishers, including working with Bokeh Game Studios on Slitterhead. He also advises for Annapurna and Expedition 33 publisher Kepler Interactive.</p>

            <p>On its release, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>: Tarnished Edition will include two new classes for players to choose from when they set off for the Lands Between.</p>
<p>This upcoming edition of the game was first revealed last month, when developer FromSoftware announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-is-coming-to-switch-2">Elden Ring would be coming to Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>At this time, the team said new armour, a new Torrent appearance customisation feature and "more" would be available for Elden Ring players, and while this edition was announced for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>, FromSoftware confirmed the additional content will also be available on other platforms as DLC.</p>

<p>And now, we have a better idea of just what that previously teased "more" is, with the news that two new classes are coming to Elden Ring.</p>
<p>As shared by <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202505/41423">Famitsu</a>, these classes are Knight of Ides and Heavy Knight (via machine translation). At the present time, the developer hasn't said what kind of stats these two new classes will have, so something else to keep an eye out for. Heavy Knight suggests quite a burly class, though.</p>
<p>According to the publication, in addition to these new classes the Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition will also include three new looks for Torent, along with four new types of armour, weapons, and combat techniques.</p>
<p>As to when we will be able to get our hands on this edition of Elden Ring, we are still awaiting a release date. Later this month, though, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-eight-hours-with-elden-ring-nightreign-im-convinced-multiplayer-souls-is-an-exhilarating-rush">co-op spin-off Elden Ring Nightreign will make its debut</a>.</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Nightreign</a> will be released on 30th May across PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S and PC. You can check out the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/here-are-the-pc-requirements-for-elden-ring-nightreign">PC requirements for Elden Ring Nightreign here</a>.</p>
<p>The studio also has a brand-new title known as The Duskbloods in the pipeline. Announced as part of Nintendo's Switch 2 Direct, The Duskbloods is a PvPvE title with online multiplayer, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftwares-the-duskbloods-is-bloodborne-meets-sekiro-meets-dark-souls-with-jetpacks-and-dinos-thrown-in">our Matt noting it looked like "Bloodborne meets Sekiro meets Dark Souls, with jetpacks and dinos thrown in"</a>. </p>
<p>Last week, FromSoftware announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-sales-pass-30m">Elden Ring had shipped over 30m copies worldwide</a> since its release three years ago.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/06/drop-duchy-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Considering just how fundamental Tetris is to gaming history, it’s perhaps a little surprising that it isn’t featured more often in the merry-go-round of genre mashups that we so often see. Drop Duchy takes those iconic tetrominos and transforms them into land tiles, blending the block-dropping puzzle with deck building, roguelite progression and a theme that would feel fitting for a physical board game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Drop Duchy - Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n-1bVOl6iio?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The lands are under threat and/or tyranny from belligerent armies and cruel overlords, and only you can build up your duchy piece by piece to defeat them. Presented with an 8×13 grid, you drop tiles in those oh-so-familiar shapes into place until you either run out of blocks or breach the top of the grid. Unlike Tetris, completing a row doesn’t vanish it from view, but instead rewards you with resources for each of the tiles it contains, adding permanence to every decision you make.</p>


<p>Mixed in with the standard land tiles are buildings of several types. Production buildings will draw resources from their surroundings, often transforming the land at the same time – a farm will turn plains into wheat fields, there’s forestry buildings that can clear woodland or draw upon it, mining tiles, and more. But then there’s the military buildings for both yourself and, in a combat round, for your enemies, and they will also have various conditions and modifiers to determine how many troops they supply. A watchtower needs to be near plains and fields to supply you with archers, a siege camp can reduce the units on nearby enemy buildings, the alarm tower recruits when aligned vertically or horizontally with enemy buildings, and on and on and on.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there’s only very minimal time pressure applied to you during this. Yes, blocks left alone will slowly start to drop, but you have so much time to consider your plans and look at the next three tiles coming to decide what to do. Additionally, you can put a block in reserve (which can effectively remove an enemy tile from the action, if you hold it to the end of the round), and swapping in and out of reserve resets the block to the top of the grid, so again, you’ve got acres of time to make your mind up.</p>


<p>At the end of a round with enemies is the combat phase, adding yet another layer to the puzzling. You connect up all of the military units, simplistically adding allied units together and subtracting enemies, but the order in which you do these is important. Units recruited are either light (sword), heavy (axe) or ranged (arrows), and there’s a typical triangle of strengths and weaknesses between them, giving a 1.5x multiplier so that 12 archers can take out 18 axes, for example. Merging units together unites them all as one unit type, determined by whichever had the higher number. Once again, you can play this out in so many different ways, toying with the multipliers and how stacks are added together.</p>
<p>If you come out the other side with enemies left over, that number is chipped away from your duchy’s health stat, so a “loss” isn’t necessarily the end of a run.</p>
<p>Each area builds up to a boss battle, the first of which constrains you within a subsection of the grid while having a large health count for you to defeat. The second and third then start to put even more strictures on your placement, at the penalty of bolstering the enemy forces, and they all make for a refreshing change of pace. However, there’s only three of these bosses, and while they can force your hand into disadvantageous block placement, they’re easy to defeat on a good run.</p>
<p>You chart your own path through the overworld, heading down different branches to decide what to tackle next. You can often choose between rounds that have combat and that are peaceful –&nbsp;though this boosts the impending boss battle –&nbsp;and you’re also shown the split between terrain types which could advantage your deck at that time. You also have resource spots to dole out lump sums, trading posts and more.</p>

<p>Even in your first few runs, there’s so many variable that emerge as you go from round to round. Each round rewards you with a choice of three building cards, and you can then spend resources to level them up and increase their efficacy and range –&nbsp;a level 3 farm is something to behold and incredibly empowering to a level 3 watchtower that it envelops in fields.</p>
<p>However, you’ll start to complete tasks and missions (like recruiting a certain number with a particular military building) for the overarching progression, unlocking new buildings, river terrain and buildings, new technology cards that act as passive modifiers, and eventually two more factions that play very differently to the starting one. Shifting from being able to quite purely focus on military buildings to needing to build a town around a belfry changes the tone and how you tackle the puzzle.</p>
<p>There’s also increasing difficulty levels and modifiers to put further restrictions on you, like not being able to huddle enemy buildings together or their power is amplified, or having a smaller grid to play on. You do have that compulsive feel of wanting to play another run in Drop Duchy, and these added challenges will give more to those that want them, but at the same time, I’m fairly content after half a dozen successful runs and seeing what each faction has to offer.</p>

			<p>The latest PC games to receive support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation are MechWarrior 5: Clans, New World: Aeternum, and Spirit of the North 2.</p>
<p>MechWarrior 5: Clans is the Unreal Engine 5-powered single-player and co-op campaign focused spin-off of MechWarrior 5. The game launched in October 2024 <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-3-is-in-mechwarrior-5-clans-a-quiet-place-road-ahead-and-forgive-me-father-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with support for NVIDIA DLSS 3 Frame Generation</a>; tomorrow, with the debut of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3463200/MechWarrior_5_Clans__Ghost_Bear_Flash_Storm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ghost Bear: Flash Storm story-based DLC</a>, Clans will be updated to support NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, enabling much faster frame rates on GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards. Moreover, the NVIDIA app override functionality will be updated to allow users to manually upgrade the existing NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution CNN model to the newest transformer one for improved image quality.</p>
<p>In exactly a week from today, Amazon Games will launch Season 8 - Season of the Divide for its MMORPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-aeternum-officially-launches-today-on-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-and-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New World: Aeternum</a>. The new Season will introduce the new Outpost Rush map Coral Divide, Capture The Flag maps, a new 3v3 Arena map, seasonal events, limited-time world events featuring iconic bosses from the dungeons, the barbershop, and several combat updates included tuned aim assist for controller users. New World: Aeternum will also now default to using DirectX 12 on Steam, and the developers have improved visuals and performance on NVIDIA GPUs thanks to the addition of NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation.</p>
<p>In two days, the third-person adventure sequel <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1778840/Spirit_of_the_North_2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spirit of the North 2</a> will let players once again wander in a mysterious world as a lonely fox. This game will support NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation from day one.</p>
<p>There are also PC games that still adopt just the regular NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution. For example, the realistic multiplayer first-person shooter game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2406770/Bodycam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bodycam</a> was recently updated to support DLSS SR, and Frame Generation will be added soon. Bossa's cooperative open world survival game adventure,&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/bossa-games-upcoming-lost-skies-officially-due-to-arrive-in-early-access-later-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lost Skies,</a> recently launched on Steam Early Access with DLSS Super Resolution integration.</p>
<p>The side-scrolling action RPG <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1721060/Mandragora_Whispers_of_the_Witch_Tree/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mandragora: Whispers of the Witch Tree</a> also featured NVIDIA DLSS SR support when it launched on Steam, and the same goes for the first-person horror adventure <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2019760/Necrophosis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Necrophosis</a>. The latter game also offers a demo to check out ahead of the purchase.</p>

			<p>Among the many high games I checked out during Gamescom last year was&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/hordes-of-hunger-hands-on-preview-monster-survivors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hordes of Hunger</a>, a unique blend of mechanics lifted from Vampire Survivors, Hades, and hack-and-slash games. Though my test session was short, I was immediately captivated by the smoothness of the gameplay and the character-building possibilities the game seemed to offer right from the beginning. Though it seemed to lack a bit of polish compared to other similar games, I felt the game had a ton of potential with its relatively straightforward formula almost reminiscent of an arcade game that made it very easy to get into.</p>
<p>Following the release of a demo version that was generally very well-received, Hordes of Hunger is now available as an Early Access release on Steam. After spending a dozen or so hours with the very first public release of the game, I can only say that my expectations after trying the game for the first time last year were almost completely met.</p>

<p>The <em>"3D action survivorlike" </em>developed by Hyperstrange doesn't waste any time getting the player into the thick of the action. After starting the game, main character Mirah awakens in the Sanctum, the only safe haven for humanity after the Beast and its ravenous hordes have stripped the land bare, ready to take on these hordes and save the world. Much like in the aforementioned Hades, the story develops as Mirah completes quests set in several different locations and rescues other central characters that will also offer additional services to help the warrior overcome even more challenging enemies. These services are generally standard fare for the genre, such as purchasing permanent perks from the Father, buffing meals from the Mother, or crafting new weapons at the Workshop, and they are extremely easy to understand and take full advantage of.</p>
<p>This simplicity works quite well in the context of Hordes of Hunger, as the game wants the player to constantly be out and about to fight the hordes of the Beast, hordes whose strength changes depending on the location and how many quests have already been completed in it. For example, the Main Square will be the starting point for all players, as it features the easiest enemies, while the Watermill and the Forest feature from the very first Horde Extermination quest some advanced enemy types that require players to be at the very least familiar with the different weapon types, which range from the basic all-rounder sword to the hard hitting hammer and the mobile spear, their heavy attacks, which require Focus built by fighting enemies, special attacks and the general use of the skills learned as Mirah levels up during quests.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250428120718_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>As I highlighted last year, the skill system, along with the smooth, fast-paced, satisfying gameplay, is the feature that best defines Hordes of Hunger. The first public version of the game features a nice selection of skills that range from simple stat buffs to unique abilities like auras that deal elemental damage, additional attacks with phantom weapons, dodge and parry enhancements and so on that can not only be enhanced multiple times, but that also synergize well, and unexpectedly in some cases. As Miriah levels up reasonably quickly, and can do so even faster by acquiring certain perks, it doesn't take too long for the warrior to get powered up and see all sorts of special elemental effects go off at once, which, to be honest, tends to be a little distracting and often makes it difficult to understand what is going on amidst all the chaos. This is, in my opinion, one of the biggest issues found in Hordes of Hunger in its first Early Access release, alongside the unpolished and somewhat clunky menus that don't feel designed for controllers, especially the weapon crafting interface, where it is difficult to see which element is highlighted.</p>
<p>With so many combat options at the player's disposal right from the get-go, varied quests that range from simple extermination of enemies to simple escort and target destruction quests, and the promise of bigger things to come down the line, Hordes of Hunger is a well worth purchase even in its current state for players looking for a game that is highly addictive, feels great to play and doesn't require tens of hours to get going. While the experience could become a little repetitive after a few hours, its solid direction is remarkable, and I hope developer Hyperstrange will continue to spice up the experience ahead of its 1.0 release, which has yet to be dated.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/backbone-pro-announcement</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/backbone-announces-backbone-pro-controller-for-any-screen.1181937/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/backbone-pro-announcement<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Mobile controller company Backbone has announced the Backbone Pro, a new controller whose stated aim is to let you play on "any screen with a single device".</p>

<p>The controller, which is out now via Backbone's website, is designed for a world in which "more people are playing across platforms than ever before", the company says. It's got two principal modes: Handheld and Wireless.</p>

<p>In Handheld mode, you'll connect the controller to a mobile device via USB-C for "zero latency and no need to charge", while in Wireless mode, the Backbone Pro will connect via Bluetooth. It'll work with devices like phones, tablets, laptops and PCs (with Bluetooth functionality), and VR headsets, as well as smart TVs.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/backbone-pro-controller-fortnite.jpg?itok=0brwFsvY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/backbone-pro-controller-fortnite.jpg?itok=8xRVsaiM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Backbone Pro wants to let you game anywhere with just one controller.</figcaption></figure><p>Not only that, but the controller will come complete with an app that lets you change remembered devices with a single tap, allowing you to switch seamlessly between gaming platforms.</p>

<p>Backbone says it had to "rethink everything" to make the Pro work, "from industrial design to firmware". The company goes on to say that the controller constitutes "one of the most comfortable handheld gaming products ever built".</p>

<p>According to Backbone, the Pro will feature full-size console-style joysticks, and you can remap every single button on the controller, including its back paddles. You can also create specific game profiles and switch between them within the Backbone app.</p>

<p>Rather uniquely, the Backbone Pro also comes with its own "built-in emulator" that will feature a "rotating library of free games" if you sign up to the Backbone Plus subscription service. Backbone doesn't reveal what those games are, though.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/backbone-pro-controller-emulator.jpg?itok=-t-Vh122 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/backbone-pro-controller-emulator.jpg?itok=4uCMBzl0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A retro emulator is included with the Backbone Pro, although we don't know what games will come with it yet.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, since there's a USB-C port on the Backbone Pro, you can also hook it up to your PC for some good old-fashioned wired gaming. Naturally, though, the controller won't work as an Xbox or PlayStation peripheral, nor can you hook it up to your Switch or Switch 2.</p>

<p>The Backbone Pro is available right now via Backbone's website.</p>

That process included dozens of user studies and thousands of component iterations geared toward finding the most comfortable controller for as many players as possible. Ergonomics are subjective, but the difference between the Backbone Pro and Backbone One is immediately noticeable. The Pro model is by no means bulky, but the more rounded, chunkier handles feel more natural.</p><p>The redesign is especially beneficial for longer play sessions. If you, like me, find the Backbone One to be somewhat uncomfortable when playing for longer than 30 minutes to an hour, the Pro's form factor is much friendlier in this regard. It caters better to those with larger hands without sacrificing the compact design that many people love. My four-year-old son tested the Backbone Pro with several Apple Arcade games without any issues with the larger size.</p><p>When I picked up the Backbone Pro for the first time, my ring fingers rested naturally on the M1 and M2 back buttons. Depending on your hand size and how you hold the controller, it might be more natural for you to use your middle fingers instead. Back buttons are no longer novel features like they once were, but it's a meaningful addition nonetheless.</p><p>The presence of back buttons spurred a substantial improvement within the Backbone App. If you want to remap your controls on the Backbone One on iPhone, you have to exit the app and use Apple's dedicated game controller settings menu. On Android, the only official option is Backbone's TouchSync feature, which is restricted to Backbone+ subscribers. Thankfully, the Backbone Pro supports input customization within the official app. You can quickly set up as many custom profiles as you want, remap buttons, adjust trigger and stick sensitivity, and create deadzones for both.</p><p>Speaking of the sticks and triggers, it's worth reiterating that while the Backbone Pro has Hall Effect triggers, it does <em>not </em>have Hall Effect sticks. The Backbone Pro's full-sized sticks are certainly nicer than the shorter ones found in the original. They offer a smooth range of motion and feel precise, but these are still ALPS sticks. Though ALPS remains the most widely used analog stick technology--Nintendo, Microsoft, and Sony all use it in their controllers--ALPS sticks are susceptible to drifting issues. The anti-friction thumbstick ring should act as an extra layer of protection, but it's still disappointing that a $170 pro-style controller doesn't have Hall Effect sticks.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4488226-backbonebuttonmapping.png" data-ref-id="1300-4488226" data-ratio="0.456" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4488226-backbonebuttonmapping.png" data-ref-id="1300-4488226"></a><figcaption>Remapping buttons in the Backbone App</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4488226-backbonebuttonmapping.png"></figure><p>Like the original, the Backbone Pro's greatest asset is its ability to turn your phone into a Switch-like gaming handheld. The ability to use the Backbone Pro as a wireless controller for other devices via Bluetooth is an interesting bonus. I tested the Backbone Pro on my PC, MacBook, iPad, Steam Deck, and Meta Quest 3S. From a pure performance perspective, the Backbone Pro works well as a wireless controller. The app remembers your devices, and you can swap between them almost instantly. Customization and game-specific profile support could make using the controller as a traditional gamepad enticing for some. As an Apple Arcade subscriber, it's neat to have control profiles that can be used for the same game across iPhone, iPad, and Mac</p><p>If you already have a pro-style wireless controller for PC and mobile, the Backbone Pro probably won't replace that. Without a phone attached, it feels a bit too light as a standalone wireless controller. Plus, if you're like me, you might have a hard time getting past the visual aesthetic of the Backbone Pro without a phone between each half.</p><p>At $170, the Backbone Pro is one of the most expensive dedicated mobile controllers around. It's $70 more than the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BACKBONE-Mobile-Gaming-Controller-Android-iOS/dp/B0CCT2TJW4?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Backbone One ($100)</a> and $20 more than the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Gaming-Controller-Android-iPhone-Smartphone/dp/B0CXGMPLWK?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Razer Kishi Ultra</a>, a high-end mobile controller that released last year. For Android users, it sounds even more expensive when you consider that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Gaming-Controller-Bluetooth-Joysticks-Console/dp/B0DK36N98Q?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Controller</a> costs $50 and is equipped with Hall Effect sticks/triggers and back buttons. But Backbone's mobile gaming experience remains unmatched thanks to the Backbone App, and the Pro takes notable strides forward in software utilization.</p><p>If you use your Backbone One at least a few times each week, you will likely appreciate the Pro's upgrades. And if you've avoided the Backbone One purely because you thought it was too small, you should give the new Pro model a look.</p><p>Existing Backbone users can also take advantage of one of the most exciting new features in the Backbone App: a built-in emulator on iOS and Android for NES, SNES, and Game Boy games (GB, GBC, and GBA). It's currently in beta, but I tested homebrew games for each platform and found the experience to be as smooth as other retro emulators on iOS.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4488234-backbone_emulator_beta.png" data-ref-id="1300-4488234" data-ratio="0.461" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4488234-backbone_emulator_beta.png" data-ref-id="1300-4488234"></a><figcaption>Backbone Emulator plays NES, Super Nintendo, and Game Boy ROMs.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4488234-backbone_emulator_beta.png"></figure><hr><p><em>Backbone provided GameSpot with a pre-launch sample for testing.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ecco-dolphin-remasters-new-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Ecco the Dolphin&nbsp;</em>creator Ed Annunziata has revealed that remasters of the first two games in the series are on the way, and that a brand new entry in the franchise is also in the works.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/05/xbox-asian-pacific-islander-heritage-month-2025/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">interview</a> as part of Xbox's Asian and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, Annunziata says that remasters of&nbsp;<em>Ecco the Dolphin&nbsp;</em>and its 1994 followup&nbsp;<em>Ecco the Dolphin: The Tides of Time&nbsp;</em>are on the cards, although it's not clear whether work on said remasters has begun yet.</p>

<p>He then says a "new, third game" that features "contemporary play and GPU sensibilities" will be made, although it's not clear whether he means a third modern project or a third&nbsp;<em>Ecco&nbsp;</em>game overall.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ecco-the-dolphin-remasters-new-game-website-countdown.jpg?itok=mKGlFMeC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ecco-the-dolphin-remasters-new-game-website-countdown.jpg?itok=P3-AdhKD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>At time of writing, this is what you see if you visit the&nbsp;<em>Ecco the Dolphin&nbsp;</em>website.</figcaption></figure><p>If it's the latter, then Annunziata is perhaps unfairly skipping over 1995's&nbsp;<em>Ecco Jr.</em>, its rather odd Sega Pico-only sequel, and 2000's Dreamcast game&nbsp;<em>Ecco the Dolphin: Defender of the Future</em>, which was due to get its own sequel before the Dreamcast's demise.</p>

<p>Either way, Annunziata says interested fans should keep an eye on the official&nbsp;<em>Ecco the Dolphin&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.eccothedolphin.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>. At time of writing, said website shows only a counter that seems to promise some kind of announcement or reveal at the end of April next year, counting down around 8,500 hours to do so.</p>

<p>In the interview, Annunziata says he believes that "gamers possess a higher than average IQ" when compared to "the average human". This he puts down to gamers' "socially connected" nature, as well as the fact (as he says) that they're "frequently fully engaged and challenged mentally with real-time systems and information technology".</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Ecco the Dolphin&nbsp;</em>revival will surely bring at least a modicum of joy to those who were hoping that&nbsp;<em>Dolphin Quest</em>, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/intellivision-amico-reveals-new-game-from-ecco-dolphin-team" rel="nofollow">spiritual successor</a> originally touted for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/leaked-intellivision-amico-documents-paint-grim-picture" rel="nofollow">ill-fated</a> Intellivision Amico, would come to fruition. There's a much better chance of&nbsp;<em>Ecco&nbsp;</em>happening than&nbsp;<em>Dolphin Quest</em>, that's for sure.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dolphin-quest-ecco-the-dolphin-team.jpg?itok=W_vhp-6T 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dolphin-quest-ecco-the-dolphin-team.jpg?itok=L9yoNdqR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dolphin Quest&nbsp;</em>probably isn't happening, is it?</figcaption></figure><p><em>Ecco the Dolphin&nbsp;</em>is just one of the many classic IPs Sega is currently in the process of reviving. Others include the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sega-new-virtua-fighter-game" rel="nofollow"><em>Virtua Fighter</em></a>, ninja platformer series&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shinobi-movie-announced" rel="nofollow"><em>Shinobi</em></a>, and wacky arcade racer&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crazy-taxi-reboot-open-world-mmo" rel="nofollow"><em>Crazy Taxi</em></a>.</p>

<p>It's likely we'll get to hear more about the&nbsp;<em>Ecco the Dolphin&nbsp;</em>revival in the coming months, although it's not clear whether the above timer is counting down to a release or just a reveal. Stay tuned for more.</p>

weapons, infiltrate enemy strongholds in search of information, or challenge more dangerous enemies and dungeon-like lairs to unlock unique items. In all of this, players can choose to travel together, or split up and try to cover more ground. Throughout the day, players may encounter random events or be interrupted by unexpected enemies.</p><p>When night falls, the focus shifts to survival--an ever-contracting ring of fire pushes the player-characters towards a boss fight, which on the final night will be the challenging Nightlord. Whether players triumph against the Nightlord or fall short, they will be able to return to the hub world, the Roundtable Hold, with relics and currency to upgrade and equip their character for the next run.</p><p>Players can pick from one of eight classes, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date-trailer-news-everything-we-know/2900-6095/" data-ref-id="2900-6095">four of which</a> were available to try in the Nightreign network test--Guardian, Duchess, Recluse, and Wylder. The gameplay overview goes into more detail about two more classes--a ranged archer known as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-new-ironeye-class-is-an-agile-archer-that-deals-death-from-afar/1100-6530523/" data-ref-id="1100-6530523">Ironeye</a>, and a heavy-hitting melee fighter called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/elden-ring-nightreign-raider-character-gameplay-trailer/2300-6465900/" data-ref-id="2300-6465900">Raider</a>. Two more Nightfarers are shown in the trailer, but are not detailed. The Executor's name is briefly revealed in a clip of the character selection screen, but not much else has been revealed about the katana-wielding warrior. The final Nightfarer is shown to be a pale woman with a harp, but not much is known about this final character, including her abilities or even her name.</p><p>Players will be able to customize their Nightfarers to a degree with skins--including some based on other From Software games, with Faraam, Solaire, and Leonhard-inspired skins shown off in the gameplay video. There will also be a narrative aspect to the Nightfarer, with players undertaking a journey to recover their characters' lost memories.</p><p>Elden Ring Nightreign releases on May 30 for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC via Steam.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-2m</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-top-2m-in-less-than-two-weeks.1181856/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-2m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Sandfall Interactive and publisher Kepler Interactive have announced that JRPG-inspired adventure&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>has hit another big sales milestone less than two weeks after its initial release.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/expedition33/status/1919701863491838316" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, the two studios reveal that&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>has reached two million sales since its launch in late April. The figure means the game has picked up another million and a half sales since <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-500k" rel="nofollow">very quickly hitting 500,000</a>&nbsp;on launch day.</p>

<p>Sandfall says it's "watched in awe" as players flocked to&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, "feeling every step, every emotion, every revelation" alongside those playing through the&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy</em>-style RPG.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-2m-boss.jpg?itok=USkaGTri 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-2m-boss.jpg?itok=83SgQxfC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Turn-based RPG&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>is selling pretty well.</figcaption></figure><p>As before, the two million figure is particularly impressive when considering that&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>is also available on Game Pass (as part of the PC and Ultimate tiers, at least), so two million people have bought it rather than opting to play it via the subscription service.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, it's a turn-based RPG inspired by the&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>series, and it's also a pretty strong argument against&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>producer Naoki Yoshida's <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/final-fantasy-16-ditched-turn-based-combat-to-appeal-to-younger-generations-producer-says/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">assertions</a> that gamers don't want turn-based games anymore.</p>

<p>The game follows the titular Expedition 33 as it sets out to put an end to the Paintress, a solemn and terrifying figure who paints increasingly low numbers each year, with everyone of the equivalent age perishing as she paints.</p>

<p>It features staples of the JRPG genre like an overworld map with plenty of optional locations to explore, party members that can be swapped out on the fly, and turn-based battles (albeit with real-time elements and a parry system).</p>

			<p>The price of video games started rising in 2020, but even if that didn't happen five years ago, a price increase would have happened sooner or later for a few reasons, according to former PlayStation president Shuhei Yoshida.</p>
<p>Speaking in a lengthy interview with&nbsp;<a href="https://playstationinside.fr/interview-shuhei-yoshida-playstation-inside-english-version" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation Inside</a>, Yoshida-san was asked about the increase in video game prices, which may become more normalized with the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2. According to the former PlayStation president, this price increase would have happened sooner or later, regardless of who would have been the initiator. Inflation is real and significant, Yoshida-san continued, and the fact that players expect ever more ambitious games with rising production costs is a combination that can only increase the price of games.</p>
<p>To keep production costs under control and continue producing the AAA games the public buys, Shuhei Yoshida added, industry actors are keen to diversify their revenues. This is the reason behind the proliferation of remasters, remakes, and PC ports, as they are an easy solution to bring in profits to finance new games. Subscription services and GAAS titles also help finance AAA games.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the former PlayStation president feels that a balance between production costs and game prices must be found. GTA 6 will obviously be a case in point, but the recent Clair Obscure: Expedition 33 has shown that it is possible to release an excellent game with tighter teams and budgets without compromising quality.</p>
<p>It isn't just Nintendo that is increasing the price of its games in the near future, but also Microsoft. While the publisher did not increase game prices when the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S generation began, some of its games will be priced at <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-xs-price-increase-europe/">$80 starting this holiday season</a>. The price of the Xbox Series X has also been increased worldwide, with the steepest increase in the United States.</p>
