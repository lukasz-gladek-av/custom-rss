			<p>Team Cherry is almost three months removed from finally releasing Hollow Knight Silksong, one of the most anticipated games ever and one of 2025's best releases. It's <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-5-million-audience-overlaps-soulslike/">sold millions of copies</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-nominees-full-list/">earned five nominations at The Game Awards</a>, including Game of the Year. After seven years of development and such a roaring success, you might think Team Cherry is taking a bit of a break to reap its rewards. Not so, it would seem, as the small studio is already working on DLC for Silksong, and has begun thinking about games outside of the world of Hollow Knight.</p>



<p>All this comes from a new interview with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-28/the-makers-of-hollow-knight-silksong-aren-t-done-just-yet?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NDM0NzQzNiwiZXhwIjoxNzY0OTUyMjM2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNkczNjFLR0NUSDAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.nHDv04b3quPAcWKT5nBOeCqr1KCS01wBn_nMscKzzng&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg</a>, which includes a solid chunk of spoilers for Hollow Knight Silksong, so if you've not finished Silksong yet, but want to hear how Team Cherry is reacting to how the game was received, be prepared for spoilers. </p>



<p>On the topic of non-spoiler territory and on DLCs, when Bloomberg's Jason Schreier asked about Steel Assassin Sharpe, Ari Gibson said, "<em>Just waiting in the wings. Waiting to arrive is probably the best way to say it. One of those enemies, a little suite of Sharpe and their companions, they got tucked away for a while because the game had so much in it. And all of these pieces need polish, and polish takes time. We're excited to reintroduce Sharpe. We just have to get to them</em>."</p>



<p>Schreier immediately followed up by asking if the Village of Lions was part of its DLC plans that were tucked away and are now waiting in the wings, to which Gibson responded, "<em>We will make sure to deliver on all of our obligations. One, because they're going</em> <em>to be very fun to do. But even alongside those tasks we had our own ideas for extra things that could be added to the world. We're trying to juggle when that could potentially be</em>."</p>



<p>As far as when these extra bits of content and DLC updates are coming, the truth is that Team Cherry is not sure. "<em>We didn’t plan seven years for </em><em>Silksong</em>," said Gibson. "<em>Not that we expect to take an excessive amount of time, but we still are pursuing the same development philosophy, which sometimes can expand our timeframe</em>."</p>



<p>Regarding what Team Cherry will do after Silksong, Gibson and William Pellen, the other half of Team Cherry's core, both admitted that they have ideas for what would be next. The question is how much longer they have in this life to get to them.</p>



<p>"<em>We haven't thought that much about the time, but we've thought about the ideas that we have, the stuff we want to make and put in there</em>," said Pellen. "<em>And then we do have other games that we plan to make</em>," Gibson continued. </p>



<p>"<em>The only time concern really is - and we've talked about this before - death. It's not that far off if you spend seven years per project, and potentially add another two. So it'd be nice to do a few more games. Apparently our timeframe still allows us to fit a few more in. Short of an unexpected tragedy.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>We have said we'll go elsewhere,</em>" Gibson added. "<em>Although we've also said those experiences will still be about exploring big worlds full of weird characters and giant bosses and whatnot. So there would be a through line there that people will be familiar with. That's not to say we won't return to these Hollow Knight worlds. We do have ideas around what forms those would take. But we also don't want to be exclusively people that make Hollow Knight</em>."</p>



<p>That said, Gibson was quick to clarify that he and Pellen aren't sick of making Hollow Knight. Gibson said that if they were forced to make another Hollow Knight game right now, "<em>it'd be a joy.</em>" The drive to go beyond the games that made Team Cherry a household name in the industry is rooted in their own creative endeavours to try something new. </p>



<p>"<em>It'd be interesting for us to explore the same things we're interested in but maybe in a slightly different genre, slightly different theme, and how that affects the stories we come up with. We're interested to see what would happen ourselves</em>."</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Warframe: The Old Peace Gets December 10 Launch Date; Android CBT Live Now]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/warframe-the-old-peace-gets-december-10-launch-date-android-cbt-live-now/</link>
            <guid>1367722</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today, Digital Extremes announced that Warframe is getting <a href="https://wccftech.com/warframe-to-get-the-old-peace-in-2025-tau-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Old Peace update</a> on December 10 across all platforms. The Old Peace represents the next Narrative Chapter for the ongoing Warframe storyline, but it also introduces two brand new game modes to shake up the gameplay experience.</p>



<p>The first one, called Descendia, is a roguelite-style, weekly-rotating Tower mode where players descend through increasingly challenging levels in pursuit of rewards. Progression allows for deeper starting floors and varied loot each week, keeping things fresh. </p>



<p>The second is Perita Rebellion, a time-limited '12-minute war' mode that challenges players or squads to complete as many randomized objectives as possible on the moon Parita before facing a bespoke boss fight. Players will face intense time pressure and must therefore make robust use of the new movement options, such as the enhanced grappling. Perita Rebellion's bosses are randomly assigned and include encounters with the Prime Vanguard and other unique enemies. This mode will also have players fending off the Anarchs, the newest enemy faction added to the game.</p>



<p>Another big new addition brought by The Old Peace is the introduction of the Tauron Strikes into Warframe. This is a set of five all-new Focus School Ultimates, unlocking legendary artifact weapons (e.g., sword, hammer, staff), which can then be modded and enhanced through a bespoke interface. These are the Naramon Strike (Vexoric), the Unairu Strike (Cogron), and the final three that have been shown in today's devstream: Madurai's Thara, Vazarin's Nidri, and Zenurik's Lorak. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Warframe | The Old Peace Official Teaser - Coming December 10 To All Platforms!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F2a4_rkcbyM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Players will use the new Perita Rebellion resources and Focus to unlock and upgrade each Tauron Strike. These powers drastically enhance Operator/Drifter gameplay, with artifact acquisition and empowerment tightly integrated into the new game modes and narrative content, as planned by the studio.</p>



<p>A new limited-time Operation, Blood of Perita, will be available between December 16 and January 6. Players must gather Marks of Valiance from the Perita Rebellion and other Alert mission completions, found via the Star Chart map, then take these spoils to Roathe of the Devil's Triad in exchange for time-limited rewards, including the new, evolving Loyaus Chest Armour cosmetic item and an exclusive Honoria player title. This new Operation will only be accessible to players who have completed The Old Peace narrative quest.</p>



<p>Just like with most big Warframe updates, The Old Peace comes with a new playable Warframe, Uriel, who's thematically inspired by World War I and trench warfare. Uriel, the game's 63rd Warframe, introduces the bayonet class Vinquibus, a hybrid weapon that functions as both a semi-automatic primary firearm and a melee weapon, featuring fluid auto-switching between stances. Uriel's kit centers around direct, frontline aggressive combat, summoning demon minions, and activating powerful comet-style movement abilities. Urile's build paths allow for deep customization, as both the primary and melee forms can be independently modded for varied combat approaches.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/TheOldPeace_Screenshot_UrielAltHelm_4K_NoLogo-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Lore-wise, Uriel originated as the Protoframe Roathe of The Devil’s Triad. This demon commander embodies the rage of a thwarted imperial takeover and temporal banishment thanks to the meddling of Dr. Entrati. Uriel can be unlocked for free by collecting the required Blueprints and resources via The Descendia. Alternatively, if you have Platinum currency to spare, you can unlock the Warframe right away from the Marketplace.</p>



<p>The Old Peace makes Warframe prettier, too. A significant visual overhaul is coming for Operators and Drifters; all their faces and hairstyles have been remastered for improved fidelity. There are even additional options for character customization. The update also features improved lighting, material fidelity, and entirely new environmental tile sets, especially for Perita, the focal moon of new lore and battlefields. The user interface and map have also been overhauled for clarity, featuring new icons and improved navigation.</p>



<p>As mentioned in the headline, the Android Closed Beta Test is out today, nearly two years after <a href="https://wccftech.com/warframe-finally-makes-its-way-into-ios-release-expected-by-20th-februrary/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warframe launched on iOS</a>. You can try your luck at being selected <a href="https://www.warframe.com/android" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the official website</a>. There's more, as Digital Extremes already confirmed the dates for TennoCon 2026. The annual convention will take place in London, Ontario, Canada, on the weekend of July 10-11, 2026, and it will also feature a reimagined TennoConcert.</p>



<p>Lastly, the studio teased that Warframe fans eager for a glimpse at the next narrative chapter coming after The Old Peace should tune into The Game Awards 2025 on December 11.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Best Indie Game Deals Holiday 2025: Steam & Console]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/best-indie-game-deals-holiday-2025/</link>
            <guid>1367710</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Indie games can be more fun than big-budget AAA titles. 2025’s indie catalog ranges from intense ball-bouncing affairs to the chance to become a dealer of rather sus substances. This Holiday 2025 guide covers hit indie games across console and PC.</p>



<p>Ben Starr said it best when he was accepting Balatro’s award for Debut Game at the BAFTA Games Awards 2025: “Play more independent games like Animal Well, they are the lifeblood of this industry.” It’s true, with the industry as reluctant as ever to splash millions on a AAA title, it’s the ‘smaller’ games that love to grab the headlines.</p>



<p>Check out the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/holiday-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Holiday 2025 hub</a>&nbsp;for the best deals available across all platforms, gifts, and more.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-indie-games-you-should-buy-for-holiday-2025">Best Indie Games You Should Buy For Holiday 2025 </h2>



<h3 id="h-hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Stay between the waves. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>It happened, it finally happened in 2025! Hollow Knight: Silksong was released, and Team Cherry can stop being pestered about the game’s existence…until Hollow Knight 3. The brutally difficult Metroidvania title is up for Game of the Year, and rightly so. It’s a masterclass in platforming, exploring, and nuanced combat.</p>







<h3 id="h-hades-2">Hades 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Supergiant Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>You could argue Hades 2 is teetering on the edge of being a AA game or more, but the fact is that Supergiant Games is still an indie developer, and an incredibly gifted one. The first Hades was a breath of fresh air, and Hades 2 builds on the success of the first game with great aplomb. The roguelike sequel delves into the depths of the Underworld to pull out an absolute indie winner in 2025.</p>







<h3 id="h-peak">Peak</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to landcrab</figcaption></figure>



<p>Now we’re getting <em>really </em>into indie territory. Peak adopted the successful formula from recent years of putting multiple players in a group, where they must work together to win. Peak asks you to climb a mountain, and that’s the game’s task in a nutshell. But getting there is no mean feat, and you have to use all the tools at your disposal as you dice with danger and death.</p>







<h3 id="h-escape-from-duckov">Escape From Duckov</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Team Soda</figcaption></figure>



<p>Escape From Duckov leans dangerously close to Escape From Tasrkov’s territory, but the fact is that they are both very different games. Yes, Escape From Duckov is an extraction shooter, but one with a huge player base, as the community has become enamored by super-soldier ducks. Don’t be put off by its name; this is an excellent game with its own identity.</p>







<h3 id="h-schedule-1">Schedule 1</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to TVGS</figcaption></figure>



<p>The indie breakout hit of the year: Schedule 1. The narcotic-creating and selling RPG quickly amassed a wide audience, with over half a million players hopping in concurrently at one point. It’s had a consistent stream of new content since, and will go down as one of the biggest indie successes of 2025.</p>







<h3 id="h-dispatch">Dispatch</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to AdHoc Studio</figcaption></figure>



<p>An episodic game about a superhero workplace and its cast of heroes sounds good on paper, and works even better in reality. Developer AdHoc Studio includes employees from the now-defunct Telltale Games, and the themes and design choices have carried over seamlessly into Dispatch.</p>







<h3 id="h-repo">REPO</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to semiwork</figcaption></figure>



<p>It was halfway through the year that we learned that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/repo-is-the-best-selling-steam-game-of-2025/">REPO was the best-selling Steam game of 2025</a>. REPO borrows the odd multiplayer ingredient from Content Warning and Lethal Company to create an entertaining and terrifying time. This is for people who love wacky multiplayer games they can play with their friends—and Insider Gaming has made REPO even cheaper to grab!</p>







<h3 id="h-ball-x-pit">Ball X Pit</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Kenny Sun</figcaption></figure>



<p>Making a semi-on-rails ball-launching and bouncing game with roguelike elements and quickfire runs sounds like it has too much going on to work. Ball X Pit has metaphorically kicked that notion in the aforementioned ball pit, and unique is probably the most apt adjective, as there are few games like it. Each run is different; there are many characters with different abilities to use, and it requires you to think on your toes.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>My desktop is very busy. This is largely by my own design. I use a laptop, but I split my screen into two. At any given moment, I've got two browser windows open—the Google Doc where I'm writing this draft is open on the right side of the screen, with my email open in the browser window next to it. Sometimes, I'll swap the email out for Discord, Slack, or a spreadsheet I use to keep track of my freelance work. Unfortunately for my attention span, I also often have a little game running at the bottom of my screen: something like <em>Rusty's Retirement</em>, <em>Nanomon: Virtual Pet</em>, or <em>Cornerpond</em>.</p><p>These are all semi-idle games,which require some attention every so often. Plant eggplants, feed my virtual pet, reel in a fish. I usually find these sorts of minor distractions helpful; they're little breaks but aren't as distracting as picking up my phone and scrolling.&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><p><em>Tiny Aquarium</em> is the latest idle game I've added to my desktop. From developer Lunheim, <em>Tiny Aquarium</em> is literally an aquarium that runs on the bottom of your desktop screen. It just requires a little bit of setup before you can watch your little fishes thrive.&nbsp;</p><p>If you're familiar with Facebook's <em>Happy Aquarium</em>, <a href="https://www.sfweekly.com/archives/happy-aquarium-facebook-game-spurs-not-so-happy-lawsuit/article_bf1a30ab-9031-5c4c-8277-ab9ee3978b38.html?ref=aftermath.site"><u>the super popular aquarium game played by 7 million people daily in its heyday</u></a>, <em>Tiny Aquarium</em> will look familiar. But <em>Tiny Aquarium</em>, despite the name, is actually part fishing game, too, which sets it apart from the likes of <em>Happy Aquarium</em>. You've got to catch the fish that swim around in your aquarium by heading out onto the water in a boat. Pop some corn on the end of your line (or some other bait) and drop your bobber in the water. The fishing minigame is a familiar one: You click to keep a moving bar following a little fish. If you are successful in the minigame, you'll catch the fish.&nbsp;</p><p>There's also a social element to it all, in that you can fish with other players—up to 100 per online ocean or swamp. It gets pretty crowded, which makes it hard to find a space to cast off, which is why I prefer a smaller fishing lobby. I don't find that people fishing in <em>Tiny Aquarium</em> chat all too much (there's chat functionality on the left-hand corner while fishing) but I still like the companionship. A pop-up shows what fish the other players have caught, and you can visit other aquariums from this screen.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Image: Lunheim Studios/Future Friends Games, Gamersky Games</span></figcaption></figure><p>Like any game, there's a grindy element. You've got to unlock items to help care for and grow your aquarium, as well as better bait. It's slow. Fish generate income just by existing, so that's how you earn money to unlock stuff. Customization options are gated off, as are more tanks. Then there's the breeding program. It's all fine—I don't spend a ton of time making active progress toward unlocking any of that stuff. I'm not really concerned with collecting all sorts of different fishes. (Though there are certain fish I do covet, like a collection of carp, my namesake.)&nbsp;</p><p>What I do like, especially, is enjoying the tiny aquarium I've built on the bottom of my screen. The fish do their own thing. Every so often, I fullscreen the game and feed the fish. Then, back to whatever I was doing. Getting to this spot—where you're satisfied with the amount of fish in a particular tank—is reaching that no thoughts, all fish state.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Image: Lunheim Studios/Future Friends Games, Gamersky Games</span></figcaption></figure><p>Fishes hatch, grow, and change, even when the game isn't up-and-running. That's one thing that I've learned the hard way—you can't just abandon the game, but there's a way around keeping your fish alive. You see, I left <em>Tiny Aquarium</em> alone for about a week or so, and when I returned, all my fish were dead. Yikes! My aquarium was all green and slimy, too. Unfortunately for me, I didn't read the fine print, which is the thing about the game running while offline. You can, however, freeze your aquarium if you're not able to pay much attention to it, so your fish won't die.</p><p>Then, you're able to revel in the chilled out aquarium and its exceptionally cute pixel fishes.</p>

It's single Energy cost without having to recycle Runes is an extremely valuable rate both on turn one and in the late game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's going for around $5-$6, so as an uncommon it's a bit pricey. </p></div><p id="tasty-faefolk"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Tasty Faefolk">Tasty Faefolk</h2></p><div catalogid="a8bd2389-2562-406f-8119-f230fbc458d6" id="230460"><div id="230460" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Tasty Faefolk</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Tasty Faefolk sees play in most Calm (green) decks. It's a great late-game finisher on a budget, currently sitting at around $7. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I might not play three of these due to its high cost, but it depends on the deck it's slotted in. </p></div><p id="darius-trifarian"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Darius Trifarian">Darius Trifarian</h2></p><div catalogid="a8bd2389-2562-406f-8119-f230fbc458d6" id="230461"><div id="230461" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Darius Trifarian</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Darius is a considerably good mid-game drop in Fury (red) decks. Midrange strategies like Sett the Boss will often play a copy or two, and you'll likely see him taking up space in the top-tier <a href="https://zdcs.link/QmOgRq?object_uuid=25314409-5722-4403-88c9-ff0d1ee5977d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kai'sa, Daughter of the Void</a> decks as well. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">At $10, it's reasonably priced for a powerful effect. </p></div><p id="falling-star"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Falling Star">Falling Star</h2></p><div catalogid="a8bd2389-2562-406f-8119-f230fbc458d6" id="230462"><div id="230462" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Falling Star</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of Kai'sa, Falling Star is another card this deck typically considers including three copies of. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The two Power, two Energy cost disrupts your tempo a bit, but it can be an extremely efficient boardwipe in a pinch. I'd also consider playing this in any other red deck like <a href="https://zdcs.link/aN8Ard?object_uuid=25314409-5722-4403-88c9-ff0d1ee5977d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jinx, Loose Cannon</a>, especially at the reasonably-priced $13. </p></div><p id="baited-hook"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Baited Hook">Baited Hook</h2></p><div catalogid="a8bd2389-2562-406f-8119-f230fbc458d6" id="230463"><div id="230463" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Baited Hook</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Veteran Magic: The Gathering players will recognize this as Riftbound's answer to <a href="https://zdcs.link/aDrx2X?object_uuid=25314409-5722-4403-88c9-ff0d1ee5977d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Birthing Pod</a>. It's a great combo card that pairs nicely with cards like <a href="https://zdcs.link/9215M1?object_uuid=25314409-5722-4403-88c9-ff0d1ee5977d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Machine Evangel</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In go-wide strategies like <a href="https://zdcs.link/aBD37v?object_uuid=25314409-5722-4403-88c9-ff0d1ee5977d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Viktor, Herald of the Arcane</a>, Baited Hook can be a great finisher if you're able to stomach the $37 price tag. </p></div><p id="master-yi"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Master Yi">Master Yi</h2></p><div catalogid="a8bd2389-2562-406f-8119-f230fbc458d6" id="230464"><div id="230464" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Master Yi</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the strongest Legends in the game so far, Master Yi, Wuju Bladesman's $38 cost is due to both his popularity and scarcity. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can only get him in the <a href="https://zdcs.link/9gjgwy?object_uuid=25314409-5722-4403-88c9-ff0d1ee5977d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Proving Grounds</a> box (as well as three other exclusive Legends), and getting your hands on that is currently a bit of a chore.

Because of this, it's currently sitting at around $40. </p></div><p id="dazzling-aurora"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Dazzling Aurora">Dazzling Aurora</h2></p><div catalogid="a8bd2389-2562-406f-8119-f230fbc458d6" id="230466"><div id="230466" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Dazzling Aurora</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the only cards in Riftbound Origins I would consider borderline unfair and actually broken, Dazzling Gleam is an incredibly powerful finisher in decks like Master Yi ramp. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Its nine Energy cost is worth considering, but spitting out massive Units like <a href="https://zdcs.link/QWEDgn?object_uuid=25314409-5722-4403-88c9-ff0d1ee5977d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Deadbloom Predator</a> for free will quickly win the game, especially since not many decks run much Gear removal. </p></div><p id="kaisa-survivor"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Kai'sa Survivor">Kai'sa Survivor</h2></p><div catalogid="a8bd2389-2562-406f-8119-f230fbc458d6" id="230467"><div id="230467" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Kai'sa Survivor</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The end-all, tier-1 meta deck in Riftbound Origins. Her aggressive cost mixed with her extremely powerful effect ensures she sees play in most red decks. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're running Kai'Sa, Daughter of the Void as your Legend, playing three Kai'Sa Survivor is a no-brainer. That is, of course, if you're able to get your hands on three copies. She's currently sitting around $73, so I wouldn't blame you if you found some budget replacements. </p></div><p id="time-warp"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Time Warp">Time Warp</h2></p><div catalogid="a8bd2389-2562-406f-8119-f230fbc458d6" id="230468"><div id="230468" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Time Warp</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Personally, I'm not the biggest fan of extra turn effects in TCG's, since they often give an unfair edge when used. Regardless, Riftbound's Time Warp is an extremely powerful, high-cost effect that is the metagame's current most expensive staple, sitting at around $86-$90. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most blue decks run at least one of these, so it may be worth it to pick up a single copy to build up store credit. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">More Riftbound Cards to Keep an Eye On</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Naturally, these aren't the only format staples or expensive cards Riftbound has to offer in its over 300-card Origins set. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are dozens of much more expensive alternate versions of many Legends and Champions, and more metagame staples that will break the bank a bit. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But if you're more interested in the collector value of these cards over their competitive use, we have a list of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/riftbound-league-of-legends-tcg-origins-most-expensive-cards">15 most expensive Riftbound cards</a> you can buy. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We also have a handy <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/riftbound-league-of-legends-where-to-buy">buying guide</a> if you're new to Riftbound.

That might mean larger things like Godmaster. Certainly, we’ve noticed that people would like an expansion in that way, being able to enter pantheon spaces and refight bosses. And there is already a huge number of them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Pellen:</strong> We were talking about the next project in general. We’re not thinking about the size. We just started making new stuff and working on bits and pieces. We’re still in this world, thinking about stuff to present to people.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Gibson:</strong> It is interesting working out how you expand an already huge game, to make sure you don’t completely overwhelm new players, because obviously new players will be experiencing the new stuff, very naturally integrated. It’ll just seem like the base experience.

            <title><![CDATA[Hytale Early Access Release Date Set for January After Creator Revival]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hytale-early-access-release-date</link>
            <guid>1367668</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Voxel sandbox game&nbsp;<em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>has been given a January Early Access release date, just over a week after its original creators announced its revival.</p>

<p>Hypixel Studios confirmed the news earlier today via the official&nbsp;<em>Hytale&nbsp;</em><a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-early-access-january-13-2026" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>, on which it was revealed that the game will be launching into Early Access on PC on January 13th. Pre-orders will begin on December 13th.</p>

<p>Despite that, Hypixel says you shouldn't pre-order the game "if you don't feel comfortable" doing so. The studio is clear on the fact that&nbsp;<em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>will very much be an Early Access release, which means it'll be "unfinished" and "buggy for a while". Caveat emptor, and all that.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hytale-early-access-release-date-bugs.jpg?itok=etey4Iqv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hytale-early-access-release-date-bugs.jpg?itok=LvScV7nC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll do more than your fair share of running away from bugs, as it were, in&nbsp;<em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>in January.</figcaption></figure><p>In the post, Hypixel reiterates what it said last week as part of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hytale-rescued-early-access-soon" rel="nofollow">its announcement</a> that&nbsp;<em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>had been revived, namely that the game will follow "the original vision from the 2018 trailer" and that the developer will be "returning to a four-year-old legacy build that had been abandoned".</p>

<p>As such, "some parts of the game will feel behind" when it launches in January, but despite that, Hypixel says "momentum is strong", so you can expect plenty of updates and communication from the developer throughout the Early Access period.</p>

<p>If you're the kind of person who wants to mod&nbsp;<em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>to make it your own, then you'll be pleased to know modding and creative tools will be available on day one of Early Access, even though they're "not where [Hypixel wants] them long term".</p>

<p>Hypixel closes by warning players that the Early Access build of&nbsp;<em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>will be "rough", but promises that "the path ahead matters more". It seems like it really is important to set your expectations accordingly here.</p>




<p><em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>began life as a custom&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>server before being spun off into its own entity in 2018, with&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Valorant</em>'s Riot Games <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/riot-games-hytale-acqusition-adds-blocky-adventure-to-roster" rel="nofollow">stepping in to purchase Hypixel</a> in 2020.</p>

<p>However, the partnership between Hypixel and Riot ended earlier this year when the latter <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hytale-canceled-dev-shuts-down" rel="nofollow">shut down the former</a> and seemingly canceled&nbsp;<em>Hytale</em>, although the game has since risen from the ashes under the stewardship of some of the original server's co-founders.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>when it launches on PC via Early Access on January 13th next year. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/turn-your-living-room-into-a-playground-with-the-nex-playground-while-its-discounted-by-20-2000648449</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Black Friday is a great time to stock up on essentials, plus treat yourself to purchases that are a little hard to justify during the rest of the year. We’re spotting hundreds of discounts across almost every single category you could think of, including games. Titles have dropped in prices, and so have the consoles.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to surprise your little ones with something that gets them moving in your living room, we might have just found the best gaming deal of the season. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6060/">Nex Playground — a cube-like console — is currently sitting at $199 on Amazon, after a 20% discount on its close to $250 price tag</a>. You’ll also get $25 back in Amazon credit with your purchase, which brings the total down even further. Note that both discounts are only valid till supplies last, and that might not be long. To avoid any last-minute disappointments, it’s best to get your orders in fast.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6060/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Interactive Motion Games</h2>
<p>Nex Playground looks quite like a mini projector, but in a fun way. It connects to your TV and lets you play interactive motion games using just your body. There are no controllers needed, as the built-in wide-angle camera uses AI to scan your movements to register them in games on its own.</p>
<p>Multiplayer setup is supported. Up to four people can hop in at the same time to get some workout in. Five games are packed for free, including Fruit Ninja, Starri, Whac-a-Mole, Go Keeper, and Party Fowl; showcase your chopping skills with the fast movement of arms, or put that adrenaline to good use by nailing down as many moles as you can. For a bit more variety, you can purchase a 3-Month or 12-Month Play Pass, both of which cost $49 and $89, respectively. These get you instant access to a full catalog of games, plus enjoy new games each month. Games include Barbie, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, How to Train Your Dragon, Peppa Pig, Care Bears, Elmo, Miraculous Ladybug, Gabby’s Dollhouse, Kung Fu Panda, and more, so there’s going to be something for everyone. It encourages kids to move around, and is perfect for playdates or family game nights. Honestly, we won’t judge if you want to get a solo session in after putting the little ones to sleep. It’s also appropriate for kids of all ages, since it doesn’t support ads or in-app purchases. They can play their favorite games without needing you around!</p>



<p>Getting started couldn’t be simpler. Nex Playground connects to your TV using a single HDMI cable. Plug the power supply cord into the console and then plug the adapter into an outlet. Switch the thing on, and manage it using your TV remote; simple as that.</p>
<p>All things considered, this console offers a fun way to get your family moving together. Your living room is going to turn into a mini playground (or a battlefield) without a console or tons of other accessories. Just connect it to your TV, and get the party started. You’re getting five games included for free, but will need to purchase the Play Pass to unlock more.&nbsp;<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6060/">The current Black Friday deal drops the price down to $199, letting you save a nice $50 on it. Additionally, you can get $25 back in Amazon credit, which brings the price down even further.</a> Just note that the promotional credit is added automatically to your account 30 days after shipment, so you might not be able to access it right away.</p>

The fret buttons on the Pro models also utilize mechanical switches to provide faster movements and input recognition, and there's RGB lighting on the neck.

Whether it's his <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/02/random-takaya-imamura-wants-to-see-star-fox-assault-on-switch-2">wishes for a Star Fox revitalisation</a> or his dreams of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/11/random-takaya-imamura-ponders-the-possibility-of-star-fox-zero-on-switch-2">future movie adaptations</a>, the former Nintendo dev is always on hand to give us something to think about. But today, all that's on our minds is how inadequate our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> design capabilities are.</p>
<p>You see, in the past 24 hours, Imamura-san has shared a couple of pictures from his New Horizons pad, flexing the iconic movie posters that he has recreated in staggering detail via the in-game Custom Designs app. To start, there were just three. Now, there are seven. And, simply put, they put our best efforts to shame.</p><div><figure data-videoid="HpG4hedNmz8" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HpG4hedNmz8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytHpG4hedNmz8" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HpG4hedNmz8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HpG4hedNmz8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f0b5knvuqm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>At the time of writing, we've seen recreations of <strong>E.T.</strong>, <strong>Back to the Future</strong>, <strong>Star Wars</strong>, <strong>The Terminator</strong>, and more, and every one of them is more accurate than we could ever hope to muster with our humble skills. What's more, Imamura-san claims that he "rushed" the second batch — now come on, that's just showing off.</p>

<p>Of course, this is the man behind some of Nintendo's most iconic artwork, having designed for the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/star_fox">Star Fox</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/legend_of_zelda_majoras_mask">Majora's Mask</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/f-zero">F-Zero</a>. We really shouldn't be all that surprised that he's a dab hand at Animal Crossing custom designs too, but here we are. So, when's he dropping the patterns, eh?</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/kindle-paperwhite-drops-to-record-low-e-reader-now-cheaper-than-buying-a-few-physical-books-2000648434</link>
            <guid>1367629</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Kindle e-readers have evolved into reading experiences that rival physical books through <strong>e-ink displays mimicking printed paper and provides instant access to over 15 million titles that would fill entire libraries</strong>. The convenience proves transformative through lightweight portability replacing heavy books in bags, immediate downloads eliminating bookstore trips, and adjustable lighting enabling reading anywhere regardless of ambient conditions.</p>
<p>The newest <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6054/">Kindle Paperwhite with 16GB storage (and ads) costs $124 during Black Friday on Amazon, down from $159</a>, and hits a record-low price where Amazon removes profit margins completely on their own hardware. The ad-supported version saves money through occasional lock-screen advertisements, though <strong>spending an extra $20 for the ad-free model proves worthwhile</strong> if promotional content bothers you.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6054/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The fastest page turns that are like real books</h2>
<p>The next-generation processor makes <strong>page turns 25% faster than older Paperwhite models</strong>: This gets rid of the short lag that made earlier e-readers feel slow compared to flipping through real pages. The speed boost is especially noticeable in scenes with a lot of dialogue or action, where quick page turning keeps the story moving instead of making fake pauses that break the immersion.</p>



<p>The <strong>7-inch glare-free screen gives you a lot of reading space</strong> in a small package: It can fit more text on the screen while still being portable which is something that bigger tablets give up. The anti-glare coating makes it possible to read in direct sunlight where phone and tablet screens wash out completely which means that you can read at the beach, in an outdoor cafe, or at a sunny window seat without having to squint or move around like you would with reflective screens.</p>
<p>The <strong>adjustable color temperature changes from bright white light for reading during the day to warm amber tones for reading at night</strong>: This lowers blue light exposure, which can affect sleep quality. The warm light lets you read before bed without the blue light that phone and tablet screens give off, which keeps your natural sleep patterns going instead of messing them up.</p>



<p>The<strong> IPX8 waterproof rating</strong> means that the device can be submerged in water for up to two meters for 60 minutes. This means you can read by the pool, relax in the bathtub, or spend time at the beach without worrying about your electronics getting wet. The device won’t break if it falls into a pool, gets splashed by waves, or gets rained on, so you don’t have to be as careful with it when it’s wet, like you do with most expensive electronics.</p>
<p>The <strong>battery lasts for 12 weeks on a single charge</strong> so you don’t have to charge your phone or tablet every night, which can make them feel like they need constant care. Read every day for months without needing to charge, take vacations without bringing chargers, or keep reading without worrying about the battery running out like you do with devices that need daily power. The USB-C charging makes it easier to charge when needed because it doesn’t need special cables like older Kindles did.</p>
<p>The<strong> 16GB of storage can hold thousands of books</strong> which is much more than what most readers read before they upgrade their devices. The storage is especially useful when traveling internationally, when buying books can be difficult.</p>
<p>If you’ve thought about getting an e-reader but were put off by the usual prices, this is the perfect time to make the switch from physical books.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/get-a-headstart-on-your-2025-holiday-tech-shopping-with-the-ai-powered-lenovo-idea-tab-2000636961</link>
            <guid>1367626</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The digital device in pretty much every student’s backpack doesn’t absolutely have to be an expensive laptop computer. The apps and tech that make digital note-taking, research, and AI-assisted writing and coursework has filtered down not just to high-end tablets, but also some of the more affordable models as well. That’s where the Lenovo Idea Tab sits — an 11-inch Android tablet armed with everything a student needs, including Lenovo AI Notes, but without the hefty price tag that comes with a laptop. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6048/">It’s on Black Friday sale right now at Amazon for just $180 (-25%).</a></p>
<p>Odds are the Lenovo Idea Tab is going to outperform most if not all other $180 tablets for academic and productivity purposes. It comes with the Lenovo Tab Pen and a folio case, both of which are almost always added expenses with tablets. Google’s Circle to Search feature is built in as well, along with Lenovo’s AI Notes.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6048/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Clear Picture</h2>
<p>The Lenovo Idea Tab comes with four apps that are tailor-made for academic performance: Squid, the powerful paper-replacing Android app for handwritten notes, PDF markups, and other tasks; MyScript Notes (formerly Nebo), a great freehand-sketching app; MyScript Calculator, which can solve your handwritten numerical equations; and Lenovo AI Note, which transforms your handwritten notes into AI-generated quizzes, and can also use AI to expand on your notes with greater insight.</p>
<p>Whether you’re working or playing, the 11-inch 2.5K screen on the Lenovo Idea Pad isn’t going to let you down. The MediaTek Dimensity 6300 octa-core processor ensures that the images on that screen come through smoothly, and the seemingly inexhaustible battery is good for up to 12 hours of video playback.</p>



<h2>All the Tablet, Without the Price</h2>
<p>Everything else you would ask of the tablets in the higher price brackets — fast internet, smooth streaming, quality built-in camera and Dolby Atmos quad speakers for video calls, and total portability (just 6.5 x 10 x 0.28 inches in size and 1.05 pounds in weight) — are here with the Lenovo Idea Pad, and don’t forget the included-in-price Lenovo Tab Pen and folio case.</p>
<p>The Lenovo Idea Pad might be considered to be an “entry-level” tablet by some, and to be fair, we wouldn’t throw it in the ring against the latest iPad Pro or Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra. But you’re certainly not getting anywhere near either of those heavyweights for $210, and the differences between them and the Lenovo Idea Pad probably don’t quantify the $1,000-plus price difference. Long story short, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6048/">you’re getting far more tablet than you would expect for $180 from the Lenovo Idea Pad, so this Amazon Black Friday deal is a solid thumbs-up.</a></p>

<p>Build a rocket, boy</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/little_rocket_lab">Little Rocket Lab</a> is a sweet pixel art automation game from No More Robots and Teenage Astronauts. It arrived on Steam and Xbox last month, and we have been wondering when a Switch release would follow ever since. Well, it's coming real soon. What's more, there's a Switch 2 Edition in tow.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/little-rocket-lab-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Little Rocket Lab - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a>, and its Switch 1 counterpart, will be available on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Little-Rocket-Lab-2955324.html">eShop</a> from 10th December for <strong>£15.99 / $19.99</strong> (or as a free upgrade for those who make the jump between systems down the road), and it boasts some pretty slick performance on the new hardware. Alongside the promise of boosted resolution, Teenage Astronauts have also got things running at a sweet 120fps — so you know those conveyor belts are going to be looking smooth as anything.</p>
<p>It's not necessarily the kind of game that we can imagine being drastically impacted by a triple-figure frame rate, but S2 Editions hitting those upper reaches are always a welcome sight.</p>
<p>For those curious, this is a chilled little factory-building game, where you set out to transform your rundown family home into a prime site for rocket construction. To do so, you'll have to lay down transport, delegate machinery, and make the most of your surrounding resources, all while keeping the locals happy.</p>
<p>You'll find a brief rundown of the game's key features and a handful of screenshots below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Clever Contraptions:</strong> Use drills, furnaces, automated bots, cranes, complex assemblers and far more to help the town’s struggling locals!<br>
<strong>The Heart of Community:</strong> Build lifelong friendships with townsfolk, learn the depths of their lives, and become the heart of the community<br>
<strong>Invent, Invent, Invent!:</strong> Devise and formulate new machinery, energy sources and mechanical pals to help you on your journey to the stars<br>
<strong>Cozy Organisation:</strong> Lose yourself in the comforting hum of well-oiled machines, made by your hands, and working just as intended<br>
<strong>Build a Rocket Ship:</strong> Support a struggling town while building a rocket ship!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first half of December is looking particularly rammed at the moment, but if you're after something to kick back with between the stresses of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, this might just end up fitting the bill.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/fatshark-presents-darktide-new-hive-scum-class-confirms-no-pvp-plans/</link>
            <guid>1367614</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Fatshark's 10 Years of Tide celebration includes not only Warhammer: Vermintide 2 (which <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-vermintide-2-currently-free-to-keep-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was recently given away for free</a> and also got a new map), but also Warhammer 40K: Darktide. The studio's most recent game is about to receive a new paid DLC, the Hive Scum class, following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/darktide-arbites-dlc-was-a-success-boasts-fatshark/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">successful launch of the Arbites class</a>. In a press presentation attended by Wccftech, Fatshark introduced the Hive Scum as a gang of native criminals from Tertium's Hive City who are begrudgingly joining forces with the inquisitorial warband to fight the forces of chaos. This new class brings a very different style and attitude to gameplay, emphasizing a more aggressive and playstyle compared to other classes available in Darktide.</p>



<p>The developers have prepared extensive customization options for the Hive Scum, including new faces, hairstyles, full-body tattoos, and a unique system called face paints. Players can represent different cartels within the Hive, adding an extra layer of identity and personality to their Hive Scum characters.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Hive-Scum-Screenshot-4-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>This class focuses on rapid dual-wielding pistols for ranged combat and dual-wielding shivs (daggers) for melee combat. The dual-wielding pistols can be fired in an alternate, frenzied mode with the left trigger but can also be fired more accurately with 'brace mode', which is enabled with the right trigger. Similarly, when using the dual blades, Hive Scum players can switch between blunt and pointed grip, which changes the attack chains and effects. In either case, it's a fast-paced playstyle designed to highlight the street-gang vibe of the Hive Scum, which is reflected in their animations as well. </p>



<p>The class features several abilities and ultimate moves that align with its reckless gangster theme, such as unlimited ammo and invincibility during a Desperado ultimate. Another ultimate, Rampage, buffs melee attacks, enhancing attack power, and can be refreshed by hitting targets. Lastly, Stimm Supply places a crate on the ground that buffs the whole group. The type of buff is derived from the Stimm Lab, arguably the class's most significant innovation. It is a new, class‑specific progression system that lets Hive Scum players craft a custom 'Cartel Special' stimm. For every character level, you gain one point to spend in the Lab, selecting different bonuses that are baked into this personal Stimm, which then replaces regular Stimms found in missions if you opt in. The Cartel Special automatically recharges on a cooldown, and that cooldown grows longer the more points you invest and the more powerful the combined effects become. Using the Stimm Lab is optional, by the way: if you don't take any upgrades there, your Hive Scum simply uses the same normal stimms as other classes.</p>



<p>The Hive Scum class also introduces a new damage type to Darktide called toxins, which deal damage over time and weaken enemies. When it comes to Blitz abilities, Blinder/Blackout is a fast‑throw concussive grenade for knocking enemies down and creating openings; Boom Bringer is a disposable missile launcher for deleting elites and monsters; and Chem Grenade creates lingering toxic zones and chain reactions. The talent trees are designed around three core playstyles: a gunslinger Desperado, a melee-focused Ruffian, and a Chemist specializing in the aforementioned toxin damage.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/No-Mans-Land-Screeshot-2-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>While the Hive Scum class is a premium DLC (available starting December 2 on all platforms for $11.99 in the Standard Edition and $18.99 for the Premium Edition), all Warhammer 40K: Darktide players are getting a new three-mission story arc as part of a free update. It includes trench warfare-style combat through a 'No Man's Land' area as players escort a tank to reclaim a stronghold held by a cult faction. The mission features outdoor combat areas with classic Warhammer 40K-inspired ruined cityscape and bunkers. It branched out from previously released content but includes new voice-overs, story elements, and narrative developments. It requires players to unlock part of the main campaign before access, but can also be joined in co-op with players who have unlocked it.</p>



<p>In the presentation's Q&amp;A segment, we learned from Fatshark that developing a new class like the Hive Scum usually takes them between six and twelve months, with teams ranging from 10 to 25 members involved. The studio promised further ongoing support for Darktide, including additional missions, factions, and gameplay features.</p>



<p>I asked whether the studio was evaluating the addition of PvP modes <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-vermintide-2-gets-versus-mode-with-4v4-battles-and-several-characters-to-choose-from/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like in Warhammer: Vermintide 2</a>, and the reply was that this is not currently planned, but may be considered later. Don't hold your breath, though, as it sounded like this possibility has barely been evaluated thus far. It took many years before Vermintide 2 got its own PvP, and the same may apply to Darktide.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Though Black Friday deals usually start ahead of the actual date, there are always still deals that only appear on the day itself, which is why it's still worth keeping your eye out for deals and waiting for the actual day. Well, anyone who was patient enough to wait for it to actually be Black Friday in order to take advantage of deals on video games has been rewarded, because there's a slew of games, all of which were released in 2025, that you can grab for $40 or less on Amazon.</p>



<p>Of course, you can find older games for cheap as well, and some other 2025 releases on sale for more than $40, but no one is able to grab everything they want in a given year right at launch, so there's likely a few games in this list of 20 titles released in 2025 that you can pick up for cheap now.</p>



<p>Starting from the top-end of the pricing, with games that you can pick up for $40 that were released in 2025:</p>

<p>Moving down the pricing list, here are the games you can get for $30 and up:</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/top-all-your-essentials-in-one-go-with-the-3-port-65w-anker-usb-c-charger-for-just-24-2000648212</link>

              <p>Black Friday has arrived in all its glory, slashing rates across a wide range of categories right, left, and center. We’re spotting tons of items hitting their lowest ever prices, and even some of the latest releases getting surprise discounts. It’s basically a great time to pick everything you’ve had your eyes on for less, whether it’s a MacBook, a pair of premium Bose headphones, or even an air fryer to finally start eating healthy.</p>
<p>If you rely on multiple devices to get through the day and are done dealing with cord clutter, a multiport charger is the way out. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6044/">Right now, you can snag the 3-port 65W Anker USB-C charger for $24, after a whopping 40% off its usual price of $40 at Amazon.</a> And as if that wasn’t enough, the retailer is also throwing in 2 free months of Audible with your purchase to sweeten the deal even more. Both Prime and non-Prime members can grab it, but subscribers will enjoy free shipping, so they’re saving a few bucks on that front, too.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6044/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>High-Speed Charging for All Your Devices</h2>
<p>This compact charger is roughly the size of an AirPods Pro case, and the plugs fold in for easy portability. The smooth, scratchproof surface handles everyday wear and tear well, making it easy to take it with you on the go without worry.</p>
<p>There are three ports (two USB-C and one USB-A) to charge up to three devices at the same time, whether it’s your smartphone, tablet, or even a laptop. 65W ultra-fast charging is enough to juice a 14-inch MacBook Pro to 50% in just 35 minutes, or a Google Pixelbook to about half in a little over 40. You’ll get maximum power when using a single port, but when multiple devices are plugged in, the charger automatically spreads the output intelligently. For instance, when topping three devices up at the same time, the top USB-C port can output 40W, while the second USB-C port and USB-A port can deliver 12W each. You can connect your power-hungry devices to a USB-C port, while other essentials to the rest.</p>



<p>Despite this power, the charger stays calm and cool while it works. GaN II technology makes for higher energy efficiency and upgraded heat dissipation in a compact frame that is around 53% smaller than your regular, everyday blocks. The box comes with the Anker 735 Charger, a welcome guide, and an 18-month warranty for some extra peace of mind.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6044/">To wrap it up, you’re saving a massive 40% or $16 on this compact, but powerful charger that’s easy to use and makes any workspace more efficient.</a> It plays nicely with a range of devices, so you can use it to top up your earbuds, smartwatches, smartphones, tablet, laptop, and even consoles.&nbsp;You’re also getting a free 60-day Audible trial on top of that, which typically costs $15 a month. Audible gets you access to a huge library of podcasts, audiobooks, and Audible Originals that include documentaries, comedy shows, and more. You can purchase titles, enjoy on-demand streaming, and even enjoy offline access to your favorites!</p>
<p>Both the offers, however, are expected to expire soon, so it’s best to get your orders in quickly. Once these are gone, there’s no guarantee they’ll be back. This is also a great time to grab other tech gadgets for less. We’re covering the top deals here at Kotaku, so don’t forget to check back for the latest drops and some exclusive offers.</p>

Like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/819903/analogue-3d-nintendo-64-console-ship-date-november-18">recently released</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/822849/analogue-3d-review-n64">Analogue 3D</a>, it will play N64 games in 4K through the use of an FPGA. ModRetro — the company founded by the controversial figure Palmer Luckey who’s also behind a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/798821/anduril-eagleeye-palmer-luckey-mark-zuckerberg-meta-military-mr">defense contractor that makes military tech</a> — has been <a href="https://x.com/PalmerLuckey/status/1901796093396222233?">teasing details about the console</a> on social media over the past few months, but today it finally revealed the console’s design, and an accompanying remake of the N64’s unique three-pronged controller.</p><p>Similar to the recently-launched Analogue 3D, the M64’s design is inspired by Nintendo’s original hardware with a gently curved top panel, cartridge slot on top, and four ports on the front compatible with the N64’s original wired gamepads. On the front corner of the top panel you’ll find a power button, while the other corner features a dial labeled “Menu.” Aside from presumably navigating on-screen menus we don’t yet know if the dial will have additional functionality. On the back of the M64 is an HDMI port, three USB-C ports, and a microSD card slot.</p><p>The new images of the M64 show the console with a translucent housing in green, purple, and white color options, as well as three color-matched controllers. The Analogue 3D is also compatible with the Nintendo 64’s original gamepads, but the company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/825309/8bitdo-64-wireless-bluetooth-controller-analogue-3d-retro-gray-color">worked with 8BitDo to create a modernized version</a> with a similar button layout and thumbstick design. ModRetro has instead gone for authenticity. The M64’s controllers look nearly identical to the original with a three pronged design featuring the thumbstick on top of the middle grip and a trigger button beneath it.</p><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/PalmerLuckey/status/1993115525153436057">post on X earlier this week</a>, Luckey also announced that while the M64 was priced at $199 (the same launch price as the N64 in 1996) for those who signed up for the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmodretro.com%2Fpages%2Fm64" rel="sponsored">waitlist on ModRetro’s website</a> after the M64 was announced, the introductory pricing is being extended to everyone — at least for now.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/831498/modretro-m64-console-4k-fpga-nintendo-64-clone]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Of steel is my spirit, of thunder my bones. I am the hawk's justice, the quadrapedal crucible of oil and atrocity in which the future is forged. BEHOLD, ye <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> simulation enthusiasts. Behold my unabashed phallic symbolism menacing the gates of heaven, while my hissing hydraulics uncipher the coordinates of my prey.</p>
<p>Many are my supplicants, strangers from near and far who seek to beguile me and aim my blessed ordnance, but mine is the judgement, and mine the tactile gratifications of levers and gears and dials. You were getting bored of turrets in war games? Fools! You have never experienced one from the inside. Come, surrender yourself to the dieselpunk folds and surprisingly jaunty background music of my ironclad majesty. (Here's a trailer.)

"A brutal dieselpunk heavy-artillery experience where you dominate the battlefield through a colossal war machine," roars <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2950790/IRON_NEST_Heavy_Turret_Simulator/">the Steam page for Iron Nest: Heavy Turret Simulator</a>, like a minotaur with a marketing degree. "Every lever, every dial and every shot is under your control. High Command may send cryptic orders, but you alone pull the trigger. Obey or defy, in this nest you are the god of steel and fire. Beware, each blast tears the silence!" ARGH. I just saluted inadvertently and jammed a pencil in my ear.
</p><p>
There's a slightly less bellowy characterisation of the game at the bottom of that Steam page. This is "a unique blend of tactical problem-solving, war machine management, and strategic customization" in which you "translate cryptic reports into coordinates, determine where to strike, and set the turret accordingly". It features "a card-based requisition system that keeps every mission fresh", and is apparently the work of just two developers with about 20 years of experience between them. 
</p>
<p>
Iron Nest takes heavy inspiration from (deep breath)  <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pvkk-planetenverteidigungskanonenkommandant">PVKK: Planetenverteidigungskanonenkommandant</a>, which is kind of bizarre because PVKK isn't even out yet. In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2950790/view/707754276831626328?l=english">a post</a> about the experience of going moderately viral on Tiktok, the devs stress that Iron Nest and PVKK are quite different once you disregard the theme of honking massive manually operated cannons. It's about "ground-based artillery, which brings a completely different setup, mechanics, and challenges compared to an orbital gun!" 
</p>
<p>
Potato, potarto, I'm tempted to say, but I'm already imagining the whistle of vengeful shells. You can expect a demo in a few months, and the full release in mid-2026.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/forget-expensive-oled-tvs-4k-fire-tv-on-black-friday-sale-does-the-job-for-97-of-people-2000648430</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon sells Insignia-branded TVs despite the brand being owned by competitor Best Buy and creates the unusual situation where Amazon’s platform promotes a rival’s house brand.&nbsp;Several popular sizes including <strong>55-inch and 75-inch variants have already sold out</strong> completely, but remaining models like this 50-inch version offer exceptional value that doesn’t justify spending significantly more on competing brands.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5462/">55-inch TV costs $169 during Black Friday on Amazon, down from $299, and hits a record-low 43% discount</a> that makes 4K smart TVs cost less than many soundbars or streaming devices.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5462/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Fire TV integration</h2>
<p>The <strong>4K Ultra HD resolution at 2160p has four times as many pixels as 1080p Full HD</strong>. This makes images sharper with text that is still readable, faces that show detail, and faraway objects that stay clear instead of becoming blurry copies. HDR10 support improves dynamic range by using metadata to adjust brightness and color on a scene-by-scene basis, and this lets you see more detail in shadows in dark scenes while keeping bright highlight information.</p>



<p>The wide color gamut shows more colors than standard dynamic range and makes images that are more colorful and realistic like what we see in real life, instead of the flat colors that SDR content has. The upscaling engine looks at content with lower resolution and smartly adds detail to make it look like 4K quality.</p>
<p>The <strong>60Hz refresh rate works well with regular TV and movie content</strong> because it has native frame rate support that stops the judder from happening on displays with different refresh rates. The refresh rate is good enough for almost all types of content, including streaming services, cable TV, and DVDs and Blu-rays, which never go above 60 frames per second.</p>
<p>You don’t need any extra streaming sticks or boxes to <strong>use the built-in Fire TV operating system to get to streaming services</strong> like Prime Video, Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, HBO Max, and thousands of other apps right away. The all-in-one design gets rid of the HDMI port, the need to switch between remotes, and the mess of cables that come with separate streaming devices.</p>



<p>With the <strong>smart home hub</strong>, you can watch camera feeds from compatible video doorbells and security cameras directly on the TV in picture-in-picture or full-screen mode. You can use voice commands to control Alexa-compatible lights, thermostats, and smart plugs through the TV remote. This makes it easier to manage your smart home without needing separate Echo devices or phone apps.</p>
<p>Insignia’s 50-inch 4K Fire TV is now the cheapest on Black Friday at $169: It <strong>costs less than many 32-inch TVs but has a much bigger screen and all the smart features you could want</strong>. This deal makes 4K smart TVs available at prices that have never been seen before so you can get big-screen entertainment without losing any of the important features.</p>
