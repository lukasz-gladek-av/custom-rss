            <link>https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-shadow-and-order-update-gets-last-minute-3-month-delay-bungie/</link>
            <guid>1440322</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Just as things were starting to look up for <strong>Bungie</strong>, with some positive buzz building around <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-marathon-gamelay-new-impressive-death-awaits-trailer/">Marathon</a></strong> as we inch closer to the new extraction shooter's arrival, the tides take a turn for the worse once again. In a statement shared on its social media channels, the studio has announced that the next major update for <strong>Destiny 2</strong>, the upcoming <strong>Shadow and Order</strong> update, which was supposed to be out on <strong>March 3, 2026,</strong> has been <strong>delayed by</strong> <strong>three months</strong> and will now arrive on <strong>June 9, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>A lack of promotional marketing for the update this close to its initially intended release already had players suspecting a delay would be announced, alongside the fact that the update would have been out just days ahead of Marathon, which arrives on March 5, 2026. Bungie fans and anyone who wanted to try out Marathon would have also just finished playing it for a whole weekend during its server slam test, <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-will-host-a-marathon-server-slam-test-just-ahead-of-launch-next-month/">which runs from February 26 to March 2</a>.</p>



<p>Instead of squeezing in the launch of a new update and a new game into one week, the Shadow and Order update will now arrive a little more than three months after its initial date. To make matters worse, if the delay time didn't raise concerns about the state of the update, Bungie's statement surely will, as the delay isn't to give Marathon more space to breathe or give the studio time to fix a significant bug they've recently discovered. It's to give the update <strong>"<em>large revisions</em>,"</strong> including changing the title of the update and give the team time to bring <em>"sizable</em>" quality-of-life updates.</p>



<p>"<em>Our next Major Update, Destiny 2: Shadow and Order, is <strong>undergoing large revisions and will be delayed</strong>,</em>" Bungie begins in its statement. "<em>This update is being changed and expanded to include sizable quality-of-life updates and as a result, will <strong>also be renamed</strong>. This update will now launch on <strong>June 9, 2026</strong>. We will provide exact details closer to release covering previously announced Weapon Tier Upgrading, but also additions like expanding Tiered Gear to all Raid and Dungeon activities, Pantheon 2.0, Tier 5 stats for Exotic Armors, and more.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Through June, we will continue to have routine bug fixes and stability improvements, continued portal modifiers, Guardian Games (March), and the return of a more frequent Iron Banner cadence (April)."</em></p>

</div></figure>



<p>Of course, the changes being made to this update could, and likely will, ultimately be for the better. But announcing such major changes this close to release, for something that is not the game's next big expansion, and just a mid-season update, clearly points to there having been not just one, but several mishaps along the way. Delays and changes like this are rarely due to just one thing going wrong, and it doesn't inspire confidence in Destiny fans who now have to wait months for an update they thought they'd get to check out in just a couple of weeks.</p>



<p>Especially after its last major update, which was the arrival of its Star Wars-themed <strong>Renegades</strong> expansion, <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-renegades-out-now-steam-concurrent-player-count-rises/">failed to revitalize the player base</a>. Hopefully, when Bungie is ready to talk about the update closer to release, it'll have been worth the wait.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>For months, I’ve been keeping an eye out for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/denshattack">Denshattack!</a>, an enticingly loud stunt-action game that’s somewhere between an autorunner and Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater, if Tony Hawk was an electric locomotive and not a man of mortal flesh. I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/at-a-largely-humourless-gamescom-train-kickflipper-denshattack-was-a-golden-streak-of-joy">played it last year</a> and was instantly smitten with its speedy, tricksy rail riding, and now that there’s a newly released <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2524850/Denshattack/">Steam demo</a>, perhaps you will be too.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I’ve had a go, and while the playable story bits – in which your unsatisfied ramen delivery girl embarks on a career of competitive train flipping – are still enjoyably breakneck, there’s also a purely stunt-focused score attack mode that’s given me a fresh appreciation for the depth of Denshattack!!’s tricks system.</p>
<p>In contrast to these opening campaign stages, where you learn the basics of jumping and twisting your carriage on linear A-to-B runs, this mode is a looping maze of grindrails, halfpipes, and rideable walls. Both a proving ground and training facility, which is useful, because most of the aerial tricks in Denshattack!!! demand such complex yet precise flicks of the gamepad’s right stick that I’m not certain all of them are possible without undergoing some manner of cybernetic thumb joint surgery.</p>



<p>It’s good fun, though, thrashing a fat, blocky engine around like with such pace and aplomb that it almost starts to look graceful. It still feels like the campaign is the place to go for big, silly set pieces and an even greater sense of barely-holding-together speed, where tricks are mostly grabbed in the brief windows where you’re not dodging track hazards, or barrelling along atop a commandeered Ferris wheel. But there’s something more quintessentially Hawkian about the score attack mode, and it’s not just the animal brain desire to make a bigger number on the next run than the last one.</p><p>There’s a real mastery to be pursued here, I reckon. One measured less in combo multipliers and more in the physical spectacle of perfectly timed 720s, or grinds so clean they wouldn’t nudge the bubble on a spirit level. Pure athleticism, if you don’t count the traction motor.</p>
<p>Anyhow, the Denshattack!!!! demo is out now. There’s still no word of a release date beyond "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hello-pacific-drive-dlc-boltgun-2-trailer-denshattack-release-window-and-solasta-ii-early-access-update">Spring 2026</a>," as far as I can tell, so hopefully it doesn’t get the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/scratch-that-the-steam-machine-is-delayed-after-all-and-valve-confirm-ram-shortages-will-affect-pricing">Steam Machine treatment</a>. In the meantime, you can also read Malindy Hetfeld’s chat with David Jaumandreu, studio director at developers Undercoders, about its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-game-developers-worldwide-are-reliving-y2k-japan-from-jet-set-radio-to-dance-dance-revolution">influences from rhythm games and Japanese rail transit</a>.</p>

 <p><span>“Please help Ludovic, who is a wonderful and kind person that makes the world a better place.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/highguard-content-update-mode-servers-2000671282</link>
            <guid>1440310</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you, like me, have been keeping up with<em> Highguard</em>, well, there’s good news. Despite last week’s studio layoffs and the <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-update-roadmap-servers-discord-2000670633">radio silence afterwards</a>, Wildlight Entertainment’s hero shooter has snuck out a new content drop. It includes a new map and raiding item, as well as new mounts that look like <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>‘ Owlbears. But the real pocket of hope is a new mode the developers are teasing based around what <em>Highguard</em> does best: raids.</p> <p>“This patch is purely content focused, with a brand new Base and a powerful new Raid Tool added to the game, along with new offerings in the Store,” <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/4128260/view/518613150889673564">read the patch notes</a> on Steam. “We are also working on next week’s patch, which we aim to bring a new game mode focused on the Raid experience, as well as some balance adjustments to weapons, among other things.”</p> <p>The “Raid experience,” for folks who bounced off <em>Highguard</em> at launch or haven’t given it a try, is when one team is breaching a base and trying to plant bombs on objectives to blow it up. There’s a bit of <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> sprinkled in with destructible walls and gadgets that assist with breaching, including zip-lines you can shoot out from a siege tower to quickly get behind enemy lines. It’s usually the best part of any match and is where the real promise of <em>Highguard</em> begins to break through. A new mode that serves that up in a more concentrated form could work really well.</p> <p>Wildlight still hasn’t given an update on just how the old content roadmap is being modified or scrapped, but that new mode is supposed to arrive next week. In the meantime, however, this week’s patch will add the Cloudbreach map which takes place at the launchpad for a giant airship, and the Lockpick, a new item that lets you shoot a dart at doors and windows to take control of them away from the enemy during raids. A purple variant will even add an electric shock that zaps enemies nearby. Plus there’s new Moonbruin Mounts which look cool, though good luck <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-layoffs-dead-game-awards-live-service-2000668192">getting anyone to spend money</a> on <em>Highguard</em> right now.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/wraith-ops-demo-live-steam-no-battle-pass/</link>
            <guid>1440307</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Wraith Ops, a developing first-person shooter from Grassrootz Games and publisher Team 17, has just launched a demo <strong>exclusively </strong>on Steam. The shooter, which is ‘all about gunplay and gameplay first’, has launched the new demo as part of Steam Next Fest, the event that pays tribute to upcoming, developing games across a range of genres.</p>



<p>While the demo is pretty short, it gives a glimpse of what Wraith Ops promises: pure, unadulterated gun-toting action. As the game’s blurb states, there are no immersion-breaking cosmetics, no gacha mechanics, and no ‘silly killstreaks’, all of which are said in a jab at games like Call of Duty.</p>







<h2 id="h-wraith-ops-isn-t-the-next-call-of-duty">Wraith Ops Isn’t The Next Call of Duty</h2>



<p>To say that Wraith Ops is anything like Call of Duty would earn you a scolding from the game’s developer. It’s stressed everywhere on the Steam page and the game’s social channels that it exists as the antithesis of Activision’s first-person shooter franchise, despite bearing similarities.</p>



<p>But then, how different can a first-person shooter truly be from what’s already on the market?</p>



<p>Steam Next Fest has welcomed a small demo for Wraith Ops, which includes a mode called Arena, a 6v6, one-life mode, made playable across three maps: Airfield, Mall, and Submarine. Since the Gamescom demo went live in August 2025, Grassrootz Games has implemented <strong>876 </strong>bug fixes and tweaks, ready for the rollout of this new demo.</p>

<p>According to a store listing, FromSoftware’s The Duskbloods could release as early as March 27, 2026. </p>



<p>The Duskbloods is FromSoftware’s exclusive title for the Nintendo Switch 2, which is set to release in 2026. We have received a lot of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/more-details-on-the-duskbloods-revealed-in-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">information</a> about the game since it was announced, and the only thing left now is the release date. It seems one of the retailers might have been informed about the date early. </p>







<h2 id="h-the-duskbloods-listing-points-at-march-2026-release">The Duskbloods Listing Points at March 2026 Release</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2026/02/18/duskbloods-listing-appears-today-on-australian-eshop-and-finnish-retailer-starts-listing-27th-march-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MyNintendoNews</a>, there are two things that point towards The Duskblood’s release date. First, the Finnish online store <a href="https://en.konsolinet.fi/product/36809/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Konsolinet</a> listed the release date as March 27, 2026. The website has been updated, and the date now reads December 31, 2026. Players are wondering whether this is the actual release date or just a placeholder from the website. </p>



<p>The next hint is not for the release date, but probably an announcement of it. The Duskbloods listing now <span>appears on the&nbsp;<a href="https://ec.nintendo.com/AU/en/titles/70010000098072" target="_blank">Australian Nintendo eShop</a>;</span> it doesn’t seem to have a release date yet, still showing planned 2026, but a listing appearing may mean&nbsp;an announcement could be around the corner. </p>



<p>The last official update we received for the game was just a few days ago during Kadokawa’s earnings results (FromSoftware’s parent company). It was revealed that both The Duskbloods and Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition are slated to release for the Nintendo Switch 2 in 2026. </p>

Additionally, Group SNE is adapting Elden Ring Nightreign into a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/an-elden-ring-nightreign-ttrpg-is-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tabletop RPG</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Heretical is a game that wasn’t on my radar at all until TSA’s Reviews Editor, Dom, put me onto it, and I thought, “Oh yeah, that looks cool!” It’s one that I hadn’t noticed, despite the fact that it’s so specifically built for me that Steam not recommending it to me is a total failing of the system designed to promote games to me. Seriously people, what are we doing if this doesn’t end up on my recommended games list?</p>
<p><iframe title="HERETICAL - Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/twbr9Bui9hw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>My Steam-related woes aside, Heretical is an action roguelike with some seriously Soulsy vibes in both setting and the feel of combat. Death is everywhere, one of the NPCs is a skeleton with an eldritch horror for legs that’s praying a lot, and everyone is sad. This game is incredibly hard, and while progression is constant, it’s not immediately obvious. Each character you can play as has their own stats and a special skill, along with equipment preferences.</p>


<p>Combat is generally just you attacking, using an alternate weapon, or dodging, and all of your skills will be going off as you go. Some of those will be on a timer, some will be a set number of attacks, and some might be passive buffs. You can upgrade those as you level up, and along with that, new equipment drops constantly, so you get to pick between what you have and what you’ve picked up, with the loser of that competition immediately turning into gold.</p>
<p>It’s all very simple theoretically, but the reality is that you’re making builds that need to work together with each skill coming together as one, and ideally matching your character as well. You also get stat points to spend which you permanently unlock, and can apply at the beginning of each run to each character. That’s a lot of fun, because you can try out different builds pretty comfortably.</p>


<p>Combat isn’t complex, but it is a lot of fun, with most enemies being more than capable of ruining a run in an instant, especially as things get harder the longer a run goes on. For every 50 kills you manage, the difficulty goes up, and you get some special currencies to spend on shrines that will give you buffs and debuffs, but you can usually work off the debuffs. It makes for a constant stream of risk and reward, and while getting stronger is nearly always a good thing, it sure can come back to bite you in the butt if your build can’t keep up.</p>
<p>On top of all of that though, you get prophecies to complete. Each of these is a mission of sorts which will unlock something. Some of those are new skill slots, new skills, new characters, new items, and just about anything else. It means that every run, even the failed ones, often end up leading you towards something a little bit cooler. Not only that, but while it is a roguelike, the world itself is pretty set in stone. Bosses are always in the same place, and your progression speeds up as you learn the layout, but also as you unlock new shortcuts by kicking down ladders, or killing a boss enough times to permanently unlock a magical gate or something.</p>

<p>It just feels fantastic, and while it’s undoubtedly very punishing, every little unlock is a joy to achieve, and the enemies are wonderfully varied, and the starting characters feel meaningfully different. It also looks amazing, I really like the music, and I just think that if any of this sounds appealing to you, you should probably play it, because it’s a damn good game.</p>

<figure data-uuid="6018a6ab1009b"><a title="Pokémon Pokopia" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6018a6ab1009b/pokemon-pokopia.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>We weren't the only ones to draw the <strong>Dragon Quest Builders</strong> link when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-pokopia">Pokopia</a> was first unveiled last year, and it was with good reason. As it turns out, we have Builders dev Omega Force to thank for the game's speedy development time.</p>
<p>That is according to Pokopia producer Kanako Murata, who, in a new interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202602/66124">Famitsu</a> (translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/pokemon-pokopia-boasts-largest-development-team-in-omega-force-history-with-dragon-quest-builder-2s-game-and-art-director-on-board/">Automaton</a>), confirmed that the team brought in director Takuto Edagawa and art director Marina Ayano to share some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_quest_builders_2">Dragon Quest Builders 2</a> pearls of wisdom.</p>
<p>Edagawa and the Omega Force team apparently got on board after seeing senior director's Shigeru <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/pokemon-pokopias-roots-go-back-further-than-you-think">Ohmori's early prototype</a>, which was inspired by his time working on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/pokemon_ruby_and_sapphire">Ruby and Sapphire</a> back in the day. According to Edagawa, this prototype provided such a clear rundown of what Game Freak wanted to achieve with Pokopia, that Omega Force knew it'd be able to contribute to development.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fuwtrij&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>The game director went on to say that the teams worked closely together for three to four months before development officially started, ironing out any potential gameplay creases and tweaking the central ideas. While he didn't provide any specific dates, Pokopia development apparently wrapped up pretty quickly thanks to this collaborative planning effort, with many of the major hurdles dealt with way in advance.</p>
<p>This is reportedly the biggest team that Omega Force has ever mustered for a game, and while Edagawa and Ayano are new to working on the series, they believe they've made something that can be proudly delivered to Pokémon fans.</p>
<p>From the small amount that we've played so far, we have to agree! "Despite going in with the lowest of the low expectations," Ollie Reynolds wrote in our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/despite-low-expectations-pokemon-pokopia-had-me-grinning-from-ear-to-ear">hands-on preview</a>, "Pokopia was a huge surprise which had me grinning ear to ear". We're excited to see even more when the full game launches on <strong>5th March</strong>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>For the longest time, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/league-of-legends/" id="335">League of Legends</a> players have found themselves a little restricted when it comes to in-game voice chat. It’s admittedly not everyone’s cup of tea, but voice chat in League has, until now, been restricted to players in a <strong>premade party</strong>. It’s a system that has always operated directly through the game’s client, but it hasn’t ever been perfect.</p>



<p>It was recently discovered that Riot Games plans to blow that concept out of the water, finally adding global team chat that allows you to communicate with people outside your premade group.</p>











<p>It was recently discovered in the Public Beta for League of Legends that a setting is coming up that will allow users to ‘Enable Team Voice Chat’ when they join a lobby. Further to that revelation, dataminers have uncovered references to a full-fledged global voice chat system in League of Legends.</p>



<p>From what we know, it looks like you’ll have two inputs, bindable to whatever input you want. One button will allow you to PTT to talk to your <strong>party</strong>, while the other will allow you to speak to your wider team, even those who weren’t in your premade lobby and joined after the fact, or to fill the lobby.</p>



<p>League of Legends is, unfortunately, one of the most toxic games in the business, and that’s where the issues start to surface in the voice chat stakes. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/riot-games/" id="350">Riot Games</a> does have pretty good moderation mechanics, but opening up a global chat function might invite more chaos than they might like.</p>







<p>Are you looking forward to global, team-based voice chat in League of Legends? Let us know over on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Huggy Wuggy and Kissy Missy are more than just incredibly popular plushies, as they’re central to the plot of Poppy Playtime. Now that Chapter 5 is here, their stories have been continued, though there’s a fair share of ambiguity involved.</p>



<p>Whilst Kissy Missy remains as loyal as ever, Huggy Wuggy continues to be a menace as you work your way through the factory. However, when they’re finally reunited, there’s one question on everyone’s mind: Did Huggy Wuggy or Kissy Missy die?</p>







<p>It goes without saying that <strong>huge spoilers for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/poppy-playtime/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/poppy-playtime/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Poppy Playtime Chapter 5</a> lie ahead</strong>, so only read on if you’re desperate for the answer. </p>

<figure><figcaption>He’s fine… right? Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It’s unclear whether Huggy Wuggy dies at the end of Poppy Playtime Chapter 5, with the answer being purposefully left ambiguous by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/mob-entertainment/" id="3160" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mob Entertainment</a>. </strong></p>



<p>After another tense chase, Kissy Missy steps in to save the protagonist, reuniting with Huggy Wuggy at last. The moment doesn’t last long, however, as the Prototype suddenly impales him with its needle-like hand and tosses him aside.</p>

</ul>



<p>Even then, Huggy Wuggy is still visibly moving, lifting his head to look at the Prototype as it prepares another strike. Before anything more happens, the player is forced to flee, and that’s the last time he’s seen. Given his importance to the story, it seems unlikely the developers would kill him off-screen, suggesting he may still be alive—but what about Kissy Missy?</p>

<p><strong>Kissy Missy also falls victim to the Prototype shortly afterwards, suffering a similar impalement, though her fate is also unclear in Poppy Playtime Chapter 5.</strong></p>



<p>She’s last seen lying face down after the attack, which strongly suggests she could be dead. Still, there’s a small hint that she might have survived.</p>

Poppy Playtime Chapter 6, Explained</a></li>
</ul>



<p>After rescuing you, Giblet explains that Poppy has been taken by the Prototype and admits he doesn’t know what happened to Kissy Missy. The fact that her fate is mentioned but not confirmed keeps things uncertain, leaving the door open for her return.</p>

"In terms of communications, we will be focusing on providing you with updates about our live game content, community activations, and general upkeep through the TWID and our Destiny social channels."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The statement closed on thanking players for their "continued patience and support," and said there'll be more information on the next major update and future plans for Destiny 2 "closer to launch."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Raids and dungeons getting tiers and pantheon 2.0 is great, but will there even be anyone left playing by then?" asked one player on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1r8gvip/comment/o64wflf/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Destiny 2 subreddit</u></a>.

In its latest financial report, Sony said it had recorded a 31.5 billion yen (approx. $204.2 million) impairment charge as a result of Destiny 2’s underperformance.

            <p>The next big update to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>, Shadow and Order, has been delayed as it undergoes a substantial round of tweakage and expansion. Such a substantial round of tweakage and expansion, in fact, that it'll no longer be called Shadow and Order when it returns.</p>

<p>"This update is being changed and expanded to include sizable quality-of-life updates and as a result, will also be renamed," Bungie wrote in <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/destinythegame.bungie.net/post/3mf63bvtcms2g">their post</a> announcing the delay. The artist formerly known as Shadow and Order is now set to launch on June 9th, approximately three months on from its original March 3rd slot.</p>
<p>"We will provide exact details closer to release covering previously announced Weapon Tier Upgrading, but also additions like expanding Tiered Gear to all Raid and Dungeon activities, Pantheon 2.0, Tier 5 stats for Exotic Armors, and more," the studio continued.</p>

I can't help but think using the word final in that DLC's name probably isn't a move Bungie would repeat in hindsight.</p>

Former staff of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/enotria-the-last-song">Enotria: The Last Song</a> developers Jyamma Games have revealed to RPS that they’re owed months of unpaid salary, following layoffs at the company last year. They've shared an inside look at a troubled independent studio dealing with payment delays, multiple changes of direction, and general confusion that stretches back to spring 2025.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Founded in September 2019, Jyamma are one of Italy’s better-known indies. Based in Milan, they worked on several mobile games before breaking into PC and console development with Enotria, released in September 2024. We liked Enotria, a sunny and theatrical action-RPG with a distinct vocabulary of elements and status effects, set in a world of gorgeously distorted Italian folklore. RPS reviewer Caelyn Ellis <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/enotria-the-last-song-review">deemed it</a> “a delightful Soulslike palette cleanser to chase down <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-how-to-start">Shadow Of The Erdtree</a> with”. 
</p>
<p>
According to former workers who spoke to me on condition of anonymity, Jyamma were working on a sequel to The Last Song when the salary payment delays began over March and April 2025. At the time, staff were told the situation would be resolved quickly. 
</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun/Jyamma Games</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
In April, however, CEO Giacomo Greco put the Enotria sequel on hold. Instead, he announced plans for a trading card game adaptation of Dante Alighieri’s epic poem La Divina Comedia, aka The Divine Comedy - an exciting prospect, following Enotria’s explorations of Italian art and culture. Then, in May, Greco revealed to the rest of the studio in an email that Jyamma was experiencing financial difficulties, and would not be able to proceed with scheduled payments.
</p><p>
In a copy of the email to staff, shared with RPS, Greco attributed Jyamma’s cashflow problems to delayed collection of revenue from sales of Enotria on PlayStation across February, March and April. The company had already faced challenges bringing the game to Xbox Series X and S versions, with Microsoft <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/souslike-enotria-delayed-indefinitely-on-xbox-because-microsoft-decided-to-ignore-devs">promising</a> to "improve our processes" after Greco criticised them on Jyamma’s Discord.
</p>
<p>
The May email to staff stresses that "these issues are specifically related to the last couple of months," and mentions a forthcoming injection of cash from a government tax credit "within a couple of months." There is also talk of "several initiatives to attract private investments through a dedicated platform, which will allow us to diversify our funding sources and ensure greater long-term stability."
</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Jyamma Games</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
According to a copy of another email shared with us, this time written by administrative manager Anastasia Tsybakova on June 13th, outstanding payments for April had been "fully paid." But sources tell me that Jyamma management repeatedly postponed monthly payments through to August 2025, with one person commenting that "communication became inconsistent and unclear."
</p><p>
According to my sources, Greco announced another massive change of direction in July: the Divine Comedy adaptation would now be an action-RPG, like Enotria. Greco also told staff that Jyamma were in talks with Neowiz about potential funding. In another email sent to staff in July, he wrote that the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lies-of-p">Lies Of P</a> publishers had "expressed strong interest" in publishing either the Divine Comedy adaptation or Enotria 2, with "concrete updates" expected by September or October. 
</p>
<p>
The email also mentions discussions with investors about taking Jyamma public on the NASDAQ stock exchange – "a complex process that could take 6-12 months." In the event of Jyamma going public, the email suggests that Jyamma might “explore” distributing company shares to team members with stock benefits options. Finally, the email touches on some "long-term strategic opportunities" in the shape of very early discussions with Amazon and Tencent.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn43FTweX-s" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>


<p>
There is some existing public corroboration for the reports of delayed payments. Shortly after Jyamma <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dantes-epic-poem-la-divina-commedia-is-getting-turned-into-a-videogame-again">screened a trailer</a> for their Divine Comedy game at Gamescom Opening Night Live in August 2025, Italian streamers Blur and IlMasseo <a href="https://www.drcommodore.it/2025/08/26/jyamma-games-blur-ilmasseo-polemiche/">published allegations</a> that the studio still owed them payments for promotion of Enotria: The Last Song the previous year.
</p><p>
Things came to a head in October. According to sources, salaries for July were finally paid. Greco also announced that the studio would develop a 2.5D Enotria spin-off alongside the Divine Comedy game. In an email sent October 1st, he confirmed that Jyamma were "actively engaged in a deal and public listing process" on NASDAQ, to be finalised in "five-six" months. 
</p>
<p>
However, he also revealed plans for mass layoffs "to make the company more sustainable," with the promise to "ramp up again" and discuss rehiring staff once investment had been secured. According to one source, Jyamma made two separate rounds of layoffs in October and December. My sources noted with some bitterness that on the day of the original layoff announcement, Jyamma posted "Happy Birthday to us!" on their <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jyammagames/reel/DPRy3pACT1q/?hl=en">Instagram</a>. 
</p>
<p>
As of February 9th, sources tell me that some current Jyamma staff are getting paid. But several former team members are apparently still owed salary payments for August, September and October. 
</p>
<p>
It’s a depressing state of affairs for such an outwardly promising studio. Enotria is both a well-made game and a rich contribution to the wider compendium of Soulsliking - in foregrounding Italian folklore, it talks back to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> studio FromSoftware's <a href="https://www.killscreen.com/understanding-sublime-architecture-bloodborne/">representations of European culture and architecture</a>. 
</p><p>
I’m similarly enthused by what I’ve seen and read of Jyamma’s Divine Comedy adaptation, in which "dark forces subvert the promises of the poem," hinting at some degree of creative antagonism with the source text. Still, all of that comes second to ensuring that your staff have secure livelihoods.
</p>
<p>Approached for comment about these allegations of delayed payments, together with the reports of changes of project direction and publisher negotiations, Jyamma CEO Giacomo Greco offered the following general response:</p>
<blockquote><p>Enotria was an ambitious project, entirely self-financed, self-produced, and self-published, born from the passion of our team and several industry veterans, with the clear objective of establishing Jyamma Games' identity through the development of original IPs rooted in Italian culture.</p>
<p>The company has always acted with the well-being of its collaborators as a priority and has consistently worked to retain as many team members as possible. We confirm that we have never ceased compensating our collaborators. While some payments have been rescheduled, all commitments continue to be honored, as they have been regularly over the past six years. Following a necessary restructuring to ensure long-term sustainability, the current team is fully aligned with the studio's resources, and there are no payment delays.</p>
<p>Regarding the matter involving Italian streamers, Jyamma Games has always honored and will continue to honor all agreements made. The parties involved are working together to ensure that all agreed obligations are fulfilled.</p>
<p>Jyamma Games refrains from commenting on any rumors or speculation regarding projects or partnerships, and any information regarding its initiatives will be shared when appropriate.</p></blockquote>
<p>We've contacted Blur and IlMasseo for an update on whether they're still owed any payments by Jyamma.</p>

<p>God of War Ragnarok’s Kratos actor has shared some new details on the upcoming Trilogy Remake. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Sony’s PlayStation State of Play event brought two new announcements for God of War fans: the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-original-trilogy-remake-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmation</a> of the original Trilogy Remake and a shadow drop for the 2D prequel title, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-son-of-sparta-shadow-drops-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sons of Sparta</a>. Now, new information about the trilogy remake has been revealed. </p>







<h2 id="h-god-of-war-trilogy-remake-to-include-new-technology-and-fighting-system">God of War Trilogy Remake to Include New Technology and Fighting System </h2>



<p>Spotted in a video posted by RebsGaming on <a href="https://x.com/Mr_Rebs_/status/2024350952476856596" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), YouTuber Fuzhpuzy had the opportunity to meet Kratos actor, Christopher Judge, and ask him about the God of War Trilogy Remake. The YouTuber first asks whether Judge will be part of the remake, to which the actor replies, ‘No,’ and adds that it will include TC Carson, the original voice actor for Kratos from the Greek trilogy. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">YouTuber Fuzhpuzy asked God of War voice actor Christopher Judge if he’s in the upcoming GoW Remakes. He said:<br>•Kratos will be voiced by TC Carson in the remakes, Christopher won’t be in it. <br>•Remakes will have new technology, fighting system, and content. <br>•New GoW from Santa… <a href="https://t.co/bCSiIUiJEv">pic.twitter.com/bCSiIUiJEv</a></p>— Rebs Gaming (@Mr_Rebs_) <a href="https://twitter.com/Mr_Rebs_/status/2024350952476856596?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 19, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Judge elaborated that God of War Trilogy Remake is not a reboot and will feature “new technology” and a “new fighting system”. No details were revealed on what this new system would include or how it would change the previous one. Previously, we had only received confirmation that the trilogy remake is in development and were told it would be a long time before we received another update. The announcement also came through TC Carson, who confirmed that he will be voicing Kratos in the remake. </p>







<p>In other news, Christopher Judge has also stated that a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-actor-says-new-santa-monica-announcement-will-arrive-late-summer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Santa Monica announcement</a> is coming late summer.

<p>The actor who played Kratos in God of War 2018 has revealed some details about the trilogy remake and the next Santa Monica announcement. </p>



<p>God of War has been in the news a lot recently, and that’s all thanks to PlayStation’s latest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-original-trilogy-remake-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">State of Play event</a>, which dropped not but two announcements. There were already reports that Santa Monica was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/santa-monica-developing-more-than-just-god-of-war-trilogy-remake-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">developing another title</a> alongside the God of War Trilogy Remake, and now we have some more concrete information. </p>











<p>Spotted by RebsGaming on <a href="https://x.com/Mr_Rebs_/status/2024350952476856596" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), YouTuber Fuzhpuzy is seen talking to God of War 2018’s Kratos actor, Christopher Judge, at some fan expo. During their conversation, Judge talks about TC Carson playing Kratos in the trilogy remake before talking about what’s next. Judge states, “You’ll be hearing about what we’re doing probably late summer,” which hints at another announcement from Santa Monica. The video is currently unavailable on the YouTuber’s channel. </p>

<p>This is not the first time we have heard about Santa Monica’s other game.

However, one thing is unclear: whether this is the God of War Egypt game or some other IP altogether. Players will have to wait for an official announcement to know for sure. </p>







<p>In other news, God of War: Sons of Sparta is the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-is-the-worst-rated-game-in-the-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">worst-rated game in the series</a>.

            <p>Floundering PvP shooter Highguard lives on, as developer Wildlight releases a new content update and assures worried fans that ominous signs like the game's website going offline are "low priority" problems.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/4128260/view/518613150889673564">The new content update</a>, released overnight, adds an airship-featuring base to the game, a lockpick raid tool, and expands what's on sale in the Store. There's an owlbear-like mount there called a Moonbruin, and some Iron Vigil-themed outfits.</p>
<p>The patch arrives amidst growing concern that Highguard is about to shut down - an assumption that follows a bad start for the game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-not-shutting-down-following-wildlight-layoffs-with-a-core-group-of-members-left-to-support-game">resulting in lay-offs at Wildlight</a>, and more recently, <a href="https://playhighguard.com/">the game's website suddenly going offline</a>. (It's still offline, by the way.)</p>

</figure><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Q286nJoqI" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></p><p>But Wildlight remains outwardly resolute despite these setbacks, insisting in the game's Discord overnight that the website issue is nothing sinister. "Not sure on the timeframe, but basically needs to be transferred and simplified," explained Wildlight staff member WL_Coronach (<a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/2024081430674800915/photo/2">screenshotted by CharlieIntel</a>). "Low priority atm (reputational damage already done). Now we just need to focus on delivering updates and content to improve."</p>
<p>These comments follow a statement sent to Eurogamer earlier this month, regarding the layoffs, in which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-not-shutting-down-following-wildlight-layoffs-with-a-core-group-of-members-left-to-support-game">Wildguard said a "core group of developers" would remain to support Highguard</a>, and that the game wasn't about to close.</p>
<p>Highguard's had a hard time ever since closing The Game Awards in December. Despite the prominence of such an announcement and the proximity of a January release date, the game remained almost invisible until release, suggesting there were problems. Then when Highguard did finally arrive - a game with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> pedigree - it failed to convince. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/we-were-turned-into-a-joke-from-minute-one-fired-highguard-developer-reflects-on-games-ill-fated-launch-and-false-assumptions-after-game-awards-reveal">"We were turned into a joke from minute one," former Highguard developers said</a>.</p>

            <p>In the aftermath of reports claiming that the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) deepened their reliance on Microsoft’s cloud technology last year, No Azure for Apartheid have issued a statement demanding the company cut ties with the agency.</p>
<p><a href="https://noazureforapartheid.com/">No Azure for Apartheid</a> are the same <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-culture-of-intimidation-retaliation-and-oppression-how-microsofts-gaza-stance-fuelled-an-industry-spanning-boycott">worker-led group</a> who've carried out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/on-the-eve-of-gamescom-microsoft-workers-occupy-the-xbox-companys-campus-in-protest-at-dealings-with-the-israeli-military">protests</a> against Microsoft's dealings with the Israeli military, amid what Amnesty International and a UN enquiry <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/27/israel-still-committing-genocide-in-gaza-amnesty-international-says">have called</a> a genocide in Gaza.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>According to reporting from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/17/ice-microsoft-technology-immigration-crackdown">The Guardian</a> and partner publications <a href="https://www.972mag.com/ice-microsoft-azure-leaked-files/">+972 Magazine</a> and <a href="https://www.mekomit.co.il/">Local Call</a> earlier this week, leaked documents indicate that ICE increased the amount of data it stored on Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform from from 400 terabytes as of July 2025 to almost 1,400 terabytes as of January 2026. The agency are also reportedly using Microsoft "productivity tools, as well as AI-driven products, to search and analyse the data".</p>
<p>In a statement to The Guardian, a Microsoft spokesperson said that while they do "[provide] cloud-based productivity and collaboration tools to DHS and ICE" via "key partners", the company's policies and terms of service "do not allow our technology to be used for the mass surveillance of civilians, and we do not believe ICE is engaged in such activity".</p><p>Following this reporting, No Azure for Apartheid have issued a statement on the subject to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/microsofts-ties-with-ice-come-under-fire-amidst-allegations-that-the-companys-cloud-and-ai-technology-are-being-used-to-support-mass-surveillance-of-us-citizens/">PC Gamer</a>. "No Azure for Apartheid recognizes that the same Microsoft Cloud &amp; AI technology that forms the technological backbone of Israel's apartheid and genocide is the same technology that powers ICE's violence towards migrants and communities in the United States," the group wrote.</p>
<p>"We, as Microsoft workers, stand in solidarity both with Palestinians and the communities and families in the United States who are being terrorized, detained, murdered, and deported by ICE," they continued. "We echo the demands of hundreds of workers and community members who spoke out as early as 2018 to demand Microsoft cut ties with ICE."</p>
<p>I've reached out to Microsoft for comment.</p>
<p>Microsoft reportedly revoked the Israeli military's access to certain Azure cloud and generative AI technologies <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-block-israels-access-to-azure-and-genai-tech-used-to-surveil-millions-of-palestinian-phone-calls-according-to-report">in September last year</a>, following reporting that this tech was being used for surveilance of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fortnite is seemingly going to collab with one of the most popular live-action series out there, Game of Thrones. </p>



<p>Collabs are something Fortnite is known for, and the developers have been cooking up some really cool ones lately. Some of the biggest ones we have seen lately are with The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-the-simpsons-battle-price-all-rewards-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Simpsons</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-39-20-patch-notes-january-9/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">South Park</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-to-feature-quentin-tarantinos-dream-kill-bill-chapter-later-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kill Bill</a>, Back to the Future, and more. Now, it seems that Epic might have even more in store for us. </p>







<h2 id="h-fortnite-x-game-of-thrones-is-in-development">Fortnite x Game of Thrones is in Development</h2>



<p>The news about the Game of Thrones and Fortnite collab comes from AdiraFNInfo on <a href="https://x.com/AdiraFNInfo/status/2024434171444101235" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) and has been corroborated by reliable leaker, <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/2024434380031017202" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">HYPEX</a>. The collaboration is expected to arrive “soon,” but the contents and scope of this crossover were not revealed. </p>



<p>Game of Thrones is a fantasy drama series by HBO, an adaptation of George R. R. Martin’s novel. It received widespread critical acclaim and spawned spinoffs such as House of the Dragon, A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms, and more. </p>



<p>Some of the most popular characters from the series include Jon Snow (played by Kit Harrington), Arya Stark (played by Maisie Williams), Daenerys Targaryen (played by Emilia Clarke), Tyrion Lannister (played by Peter Dinklage), and more. Players would also love to see the Dragons come to Fortnite as a part of this collaboration. </p>



<p>A lot of rumoured Fortnite collaborations have surfaced recently. We have been informed of crossovers with franchises such as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-has-a-kingdom-hearts-collab-in-development-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Hearts</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/vampire-diaries-fortnite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vampire Diaries</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-rumored-to-be-working-on-a-minecraft-collab/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Minecraft</a>, and others; however, none have been officially revealed yet. Some of the leaks that have been accurately revealed recently include <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-leak-reveals-the-office-collab-skins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Office</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-x-fortnite-collaboration-dropping-in-months-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Overwatch</a>. </p>

            <p>
Match of the Day football commentator Guy Mowbray has revealed he gave EA permission to create an AI voice clone of himself in order to assist with some of the more onerous aspects of recording commentary for EA Sports FC.
</p>
<p>
Mowbray shared the news as part of a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/c4g40828ngjo">BBC feature exploring how EA Sports FC's commentaries are made</a>, explaining that these days, recording or preparing for the game is a "part of my weekly routine", taking up "pretty much every week from November all the way through to the start of July."
</p>
<p>
"It takes so long because for every single facet of the game that you could think of, we have to cover every scenario," he revealed. "It is so in-depth because it has got to feel and sound real - the whole point of the game is its authenticity."
</p>
<p>
According to the report, one of the most repetitive elements of the recording process is reading out the name of every player in the game. Each name must be recorded several times, in different intonations, in order to fit within the wider commentary, and EA Sports FC features "more than 20,000 real male and female footballers". As such, EA now uses AI to replicate Mowbray's voice - with his permission - to "help" with this aspect of recording.
</p><p>
"AI has long been part of our development pipeline, from animation to gameplay systems," EA told the BBC in reference to its AI usage, "and continues to support our teams in making better, more responsive football experiences. But when it comes to commentary and content, it's always a collaboration with our talent - not a replacement."
</p>
<p>
Generative AI does, of course, remain hugely controversial given the numerous ethical concerns associated with the technology. And it's proved particularly contentious in the realm of video game voice acting. Last year, US voice actors union SAG-AFTRA <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/voice-actors-relieved-to-have-the-freedom-to-work-again-says-jennifer-hale-as-sag-aftra-strike-ends">ended a lengthy strike</a> after finally securing "safety guardrails" around AI - and one of the union's key requirements was that companies pay actors on an equivalent basis for digitally replicated voices.
</p>

			<p>After having been away from <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">Monster Hunter Wilds</a></em></strong> since defeating <strong>Mizutsune</strong> in the game's first major update, I returned to the latest entry in the series this week with <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-update-1-041-00-00-full-patch-notes-cpu-gpu-load/">Update 1.041.00.00</a></strong>, finding a very different experience. While the <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-patch-significant-performance-improvements/"><strong>performance improvements</strong></a> introduced in the last couple of patches have made the game run significantly better on my PC, it's the staggering amount of new content that impressed me the most. With a new endgame grind for <strong>Talismans</strong> and a host of new monsters, I expect to continue playing until the launch of the <strong>Master Rank expansion</strong>.</p>



<p>While I looked at the mountain ahead of me, represented by the ultra-difficult <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Proof of a Hero</strong> quest, which involves defeating all four <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Arch-tempered</strong> variants of the Apex monsters, however, I didn't expect to discover that <strong>even more challenges could be on the way</strong>.</p>



<p>Over on the <strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/monsterhunterleaks/comments/1r8c00w/tempered_gogmazios_and_zoh_shia_sw2_version/"><em>Monster Hunter Leaks</em> subreddit</a></strong>, user <strong>Lener30</strong> posted findings after digging into the update's files. Interestingly, <strong>Tempered</strong> variants of <strong>Gogmazios</strong> and <strong>Zo Shia</strong> appear to be in the works. For the former, a <strong>LegendaryParam</strong> file has been added, strongly hinting that this variant of the monster is indeed coming. For <strong>Zo Shia</strong>, while the update does not mention the monster by name, plenty of its moves have seen changes in its own <strong>LegendaryParam</strong> file, which will likely make this new variant of the base game’s final boss significantly<strong> more challenging.</strong></p>



<p>Besides the upcoming content, the latest update adds more fuel to the fire regarding a <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/think-monster-hunter-wilds-on-nintendo-switch-2-will-be-an-impossible-port-new-screenshot-and-information-suggest-otherwise/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nintendo Switch 2</em> port</strong></a>. While text references to the system have been scrubbed, the update files still hide a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">tutorial image for Local Communication</strong> play that clearly depicts <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nintendo Switch 2</em></strong> systems. At this point, it seems a matter of when, not if, the game is announced for Nintendo's next-gen hardware. Launching in a complete state with proper optimization will definitely help the game's popularity, which was initially hindered by technical and low challenge issues.</p>



<p>Will the updates released so far be enough to bring back lapsed players, as <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/i-would-appreciate-it-if-you-could-pick-it-up-again-monster-hunter-wilds-director-pleads-with-lapsed-players-to-return/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Game Director Yuya Tokuda pleaded last year?</strong></a> I believe they will. This isn't just an opinion based on my positive experience since yesterday: hard facts support it. The game's latest reviews on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/">Steam</a></strong> are now <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Mostly Positive (72%)</strong>, a considerable improvement over the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Mixed</strong> status they held for a long time.</p>
