Beadle &amp; Grimm’s Platinum Edition Box Sets</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Picking up one of these premium campaign sets is a delightfully self-serving option to give to your DM. These are packed with premium maps, miniatures, handouts, and props that support specific campaigns. That includes recent additions like <em>Adventures in the Multiverse</em> and <em>Phandelver and Below: The Shattered Obelisk</em>.

Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Red Dragon’s Tale LEGO Set</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">This 2,000+ piece LEGO set commemorates D&amp;D’s 50th anniversary (and so could very easily go on that list as well), but at more than $350, it certainly sits squarely in the high-end space. This set includes some really neat stuff, like a dragon, owlbear, beholder, and gelatinous cube, as well as some preset PCs for you to control. LEGO can be a bit pricey, but this set is still cheaper than most battlemats and painted miniatures!

Damascus Steel True Metal Dice</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">This incredibly beautiful, absurdly luxury set of dice is forged from the same steel alloy found in the weapons of soldiers in a bygone age.

It sports an ambidextrous design with four additional programmable buttons--two on either side of the mouse. Like the Retro 87's directional keys, the Retro R8's extra buttons match the colors of the Xbox controller's face buttons. You can connect use the mouse on Windows or Android devices wirelessly via Bluetooth or 2.4G wireless, or through wired USB-C connections. The mouse ships with a charging dock and includes a one-month subscription to PC Game Pass. Preorders are available now at Amazon.</p><hr><p dir="ltr">In case you'd prefer a different design, several other 8BitDo TKL keyboards are on sale for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/black-friday/">Black Friday</a>. The company has several designs, like the NES-inspired <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mechanical-Keyboard-Bluetooth-Swappable-Programmable-PC/dp/B0CCP8KYGG?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">N Edition</a>, the Famicom-inspired <a href="https://www.amazon.com/8Bitdo-Mechanical-Bluetooth-Swappable-Programmable/dp/B0CH4MPJJ8?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fami Edition</a>, and the Commodore 64-themed <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mechanical-Keyboard-Bluetooth-Swappable-Programmable-PC/dp/B0CYSQWYZP?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">C64 Edition</a>. These are all TKL models, meaning they lack the numpad of a full-size keyboard--but if you find yourself missing those extra keys, 8BitDo sells numpad add-ons for these keyboards. That said, if you'd prefer a more all-in-one solution, the company will be rolling out full-sized versions of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DKXH5WCD?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">N Edition</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DKXDH8BG?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fami Edition</a> keyboards on December 12, which you can preorder at Amazon. </p><p dir="ltr">As for alternative mouse options, 8BitDo also makes an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/8Bitdo-Wireless-Receiver-Buttons-Windows/dp/B0BZRXK2LK?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">NES-inspired N30 wireless mouse</a> with buttons and a D-pad that look identical to the inputs on the NES gamepad.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/29/24309019/black-friday-2024-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-totk-nintendo-switch-cyber-monday<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Significant discounts on first-party Nintendo Switch games can be notoriously difficult to come by, particularly on landmark titles like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14787082/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review"><em><strong>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</strong></em></a>. However, that trend seems to be shifting with Black Friday, as last year’s Game of the Year contender has dropped to just $30 ($40 off) at <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FThe-Legend-of-Zelda-Tears-of-the-Kingdom-Nintendo-Switch%2F3416965843">Walmart</a> for a limited time, beating its previous low by $10.</p><p>Nintendo’s action-adventure RPG presents a familiar premise: you’re ultimately chasing after the malevolent Ganon in hopes of saving Princess Zelda and protecting the kingdom of Hyrule. But wait, didn’t we do that in the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14787082/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review">last game</a> and many before it? How could she <em>possibly</em> fall into that predicament yet again? I’ll leave you to uncover the details, but let’s just say there’s enough timeline shifting to make Doctor Strange blush. </p><div><p><em>Tears of the Kingdom </em>is the latest installment in the <em>Zelda </em>franchise. The storyline and gameplay are similar to <em>Breath of the Wild</em>’s<em>, </em>but enough has changed to make Link’s return to Hyrule plenty special. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch">Read our review</a>.</p></div><p>You’ll have tons to do around the realm in pursuit of her safety, too. There are plenty of puzzling shrines to complete, weapons to collect, and open regions to explore, including floating islands and harrowing subsurface caverns. It’s a familiar trek on the surface, but there are enough changes and secrets to keep it feeling fresh if you’ve played the equally impressive <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14787082/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em></a>.</p><p>What you can’t find in the wild, you’ll probably be able to craft using an imaginative system that lets you leverage anything you can stuff into your inventory. Link also has a few new tricks up his sleeve to aid in combat and traversal, including teleportation and the ability to alchemically phase through walls and objects. If you could have just one game hold you over until Nintendo launches the heavily rumored<a href="https://www.theverge.com/24051677/nintendo-switch-2-pro-rumors-news"> Switch 2</a>, <em>Tears of the Kingdom </em>is it.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p> / <span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

When <em>The Severance Podcast With Ben Stiller and Adam Scott </em>debuts, it’ll launch with two episodes dedicated solely to the first season, with a new episode dropping every weekday through January 16. That’s nine episodes dedicated to unraveling this corridor maze of a show. After that, the pair will dig into the second season every Friday starting January 17.</p><p>They’ll be joined by some other Lumon loyalists—Zach Cherry, John Turturro, and Britt Lower—as guests on the podcast, hopefully to give context to some of the wildest moments of the first season.

While we await the Great War of Innie vs. Outie vs Lumon vs. our collective sanity, Scott and Stiller’s new podcast should be the companion piece we all need. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Though, I have to admit, getting $50 worth of Robux at a $10 discount is something you could even gift to yourself. A $50 gift card is equivalent to about 4,500 Robux. By saving $10, you're basically getting 900 Robux for free.

Far from it, based on leaked specs that suggest they have fewer cores, less memory, and less memory bandwidth than some of their Intel predecessors. </p><p>But they could also be a value leader. Retailer leaks <a href="https://x.com/momomo_us/status/1861788237456711881">spotted by Momomo_us</a> suggest Intel’s own “Limited Edition” Arc B580 could cost just $250. </p><p>While no confirmed specs have surfaced just yet, <a href="https://www.hardwareluxx.de/index.php/news/hardware/grafikkarten/64956-intel-arc-battlemage-amazon-f%C3%BChrt-asrock-intel-arc-b580-steel-legend.html">one particular GPU leak on Amazon</a> suggested that the B580 will feature 20 Xe2 cores, a 2.8GHz GPU clock, 12GB of GDDR6 graphics memory at 19Gbps with a 192-bit memory interface, and require as little as two axial fans and one single 8-pin PCIe power connector (though another variant was spotted with three fans and two connectors.) They may also connect to a motherboard with a PCIe 5.0 x8 connector.</p><p>If <em>Videocardz</em> is correct, we won’t have to speculate for long: full confirmed details should arrive this Tuesday. </p><p>It’d be nice to see the lower end of the GPU market get shaken up a bit. What with the pandemic, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/1/23191634/nvidia-amd-gpu-shortage-over-3080-3070-3060-radeon-rx-6900-6800">the great GPU shortage</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/24/23734022/nvidia-rtx-4060-ti-amd-rx-7600-gpu-graphics-card-benchmark-test">its aftermath</a>, it’s been a while since big GPU boosts have felt affordable. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Upcoming Sci-Fi Game Exodus, is Getting An Official TTRPG]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/upcoming-sci-fi-game-exodus-is-getting-official-ttrpg</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/upcoming-sci-fi-game-exodus-is-getting-an-official-ttrpg.1048401/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/upcoming-sci-fi-game-exodus-is-getting-official-ttrpg<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The upcoming sci-fi game, <em>Exodus</em>, is getting a TTRPG. This original game property, formally announced during 2023's The Game Awards, has yet to show official gameplay, but will offer early adopters a chance to buy an official core rulebook. Given the developer's parent company, that isn't a major stretch.</p>

<h2>The <em>Exodus</em> TTRPG Announcement</h2>

<p>According to its <a href="https://www.exodusgame.com/en-US/founders-special-limited-time-offer" rel="nofollow">official website</a>, the <em>Exodus</em> TTRPG is part of a special, limited-time offer for those part of the game's Founder program. You can become a Founder by simply providing your email address and signing up for game development updates.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/exodus-alien-planet-screenshot.jpg?itok=HRe0N8qz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/exodus-alien-planet-screenshot.jpg?itok=CfcByxbz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>If you become a Founder before December 10, 2024, at 9:59 PM PT, you will receive an email with a link to an order site and a unique code. You can use the link and the code to purchase the <em>Exodus Traveler's Handbook</em>.</p>

<p>The post explains that the <em>Exodus</em> TTRPG's announcement is to celebrate the first anniversary of the announcement of the game and as a special thanks to its community. Aside from this text, no other concrete details about the TTRPG are provided. No game system is mentioned. No confirmed long-term support. No associated products like custom dice or GM Screens are included.</p>

<p>This same vibes-driven marketing is echoed in the <em>Exodus</em> videogame itself. Outside of some prerendered trailers, no gameplay footage has been shown. It's not even clear what its core gameplay will center around. Is it a single-player survival sim? A multiplayer survival game in the style of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/rust" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Rust</em></a>? No one knows.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/exodus-alien-spaceship.jpg?itok=hPqiE1VT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/exodus-alien-spaceship.jpg?itok=qhPe04O3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The one high concept the game has is the cost of time dilation during interstellar travel, similar to the Christopher Nolan film <em>Interstellar</em>. This is a deliberate choice since the game's announcement at 2023's The Game Awards was introduced <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkbPhbyPWCk" rel="nofollow">by Matthew McConaughey</a>, the star of that film.</p>

<p>This does not mean that <em>Exodus</em> and its associated TTRPG are vaporware of any kind. The game is being developed by Archetype Entertainment, whose founders include former Bioware developers, the creative voices behind the original <em>Baldur's Gate</em> and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/mass-effect-legendary-edition" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Mass Effect</em></a> trilogy.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Archetype is a subsidiary of Wizards of the Coast, the tabletop giant behind <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>. Given that much of Bioware's early work was built on the gameplay foundations of earlier editions of <em>D&amp;D</em>, there's a good chance the <em>Exodus</em> TTRPG may be built on similar foundations.</p>

<p>The <em>Exodus</em> videogame has no official release date at time of writing.</p>

You'll still want to be careful when using it as there is some degree of sharpness to the blade. The colors on this prop are quite nice though, and feature rich silver, purple, and gold metallic layers.</p><p>The other cool feature on this is that it can blast some sword-swinging sound effects, as well as several songs from The Legend of Zelda series. When you're not admiring it in your hands, you can proudly display it at home on its included stand.</p><p>Alternatively, there are some other nice display and cosplay options available for sale. If you don't feel like dropping $200 on the Master Sword, there's a more affordable $25 version available. This one isn't as detailed--or as sharp--as the one above, but you'll probably have an easier time getting into a convention with it and you won't lose sleep about it going through several baggage handlers during your flight.</p><p>And what good is a sword without a shield? The officially licensed Hylian shield replica is just $20, and while it won't stop a Bokoblin attack, it at least looks the part if you're aiming to complete your outfit. </p><h3>More Legend of Zelda prop replicas</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Legend-Zelda-Link-Sword/dp/B00SJPBRQE?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Officially licensed Master Sword</a> -- $25 ($<strike>32</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Disguise-85719-Link-Shield-Costume/dp/B00SJPBQXI?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Officially licensed Hylian Shield</a> -- $20 ($<strike>27</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Paladone-PP4934NN-Master-Sword-Light/dp/B07MM37QSW?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Officially licensed Master Sword Paladone Light</a> -- $40</li></ul><hr>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/29/stalker-2-patch-1-0-1-promises-over-650-fixes-on-pc-and-xbox/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>GSC Game Worlds has released <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/stalker-2">STALKER 2</a> patch 1.0.1, the studio working hard to patch out the wide array of bugs, quirks, progress blockers and glitches that players have encountered with the long-awaited sequel.</p>
<p>This is the first post-launch patch with over 650 different bugs and issues addressed across both <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC, though the studio acknowledges that there’s a good bit more work still to do. In particular, they highlight fixes for the A-Life bugs, which have affected the ambient interactions with creatures and different factions in the game.</p>


<p>Still, this is a great first step for the studio, and it must be said that the issues we encountered while reviewing were not game-breaking, but more on the amusing quirks end of the spectrum. See our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/21/stalker-2-review-heart-of-chornobyl/">STALKER 2 review</a> here.</p>

<p>And 7 other minor audio &amp; sound bugs.</p>

<p>You can read the official press release below:</p>



<div><p>Skipton, WY, UK – 29/11/2024 – Assassin’s Creed has had some truly unique Swords over the years, but arguably the most iconic is the Sword of Altaïr from the original Assassin’s Creed. Now you can own this truly legendary piece of gaming history for yourself, with the official release coming today, Black Friday!</p><p>This beautifully sculpted sword was meticulously crafted using over 200 references and hundreds of hours of gameplay from the original Assassin’s Creed released in 2007. Having to reverse-engineer this sword from nothing but low-res polygons and pixels to create this stunning 1:1 scale replica, Raven Forge also drew heavily on their own sword fighting background to not only know how this sword should look, but also the size and more importantly, how it should feel.</p><p>This is an arming sword, a knightly sword, the sword that is drawn in emergencies when subtlety has failed and armed combat is the only option. Heavy enough to parry a guard’s blade, light enough to be moved with ease. The swooping eagle quillons or cross guards have been made aggressive and angular, simulating a hunting bird of prey. The signature reversed “V” on the blade below the triple fullers is meticulously hand-ground on each sword that passes through our doors. When you hold this sword, you’ll know you’re holding the legendary sword of Altaïr.</p><p>With a beautiful wall plaque in the shape of the Assassin’s Creed logo and painted in the colours of the brotherhood accompanying the polished stainless steel and spiral black leather of the replica sword, and a stunning double-sided certificate of authenticity, as well as a hidden easter egg for the true fans, this is the ultimate addition to any Assassin’s Creed, prop replica weapon, or indeed any pop culture collection anywhere.</p><p>With the partnership between Ubisoft and Raven Forge now well established, we can expect to see some more highly collectable legendary weapons and products coming out soon that will excite the Assassin’s Creed fanbase as much as the Sword of Altaïr has!</p><p>With this being the first of a highly anticipated collection of legendary items from iconic games, TV and Films, Raven Forge continues to push forward into the world of high-end collectables, with more very close on the horizon.</p><p>Raven Forge is a small company from the UK, based in rainy Skipton in the Yorkshire Dales, that was founded and is run by two brothers, Sam and Tom Ive. Sam and Tom grew up on fantasy, sci-fi, and computer games, with a deep love of everything from Star Trek to Lord of the Rings, Terry Pratchett, Final Fantasy, Dungeons and Dragons, and everything in between. Now, they run one of the largest stockists of fantasy and historical memorabilia and collectibles in the UK.</p></div>

            <p>
A little over week after <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stalker-2">Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a>'s launch, developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/gsc-game-world">GSC Game World</a> is back with the post-apocalyptic shooter's first patch, promising over 650 fixes for Xbox and PC.
</p>
<p>
Stalker 2 recieved a solid critical reception last week, but rare was the review that didn't acknowledge its significant technical issues. "There are many instances where that bugginess still affects quests, gets you killed, or leaves you befuddled," we noted in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review">our three star review</a>, "and it all hurts the game's natural playability quite badly, even if it is often funny."
</p>
<p>
GSC Game World <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-dev-acknowledges-rough-edges-says-its-monitoring-feedback">moved quickly to acknowledged concerns</a>, however, promising a first batch of fixes was on the way. And that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/4455844537830474602?l=english">initial patch is now here</a>, bringing "over 650 fixes, including quest blockers, memory leaks, crashes, and minor bugs."

<p>
There are AI improvements, "approximately 100" crash fixes, audio and sound adjustments, balance changes, as well as a whole sweep of tweaks intended to enhance everything from combat and the open-world experience to character models and cutscenes. GSC's release notes are pretty lengthy, but you'll find the full breakdown below.
</p><p>
Concluding its Patch 1.0.1 announcement, the studio thanked fans for their "feedback, passion, and support", adding that "work on the game and future patches" continues. It also noted it's already tackling A-Life bugs, with those fixes coming at a later date.
</p>
<p>
Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl has, of course, got off to an impressive start despite its technical issues. Earlier this week, GSC Game World revealed the shooter has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-has-sold-1-million-copies-so-far">already sold 1m copies</a> - and that figure doesn't including all those players exploring The Zone via Game Pass.

Here are another 20 games you’ve almost definitely never heard of before, but each offering something unique, special, or outright bizarre. Get your wishlist-clicking fingers ready.</p><p>Following on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/thanksgaming-24-indie-games-wishlist-steam-1851709999&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/thanksgaming-24-indie-games-wishlist-steam-1851709999">from yesterday’s first 20 games</a></span>, I’ve once more randomly picked another 20 from the almost 500 emails sent in with submissions. It’s heartbreaking to leave 460 games unmentioned, but I have to stop somewhere, because apparently humans need food and sleep.</p><p>I implore you to follow the links on anything here that catches you eye, and wishlist or buy what you find. This slideshow features the most extraordinary range of genres, game-types, and aesthetics, from predominantly tiny teams of astonishingly talented people, some out now, some coming soon. Support them! Even if it’s to follow the link to their Bluesky and message them saying you think they’re incredible.</p><p>And now, dive in, to a selection of such variety you’ll rub your eyes in disbelief.</p></div></div><div><p>PLAY THE VIDEO! Seriously, play it. It’s so short, but it has SO MUCH! It looks like if the <em>Persona </em>developers made <em>Disco Elysium</em>, and it’s hard to think of a more compelling description than that.</p><p>In <em>Gorepunk</em>, recycling is religion, and humanity lives in the corpse of a fallen, undying titan, and that’s just the start of the weirdness, where your daily actions are decided by dice rolls, conversations open up unique pathways, and—well, just watch the video again! I’m so hyped.</p><p>The game is in development, but there’s a janky build you can get right now from Itch that’s being frequently updated.</p><p>  <strong>Developer: </strong>Milan Lefferts<br><strong>Release date: </strong>TBA<br><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://heartcasegames.itch.io/gorepunk&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://heartcasegames.itch.io/gorepunk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Itch</a></span></p></div><div><p>OK, they had me at “unique hugging mechanic.” <em>Fatherhood</em> is a game about being a father, protecting his blind daughter, during a war. It’s a 2.5D side-scrolling game, with <em>Inside</em> vibes, stealth mechanics, and what looks like a heartbreaking relationship to protect. There’s a demo via the Itch page.</p><p>  <strong>Developer: </strong>Persis Play<br><strong>Release date: </strong>TBA<br><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2180850/Fatherhood/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2180850/Fatherhood/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a></span> / <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://persisplay.itch.io/fatherhood&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://persisplay.itch.io/fatherhood" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Itch</a></span></p></div><div><p>I love how visual novels are drawing in more and more of the features of classic adventure games, proving yet again my theory that all genres want to evolve to point-and-click eventually. <em>Ventreville</em> looks to have far more interactivity than the genre is known for, with a town to explore, six protagonists, puzzles to solve, all in the name of uncovering the secrets of Remedium, a cure to a plague that is destroying the city.</p><p>This is a fair way off, with a release date in 2026, but there’s already a demo to give you a taste.</p><p>  <strong>Developer: </strong>Spicy Bread Productions<br><strong>Release date: </strong>Q2 2026<br><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2992580/Ventreville_A_Cure_for_Sorrow/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2992580/Ventreville_A_Cure_for_Sorrow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a></span></p></div><div><p>If the wonderful name isn’t already enough, wait until you learn this is a narrative-driven rhythm-action game about being a hairdresser to the supernatural in late-’70s Barcelona.</p><p>Wow.</p><p>You trim and style characters’ hair in time with the relaxed beats, while learning the backstories of your clientele, be they werewolves, banshees, vampires... And it all adds up to an intriguing mystery tale. Again: wow.</p><p>  <strong>Developer: </strong>Omaet Games<br><strong>Release date: </strong>TBA<br><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://discord.gg/BPUwkEjBDq&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://discord.gg/BPUwkEjBDq" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord</a></span></p></div><div><p>An indie take on <em>Might &amp; Magic</em>, <em>Monsters of Mican </em>is a first-person RPG with hand-made dungeons, squillions of monsters, spellcasting, loot-seeking and 14 character classes to choose from.</p><p>Which is quite the thing, especially when you learn it’s all the work of one person! It was released to seemingly very little attention in March this year, yet there’s an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/ZesLZX8acGw?si=6Xvn0NV1MAWuBnYU&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/ZesLZX8acGw?si=6Xvn0NV1MAWuBnYU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">expansion</a></span> coming soon!

We just went from a haircutting rhythm game to a <em>Might &amp; Magic</em> tribute, and now to a two-person team’s game about being an inspector of haunted cabins in a cabin factory.</p><p>Well, actually, your job is to determined if they <em>are</em> haunted, although given it’s a horror game, I’m betting the chances are reasonably high. What a fantastically strange and brilliant idea—and we get to play it in just a couple of weeks!</p><p>  <strong>Developer: </strong>International Cat Studios<br><strong>Release date: </strong>December 13<br><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/3311740/The_Cabin_Factory/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3311740/The_Cabin_Factory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a></span></p></div><div><p>A time-management life-sim, <em>Carbonflesh</em> is all about mending your body and restoring your life after a self-induced coma. You’re escaping a prison train and attempting to reclaim all that is yours, while managing resources, hacking systems, and building up bases, all while seemingly conversing with a Patrick Stewart in your head. Watch the trailer if you don’t believe me.</p><p>There’s a demo now, although no release date yet.</p><p>  <strong>Developer: </strong>In The Flesh<br><strong>Release date: </strong>TBA<br><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2191720/Carbonflesh/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2191720/Carbonflesh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a></span></p></div><div><p>I just cannot get over how much I love the extraordinary variety of indie gaming. Especially when it comes to those games that take risks no AA or AAA game ever could. There’s <em>nothing</em> else out there that looks like <em>Dome-King Cabbage</em>, and it’s <em>everything I want</em>.</p><p>Describing itself as “a visual novel made of a vibrant collection of psychedelic visuals, warbled beats, and colorful stories,” it’s apparently set inside the world of a monster-collecting RPG, with a protagonist who’s “grappling with their ability to perceive reality through an RPG lens.”</p><p>I’ve <em>no idea</em> what that means, and I want to play it so very, very much.</p><p>  <strong>Developer: </strong>Cobysoft<br><strong>Release date: </strong>TBA<br><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2092510/DomeKing_Cabbage/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2092510/DomeKing_Cabbage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a></span></p></div><div><p>I’ve been craving a new metroidvania, so I’m very pleased to have <em>Stardust Demon</em> cross my path. The colorful retro-style game came out at the end of October, but has yet to trouble the attention of the gaming press (beyond the eagle eyes of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stardust-demon-is-an-intergalactic-metroidvania-that-looks-very-snazzy-indeed-and-its-out-now&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stardust-demon-is-an-intergalactic-metroidvania-that-looks-very-snazzy-indeed-and-its-out-now" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>RPS</em></a></span>), so it’s good to get some eyes on it.</p><p>There’s the traditional mix of platforming, combat and puzzles, somehow created by just two people, the couple behind 2020's “dreamyqueer” <em>Salad Fields. </em>There’s a demo of <em>Stardust Demon</em> if you want to check that out first.</p><p>  <strong>Developer: </strong>resnijars<br><strong>Release date: </strong>Out now<br><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2815500/Stardust_Demon/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2815500/Stardust_Demon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a></span></p></div><div><p>A puzzle-platformer that’s heavy on the puzzles, and also the platforming, and it’s not exactly going easy on the combat. <em>Gigasword</em> says it will have “intricate puzzles” alongside its titular enormous weapon.</p><p>Our hero Ezra must reach the top of the Nestrium to recover the God Crystal, which is uncannily like my upcoming weekend. Again, this is a game created by just one guy, Jack! These solo-devs bemuse me with not only their talent, but their tenacity to get beyond, “It’d be nice to make a game one day,” before wandering off into the kitchen to stick their finger in the peanut butter jar...</p><p>Oh, and there’s a demo.</p><p>  <strong>Developer: </strong>Studio Hybrid<br><strong>Release date: </strong>TBA<br><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1885930/GIGASWORD/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1885930/GIGASWORD/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a></span></p></div><div><p>Another solo dev, and mmmmmm, more PSX lost disc horror goodness! Despite never owning a PS1 during its era, I still find myself just compelled by this aesthetic, and the apparently shouted <em>THRESHOLD</em> looks like a splendid rendition.</p><p>An endless train thunders through a decaying station, says the game’s description, continuing, “Don’t speak. Don’t run. Don’t look in the train. Just do your job. It’ll all be over soon.” I’m so in. And the game just came out!</p><p>  <strong>Developer: </strong>Julien Eveillé<br><strong>Release date: </strong>Out now<br><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2580020/THRESHOLD/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2580020/THRESHOLD/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a></span></p></div><div><p>The incredibly prolific MythicOwl has made a whole bunch of splendid games that have gone cruelly under-noticed. I definitely recommend puzzle game <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/785890/Hexologic/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/785890/Hexologic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hexologic</a></span>, but prove myself as bad as everyone else by having missed the release of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2447030/Planetiles/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2447030/Planetiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Planetiles</em></a></span> this year! [Installs]</p><p>Next is <em>Truckful</em>, and oh my goodness, have you ever wanted to cuddle a YouTube video? This looks so utterly delightful, a game where you play a pickup-driving courier, delivering goods to a small town in the woods, but stumble upon a mystery. “Beware, the old forest is watching.”</p><p>  <strong>Developer: </strong>MythicOwl<br><strong>Release date: </strong>TBA<br><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/3090810/Truckful/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3090810/Truckful/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a></span></p></div><div><p>Not a word wasted in this splendid title, because <em>Flocking Hell</em> is a turn-based strategy game about protecting your sheep from invading demonic legions.</p><p>I love the suggestion of blending “calm exploration with auto-battler combat,” in a game that boasts “a lot of sheep.”</p><p>Levels are designed to last five minutes, with an emphasis on low stress, and that sounds good to me. It’s out next March, but there’s already a demo.</p><p>  <strong>Developer:</strong> Sextant Studios<br><strong>Release date:</strong> March 2025<br><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/3236280/Flocking_Hell/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3236280/Flocking_Hell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a></span></p></div><div><p>Space-zapping games have always called me in, but then I’ve proven myself inept almost every time. It’s something about enemies being perpetually behind me that gets me. I don’t get that vibe at all from <em>Rogue Eclipse </em>by Husban Siddiqi.</p><p>The game boasts destructible environments, which is ace for a space-set game, with an upgradeable ship and roguelike structure that suggests to me a game where my inevitable defeats will be turned into progress, which is very appealing.</p><p>  <strong>Developer:</strong> HUSKRAFTS<br><strong>Release date:</strong> TBA<br><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/782260/Rogue_Eclipse/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/782260/Rogue_Eclipse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a></span></p></div><div><p>I love a two-game elevator pitch, and especially love the sound of “<em>Spelunky</em> meets <em>Thief</em>.” That’s the claim of <em>Don’t Wake The Beast</em>, a top-down pixel steal ‘em up in a fantasy setting. Oh, and it has a grappling hook, which always guarantees an extra 10 percent on any game score.</p><p>Also, the roguelite stealth game appears to feature some absolutely <em>enormous</em> dragons.</p><p>  <strong>Developer:</strong> Artificial Disasters<br><strong>Release date:</strong> TBA<br><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/3258580/Dont_Wake_the_Beast/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3258580/Dont_Wake_the_Beast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a></span></p></div><div><p>It’s April 2062, and your plane’s in trouble somewhere over Alaska. Sorry to break it to you like that. Thankfully, you’re accompanied by your friendly floating orb robot, who’s going to be by your side after you crash into the snowy wastelands.</p><p>This has real <em>Firewatch</em> in <em>The Long Dark</em> vibes, a first-person narrative adventure with full voice acting and a spooky sci-fi story. It looks like something from a full-on AA studio, rather than a five-person developer that last released a strange-looking top-down MMO in 2019. I absolutely cannot wait to see more of this. Which is good, because I’m downloading the demo right now.</p><p>  <strong>Developer:</strong> GoldFire Studios<br><strong>Release date:</strong> TBA<br><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1275550/Arctic_Awakening/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1275550/Arctic_Awakening/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a></span></p></div><div><p>Competitive story writing?! That’s going to be a thing now! <em>Write Warz</em> is a game about crafting stories in a sort of semi-competitive six-player co-op, where you write sentences, vote for plot-twists, and even gain character abilities that let you better control the direction of the story.</p><p>It sounds like the most elaborate game of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequences_(game)&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequences_(game)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Consequences</a></span>, but everyone’s voting for the best next line, while the game itself introduces key events and adds challenges. It sounds like the best party game for creative types, and plans to enter Early Access early next year, with a demo already available.</p><p>  <strong>Developer:</strong> Boltz Entertainment<br><strong>Release date:</strong> Q1 2025<br><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2477650/Write_Warz/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2477650/Write_Warz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a></span></p></div><div><p>The very first game I ever reviewed, 25 years ago, was about being a paramedic. It was <em>awful. Neo Harbor Rescue Squad</em>, however, looks amazing! It has some <em>Theme Hospital </em>vibes, although minigame based, where you play a rookie paramedic trying to cope with waves of patients.</p><p>It looks just the right sort of silly, and has flown frustratingly under the radar since its release two weeks ago. Fix that!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nfl-is-doing-a-special-madden-cast-on-december-21/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The NFL is heading to the virtual gridiron in a new special broadcast in December. NBC Sports, EA, and the NFL have announced the first-ever “Madden Cast” broadcast for the Saturday, December 21st matchup between the Houston Texans and Kansas City Chiefs.</p>



<p>This new broadcast type will air exclusively on the Peacock streaming platform. It will feature it’s own broadcast team, feature Madden NFL 25 graphics, route trees similar to what’s in the game, play selection cards, player rating showcases, and more.</p>



<p>Calling the game will be Paul Burmeister on play-by-play with former NFL quarterback Kurt Benkhart and legendary Cincinnati Bengals receiver Chad Ochocinco providing commentary.</p>







<p>“The&nbsp;<em>Madden NFL Cast</em>&nbsp;will transform football strategy, information and IQ for viewers, enabled by the NFL’s Next Gen Stats and&nbsp;GeniusIQ<em>,&nbsp;</em>Genius Sports’&nbsp;next generation data and AI platform,” an announcement on the broadcast read.&nbsp;“GeniusIQ&nbsp;combines real-time data insights with fully branded animations, delivering an immersive viewing experience.”</p>



<p>“By merging the excitement of live NFL action with the immersive possibilities of augmented reality, we’re redefining how fans experience football,” GM and SVP of Publishing at EA Sports Andrea Hopelain said.</p>



<p>It’s not the first special broadcast for the NFL as they’ve done crossovers with Toy Story and, coming December 9, The Simpsons. Still, it’s the first one to truly crossover into video games.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that the broadcast will be weather dependent as the game is in Kansas City, Missouri. </p>

At the time, <a href="https://x.com/gmodofficial/status/1834185126206488932" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Newman joked</a> that he'd “never imagined becoming a world record holder and not be prawn cocktail crisps related.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Garry's Mod lets you play with models from Valve games developed on the Source engine, and its enduring popularity has seen it remain in Steam’s top 100 most-played games list for years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In July, Newman said the “Skibidi Toilet guys” had hit him with a DMCA in a wild bit of litigious irony. But soon after, an account purporting to be Skibidi Toilet creator Alexey Gerasimov (DaFuq!?Boom) insisted he wasn’t behind the claim, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/garrys-modskibidi-toilet-dmca-claim-has-been-resolved-creator-garry-newman-says">Newman then told IGN that the matter had been “resolved.”</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The copyright holder the DMCA letter was attributed to was <a href="https://inviz.tv/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Invisible Narratives</u></a>, the film and TV production studio that’s partnering with Michael Bay <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/skibidi-toilet-film-reportedly-in-the-works-from-michael-bay"><u>on a Skibidi Toilet film</u></a>. The letter cited Skibidi Toilet characters Titan Cameraman, Titan Speakerman, and Titan TV Man, saying they were "all registered copyrights that are unique and representative of our brand." Sure enough, <a href="https://cocatalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?v1=1&amp;ti=1,1&amp;Search%5FArg=Titan%20Cameraman&amp;Search%5FCode=TALL&amp;CNT=25&amp;PID=Gr6jPAL716R1MnV450HxzbpYaFF0b&amp;SEQ=20240730153403&amp;SID=1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a public catalog search reveals</u></a> that Invisible Narratives had indeed claimed a copyright for Titan Cameraman and three other unpublished works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The letter added that “significant revenue is being generated by unauthorized Skibidi Toilet Garry's Mod games that are being advertised everywhere." The irony was not lost on Newman, who declared: “can you believe the cheek?” Skidibi Toilet, of course, is largely made with assets from Half-Life 2, and was originally created in Garry’s Mod.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/garrys-mod-removing-all-nintendo-content-from-steam-workshop-after-takedown-request">Facepunch removed all Nintendo-related content on Garry's Mod</a> - what amounted to 20 years of uploads - from Steam Workshop after receiving a takedown request from Nintendo.

Browser-based game <a href="https://marieflanagan.com/loserlane/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Loser Lane</em></a> is reminding me why.</p><p>Creator Marie LeBlanc Flanagan <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/omarieclaire.bsky.social/post/3lbhxpml3ms2z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">calls</a> the game “a tiny protest game about the terrifying reality of biking in Toronto without bike lanes.” Using your left and right arrow keys, you navigate a little bike between parked cars, moving cars, pedestrians, mass transit vehicles, and road features. Most of my runs have ended swiftly due to car doors; longer runs have fallen victim to having to choose between hitting a pedestrian and getting taken out by mass transit, or between flipping over the back of a parked car or getting hit from behind by a car swerving out of its lane. You’re basically constantly being put in impossible situations with only moments to react, and the narrow play space really captures the way it feels to navigate busy roads with no bike infrastructure. When you die, you get a counter of how long you lasted, what killed you, and the words “Thanks Doug,” presumably a reference to Ontario premier Doug Ford.&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><p>A link in the game takes you to the contact info for current MPPs, whom you could email angrily about bike lanes if you live in Canada.

			<p>Bloober Team is currently in their redemption arc, as they managed to pull off a brilliant remake of one of the best survival horror games ever made. You can read our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/">Silent Hill 2 review from Chris Wray here</a>. Shortly after the release, Bloober Team unveiled their upcoming horror game named Cronos: The New Dawn. The reveal didn't particularly provide any in-depth looks at the gameplay. Instead, the reveal focused more on the atmosphere and the theme of the game, which shows that it looks somewhat similar to games like Resident Evil, Prey, and Dead Space.</p>
<p>In an&nbsp;<a href="https://mp1st.com/news/bloobers-cronos-the-new-dawn-combat-will-lean-towards-resident-evil-will-feature-a-special-mechanic-to-spice-things-up" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exclusive interview with MP1st</a>, Cronos: The New Dawn's Game Director, Wojciech Piejko, spoke about what to expect from the upcoming horror game and that the combat will be leaning towards that of Resident Evil and Dead Space.&nbsp;They've also said that they will be implementing a combat mechanic that will "spice" things up but didn't state what that mechanic may be. There have been many survival horror games throughout the years that have a unique combat mechanic. This has been seen in games like Dead Space, Alan Wake, and, to some degree, even Scorn.</p>
<p>In the interview, Piejko states that while there will be combat involved in the game, the team is "still storytellers at heart," saying that there will be a strong emphasis on story and atmospheric exploration. Some of the most well-known games from Bloober Team include Layers of Fear and Layers of Fear 2, which are very story-heavy. Those games are predominantly walking simulators where you pick up items and solve puzzles to reveal more of the story. However, they have also created games like Observer, Blair Witch, and The Medium. Some of their games have performed better than others, but overall, their reputation prior to the Silent Hill 2 remake wasn't fantastic.</p>
<p>During the interview, Piejko did give away a few minor details about the game and what to expect. "The Traveler relies on suit, weapons, and abilities but is still very vulnerable to the monstrosities lurking in the ruins of an old world. You will be outnumbered, and you need to be careful to stay alive. Resources are limited and the monsters hit hard."</p>
<p>While this doesn't provide much, it does give an insight into how hard they plan on leaning into the survival horror element of the game.</p>
<p>Cronos: The New Dawn is due for release in 2025 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>
<p>Will you be picking this game up?</p>
