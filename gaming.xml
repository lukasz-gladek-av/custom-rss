            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2: Edge of Fate</a> launches later today, but thanks to the opportunity to pre-load the expansion ahead of time, players have been able to hop into the title screen. It's there that longtime Destiny fans were welcomed with a blast from the past.</p>
<p>This nostalgia bomb comes courtesy of a music track that plays while on this title screen. The track is the main menu theme from the original Destiny! Originally composed by Martin O'Donnell and Michael Salvatori, it's been long absent from the series for years until now.</p>
<p>Destiny 2: Edge of Fate is the first in the game's Fate Saga, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2s-getting-two-paid-expansions-this-year-and-one-of-them-is-star-wars-themed">and the first in its new approach to major game expansions</a>. Rather than the massive updates that came with The Witch Queen or Beyond Light, now medium-sized updates will be coming twice a year.</p>

<p>It's also been stated by developers at Bungie that a major goal is to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2-can-it-ever-win-lapsed-players-back">create a "more curated experience" for new players</a>. This has proven a major thorn in the side of Destiny 2 for some time, as older versions of the game have been vaulted forever alongside all the accompanying content. For example, new players can't experience the story of the base game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2s-unpopular-removal-of-older-game-content-now-hampering-bungies-ability-to-defend-plagiarism-lawsuit">something which has proved vexing for Bungie in recent legal battles</a>.</p>
<p>It's a good start for the Destiny 2 team, who are fighting to win back some positive sentiment for the game after a lengthy string of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inexcusable-current-and-former-bungie-employees-react-to-sweeping-layoffs">layoffs</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2-targeted-in-lawsuit-from-writer-who-says-bungie-copied-his-work">legal trouble</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2-developer-now-investigating-an-issue-with-rng-weapon-perks-days-after-telling-players-there-was-no-issue-at-all">embarrassing moments</a>. With Edge of Fate, the team has another chance to tempt people back. Whether it can remains to be seen.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2-edge-of-fate-title-screen-blasts-fans-with-nostalgia-with-a-single-track]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>EA and DICE have been going about building anticipating for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">the next Battlefield</a> in some fairly unusual ways. The game's title has yet to be officially announced, and no reveal - of any kind - has taken place, yet.</p>
<p>The people making the highly-anticipated shooter instead decided to run an invite-only testing environment - dubbed <a href="https://www.vg247.com/topics/battlefield-labs">Battlefield Labs</a> - and have that, well, do the talking. It's clear DICE and co wanted to get the people who care most about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-franchises/battlefield">Battlefield</a> involved as early as possible, because it's them who'd be more than happy to generate that word of mouth organically.</p>
<p>Of course, you have to keep in mind that those same people are more than happy to tell you when there's something they don't like, too - and that's a problem when what that is seems integral to the vision of the game.</p>

<p>If you've not been paying attention to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/four-most-important-leaks-battlefield-6">any of the recent (and many) Battlefield 6 leaks</a>, the short version is that the game looks good! The art style is grounded, depicting gritty combat in environments where you expect it to take place. There's a big emphasis on destruction, combined arms gameplay, and a focus on bringing back <a href="https://www.vg247.com/battlefield-2042-128-players-massive-maps-reveal">the type of squad combat Battlefield 2042 abandoned in its attempt at Apex Legend-ifying the series</a>.</p>
<p>Crucial to the way a Battlefield game works is class co-dependency. In other words, each class is meant to perform a certain role, and it's only allowed to use certain weapons. It would be even better if each also had a distinct look and an easy-to-spot silhouette. Those inherent limitations give Battlefield's multiplayer its character, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> is chipping away at - at least - some of that.</p>
<p>DICE first revealed its intentions to alter the way classes work in the next game nearly two months ago, when it first allowed Battlefield Labs participants to test out a version of the game where any player could use any weapon, regardless of their class.</p>
<p>DICE's language at the time was a little soft; seemingly <a href="https://www.vg247.com/battlefield-labs-weapon-class-restrictions-community-reaction">intended to massage what the developer knew would be an incredibly controversial change</a>. The studio's argument was that it's building in-game systems to incentivise players to stick to their chosen class' recommended weapon type - so called Signature Weapon - and that players would need to play with those systems implemented first before they pass judgement on the direction things are going.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>Will EA improve on the reputation of the series post-2042? | <span>Image credit: <cite>EA</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As it happens, that conversation started with a blog post that had a telling "part one" at the end of its title, which signaled that things <em>could</em> change. The <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/news/battlefield-labs-the-class-system-part-two">second part of that blog post</a> has since gone up, confirming that DICE is sticking to its guns on this one.</p>
<p>The biggest reveal in the post is that each class in Battlefield 6 will have two Training Paths, effectively branching roles with passives that enhance your character. Each path is structured into three levels that you progress through in the match itself, similar to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-4">Battlefield 4</a>'s Field Upgrades.</p>
<p>You get to immediately take advantage of level 0 of either track after you spawn, and you can expect a basic stat boost there. Levels 1 and 2 offer advantages specific to your class, and DICE says earning them can only be done through "teamplay progression and score XP." The third and final level is a single-use ability.</p>
<p>The progress rate and power of each node (and for each class) is what DICE is currently testing in Battlefield Labs. What's not changing, however, is that all weapons will be available for all classes. If you like the passives that come from using your chosen class' Signature Weapon, all the better - but the crux of this entire dilemma is that you can simply choose not to care.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>It's spent a while in the Labs, but we'll see it soon. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The arguments against this lack of weapon limitation are plentiful, and many of them are simply re-heated from the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a> pre-launch months. Players tend to land on one side over the other here, because of how fundamental class co-dependency - and the limitations therein -  are to what makes Battlefield, well, <em>Battlefield</em>.</p>
<p>More than what the change could do to Battlefield 6's gameplay, the general sense is that DICE developers are being "forced" into doing this by EA's upper management because it is seen as an instance of friction the game could do without.</p>
<p>According to a recent <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/07/behind-the-next-battlefield-game-culture-clash-crunch-and-colossal-stakes/">wide-ranging Ars Technica report</a>, EA is betting the farm on the next Battlefield. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-reportedly-expects-battlefield-6-to-have-100-million-players-three-times-more-than-the-series-best-seller">It wants to bring in 100 million players</a>, and it's going to offer multiple ways of accessing the game to entice the largest possible number of them.</p>
<p>It's impossible to divorce that design decision from the report. Class co-dependency, weapon and gadget limitations are often cited among the reasons why many players could never stick with the series; they're as integral to Battlefield as Killstreaks are to Call of Duty. <a href="https://www.vg247.com/ea-call-of-duty-salt-mines-with-battlefield-it-doesnt-make-sense">EA doesn't want anything less than its own Call of Duty factory</a>, and the publisher even <a href="https://www.vg247.com/battlefield-call-of-duty-general-manager-ea">went as far as hiring some of the higher ups who created that model</a> with Activision's shooter series.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>Can a refresh of old modes make a big impact? | <span>Image credit: <cite>EA</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The irony, of course, is that most players who tend to favour <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-franchises/call-of-duty">Call of Duty</a> have no problems listing all the many things that prevent them from having the same kind of fun in Battlefield, which means any one of the series' defining aspects may as well be significantly altered - or done away with entirely - in pursuit of taking away some friction.</p>
<p>There really is no way to tell how much that change will mess with the game's character, or whether or not it's even going to matter four, six or 12 months on from launch. For all we know, the game's rumoured battle royale mode may well be the mode that takes off and dethrones <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-warzone-20">Warzone</a> as the go-to for casual players, leaving the core experience just to the Battlefield fans. Maybe then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-2042-overhauls-specialists-with-new-class-like-system">DICE will have more reason to revamp that whole system</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/if-youre-worried-about-one-of-battlefield-6s-most-controversial-design-changes-dice-just-confirmed-your-fears]]></content:encoded>

<p>One particularly interesting nugget was that the concept of destruction was actually being worked on before development on Bananza officially began. In fact, one concept video shows that the team experimented by sticking hands onto a Goomba – more specifically, Knucklotec hands from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>.</p>
<p>Here's what the team said:</p><div><figure data-videoid="Vb6JFhMsLFI" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c2cb8oqkgip&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb6JFhMsLFI" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>So it wasn’t that the concept of destruction came first, and then you built a mechanic around it?</strong><br>
<strong><br>
Wataru</strong> <strong>Tanaka:</strong> No. Shortly after <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> was released, we started running technical experiments with the idea of, “What kind of game do you get if everything in the environment is destructible?”</p>
<p><strong>Kenta</strong> <strong>Motokura:</strong> We even tried sticking arms on a Goomba.</p>
<p><strong>Tanaka:</strong> That's right, we did. (Laughs) In <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>, there’s a boss called Knucklotec who attacks Mario with giant hands. The programmer who created him tried attaching those arms to a Goomba as an experiment. The Goomba could smash terrain, tear off pieces to use as weapons, and throw them. Those actions felt surprisingly satisfying, and we got a sense that this destruction-based gameplay could be a compelling core mechanic.</p>
<p><strong>Motokura:</strong> The results of our tests showed that destruction-based gameplay could work, and it was a good match for Donkey Kong’s enormous strength. We felt that the concept and the core gameplay had clicked into place.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And here's a look at the concept video itself (courtesy of <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stealth40k.bsky.social/post/3ltz2wbwelc2h">Stealth40K</a> on BlueSky):</p>

<p>It's a very barebones video, but you can certainly see how it would go on to inform the gameplay seen in Donkey Kong Bananza. It makes us wonder what other kind of concepts Nintendo has managed to stockpile in recent years, too. Just imagine the possibilities!</p>
<p>The same interview also revealed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/heres-what-donkey-kong-bananza-looked-like-on-switch-1">what Bananza had looked like when it was in development for the Switch 1</a>. The team stated that they had begun to think about moving the game to Switch 2 in 2021 after it became apparent that the improved specs would lead to more satisfying destruction.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-2-visions-of-eternity-next-expansion-october-28/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/guild-wars-2-visions-of-eternity-is-the-mmorpg%E2%80%99s-next-expansion-out-on-october-28.1244214/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, ArenaNet is announcing Guild Wars 2: Visions of Eternity, the next expansion coming to the MMORPG after the final update <a href="https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-2-janthir-wilds-final-update-absolution-is-out-on-june-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released for the previous expansion, Janthir Wilds</a>.</p>



<p>As you might recall, ArenaNet <a href="https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-2-qa-arenanet-on-switch-to-yearly-expansions-secrets-of-the-obscure-learnings-and-2024-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">switched to a yearly expansion model</a>. As such, you can expect Guild Wars 2: Visions of Eternity to launch relatively soon, albeit a couple of months later than Janthir Wilds did in 2024, as Visions of Eternity will be available from October 28. The new expansion is already available for pre-purchase <a href="https://buy.guildwars2.com/visions-of-eternity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the official website</a> for $24.99, and includes a bundle of pre-purchase bonus items, including a Tropical Resin Kintsugi weapon set, a Sea Captain Hat headpiece, the Eternal Alchemist character title, a shared inventory slot, and a level 80 character boost. </p>



<p>The Deluxe Edition, priced at $49.99, comes with the standard edition bundle, plus another batch of exclusive items: a Castoran Tentacled skimmer skin, a set of Fairy’s Call Gathering Tools, an additional character slot, and an Identity Repair Kit. Finally, the Visions of Eternity Ultimate Edition (which costs $74.99) includes the exclusive Standard and Deluxe Edition items, plus 4,000 Gems, Guild Wars 2’s premium in-game store currency.</p>



<p>Guild Wars 2 Game Director Josh Davis said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>Visions of Eternity continues our commitment to major yearly content expansions. Over a decade into the game’s life, we’re making improvements and enhancements to game modes and systems, expanding the horizon of Guild Wars 2’s gameplay. This expansion is offering up more elite specializations to further grow the possibilities for player customization and gameplay while becoming more seamlessly accessible across game modes and activities.</em></p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Guild Wars 2: Visions of Eternity - Announcement Trailer [UK]" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A4cdnrLCs-M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The new narrative of Visions of Eternity begins with rumors of Castora, a fabled island allegedly rich with magic and ley energy, as told by the seafarers of Tyria. The Tyrian Alliance receives word that the Inquest, the infamous group of evil Asuran technology researchers, has been searching for the island of Castora. Together with allies willing to brave an unknown voyage, the Commander (the title of the player character in Guild Wars 2) sets off to discover the Inquest's goals and stop them before it's too late.</p>



<p>On day one, players will be able to explore two new maps in Guild Wars 2: Visions of Eternity, with two more coming throughout 2026 in post-launch updates alongside new Raid Encounters, a new Convergence, new rewards (including new earnable items in the Wizard's Vault), two extensions of the storyline, new legendary gear. </p>



<p>Each profession (the game's term for class) will receive a new Elite specialization, greatly increasing the amount of build options thanks to new traits and utility skills. As with the previous expansions, ArenaNet will open up beta access to the Elite specializations for a week, between August 20 and 27, to anyone with a game account.</p>

<p>The Skimmer aquatic mount will be expanded with three new Mastery lines. The housing-like Homestead system is also being augmented with a new plot on the sunny beaches of Castora and the brand new game-wide Homestead Layout feature, which will allow players to easily and quickly share their customized space with others, allowing a perfect duplicate of a construction (provided that the player has the requisite decorations).</p>



<p>When it comes to new gear, a legendary weapon and a legendary Aquabreather will be available on October 28, with a legendary ring, a legendary accessory, and another legendary weapon to be released in later patches. Of course, there will also be new armor and weapon sets and new Wizards Vault rewards, as mentioned above.</p>



<p>ArenaNet's parent company, NCSoft, may have more or less inadvertently <a href="https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-3-was-reportedly-greenlit-by-ncsoft-but-dont-get-too-excited-yet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">advertised</a> that the studio is already working on Guild Wars 3, but if that's the case, they still have a big enough team to continue building Guild Wars 2.</p>

<p>Just in time for the season 3 release in Marvel Rivals, players can enjoy a boost in performance thanks to DLSS 4, with NVIDIA claiming that players can see frame rates multiply by up to 5X, and get latency on their PC reduced by 55% with NVIDIA Reflex enabled. </p>



<p>If you're sporting an RTX 5090, then, according to NVIDIA, you'll be able to run through enemy players in Marvel Rivals at 450 FPS, with all of the game's settings maxed out and playing at 4K. RTX 5080 owners can get up to 330 FPS, RTX 5070 Ti players can get up to 290 FPS, and RTX 5070 players can achieve up to 230 FPS. The more you drop the resolution, the higher your frame rate will go, with even RTX 5060 cards capable of hitting 300 FPS when playing at 1080p. </p>



<p>War Thunder is another game that is adding support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation in its latest update, which players with RTX 50 series cards can take full advantage of, enabling ray tracing and cranking the settings to get the most detailed image at smooth frame rates. </p>



<p>Lastly, RoboCop: Rogue City - Unfinished Business, the DLC for the 2023 return of the robotic police officer that's due to release in <a href="https://wccftech.com/robocop-rogue-city-unfinished-business-is-out-on-july-17/">just two days at the time of this writing</a>, will launch with the game adding support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Plus more on DK's redesign.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Switch 2 blockbuster <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> will be something of a template for the character's future 3D games, Nintendo has said, splitting DK's appearances in 2D and 3D titles. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Similar to how Mario still appears in both 2D and 3D installments — the most recent of each being Super Mario Bros. Wonder and Super Mario Odyssey, respectively — Nintendo now sees a similar delineation in its plans for its most prominent ape.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Expanding on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-exists-because-yoshiaki-koizumi-asked-the-mario-odyssey-team-for-a-3d-donkey-kong-game">comments previously made to IGN about Bananza's origins</a>, producer Kenta Motokura has said that the game's development began when Nintendo legend Yoshiaki Koizumi asked his 3D Mario team to work its magic making a 3D DK game instead.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"With an eye to expanding the Donkey Kong franchise further, I'd like the team that's been working on 3D Mario games to create a 3D Donkey Kong game," Motokura quoted Koizumi as saying, as part of a new <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/News/2025/July/Ask-the-Developer-Vol-19-Donkey-Kong-Bananza-Chapter-1-2871377.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ask the Developer</a> Q&amp;A. It was this instruction, combined with ongoing experimentation into voxel-based destruction, that led to Donkey Kong Bananza's genesis.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Asked how Bananza sits alongside other Donkey Kong games, Motokura continued by saying that the 3D Mario team considered this project to epitomise a new 3D Donkey Kong "branch", separate to the DK's 2D platformers — leaving the door open to both kinds of games still existing in future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In a long-running series, novelty and continuity are both important, but we wanted this title to fully convey the appeal of Donkey Kong as a character," Motokura said. "Meanwhile, we thought that by creating something new, leveraging our experience developing 3D Mario games, we'd have the opportunity to create two separate branches – 2D Donkey Kong and 3D Donkey Kong – just as we did with Mario games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So, keeping in mind that this game will come to symbolise 3D Donkey Kong, and with the theme of bringing Donkey Kong's strengths and new actions to the forefront, we thought the concept of 'destruction' would be a good fit."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Donkey Kong Bananza Direct Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, Motokura discussed Nintendo's recent Donkey Kong redesign in more detail, and said that it was the development of Bananza which spearheaded the company's search for a new DK look.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Donkey Kong Bananza sparked the creation of a design which I think better conveys the new Donkey Kong," Motokura said, noting that Nintendo's new 'standard' DK was actually another attempt to recapture the character's original design, drawn by Shigeru Miyamoto for the Donkey Kong arcade game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Outside of this game, Donkey Kong has recently appeared in The Super Mario Bros. Movie released in 2023 and in Mario Kart World, but there's a basic character design which provided the foundation for those versions of Donkey Kong," Motokura concluded. "That basic Donkey Kong design has been completely revamped. While overhauling the design, we returned to where it had all started. We took Miyamoto-san's original Donkey Kong as the basis, adding design elements from Donkey Kong Bananza here and there."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What's next for Donkey Kong? Well, it certainly sounds like the door is being left open for the character to reappear in further 2D games in future. And then there's the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-has-filed-a-copyright-notice-for-an-untitled-donkey-kong-motion-picture">intriguing copyright listing for an unannounced Donkey Kong movie</a>, spotted by Nintendo fans earlier this week.

                <p dir="ltr">Snapshot Games' <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2347080/Frosthaven/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Frosthaven</a> (which I'll henceforth refer to as Frosthaven Digital) is a video game version of the tabletop game of the same name. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/frosthaven/" data-ref-id="5000-542087">Frosthaven</a>'s predecessor, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/gloomhaven/" data-ref-id="5000-485475">Gloomhaven</a>, got a similar digital version in 2021 (which was helmed by Flaming Fowl Studios). Unlike games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/" data-ref-id="5000-497541">Baldur's Gate 3</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/cyberpunk-2077/" data-ref-id="5000-143160">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, which adapt mechanics and themes from their tabletop inspirations (Dungeons &amp; Dragons and Cyberpunk RED, respectively) to create a unique gameplay experience, Frosthaven Digital is just Frosthaven--it's the board game minus the need to meet up with friends physically. For someone like me, who primarily hangs out with people virtually, Frosthaven Digital is a boon. I've wanted to introduce the board game to friends for a while, and this lets me without us all having to meet up in person to do it.</p><p dir="ltr">Gloomhaven Digital was well-received when it came out, and the fanbase has been eager to see Frosthaven make the jump to digital as well. Among the excitement, however, has been a recurring concern: Will Frosthaven Digital have an undo feature? In person, when you make a mistake while playing a tabletop game, the only thing stopping you from fixing it is you and your friends. That's not necessarily the case for a video game if there's no option to do so. In Gloomhaven Digital, it was possible to restart an entire encounter if you wanted, but there was no way to simply start your turn over or undo your last action. It was frustratingly awful, with misclicks resulting in a wasted turn. Fans have wondered if Frosthaven Digital will follow suit, and thankfully, it's not.</p><p dir="ltr">"[Undo] was the most requested feature [for] Gloomhaven," Frosthaven game director Hristo Petkov told me. "It [didn't] exist in Gloomhaven Digital, and according to our engineers, it was impossible [for Frosthaven Digital]. But yeah, we did it."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4532513-ss_3c1d41b42d92ba93a0b33ca5029eabdac3be9f8c.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4532513" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4532513-ss_3c1d41b42d92ba93a0b33ca5029eabdac3be9f8c.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4532513"></a><figcaption>Frosthaven Digital replicates the look and feel of the original board game.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4532513-ss_3c1d41b42d92ba93a0b33ca5029eabdac3be9f8c.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">For the unfamiliar, Frosthaven is a dark fantasy RPG that sees you and your fellow players become adventurers who find themselves in the snow-laden town of Frosthaven. Each character class has its own goals and abilities (portrayed as cards). In combat, each player plays two cards to determine what their character does on a turn, and moves through a scenario along a hexagonal grid. During missions, you can also find loot that you can bring back to town to build new structures or improve existing infrastructure, unlocking additional storylines and perks.</p><p dir="ltr">Between scenarios, your team can rest to regain spent cards, but over time, you regain less and less. Once every card in your deck is gone for good, your character retires and becomes just another non-player character in town. You pick a new character class, grab their ability cards, and keep going, slowly building the legends of these different adventurers that came to Frosthaven. Your character can also just die, too, but in Frosthaven, most characters retire before succumbing to death.</p><p dir="ltr">Each session of the game takes about two to four hours, and an entire story campaign (if played once every week) will likely take you and your friends a few years to finish. It is a <em>commitment </em>to play this board game, one that should be easier to keep over a virtual call with no physical set-up, if Gloomhaven Digital is any indication. It's not a perfect replacement, though. In going digital, Gloomhaven Digital created new issues to overcome, like the aforementioned inability to undo a simple mistake.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4532512-ss_95b698ec578ed27844ad3e7a62a913bea1db89fd.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4532512" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4532512-ss_95b698ec578ed27844ad3e7a62a913bea1db89fd.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4532512"></a><figcaption>You'll return to town often to meet with other characters and build new infrastructure.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4532512-ss_95b698ec578ed27844ad3e7a62a913bea1db89fd.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"Normally, it shouldn't be [too hard] to do something like [an undo mechanic], but we used the code base of Gloomhaven as a starting point," Petkov said. "And [Flaming Fowl Studios'] code base wasn't really suited at all for this. So it basically was rewriting the whole thing. And one of our programmers found a way around it, but it wasn't easy. It took months upon months of work."</p><p dir="ltr">This undo feature is still in development and experimental, so Snapshot Games is looking to the upcoming early access release to see if what it has implemented fits what the fanbase has been asking for. The feature Petkov describes, however, sounds perfect, so I foresee it sticking around in the full version of the game.</p><p dir="ltr">"You can enable it in the options [in early access], because there might still be some bugs related to it," Petkov said of the undo feature. "It is pretty well tested--probably no problems with it--but we didn't want to put it in as the default for the beginning of early access. But this is quite amazing--it's not just an undo [for your last turn]. Let's say you are on turn five and in the middle of the round--you can actually undo every action to the beginning of battle. You can undo every single action [at any time]. It is pretty amazing. It works wonders. It was one of the biggest things we needed to do when we started."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4532514-ss_749b16a33263ed2e04a2c4fd7f91067ea83b6303.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4532514" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4532514-ss_749b16a33263ed2e04a2c4fd7f91067ea83b6303.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4532514"></a><figcaption>Combat is turn-based.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4532514-ss_749b16a33263ed2e04a2c4fd7f91067ea83b6303.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Like Gloomhaven Digital, Frosthaven Digital seems like it will be a fairly authentic reimagining of the original board game. However, Snapshot Games is going a few steps further with its adaptation, implementing features that don't exist in the original board game but that make for a better video game.</p><p dir="ltr">"Some of the changes that are made are cases where it's quite awkward or difficult to adapt the board game," CEO Julian Gollop told me. "Usually, this is [our] approach and [Frosthaven creator] Isaac [Childres] is generally quite accommodating to this, because he realizes we have to make some adaptations."</p><p dir="ltr">"We have a new tutorial that is three missions, and then we have a four-mission campaign that is the 'Road to Frosthaven,' that is basically created in cooperation with our designers and Isaac," Petkov added. "And the goal for this new campaign is actually to get people who know the board game [or have] played Gloomhaven a little bit [up to speed] on the new things for Frosthaven. They're completely new scenarios to the game."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4532515-ss_bec86b997dc52f6e29ffc6011679e67481d085c3.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4532515" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4532515-ss_bec86b997dc52f6e29ffc6011679e67481d085c3.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4532515"></a><figcaption>Frosthaven Digital will have a brand-new opening that acts as a prologue to the situations found in Frosthaven.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4532515-ss_bec86b997dc52f6e29ffc6011679e67481d085c3.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Frosthaven Digital will also have difficulty modes, allowing players to curate how challenging the experience is to play. "Frosthaven is pretty hard," Petkov said. "So we created a new difficulty that is basically breaking the rules of the board game. ...It allows you, when you rest--no matter if it's a short or long rest--to not lose cards. It makes it much easier. ...And you have double health--that also helps. From our observations, people who try this difficulty, they don't know about the game. They try the difficulty and they play at least four or five scenarios like this, and then when they feel more comfortable with the game, they can switch the difficulty and go to normal difficulty."</p><p dir="ltr">Personally, I'm most looking forward to the artwork and character designs for long-established characters. During my conversation with Petkov and Gollop, they mentioned that though all of Frosthaven's major characters are well-known within the community, there are minor characters that have never been given unique tokens or cards or appeared in artwork for the game. These everyday citizens are being realized for the first time because they now exist in a video game, and not just in players' imaginations.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEH2soLIYfU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QEH2soLIYfU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"A lot of the main characters, we have illustrations for them. Some of the main bosses, we have illustrations for them," Petkov said. "But there are quite a lot of characters and environments from the board game that are just described. They're not in the board game, because in the board game, you use placeholder tokens for them--you use a guard token for the blacksmith. All of these are actually created [in Frosthaven Digital], reimagined with new 3D models."</p><p dir="ltr">Though it had a small Steam Next Fest demo, we'll get our first good look at Frosthaven Digital when it launches in early access on Steam and the Epic Games Store on July 31. The early access build starts with eight playable character classes (two of which you have to unlock), and about 40-50 hours of missions to play through. The full game will feature 17 playable character classes and will be a lot longer. "Frosthaven Digital has about 50% more content than Gloomhaven, and about double the complexity," Petkov said. "So it [will be] easily over 200 hours."</p><p dir="ltr">Gloomhaven Digital eventually made its way to Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch a few years after launching on PC. No such plans have been announced for Frosthaven Digital, but the possibility remains.</p>

                <p>Oblivion Remastered's latest update fixes an issue Elder Scrolls lore fans have been wondering about since the remaster's release, though the change isn't listed in the official patch notes.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Spoilers for Oblivion ahead</strong>. Those who have previously played the original Oblivion's Dark Brotherhood storyline will likely remember the intimidating door to the Dark Brotherhood's Cheydinhal sanctuary, which sports a relief depicting a woman (the Night Mother) raising a knife against her children. The Night Mother had five children she conceived with the god-like entity Sithis, which is backed up by the fact that inside the Night Mother's tomb in-game, there are skeletal remains of one adult and five children.</p><p dir="ltr">That, however, isn't what the Dark Brotherhood door in Oblivion Remastered looks like. Not only is it lacking the moody red lighting of the original, but it is actually lore-inaccurate as well. In the launch version of Oblivion Remastered, the door shows seven children instead of five.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a change that left Elder Scrolls lore scholars scratching their heads, but it turns out it was likely just a mistake and not a major lore ret-con. While it's not listed in the patch notes, those playing the latest patch Steam Beta 1.2 update have noticed the door has been changed. As spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-elder-scrolls/oblivion-remastereds-latest-patch-stealthily-fixed-the-most-lore-breaking-door-in-videogames/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, it now sports a glowing red ambiance that more closely resembles the door from the original Oblivion and is now lore-accurate, depicting the original five children instead of seven.</p><p dir="ltr">The latest update to Oblivion Remastered isn't yet available for all platforms, but can be played early by those who own the game on Steam by opting into the game's Steam Beta version. In addition to the unlisted door change, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remastereds-next-update-will-add-a-brand-new-difficulty-option-full-patch-notes/1100-6533089/" data-ref-id="1100-6533089">update also adds a new difficulty option</a> and more performance optimizations.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remastered-gets-its-first-update-with-a-whole-bunch-of-fixes/1100-6532121/" data-ref-id="1100-6532121">Oblivion Remastered's first major update</a> arrived in June and largely focused on addressing bugs and various technical issues. In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-review/1900-6418359/" data-ref-id="1900-6418359">Oblivion Remastered review</a>, we said it is a worthy remaster, in part because it keeps many of the original Oblivion's rough edges that, if they were to be sanded down, would strip the open-world RPG of much of its charm.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> - the Schrödinger's cat of video games in as much as its development appears to be simultaneously alive and dead - is set to reveal its delayed 2.3 update tomorrow, 16th July, with CD Projekt seemingly hinting at a vehicular focus.
</p>
<p>
Cyberpunk 2077's 2.3 update was originally announced in June, despite development on the game having <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-development-has-finally-wound-down-after-three-and-a-half-years">technically wrapped up last year</a>, with a planned release toward the end of the month. However, its launch was ultimately pushed back to an undisclosed later point after CD Projekt decided it needed "more time".
</p>
<p>
As for what 2.3 will include, all the studio would say previously is that it was "aiming for a scope similar to" <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077s-22-adds-new-secrets-expanded-customisation-options-and-more">last year's 2.2 release</a>. That, by way of comparison, introduced a variety of fixes and quality of life improvements, alongside an improved photo mode, new car and player customisations, plus a new selection of "most requested" vehicles for purchase via Autofixer. Oh, and there was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077s-night-city-infiltrated-by-balatros-giggling-joker-in-22-update-secret">that Balatro collaboration</a> too.
</p>
<p>
All of which brings us to tomorrow's <a href="https://x.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1945136315705467297">newly announced livestream</a>. It's airing at 5pm, 16th July, on <a href="https://t.co/crpXzrC6VR">Twitch</a> and <a href="https://t.co/6RhhKsU0xa">YouTube</a>, with appearances from Cyberpunk 2 associate game director Paweł Sasko and Adrien Jouannet, lead Designer at Virtuos. Rumours <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/surprise-cdpr-isnt-actually-finished-with-cyberpunk-2077-announces-another-update">Virtuous had been drafted in to work on some sort of Cyberpunk 2077 DLC</a> first surfaced back in June.
</p>
<p>
CD Projekt's livestream announcement also features some very particular phrasing, strongly hinting this latest release will likely focus on vehicles. "We're driving into Patch 2.3 of Cyberpunk 2077 to check what's under the hood of the newest update," the studio wrote, before referring to the shows guests as "passengers" then wrapping up with a wheel emoji.
</p>
<p>
Cyberpunk 2077 has, of course, recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-cyberpunk-2077-on-switch-2-a-cutting-edge-game-translates-well-to-nintendos-console-hybrid">made an impressive debut on Switch 2</a>, and a sadder, bloodier, and darker <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/when-people-are-sad-im-a-bit-happy-cyberpunk-edgerunners-season-two-is-going-to-be-sadder-bloodier-and-darker">second season of Cyberpunk: Edgerunners</a> is also on the way. That's alongside Cyberpunk 2077's eagerly anticipated - albeit distant - sequel <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-will-feature-second-city-thats-like-chicago-gone-wrong-says-series-creator">Cyberpunk 2</a>.

            <p>The Pokémon Company has announced that <a href="https://x.com/pokemon_cojp/status/1945045929620349069?s=46">a Pokémon Presents livestream</a> will take place on 22nd July. This comes alongside a tease of Pikachu standing in front of what appears to be a DJ deck.</p>
<p>The stream will take place at 9pm JST, which is 5am PDT / 8am EDT / 1pm GMT / 2pm CEST. There's no word on what exactly will be shown, but given the teaser image one can assume it'll be some form of music-related game or service.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, Pikachu has tried his hand at DJing in the past. He and Gengar have donned DJ attire <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/m8X3DBT_pio">at Universal Studios Japan as part of the Pokémon Halloween event</a>. Aside from that, there have been no music-focused Pokémon games, and neither Pikachu nor Gengar have shown up as DJs in card form.</p>

<p>So what's the deal here? Well, this is speculation, but one of two reveals seems likely. The longshot is a new music-focused Pokémon game that'll get revealed during the Pokémon Presents livestream. The other, a Pokémon music service. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-music-app-sees-mario-maker-take-on-spotify-and-youtube-playlists">Nintendo launched its own music app in October 2024</a>, and Pokémon is no stranger to banger tracks and catchy tunes.</p>
<p>That or it could be something totally different, and this teaser image has nothing to do with music whatsoever. With <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-everything-we-know">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a> the next big release in the series, one wouldn't be surprised to see an update for that game featured as part of this livestreamed event. Either way, we'll have to check it out live to know for sure!</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-presents-livestream-date-reveal-points-to-something-musical-rather-than-simply-an-update-on-pokemon-legends-z-a]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>No ZeniMax Online developer has been laid off following the cancellation of <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-cancelled-mmorpg-story-gameplay-details/">Project Blackbird</a>, a new statement shared online confirmed.</p>



<p>ZOS United-CWA released a new statement on Bluesky yesterday, commenting on the cancellation of the project, which came as a shock to the 222 ZOSU-CWA developers working on it, and showing appreciation for the media and players that would have loved to see the game. Unlike what happened at other studios, which saw layoffs following the cancellation of their projects, no ZeniMax Online developer has been laid off. Although the future remains uncertain, as Microsoft and the union established in December 2024 are still discussing how the studio will move forward following the project closure, the developers who worked on Project Blackbird still remain at ZeniMax Online with full pay and benefits. Layoffs may still be in the future for some of the members of the union, but as a result of organizing, those impacted will be able to depart the studio with dignity.</p>







<p>As already mentioned, ZeniMax Online Project Blackbird is not the only project that Microsoft confirmed to have cancelled earlier this month. The Perfect Dark reboot announced back in 2020 has <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/">ceased development</a>, and its development studio, The Initiative, has been shut down. Rare's Everwild was also <a href="https://wccftech.com/rare-everwild-cancelled-microsoft-gaming-layoffs/">cancelled</a>, while other studios have been considerably downsized, such as Turn 10, the developer of the Forza Motorsport series, which has reportedly become a <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-motorsport-dev-turn-10-support-forza-horizon/">Forza Horizon support studio.</a></p>

The Pro 3 is also 8BitDo’s first controller that lets you easily swap the arrangement of its ABXY buttons.</p><p>The 8BitDo Pro 2 launched at $49.99 four years ago, but the new Pro 3 is debuting with a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FFGQ6J35/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">slightly steeper $69.99 price</a>. 8BitDo has also switched to using a 1,000mAh rechargeable battery for the Pro 3, and while the company says it offers up to 20 hours of gameplay on a full charge, it’s not removable. The Pro 3 includes a convenient charging dock that doubles as storage for its 2.4GHz dongle. When the controller dies, it can still be used while connected to a console via USB, and it will charge while you play.</p><p>The Pro 3 is available for preorder starting today and officially will be on sale on August 12th. There are three color options, each of which matches different retro consoles: gray (PlayStation), G classic (Game Boy), and purple (GameCube).</p><p>The Pro 3’s design is nearly identical to the Pro 2, but it’s gained a few extra buttons. It carries forward the Pro 2’s back buttons while introducing an additional set of smaller shoulder buttons. Its triggers also use Hall effect sensors for improved accuracy and durability, while newly added switches let you choose a longer trigger for racing games or a shorter one for faster reaction times in FPS titles.</p><p>Compatibility includes support for Windows, Android, both Switch consoles (with waking capabilities), SteamOS (you can shake the controller to wake the OLED Steam Deck), and Apple’s hardware, with Bluetooth, USB, or wireless 2.4GHz connectivity.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->3</strong><span><figcaption><em>The Pro 3 includes a pair of ball-top caps that give it an arcade machine feel.</em></figcaption> <cite>Image: 8BitDo</cite></span></p></section><p>Out of the box, the Pro 3 uses the Xbox’s button layout, but you can swap the A and B buttons to match Nintendo Switch controllers or rearrange them all to whatever layout you prefer. The Pro 3 works with 8BitDo’s Ultimate Software V2 so that you can remap the layout, and the controller can store and switch between three different custom profiles.</p><p>Although the ergonomics are questionable, 8BitDo is also including a pair of arcade-style ball-top caps that can be attached to the Pro 3’s joysticks.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/706967/8bitdo-pro-3-wireless-bluetooth-controller-tmr-swappable-buttons]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/product/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, the next Switch 2 exclusive from Nintendo, launches in just two days on Thursday, July 17, and ahead of its release, Nintendo has released a <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-19-donkey-kong-bananza-part-1/">three-part interview series</a> with the game's leads. That's how we learned <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/07/15/you-can-skip-locations-and-parts-of-the-story-in-donkey-kong-bananza-thanks-to-the-games">you can skip locations and parts of the story in the game</a>, and why <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/07/15/donkey-kong-bananzas-destruction-gameplay-can-be-traced-back-to-a-goomba-with-arms">Donkey Kong Bananza's destruction gameplay can be traced back to a Goomba with arms</a>. It's also where we learned more about Nintendo's transition from developing Donkey Kong Bananza on Switch to Switch 2.&nbsp;</p><p>When asked by the interviewer if Donkey Kong Bananza was planned as a Switch 2 game from the jump, producer Kenta Motokura explained that it began life as a Switch title, but was moved to Switch 2 around 2021 due to challenges the team (<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/07/01/the-super-mario-odyssey-team-developed-donkey-kong-bananza">which also developed Super Mario Odyssey</a>) ran into. Art director Daisuke Watanabe chimed in to add, "We first looked into how we could upgrade what we'd originally built for Switch to take advantage of Switch 2.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6vIDbh6D414"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6vIDbh6D414" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>"One of the most obvious improvements was that we could place far more objects in the environment than before. Being able to place more objects in the terrain didn't just enhance the game's visual richness. More importantly, it increased the amount of things players could destroy, which amplified the exhilaration of being able to demolish anything and everything. That went hand in hand with the game's core concept of destruction. It convinced us that this game would be even more fun if we developed it for Switch 2."&nbsp;</p><p>One of the game directors Wataru Tanaka followed Watanabe up, explaining that from a programmer's perspective, the voxel technology powering the destructible environments in Donkey Kong Bananza uses a lot of system memory, leading to challenges on Switch. With the game being in 3D, Tanaka said dimensions of textures and materials grow by up to eight times, compared to 2D pixels. "So doubling all three dimensions [width, height, and depth in voxels compared to width and height in pixels] gives you 2 x 2 x 2, or eight times the data," he said. "It may sound simple to just 'double something,' but the reality is that memory usage, voxel density, and all kinds of processes end up gobbling up eight times the resources. It was clear that the memory available on Switch would struggle to handle that load, and we felt that manifesting the huge volume of terrain that we did in this game might have been unachievable on that platform."&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the move to Switch 2, Tanaka said the team gained not only more memory to work with, but great processing capacity, too, giving the team more freedom to incorporate gameplay ideas it previously abandoned because they were too demanding. He also said the Switch 2 could not only handle the heavy processing requirements, but do so at 60 FPS. "Things we'd given up on, like explosions flinging large objects or causing them to collapse, were now possible," Tanaka added. "Designers could also place as many objects as they wanted.

<p>It's currently available for pre-order via the official website and Amazon, with shipping estimated to begin on <strong>12th August 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Here's a look at all features for the Pro 3:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- TMR Joystick<br>
- Extra bumpers (R4 and L4)<br>
- 2 Pro back paddle buttons<br>
- Trigger mode switch<br>
- Hall effect triggers<br>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/john-wick-hex-delisted/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/john-wick-hex-is-being-delisted-this-week-on-all-platforms.1244109/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/interviewing-mike-bithell-ygf/">John Wick Hex</a> is being delisted this week, publisher Big Fan Games has announced. It'll be entirely removed from sale on all digital platforms as of <strong>July 17, 2025</strong>. If you've already bought the game, you'll be able to continue playing it and redownload it, but if not, you'll miss out on your chance to get the game, seemingly forever. </p>



<p>The news was announced quite suddenly this week, giving players only days to decide whether they wanted to grab it before its gone, or let it pass them by for good. John Wick Hex is critically acclaimed as one of the best games based on a film or TV show in some time, including by Wccftech, who called it "<em>an action choreography masterclass</em>" when <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/john-wick-hex-action-choreography-masterclass/">we reviewed it back when it launched in October 2019 on PC</a>. It was out on consoles a year later, in December 2020.</p>



<p>"<em>John Wick Hex will be removed from sale on all platforms beginning July 17th, 2025,</em>" a statement on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1405790/view/596280216846860675?l=english">Steam page</a> began. "<em>After July 17th, 2025, existing owners of John Wick Hex will still be able to access the game via their digital libraries (PC/Consoles) and/or physical copies (Console), however new purchases of John Wick Hex will not be possible, regardless of platform or storefront</em>." No reason for the delisting has been given.</p>



<p>With the game being removed in just two days at the time of this writing, that puts its shelf life at less than six years since its release, a short lifetime even for a game based on a licensed series. If anything, it's a wonder why there haven't been more John Wick games, since the release of John Wick Hex was such a critical success. The films have also only grown in success and popularity in the last six years, and with all the collaboration between the video game industry and Hollywood of late, you'd think someone would have been working on making another John Wick game happen.</p>



<p>"<em>When all is said and done, John Wick Hex is an exceptional licensed game, and a wonderful strategic shooter even away from that,</em>" our review reads. "<em>It's the kind of game that's high quality and enjoyable, even if you are clueless about the John Wick movies themselves. The perfect kind of licensed game, that works as well as an introduction to the franchise as it does as an extension of it. Absolutely worth playing</em>."</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/fallout-5-fully-greenlit-according-to-new-report/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fallout-5-is-%E2%80%9Cfully-greenlit%E2%80%9D-according-to-a-new-report.1244106/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Now that Starfield has come and gone, the next major title Bethesda fans are waiting for is <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-is-in-a-quite-playable-state-though-release-window-remains-unknown-rumor/">The Elder Scrolls VI</a>. After that, it'll be time for Fallout 5 to finally take center stage in the theatre of Bethesda's development efforts. </p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-5-will-follow-elder-scrolls-vi-starfields-procedural-generation-discussed/">That's been the plan</a>, according to Bethesda and Todd Howard, who, at this point, will likely finish his career with the release of Fallout 5, considering how long modern video games take to make. According to Windows Central reporter Jez Corden, speaking on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/DDr2ZSFIEXk?t=3845s">XB2 podcast</a>, the first major step in making Fallout 5 a reality has been taken, as the game is now "<em>fully greenlit."</em></p>



<p>That said, there's not a lot of clarity as to who is leading the project. According to Corden, a significant number of Bethesda's developers are working on more DLC for Starfield. The remaining staff are full-steam-ahead on The Elder Scrolls VI. Fallout 5 might have been officially added to the docket, but when it enters full production, and who will even be leading the way, isn't entirely clear.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Howard and his team are the obvious guess, but who knows what Bethesda and Microsoft will look like by the time Fallout 5 is ready to be the full focus of the studio. For now, despite claims that <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-5-release/">Fallout 5 might be moved up the priority list thanks to the success of the TV show</a>, it seems like it'll be a number of years before Fallout 5 is out and on shelves.</p>

<p>Phew. That was close. Although I fear your face will never quite be the same again. A tremendous loss for faces, but a possible gain for anyone curious what Obsidian were up to in 2006.

Soak in the shame of your minor monetary penalty, worm. That'll learn you to take a publisher's word for it next time. Here's a trailer.</p>

<p>The new edition boasts "refined camera controls, polished mechanics, enhanced textures, and full controller support with a newly designed controller-specific UI." There's obviously a bit of vagueness here, and as far as I can tell Aspyr haven't gone into detail for e.g what "polished mechanics" actually means. Although Aspyr's Jordan Reese did share the following with <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/dungeons-dragons-neverwinter-nights-2-enhanced-edition-interview/">Nintendo Everything</a> recently, via <a href="https://gonintendo.com/contents/50714-neverwinter-nights-2-enhanced-edition-dev-details-improvements-to-graphics-and">GoNintendo</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>"We’ve made several overall gameplay enhancements, many of which are noticeable as soon as you boot the game such as graphical overhauls and UI/UX redesigns, while others like updating the game client to a 64-bit architecture, and networking infrastructure are a little more behind the scenes to support modern hardware."</p></blockquote>
<p>Which, again, isn't a tonne to go on, although Reese also confirmed that you'll be able to switch to the "classic UI and control scheme". The edition also includes all three of the original's expansions, plus <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/steam-deck">Steam Deck</a> and mod support. Although, again no explicit confirmation on whether old mods will work. Sensing a pattern here. Fingers crossed, since it's become a bit of a favourite for modders over the years. You can even play the entire <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a> 1 campaign inside of it, in case you want to confirm that Larian didn't Flanderise Minsc - he was genuinely always like that.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/obsidians-hottest-dungeons-dragons-rpg-of-2006-is-out-now-in-ostensibly-enhanced-form]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Bless me, An-Ansgaidh, for I have sinned. Not against the Herald of Annihilation. Never against my god. I have always carried out my duties, my service, faithfully. Like any good cultist in An-Ansgaidh’s service, I long to be free from the burden of flesh, the toil of our mortal existence. Being a writer is a life of confessions. Every drop of ink I put to page reveals a bit of myself, whether I want it to or not. But now I have the honor of spilling blood in the service of a great god in this Pikmin-esque cult builder. And I am enjoying myself, but I feel kinda bad about it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My demo of Worship puts me in the robe of a cult leader sworn to An-Ansgaidh, Herald of Annihilation, the most compassionate of the Unseen Depth gods, who is determined to end our suffering by bringing an end to our pointless existence. Sick. My job is to gain An-Ansgaidh’s favor and expand Its cult. After playing a brief tutorial that gives me an overview of the controls and introduces me to a sassy and utterly deranged (in its own words, “charming a witty”) talking grimoire that serves as my guide, I’m dropped into a run in An-Ansgaidh’s service.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Worship Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I don’t start with any cultists in my service, which is a bad look for a cult leader. Luckily, An-Ansgaidh starts me with some godless who just needs something to believe in. How do I convert them, you ask? I stab myself with a dagger and smear my blood across the ground to create sacred symbols. This whole thing is a ritual, you know. A circle to draw the godless within it to our cult. I press my hand to the blood-stained ground to activate its power. A square to summon the Execution Edict, a fraction of my god’s power so Its mighty hand might judge our enemies, and find them wanting. I press my hand to the blood-stained ground to activate its power. It awaits my command. I am patient. I am powerful.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Converting them to our unholy cause is simple as surrounding them with a circle.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But it does hurt to stab myself so much. I fret not over my hand (which is probably little more than a bloody pulp) but for my mortality. To drain my lifeblood across the ground for An-Ansgaidh is an honor, but it leaves me diminished, leaves me at the mercy of my enemies. All that to say: it literally drains my health, and I want to be freed from this mortal coil but in An-Ansgaidh’s time, not our enemies’. And we have so many enemies. The godless stand mute, unmoving, uncomprehending. They pose no threat. Converting them to our unholy cause is simple as surrounding them with a circle.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But I fear the others. No conversion will take hold of them. The behatted men with their rapiers that cut down my cultists like so much kindling, the black creatures who do not serve my god and spew bile at us. Once there are enough of us, they pose no threat. I raise my hand, mark what needs to die, and my cult descends upon them like locusts. I wonder if An-Ansgaidh, Herald of Annihilation, is a Pikmin fan. Probably not. Gods are not concerned with such trivial things as the Nintendo GameCube. But it reminds me of it all the same.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That is not to say our followers don’t die. Oh, they are resilient. They fall, dizzied, stars swirling about their heads, but they often rise before they are killed. But inevitably, some die, brought low before they can rise and recover. Early on in our ventures, I learned to avoid our enemies. I searched instead for the godless, converted them to our cult. It is only when I have overwhelming numbers that I challenge our foes, and they fall before An-Ansgaidh’s glory. Sometimes my followers perish. That is inevitable. But I try to keep them alive. A good cult is a strong cult, and a strong cult is made of many bodies.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">They are pliable. I can pick them up by the throat and throw them to ring bells, or gut them and use their blood to perform rituals instead of my own. I have no problem throwing them at things. They’ll be a little concussed, maybe. But they’ll live. Once you use them as a resource, though, it’s lights out. Curtains. Game over. I don’t like killing the cultists. Partially because it leaves me with one less cultist, making my unholy army a little weaker. But partly because it doesn’t feel right. I brought them into this. It’s my job to keep them safe. They’re my children (religiously speaking) and my children (metaphorically speaking). They follow me around like little dogs. Besides, there’s no shortage of blood for me to absorb. I can call it back from a botched ritual where a circle too closely resembles a square, from my cultists who fall in battle, from fountains, plants, and even stones (yes, reader: blood from a stone).</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I don’t like killing the cultists.

I brought them into this.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">When my cult kills our enemies, or some of our own fall in battle, I perform a tribute ritual, inserting an upside-down triangle into the center of a circle I draw around the corpses of the dead. My reward is a chest, which might contain anything from a relic I can offer at an altar to a blood fountain to a catalyst. I can order my cult to carry catalysts back to our base, and plant them in the ground to gain new spells and perks like the ability to throw farther. As the cult grows in power, so do I, though I am still at the mercy of the world and require their aid. I have spells, yes, but they take setup. The violence of a mass of bodies is quicker, more efficient. By myself, I am nothing. Weak. The cult makes me whole. So I go, converting the godless, building favor with An-Ansgaidh. I break down the statues of The Last Church. I send the dead as tribute. I cover the world in my blood. My grimoire offers advice.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I find followers in strange ways. I find a village stuck between worlds, in the middle of a half-completed rite because musicians played a song with instruments built from the bones of horrors, and it remains unfinished. I track them down, carry them back to their stage. The song they play is a bop. Much of Worship's visual and auditory language is incredible. Only evil things are black, colored inside white outlines. Everything else is white, outlined by black. It’s not subtle, but it’s effective.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eventually, I gain enough favor to return to An-Ansgaidh victorious. It teleports my cult and I to The Last Church, something my grimoire blames for all of this earlier. I don’t understand until I get there and see a woman in white sitting next to a monster. They aren’t hurting anyone. The woman is singing. The monster sleeps with a little doll. Their names are Ulmira and Eleanor, respectively, and my god has commanded that they die.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So I go to work. Of the two, Ealnor is the larger threat, but I cannot hurt her. When my cult gets close, she stuns them, swipes at them, leaves several dead. When we run away, she shoots fire. Her doll, animated by magic, chases us across the screen. I dive out of the way; my cult follows. We move around the edges. “How do I do this?” I think. Then I discover that Ulmira is here, too. She can attack, but she is smaller and weaker. I set my cult on her and then the strangest thing happens. Eleanor comes to defend her, shielding her from harm. And this is how I win. I wait. I bide my time, until Ulmira is vulnerable. And then I set my cult on her, and Eleanor springs into action to save her, taking the damage herself. Dozens die. But in the end, I am victorious. Ulmira holds Eleanor in her arms as she dies. And then she breaks down in tears. This is where my demo ends.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is no denying that Worship feels good to play. That its minimalist art style looks beautiful. That the music is gorgeous. That it forces you to play smart, to use every resource. But I like that the last thing it did was make me feel bad. I am a cult leader serving a dark god. I will do nothing good with the power I gain. Winning shouldn’t feel good. And I am glad Worship understands that.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/worship-be-a-cult-leader-in-this-pikmin-inspired-roguelike]]></content:encoded>

        <h2><span><em>Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1 +</em></span></h2><p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>In the world of Gamindustri, four CPUs (also known as Goddesses) battled for supremacy in the War of the Guardians. One of the CPUs— Neptune—was defeated by the others and banished from the heavens. In her fall from grace, Neptune’s memories were lost, but a mysterious book revealed itself to her with knowledge of all of Gaminudstri’s history. Joined by Compa, IF, and the sentient book known as Histoire, Neptune embarks on an extraordinary journey across four different nations on a quest to save the entire world!</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>The Goddesses are Back!</strong> – Previously available on PlayStation Vita in North America, now you can immerse yourself in the zany <a title="Genres > JRPG [1,705 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/jrpg">JRPG</a> madness for the first time on PlayStation 4!</li><li><strong>Revisit Classic Neptunia <a title="Genres > RPG [17,416 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPG</a> Style Battles</strong> – Battle with up to three characters on the field, with 3 more as support. Use them to perform special attacks or swap them out at any time!</li><li><strong>Switch it Up with Plans</strong> – Use Plans to customize the game by changing up enemy difficulty, dungeon treasures, and more!</li><li><strong>Gear Galore</strong> – Craft unique equipment imbued with one or more abilities!</li></ul><h2><span><em>Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth2: Sisters Generation</em></span></h2><p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>20XX. Gamindustri faces a dire crisis! Ever since the advent of ASIC—the Arfoire Syndicate of International <a title="Companies > crim [23 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/crim">Crim</a>e—morality has all but vanished. As much as 80 percent of all students are rumored to worship a being known as Arfoire, and the authorities have chosen to turn a blind eye to the threat. Basically, Gamindustri is pretty messed up, you guys. Ahem. Thus did Gamindustri fall into complete and utter disarray.</p><p>Will the Goddesses be able to reclaim their world from ASIC’s grasp, or will they be forced to wander the Gamindustri Graveyard, forever lost?</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Four or More for War!</strong> – Have up to four characters on the battlefield, and four more on the sidelines, ready to jump in and give their support!</li><li><strong>Stella Goes Rogue!</strong> – Send Stella out to brave Gamindustri’s dungeons in this realtime mini-game and she’ll collect all kinds of treasure for you—you just sit back and eat pudding! Be careful though, because if she dies in the dungeon, she’ll lose all her special gear!</li><li><strong>The World’s your Oyster!</strong> – Customize the Gamindustri experience with Plans, which allow you to do things like increase / decrease enemy difficulty, change the items you’ll receive from a dungeon, and more!</li><li><strong>Build-a-Sword!</strong> – Use Idea Chips and Blank Discs to create custom equipment that can open up new worlds of skills for you!</li></ul><h2><span><em>Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth3: V Generation</em></span></h2><p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>It’s time to Nep-Nep like it’s 1989. Neptune’s been sucked into an alternate dimension of Gamindustri! In order for her to escape from this late ’80s world, Neptune will have to collect enough shares to open up the path to her own dimension. Sounds easy enough—except a nefarious alliance called the Seven Sages wants to rid Gamindustri of all CPUs (also known as Goddesses), including Neptune!</p><p>Forging cross-dimensional friendships, will Neptune be able to defeat the Seven Sages, save this alternate dimension and get back to her own, or will she be stuck in the ’80s forever?</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>+1 to Combos!</strong> – Customize attack combinations with up to five moves, opening a whole new array of ways to defeat your enemies!</li><li><strong>Bring a Dungeon Buddy!</strong> – The realtime mini-game Stella’s Dungeon is back, and this time she can bring friends! Each is equipped with special skills that lend their support to Stella in her items quest, so choose wisely!</li><li><strong>Remake in Your Image!</strong> – Modify the world of Gamindustri to your liking by creating “Plans” that alter dungeon treasures, enemy difficulty, and more!</li><li><strong>Get Crafty!</strong> – Customize powerful equipment that can unlock the true power of the CPUs, unlocking a world of new skills for them to use!</li></ul></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/07/hyperdimension-neptunia-rebirth-trilogy-for-ps4-launches-september-30-in-the-west]]></content:encoded>

Once we get our hands on the Pro 3, we'll update this article with our experience. At the moment, the Pro 2 is our top pick for Switch players who prefer this control layout. Similarly, this is how we felt about the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0BZ3HX62N,B0DFGZL87S,B0DFGZL87S,B0DFH12YYX&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">original Ultimate Controller</a> before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-ultimate-2-nintendo-switch-2-controller-amazon-prime-day-gaming-deal/1100-6529695/" data-ref-id="1100-6529695">testing the Ultimate 2 series</a>, which offers a markedly improved experience. In short, the Pro 3 should probably be on your radar.</p><hr><p>The 8BitDo Pro 3 costs $20 more than the Pro 2, but the $70 price point aligns with the Ultimate 2 Bluetooth, the manufacturer's flagship controller that supports both 2.4GHz and Bluetooth connections. The Pro 2, meanwhile, only supported Bluetooth wireless and didn't come with a charging dock. The new version is the first non-Ultimate controller with a charging dock. A 2.4GHz USB-C dongle is stored in the bottom of the dock. The Pro series has always felt like the alternative flagship option for those who favor PlayStation over Xbox control layouts, and the Pro 3's specs solidify that.</p><p>Like the Ultimate 2, the Pro 3 can be viewed as an alternative to the <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-SwitchTM-2-Pro-Controller-Switch/dp/B0F3VTFD6J?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller</a></strong>. Nintendo's official controller feels great and even has a pair of back buttons, but there's no denying that 8BitDo's pair of premium gamepads are more versatile thanks to its suite of physical modifications and programmable customization options.</p><p>The TMR sticks on the Ultimate 2 are awesome, so it's exciting to see the tech added to the Pro series. 8BitDo's TMR sticks are noticeably smoother, more accurate, consume less power, and are said to be even more durable than the Hall Effect sticks found on the Pro 2, Ultimate, and other older controllers in the collection. Like Hall Effect, TMR sticks use magnetic sensors to register movements; this naturally reduces wear and prevents stick-drift issues from arising over time.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4532338-pro3bluetoothgamepad-13.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4532338" data-ratio="0.667" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4532338-pro3bluetoothgamepad-13.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4532338"></a><figcaption>8BitDo Pro 3 has magnetic ABXY buttons</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4532338-pro3bluetoothgamepad-13.jpg"></figure><p>Along with the TMR sticks, the Pro 3 mirrors the Ultimate 2's remappable buttons and trigger adjustments. It has two remappable back buttons and two extra shoulder buttons that are activated by microswitches. If you flip the switches on the back, the Hall Effect triggers become non-linear microswitch triggers. The latter shortens the pull distance, effectively turning the triggers into speedy buttons.</p><p>There are a couple of differences between the Pro 3 and Ultimate 2 Bluetooth. The Ultimate 2 series has rings around the sticks with adjustable RGB lighting effects. The Pro 3 has an upgraded D-pad with improved tactile feedback. Interestingly, the G Classic edition has a series of raised ridges--three in each direction--whereas the purple and gray models have the familiar directional arrows instead.</p><p>The Pro 3 also has a customization option that will be a big deal for some players: swappable face buttons. Inside the box, you'll find a small tool to remove the magnetic ABXY buttons. You can then reverse A/B and X/Y to fit your preference for Nintendo's and Microsoft's button layout. Though the Pro 3 doesn't offer Xbox console support, you can use it for Xbox Cloud Gaming as well as for games you have installed on Steam Deck, Windows, mobile devices, etc. Xbox's control layout, with Y on top and A on the bottom, is generally considered the default for any platform not made by Nintendo or PlayStation.</p><p>With the Ultimate 2 series, you need to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DRCWSX17,B0DRCV3SPH,B0DRCWJSKZ,B0F9P4P6HB&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">buy the 2.4GHz-only model</a> to get the Xbox layout and the Bluetooth model for Nintendo compatibility. The Ultimate series has always had a separate 2.4GHz model for PC players and a slightly more expensive model that adds Bluetooth and Switch support. There's nothing wrong with that release model, especially for those who aren't interested in Nintendo consoles. But it's cool that 8BitDo created a built-in solution for those who have issues with Nintendo's control layout on other platforms. You could even remap the buttons after switching their locations to use Xbox's layout on Switch.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4532337-pro3bluetoothgamepad-10.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4532337" data-ratio="0.667" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4532337-pro3bluetoothgamepad-10.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4532337"></a><figcaption>The ball-top stick caps match each controller's theme. </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4532337-pro3bluetoothgamepad-10.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4532339-pro3bluetoothgamepad-9.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4532340-pro3bluetoothgamepad-12.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4532339,1300-4532340" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4532339-pro3bluetoothgamepad-9.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4532340-pro3bluetoothgamepad-12.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4532339-pro3bluetoothgamepad-9.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4532340-pro3bluetoothgamepad-12.jpg"></figure><p>According to 8BitDo, the ball-top stick caps were "made purely for fun," but we're looking forward to checking them out. Regardless of whether they feel practical to use, they look pretty cool on the Pro 3 and are themed around the controller's color. For instance, the retro gray NES/SNES-inspired model comes with a pair of red ball-top caps. If you opt for the GameCube-themed purple edition, you'll get yellow ball-tops.</p><p>With 8BitDo's Ultimate Software V2 app, you can adjust stick, trigger, and motion control sensitivities, create dead zones, modify rumble intensity, and remap inputs. Up to three unique control configurations can be saved directly to the controller, and you can cycle through them on the fly by pressing the profile button.</p><hr><h2>8BitDo is having a big year</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4532353-8bitdopro3vsultimate2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4532353" data-ratio="0.35" data-width="1500" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4532353-8bitdopro3vsultimate2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4532353"></a><figcaption>8BitDo Pro 3 | 8BitDo Ultimate 2</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4532353-8bitdopro3vsultimate2.png"></figure><p>The Pro 3 is just the latest major addition to 8BitDo's impressive accessory lineup in 2025.
