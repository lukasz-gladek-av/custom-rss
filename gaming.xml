            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monolith-productions-and-more-reportedly-closed-by-wb-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Video games layoffs continue as it appears to be hitting Warner Bros owned studios. A new <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:2mkgbhbhqvappkkorf2bzyrp/post/3lizk5skwps2d?ref_src=embed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Jason Schrier on BlueSky">report from Jason Schreier</a>, shared that the latest studios to be cut are: Monolith Productions, Player First Games, and WB San Diego.</p>

<p>As part of the closure of Monolith Productions, the Wonder Woman game that they were working on is also being cancelled. The game was expected to make use of their signature Nemesis System that premiered back in <em>Middle-Earth: Shadows of Mordor</em>. As of last known count, over 170 people worked at Monolith Productions.</p>

<p>This follows the stepping down of WB Games head <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warner-bros-games-david-haddad-stepping-down" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Warner Bros. Games Head David Haddad to Step Down After 12 Years">David Haddad last month</a> after 12 years on the job. It marks a decrease in WB Games' lineup following the failure of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/suicide-squad-kill-justice-league" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League"><em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em></a>, <em>Harry Potter Quidd itch Champions</em>, and struggles with <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/multiversus" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Multiversus"><em>Multiversus</em> </a>(which was worked on by Player First Games and WB San Diego). Additionally, last year <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rocksteady-layoffs-suicide-squad" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Suicide Squad Developer Rocksteady Hit by Layoffs">Rocksteady was hit by a pair </a><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rocksteady-layoffs-end-of-2024" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Suicide Squad Studio Rocksteady Reportedly Hit by More Layoffs">of layoffs</a>.</p>

<p>The remaining studios that are part of WB Games are:</p>

<ul><li>Rocksteady (who worked on<em> Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em>, and previously made the <em>Arkham</em> games).</li>
	<li>WB Montreal (<em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>),</li>
	<li>TT Games (Lego games),</li>
	<li>NetherRealm (<em>Mortal Kombat</em> and <em>Injustice</em>),</li>
	<li>WB Games offices in New York, San Francisco, and Boston.</li>
</ul><p>Earlier today we shared the announcement that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/striking-distance-layoffs-callisto-protocol" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" The Callisto Protocol Developer Striking Distance Lays Off &quot;Most&quot; Developers">Striking Distance laid off</a> most of its employees as 2025 continues to be full of layoffs for the video game industry. This is also part of WB Discovery's pattern of massive cuts under CEO <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/warner-bros-discovery-lays-off-1000-employees-finance-max-1236074169/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Warner Bros.

The TV executive has said that these cuts took "courage" to make.</p>

<p>For now we're left pondering the works that came in the past, such as the masterful <em>Shadows of Mordor</em> from Monolith Productions, or the missed potential of <em>Multiversus</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/618785/framework-desktop-annoucement-price-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Framework, the modular computer company, has just announced its first desktop PC, which is something it absolutely did not need to do — but I’m glad it did.</p><p>Partly because the world needs more tiny <em>4.5-liter </em>mini-ITX PCs, partly because it uses <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337025/amd-ryzen-ai-max-strix-halo-fire-range-9955hx3d">AMD’s most powerful APU ever</a> (Strix Halo) with some actual gaming chops and up to 128GB of unified LPDDR5x memory… and partly because it looks like <em>this</em>.</p><p>Yes, you can create your own front panel out of 21 interchangeable (and freely 3D printable) tiles, pick your own two front I/O ports, and yes, that’s a standard-size mini-ITX motherboard below, along with a custom thermal system co-developed by Cooler Master and Noctua with standard 120mm fans, a semi-custom 400W Flex ATX power supply co-developed by FSP, a whole lot of seemingly perfect-length cables for a relatively cable-light system, your choice of black or translucent side panels… and, at left, an optional LAN party carry handle!</p><p>Just don’t look for any memory slots — it’s soldered. “We spent months working with AMD to explore ways around this but ultimately determined that it wasn’t technically feasible to land modular memory at high throughput with the 256-bit memory bus,” writes Framework.</p><p>Below, find a closer look at Framework’s desktop motherboard and cooling; you only get a PCIe x4 port, not PCIe x8 or x16, and no legacy connectors like SATA, but it’s more loaded than the image lets on: Framework says it’s got onboard 5Gbps Ethernet, two USB4, two DisplayPort, one HDMI, not one but two M.2 2280 NVMe SSD slots for up to 16TB of storage, and a Wi-Fi 7 module, plus what appear to be two full-size USB-A ports and a headphone jack (at the rear).</p><p>Here’s a little bit of the build process, as told by the images Framework sent us:</p><p>And here are some better images of the Framework Desktop mainboard’s I/O, in a rack-mounted, daisy-chained configuration that the company expects some AI enthusiasts might snap up — thanks to the local AI chops and 128GB of memory on the highest-end Ryzen AI Max Plus 395 Plus config.</p><p>“With Framework Desktop, you can run giant, capable models like Llama 3.3 70B Q6 at real-time conversational speed right on your desk,” the company claims, adding, “With USB4 and 5Gbit Ethernet networking, you can connect multiple systems or Mainboards to run even larger models like the full DeepSeek R1 671B.”</p><p>Framework CEO Nirav Patel says it was also designed with LANs in mind — though with a bit less bulk than the massive CRT moniotrs and desktops of old.</p><p>What kind of gaming chops might it really have? My colleague Antonio has seen in his time <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24335012/asus-rog-flow-z13-gaming-tablet-amd-ryzen-max-plus-price-specs">with the Asus Z13 gaming tablet</a> that Strix Halo is roughly around the performance of an Nvidia RTX 4060 mobile chip. AMD gaming architect boss Frank Azor was also here with some 1080p benchmarks at high settings; it apparently can’t quite play the most demanding games (like <em>Black Myth Wukong </em>and <em>Starfield</em>) at over 60fps at native resolution with everything turned up, but the claim is that even 1440p at 60fps is possible with AMD’s FSR upscaling.</p><p>Even if you’re not getting your money’s worth out of AI, though, the prices on these desktops don’t seem all that outlandish. While a desktop with 16 CPU cores, 40 graphics cores, 80MB of cache of the 395 Plus chip, and 128GB of memory will cost $1,999 — not including bring-your-own storage and OS — you can pick one with 8 CPU cores, 32 graphics cores, 40MB of cache and 32GB of memory for $1,099. There’s also a 395 Plus with just 64GB of RAM for $1,599. Or, you can buy a mainboard alone for $799 if you provide your own mini-ITX case and power supply, too.</p><p>If you are looking for the most powerful mini-PC, Patel suggested the $1,999 model compares favorably to an Apple Mac Studio, which can cost over twice as much for the same 128GB of RAM.</p><div><p>Framework says these desktops and mainboard should be avaialble to preorder today, with plans to ship in Q3. If you’re reading these words shortly after they were published, I’m currently at a Framework event in San Francisco, where the company also just introduced a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/618769">new AMD-powered version of its Framework Laptop 13</a> and the new Framework Laptop 12: <a href="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=618784&amp;action=edit">its first budget laptop, its first touchscreen, and its first convertible. </a></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stars-reach/" data-ref-id="5000-634584">Stars Reach</a>, a new sci-fi MMO seeking funding on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/starsreach/stars-reach/description" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kickstarter</a>, has blown past its initial funding goal of $200,000 in less than an hour of being live.</p><p dir="ltr">No doubt the pedigree behind Stars Reach is part of the reason for that. The game is coming from studio Playable Worlds, led by Raph Koster, one of the lead creators of MMO classics like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ultima-online/" data-ref-id="5000-2222">Ultima Online</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-galaxies-the-complete-online-adventures/" data-ref-id="5000-27644">Star Wars Galaxies</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRd5xiNfCg0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZRd5xiNfCg0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Stars Reach is putting a heavy emphasis on its sandbox nature, giving players the freedom to shape its galaxy how they see fit. That means it's up to players to terraform planets, build settlements, form trade empires, genetically engineer alien creatures, or wipe entire planets off the map. The game's universe is procedurally generated, and players will have the ability to shape it to their liking.</p><p dir="ltr">It all sounds a bit like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/no-mans-sky/" data-ref-id="5000-221687">No Man's Sky</a>, albeit with far more players. There will be spaceships and action-based combat, but much like the more free-form Star Wars Galaxies from which Stars Reach is taking heavy inspiration, combat doesn't sound like the game's focus. There will be dozens of professions to choose from, some ideal for combat, but many that aren't. Its "endgame" sounds like it's whatever players want it to be, whether it be governing a city or exploring the deep reaches of space. It certainly sounds ambitious, with cities and even a planet's ecosystem all falling on the shoulders of players to manage.</p><p dir="ltr">Unlike some Kickstarter games that seek funding on little more than concept art and a dream, Stars Reach is said to already be fairly far along, having been in development for several years at this point. There have been playable pre-alpha tests for months now, with the goal being for Stars Reach to launch in early access this summer. A full release is tentatively slated to come in the first half of next year. As stated on the Kickstarter page, seeking public funding "isn't about starting the game--it's about finishing it, expanding it, and bringing this living galaxy to its full potential."</p><p dir="ltr">Those who want to play during early access will need to support the Kickstarter at the $30 tier or purchase an early access supporter pack when those become available. The full game, however, will be free-to-play with optional microtransactions. Like many free-to-play MMOs, there will be an optional monthly subscription as well, though this one will be required for those looking to build homes on the intergalactic frontier. It's called the Property Pass, and along with letting players become landowners, it will also grant access to unique cosmetics and other items.</p><p dir="ltr">In its first Kickstarter update after surpassing its initial goal, Playable Worlds said it was humbled and grateful for the support.</p><p dir="ltr">"This is your victory as much as ours, and we can't wait to take this journey together," Playable Worlds' statement reads. "But the journey isn't over. The more we raise the faster we can bring this game to market. And the better the game will be."</p>

            <p>
Following recent claims Warner Bros.'s Wonder Woman game was in trouble and still "years away from release", the company has reportedly now cancelled the project and shut down its developer Monolith Productions as part of a string of studio closures.
</p>
<p>
That's according to Bloomberg's Jason Schreier, who <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lizk5skwps2d">made the claim in a post shared on BlueSky</a>. "<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/warner-bros-games">Warner Bros. Games</a> is shutting down Monolith Productions, Player First Games, and WB San Diego, sources tell Bloomberg News," Schreier wrote. "Warner Bros. is also canceling the Wonder Woman game."
</p>
<p>
Schreier <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wonder-woman-games-reportedly-still-years-away-from-release-if-it-ever-launches-at-all">first suggested Wonder Woman was in trouble earlier this month</a>, as part of a report detailing the culture of Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment during the tenure of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-games-boss-david-haddad-departs-following-rocky-period-for-publisher">outgoing president David Haddad</a> - a period said to have lacked a "strong, cohesive vision".

<p>
At the time, Schreier claimed Wonder Woman had "struggled to coalesce" in the years since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monolith-is-making-a-wonder-woman-game">its announcement in 2021</a>, with the project having switched directors and been rebooted early last year. All that upheaval was reported to have cost Warner Bros. $100m, with sources telling Bloomberg its future remained "in question".
</p>
<p>
Wonder Woman's reported cancellation comes amid an extremely rocky period for Warner Bros.'s games division, with Warner Bros. Montreal's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gotham-knights">Gotham Knights</a>, Rocksteady's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a>, party brawler <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/multiversus">MultiVersus</a>, and last year's Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions all having failed to resonate with consumers. 
</p>
<p>
We've reached out to Warner Bros. for comment on these latest reports and will update the story as more comes in.

<p>Warner Bros. Games has canceled its Wonder Woman game and shut down multiple studios. Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier broke the news on Tuesday afternoon that, in addition to the game, Monolith Productions, Player First Games, and WB San Diego are all being closed.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-25/warner-bros-shuts-three-video-game-studios-in-restructuring?srnd=undefined&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report from Schreier</a> states that the cuts “reflect a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-games-focusing-on-batman-mortal-kombat-and-hogwarts-legacy-moving-forward/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">refocusing of the games division</a> on major franchises such as Harry Potter,&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat</em>,&nbsp;<em>Game of Thrones</em>&nbsp;and DC Comics, primarily Batman.”</p>



<p>In an internal memo obtained by Schreier, Warner Bros.  head of games and streaming JB Perrette said that “too many” recent releases have “really missed the mark”.</p>



<p>“We need to make some substantial changes to our portfolio/team structure if we are to commit the necessary resources to get back to a ‘fewer but bigger franchises’ strategy,” he said.</p>



<p>In addition, Warner Bros. Games gave a statement to <a href="https://kotaku.com/monolith-productions-wonder-woman-multiversus-cancel-wb-1851766400" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a>. Insider Gaming also received the same statement. Rather than cut it up, you can read it in full below:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>We have had to make some very difficult decisions to structure our development studios and investments around building the best games possible with our key franchises -– Harry Potter, Mortal Kombat, DC and Game of Thrones. After careful consideration, we are closing three of our development studios – Monolith Productions, Player First Games and Warner Bros. Games San Diego. This is a strategic change in direction and not a reflection of these teams or the talent that consists within them.</em></p>



<p><em>The development of Monolith’s Wonder Woman videogame will not move forward. Our hope was to give players and fans the highest quality experience possible for the iconic character, and unfortunately this is no longer possible within our strategic priorities. This is another tough decision, as we recognize Monolith’s storied history of delivering epic fan experiences through amazing games.

<p><em>As difficult as today is, we remain focused on and excited about getting back to producing high-quality games for our passionate fans and developed by our world class studios and getting our Games business back to profitability and growth in 2025 and beyond.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Wonder Woman was first announced at The Game Awards 2021, and was being developed by Monolith Productions. The game was set to feature the Nemesis system made popular by its Middle-earth games. Since its reveal announcement, news surrounding Wonder Woman had been scarce with it reported that the game had been completely rebooted sometime in 2024.</p>



<p>Monolith was formed in 1994 before becoming a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Games in 2004.</p>



<p>The closing of Player First Games comes after its debut game MultiVersus was canceled with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/multiversus-is-officially-shutting-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shutdown happening in May</a>. Warner Bros. Games <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-games-acquires-multiversus-developer-player-first-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acquired the studio</a> in July 2024. Lastly, WB San Diego was founded in 2019 and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/warner-bros-opens-new-mobile-studio-in-san-diego" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">focused primarily</a> on mobile and free-to-play games.</p>



<p>The news of the cancelation and closures also comes just weeks after it was announced that current Warner Bros. Interactive president David Haddad <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-david-haddad/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was leaving the company</a> this spring. His departure comes after 12 years in his division.</p>



<p>As of writing, there’s been no public statement from Warner Bros. Games. It’s also unclear if anyone from the closing studios will be moved, or if everyone will be let go. Insider Gaming has reached out to Warner Bros. Games for comment.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/skin-deep-steam-next-fest-demo-impressions-pc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’m floating in space, clinging to the hull of a spaceship. I peer in through a trash chute – not the most glamorous window into the ship’s vacuum-sealed world, but it will have to do. Inside, a lone guard patrols around a laundry room. Perfect, she’ll make for an easy ambush. I wait for her to turn her back, and then I burst in. Immediately, everything goes awry. Because I entered through the trash chute, I’m now stinky, and the guard snaps to attention as soon as she catches a whiff. I frantically scurry under a counter, where I happen upon a hidden stash of soap. Fantastic. I can work with this.&nbsp;</p><p>I throw a couple bars onto the ground, producing sudsy bubbles and causing the guard to slip and fall. I rush out to finish her off, only to… also faceplant as a result of my self-made slip ‘n’ slide. The guard opens fire, and I roll into a nearby vent with just a sliver of health left. OK, I think, this isn’t going <em>great</em>, but I still have options. As I linger in the vent, a meter fills telling me that I will soon sneeze – not great for stealth – but that gives me an idea. Earlier I picked up a container full of black pepper; I barge back into the laundry room, take aim, and throw it at the guard, who begins sneezing and wheezing. It’s now or never. I leap onto her back and wrestle her onto one washing machine, followed by another. That leaves her down for the count. Then, of course, I pop her head off nice and clean and throw it out the airlock. You know, so she can’t levitate over to a new body. Another job well done.</p><p>This is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/301280/Skin_Deep/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Skin Deep</em></a> in a nutshell.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Skin Deep - Release Date Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rP1matuR3qQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><em>Skin Deep</em> first appeared on my radar almost as soon as it was announced several years ago, largely because I’ve been a fan of developer Blendo Games since the hazily-remembered days of <em>Gravity Bone</em> and <em>Thirty Flights Of Loving</em>, games that told tight, absurd stories with a uniquely cinematic flair for the dramatic. But on other occasions, such as 2016’s <em>Quadrilateral Cowboy</em>, the studio revealed its true passion: densely-packed mechanical systems, the kind that fit together like gears in a pocketwatch. <em>Skin Deep</em>, which comes out in April, applies pretty much every tool in Blendo’s belt to a sci-fi immersive sim. It makes a phenomenal first impression.</p><p><em>Skin Deep</em>, a brief demo of which is now available as part of Steam Next Fest, describes itself as an “immersive first-person shooter” in which you play as an insurance operative who rescues talking cats. (When you do so, by the way, they explode out of their tiny jail cells, and the word “MEOW” flies across the screen.) You’re outnumbered and outgunned aboard nonlinear spaceships, with standout features that include the aforementioned sneezing tendency, as well as the fact that your character is constantly barefoot for some reason.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Blendo Games</figcaption></figure><p>The setup might sound silly, but it works. For example, if you step on broken glass, it gets lodged in your foot. Yikes. But if you yank it out, you can both recover some health and gain a new weapon. This kind of thinking suffuses the whole experience: Even the most mundane objects can be potent offensive tools in the right hands (or feet). I’m talking books, hunks of metal, walkie talkies, tuna cans, and slapstick classics like banana peels and fishbones. Creativity is your paintbrush. Every level is a canvas.&nbsp;</p><p>At this point, I’ve replayed the second level several times, with a devious glee that takes me back to childhood afternoons spent with the <em>Metal Gear Solid 2</em> demo that came bundled with <em>Zone of the Enders</em>. There are just so many ways to mess with these three hapless guards, and they’re all funny. Certainly, I’ll always remember my nearly-botched first attempt, but my second go ‘round – when I realized I could use books and coffee cups to shatter numerous windows and turn most of the ship into an antigravity playground – represented a true turning of the tables, a new power dynamic born of ingenuity (and my character’s thus-far-unexplained ability to breathe in outer space).</p><figure><figcaption>Blendo Games</figcaption></figure><p>After only an hour or so, which includes replays, I’m extremely high on <em>Skin Deep</em>. It feels like one of those games that’s going to keep throwing comically ingenious (or perhaps ingeniously comical) curveballs at me as levels increase in complexity, and whatever comes next will be positioned atop a uniquely confident foundation. As it stands, games already have plenty of slick infiltrations and assassinations. They need more knock-down, drag-out cartoon brawls. They need more slapstick. <em>Skin Deep</em>’s demo gets it. I sure hope the full game does too.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/avowed-skeleton-notes-funny-writing-bear-egg"><h3>Avowed Has Killer Skeleton Storytelling</h3></a><p>It turns out that dead men do, in fact, tell tales.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-microsoft-muse-ai-xbox-avowed"><h3>Microsoft’s New ‘Muse’ AI Is Doubly Bad Because Avowed Is So Good</h3></a><p>"The [Muse] announcement almost felt like it was under duress, like it was a hostage video in some ways"</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/framework-known-for-upgradable-laptops-intros-not-particularly-upgradable-desktop.1118730/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/framework-known-for-upgradable-laptops-intros-not-particularly-upgradable-desktop/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>In Framework's first-party case, the PC starts at $1,099, which gets you a Ryzen AI Max 385 (that's an 8-core CPU and 32 GPU cores) and 32GB of RAM. A fully loaded 128GB with a Ryzen AI Max+ 395 configuration (16 CPU cores, 40 GPU cores) will run you $1,999. There's also an in-between build with the Ryzen AI Max+ 395 chip and 64GB of RAM for $1,599.&nbsp;If you just want the mini ITX board to put in a case of your choosing, that starts at $799.</p>
<p>None of these are impulse buys, exactly, but they're priced a bit better than a gaming-focused mini PC like the Asus ROG NUC, which <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1860500-REG/asus_rnuc14srku7169aui_republic_of_gamers_nuc.html?ap=y&amp;smp=y&amp;msclkid=665d398fca4517ecc9d75e33332b247f">starts at nearly $1,300 as of this writing</a> and comes with half as much RAM. It's also priced well compared to what you can get out of a DIY mini ITX PC based on integrated graphics—the Ryzen 7 8700G, an AM5 ITX motherboard, and 32GB of DDR5 can all be had for around $500 collectively before you add a case, power supply, or SSD, but for considerably slower performance.</p>
<p>The volume of the Framework Desktop's first-party case is just 4.5 liters—for reference, <a href="https://ssupd.co/products/cases-meshroom-s-v2">the SSUPD Meshroom S</a> is 14.9 liters, a fairly middle-of-the-road volume for an ITX case that can fit a full-size GPU. An Xbox Series X is about 6.9 liters, and the Xbox Series S is 4.4 liters. Apple's Mac Studio is about 3.7 liters. The Framework Desktop isn't breaking records, but it's definitely tiny. </p>

<figure>
    
          <figcaption>
        <div>
    
    <p>
      Despite the non-upgradeability of the main components, Framework has tried to stick to existing standards where it can by using a flex ATX power supply, ATX headers on the motherboard, regular 120 mm fans that can be changed out, and of course the mini ITX form factor itself.

          </p>
  </div>
      </figcaption>
      </figure>

<p>So the pitch for the system is easy: You get a reasonably powerful 1440p-capable gaming and workstation PC inside a case the size of a small game console. "If the Series S could run Windows, I'd buy it in a second" is a thought that has occurred to me, so I can see the appeal, even though it costs at least three times as much.</p>
<p>But it does feel like a strange fit for Framework, given that it's so much&nbsp;<em>less</em> upgradeable than most PCs. The CPU and GPU are one piece of silicon, and they're soldered to the motherboard. The RAM is also soldered down and not upgradeable once you've bought it, setting it apart from nearly every other board Framework sells.</p>

href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/multiversus-director-breaks-silence-on-games-cancellation-responds-to-threats-against-devs/1100-6529188/" data-ref-id="1100-6529188">which is closing this May.</a> Warner Bros. acquired Player First in 2024. MultiVersus was the team's first game.</p><p>WB San Diego is <a href="https://careers.wbd.com/global/en/warner-bros-games-san-diego" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">more recently established studio</a> that was contributing to "the future of AAA free-to-play games."</p><p>In a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ethangach.bsky.social/post/3lizl4fakrs24" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a>, Warner Bros. Games said it made the "very difficult" decision to restructure its development teams, resulting in these studio closures. Going forward, Warner Bros. Games said it will focus on four major franchises: Harry Potter, Mortal Kombat, DC, and Game of Thrones.</p><p>The statement said the decision to close the three studios was a "strategic change" that had nothing to do with the teams or the talented individuals working there.</p><p>As for the new Wonder Woman game, Warner Bros. said it wanted to make "the highest quality" game, but "unfortunately this is no longer possible within our strategic priorities." Wonder Woman is, of course, a DC property, but it seemingly is not a fit within the company's new strategy.</p><p>"This is another tough decision, as we recognize Monolith's storied history of delivering epic fan experiences through amazing games," the company said.</p><p>A recent report said the new Wonder Woman game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wonder-woman-game-has-reportedly-cost-warner-bros-100-million/1100-6529315/" data-ref-id="1100-6529315">had already cost Warner Bros. more than $100 million and was nowhere close to being ready for release.</a> This follows a trend at Warner Bros. Games, as recent projects have failed to take off. Rocksteady's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-disappointing-release-led-to-a-200-million-shortfall-for-warner-bros/1100-6523301/" data-ref-id="1100-6523301">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League was a $200 million flop</a> for the company, Warner Bros. Montreal's Gotham Knights saw lukewarm sales when it launched, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/multiversus-shuts-down-in-may-but-can-still-be-played-offline-if-you-update-in-time/1100-6529169/">MultiVersus, as mentioned, will shut down in May</a>. Kill the Justice League and MultiVersus were live-service games. Kill the Justice League developer Rocksteady is not historically known for making those types of games.</p><p>Warner Bros. Games' longtime boss, David Haddad, announced in January that he's leaving the company but will stay on for the next three months to help oversee the transition to a new leader. No such executive has been named yet for Haddad's replacement.</p><p>Looking ahead, Warner Bros. games is focusing on the four core franchises mentioned above. A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/making-a-hogwarts-legacy-sequel-is-one-of-warner-bros-biggest-priorities/1100-6526285/" data-ref-id="1100-6526285">Hogwarts Legacy sequel is coming</a>, Warner Bros. Montreal is said to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-batman-and-game-of-thrones-games-may-be-in-the-works/1100-6529314/" data-ref-id="1100-6529314">pitching a new Game of Thrones title</a>, and Rocksteady may be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-batman-and-game-of-thrones-games-may-be-in-the-works/1100-6529314/" data-ref-id="1100-6529314">plotting a new single-player Batman game</a>. As for DC, studio boss James Gunn recently said some <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/first-dc-universe-game-wont-be-revealed-soon-but-some-really-interesting-projects-are-coming/1100-6529678/" data-ref-id="1100-6529678">"really interesting" projects are coming in the gaming space, but not soon.</a></p>

            <p>
If you've already hoovered up developer Color Gray Games' excellent deduct-'em'-up sequel The Rise of the Golden Idol, you might well be delighted to hear The Sins of New Wells - the first of its previously announced post-launch DLC episodes - is arriving this March.
</p>
<p>
The Rise of the Golden Idol, if you're unfamiliar, takes the sleuthing formula of its 2022 predecessor and shifts it from the 18th Century to the 1970s. Eurogamer liked its 20 new cases enough to declare it a "compelling modern mystery thriller" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-rise-of-the-golden-idol-review">our four star review</a> last year.
</p>
<p>
Prior to its release, Color Gray Games confirmed The Rise of the Golden Idol <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sleuthing-sequel-the-rise-of-the-golden-idol-shares-post-launch-dlc-roadmap-ahead-of-this-weeks-launch">would be getting a paid Detective Pass</a>, granting access to four additional self-contained DLC Investigations throughout 2025 - each one featuring "at least" four new cases. And we now know the first of these, The Sins of New Wells, is coming in March.

"Homicide detective [REDACTED] has been transferred to the [REDACTED]," the studio explains in its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2716400/view/521956605068051135">announcement</a>, "where corruption runs as deep as the sewers beneath New Wells. Here, crime is business as usual. But as he and his new partner, Cliff Savea, investigate a string of brutal crimes, they find themselves pulled into something far more insidious...Lemurian magic."
</p>
<p>
And if that appeals, The Sins of New Wells will be available as part of the aforementioned Detective Pass bundle, which costs £14.99/$17.99, or as an individual purchase priced at £4.99/$5.99. It's coming to PC, consoles, and the Netflix-exclusive mobile version.

			<p>Netmarble announced that <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-of-thrones-kingsroad-shows-off-castle-black-winterfell-and-fantastical-creatures-for-its-co-op-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Game of Thrones: Kingsroad</a>, the action RPG based on George R.R. Martin's popular fantasy franchise, now has a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3183280/Game_of_Thrones_Kingsroad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC demo</a> that everyone can download for free as part of Steam Next Fest. Here's a brief official description of the demo:</p>
<p><em>From the untamed wilds beyond the Wall to the towering halls of Winterfell, the North is harsh, unforgiving, and full of opportunity—and peril. In this demo, get a taste of the journey before you set forth to explore the vast realm of Westeros in the full game.</em></p>

<p>In the full game, players will forge their own legacy as the bastard child of House Tyre, a small noble house in Northern Westeros. They'll be thrust right into action by the death of the main character's brothers and the looming threat of winter and forced to embark on a mission to restore House Tyre to its former glory.</p>
<p>With this objective in mind, players must consolidate their political standing, navigate the complex power struggles between the noble houses of Westeros, and seek out any allies while also helping the Night's Watch prepare for the final confrontation with the White Walkers and their army of the dead that awaits just beyond the Wall.</p>
<p>As covered in our previous news story, Game of Thrones: Kingsroad will also support a cooperative mode. In this mode, players can band together to face mythical creatures from the world's most mysterious lore and earn great loot rewards. The game will launch at some point in Q2 (that is to say, before the end of June) on PC, iOS, and Android.</p>

And now <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-trek-section-31-cameo-big-name-jamie-lee-curtis-1851747475&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-trek-section-31-cameo-big-name-jamie-lee-curtis-1851747475">Paramount+</a></span> has added a ton of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.paramountplus.com/shows/mtv-unplugged/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.paramountplus.com/shows/mtv-unplugged/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">classic<em> MTV Unplugged</em> episodes</a></span>, including famous performances by Nirvana and Alice in Chains. </p><p>As noted in a press release by Paramount, many of these <em>Unplugged </em>episodes “haven’t been available in 20+ years.” Sure, you could find some of the most famous ones on YouTube in various levels of quality, but most were much trickier to find and the versions floating around online looked and sounded terrible. So it’s really nice to have a large chunk of music history accessible again. Well, accessible if you have Paramount+. I have the service because I love<em> Star Trek </em>and <em>Survivor</em>, and I rewatch <em>Frasier</em>. If you ask nicely I’ll share my account with you. <br></p><p>One of the <em>Unplugged </em>episodes added to Paramount+ features the infamous 1996 performance by Oasis.

And when the band finally showed up an hour before taping, he was apparently very drunk. Noel Gallagher, his brother, ended up singing the entire show on his own.

This was a similar show to <em>Unplugged</em>, but even more stripped down and with the artists talking more about their lives or the origins of their songs in between numbers.</p><p>Now, excuse me, I’m going to listen to Nirvana’s performance of <em>The Man Who Sold The World</em> again. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
BioWare co-founder Greg Zeschuk has looked back on his time at the company behind Dragon Age, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-the-old-republic">Star Wars: The Old Republic</a>, and discussed some of the studio's most notorious moments, as well as his relationship with mega-publisher owner EA.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to Simon Parkin on the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4C53o2G7q64HMCeqf54Qyz?si=02ac49c328d34de8">My Perfect Console podcast</a>, Zeschuk said EA had been a decent partner, despite some BioWare fans' view that the studio's buyout was the beginning of its end.
</p>
<p>
"I like to comment that EA gives you enough rope to hang yourself," Zeschuk said. "And what I mean by that is you have to learn to work within the structure and I think we did quite well, if you look at the Mass Effect [trilogy that] came out of there. It was actually a pretty successful run. 
</p>
<p>
"But you have to understand how to work within a big company. And, for me, that was the end. It was like, 'oh, I don't like big companies'. So I knew by year two that I was going to leave at some point. I just didn't know when.
</p>
<p>
"I lived in Austin on-and-off half-time for two-and-a-half years making Star Wars: The Old Republic and that was like my swansong in the industry," Zeschuk continued, recounting his work on his final game. Both of BioWare's co-founders famously quit the company and games industry in 2012, and Zeschuk now spends his days happily working in craft beer.
</p>
<p>
"I knew that was kind of a one-way trip," Zeschuk says of his decision to focus on BioWare's big Star Wars MMO bet. "If it was super successful, super-duper successful, Ray and I would have probably launched a bid to try and take over EA from the inside, being the corporate pirates that we are. But it needed to be like $2bn a year successful. It didn't work out so I was like, 'I'm fine'."
</p>
<p>
As for EA in general, Zeschuk says the publisher behind FIFA and Madden "let us operate freely" - though BioWare's antics sometimes raised eyebrows. 
</p>
<p>
"There's all kinds of shenanigans we did," Zeschuk recalled. "We actually made Facebook games under false pretenses, under false names actually."
</p>
<p>
Zeschuk remembers a game about a yeti running around delivering gifts, which BioWare staff made as an experiment to test the platform. 
</p>
<p>
BioWare was not allowed to work on mobile games, Zeschuk continued, but some team members were curious about it - so they made up fake company name to test development for it. The idea was that BioWare might want to include mobile integration into one of its bigger games - which indeed happened with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect-3">Mass Effect 3</a>'s Galaxy at War app.
</p>
<p>
"You can't have a company of cowboys," Zeschuk said. "I wouldn't say we were cowboys, we were usually somewhat calculating in what we did. But we liked to try stuff. So when they discovered we had a couple of Apple development devices and we weren't in the mobile division, they were like 'what are you doing?'"
</p>
<p>
While discussing his biggest regret of his time at BioWare, Zeschuk recalled receiving advice from another gaming giant - Microsoft - which ultimately swayed the company into launching <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/jade-empire">Jade Empire</a> for the original Xbox, to a middling response.
</p>
<p>
"Microsoft was like 'no no, you should release it now, right at the end of the cycle, because it's a great time'," Zeschuk recalled. "It was the worst advice, absolute moronic advice from them, the stupidest thing ever. I'll say that and Peter Moore will punch me in the mouth next time he sees me. It wasn't his fault, but we should have pushed that to the beginning of the [Xbox] 360. 
</p>
<p>
"We could have rezzed [Jade Empire] up, we could have amped it up. We could have said no. We just missed... I wish I'd said, 'this is a terrible mistake, give us another six months, give us the chance to make it a launch title for 360' and we'd have had another franchise, and then who knows. I just think it would have been a way more successful product at the beginning of a cycle than the end, because by the time it came out people weren't even buying Xbox anymore, they were waiting for the next one."
</p>
<p>
Zeschuk recalled concerns from within BioWare at the company's acquisition by EA, particularly around the perception that the publisher had a culture of overworking, or 'crunch'. But this was something BioWare already had experiences with itself, he noted.
</p>
<p>
"There was a pretty heated all-hands in the studio to talk about the sale and whether EA was going to force its philosohical work-life balance onto us," Zeschuk said, "but we actually all did it to ourselves. We were the ones who were immature, and so we were the ones who could get ourselves out of that. 
</p>
<p>
"I think we did the best we could, we always could have done better, but I don't know. There are times you had to put in maximum effort, but we also tried to institute things like, 'hey there's still sympathetic... if you work from home, go home. You don't have to be in the office'. 
</p>
<p>
"The biggest offenses in that world were, 'just in case, we'll have you stay in the office for hours on end in case someone needs you'. Nah, just go home. We'll call you in. Be reasonable. We tried to do it better. I don't know if we did? I think we did it better than we could have done. There's always ways to improve."
</p>
<p>
Finally, Zeschuk recalled <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-video-sheds-light-on-what-it-was-like-inside-bioware-during-the-mass-effect-3-ending-controversy">the Mass Effect 3 ending controversy</a>, when a fan backlash prompted the release of a new extended ending to the sci-fi space opera in response to complaints online, but also harassment and death threats.
</p>
<p>
"I think intentions were good," Zeschuk said. "You can never do anything perfectly, and that's one of the challenges as a game developer. To some degree, especially when there's high expectations - think of a series like Mass Effect, absolutely beloved, an incredible overall experience - and then to maybe not reach the players' expectations of agency and decision-making at the final step when providing a more nuanced ending... it's complicated. 
</p>
<p>
"Speaking fully and honestly, I was a bystander on it as I was working on Star Wars: The Old Republic, and so I was in the mix but not in the firing line, if that makes sense. But I really felt for the team because I understood the purpose. 
</p>
<p>
"Your dream scenario is [to] release a game no one's really heard of and do it really well, because as soon as the expectations are there, it's really tough," he continued. "And the other extreme pressure on the other side of that... you got these giant business conglomerates that are pushing for certain release dates and release times. At BioWare, when Ray and I ran [it], our most effective thing was pushing for the dates that made the most sense that made the best possible game. 
</p>
<p>
"We would play something and declare that, with lots of resource, it wasn't ready, and make it happen at a later date. I look at a game like Anthem and think 'man, there's such a great core to that game, but yeah, it needs to bake for another year'."
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-veteran-writer-among-those-looking-for-work-after-post-dragon-age-the-veilguard-downsizing">BioWare has now shrunk down in size</a> following the completion of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> last year, with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-confirms-many-staff-moved-elsewhere-in-ea-as-core-team-focuses-on-mass-effect-5-in-downsized-studio">smaller team committed to Mass Effect 5</a>.
