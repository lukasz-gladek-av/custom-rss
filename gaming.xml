It’s got <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-plucky-squire-concept-art-zelda-platformer-release-1851649101&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-plucky-squire-concept-art-zelda-platformer-release-1851649101">not one, but two, whimsical art styles</a></span>: one reminiscent of children’s picture books, and another in which the hero is presented as a miniature toy that comes to life in a child’s bedroom. The game is most often presented in the former, where screen transitions are accompanied by the turning of a page, and the middle of most stages appropriately folds where they meet. The eponymous hero goes on many adventures with his friends Violet and Thrash, who each embody noble and righteous virtues, while triumphantly defeating the forces of evil time and time again. At the close of these journeys, the Plucky Squire comes home and writes about it all, because naturally he’s <em>also</em> a bestselling author in the land of Mojo. It’s a game with all the fixings of a kids’ classic, something that can be shared with the children in one’s life to encourage them to dream big and boldly. As I played the game, though, I did find myself wishing that <em>The Plucky Squire </em>actually believed in its audience as much as it claims to. - Moises Taveras <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-plucky-squire-zelda-inspiration-too-on-rails-1851653126&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-plucky-squire-zelda-inspiration-too-on-rails-1851653126">Read More</a></span></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c99e848421f125896bf44e4733897111" data-recommend-id="image://c99e848421f125896bf44e4733897111" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The 30th Anniversary PlayStation collection sits on display." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The 30th Anniversary PlayStation collection sits on display." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c99e848421f125896bf44e4733897111" data-recommend-id="image://c99e848421f125896bf44e4733897111" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The 30th Anniversary PlayStation collection sits on display." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Sony is marking the 30th anniversary of PlayStation with a new lineup of limited-edition, PS1-inspired consoles and accessories and they look surprisingly good, especially for those of us who still have fond memories of listening to the disc spin in the original console while grinding through our favorite ‘90s RPG late at night.  - Ethan Gach <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-30th-anniversary-collection-preorder-price-1851652528&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-30th-anniversary-collection-preorder-price-1851652528">Read More</a></span></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="51ab161e6d9d7368dbfa1f383d47de59" data-recommend-id="image://51ab161e6d9d7368dbfa1f383d47de59" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Space Marine kills aliens " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Space Marine kills aliens " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Saber Interactive / Focus Entertainment</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="51ab161e6d9d7368dbfa1f383d47de59" data-recommend-id="image://51ab161e6d9d7368dbfa1f383d47de59" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Space Marine kills aliens " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/c/379647/2059850/25796?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fwarhammer-40000-space-marine-2%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/c/379647/2059850/25796?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fwarhammer-40000-space-marine-2%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2</em>,</a></span> made by Saber Interactive, is the sequel to a beloved 2011 shooter and has been praised for, among other things, feeling like an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games-like-space-marine-2-warhammer-boltgun-gears-l4d2-1851650812&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games-like-space-marine-2-warhammer-boltgun-gears-l4d2-1851650812">old-school Xbox 360-era game</a></span>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/21/24249299/the-plucky-squire-art-interview-switch-ps5-xbox-steam<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>The Plucky Squire</em> is a game that leaps off the page — literally. It takes place in a storybook world rendered in an adorable two dimensions thanks to codirector and former <em>Pokémon</em> artist <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jamesturner_42/">James Turner</a>. But at certain points, the heroic lead character can venture into the real world and solve puzzles that mix 2D and 3D in inventive ways. Sometimes, you’re moving objects between dimensions; other times, you’re rearranging the words in a book to create new outcomes. It’s as cute as it is creative, and it follows <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24237778/astro-bot-review-ps5-game-of-the-year">Sony’s <em>Astro Bot</em></a> in what is turning out to be a very good year for family-friendly games.</p><p>The game puts you in the role of Jot, the titular plucky squire, who has the unusual ability to exist outside of the book he stars in. The two worlds are drastically different: inside the storybook is bright, colorful, and simple, while the real world is appropriately dark and realistic. They’re distinct, but through Jot, the worlds intersect as he sets about saving the book from an evil wizard. Solving puzzles involves flipping through pages to pull items from the past, using language to bypass barriers, and occasionally boxing a bear. It’s silly and heartfelt and, at times, calls to mind the 2D segments in Nintendo classics <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16552118/super-mario-odyssey-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Super Mario Odyssey</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/14/5103870/legend-of-zelda-a-link-between-worlds-gets-back-to-series-roots"><em>The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds</em></a>.</p><div><p>“The idea of contrast was really important to the game.”</p></div><p>For Turner, the initial idea for the game came during a lull, when he had just left <em>Pokémon</em> developer Game Freak but hadn’t yet started work at All Possible Futures, the studio he cofounded with Jonathan Biddle. “I left Game Freak, and then I had nothing to do,” he tells <em>The Verge</em>. “To fill that void, I started drawing a webcomic.” That comic, called <a href="https://x.com/JamesTurner_42/status/1289693386849411072"><em>Cosmic</em></a>, included a number of characters and ideas that would eventually make their way into <em>The Plucky Squire</em> as its storybook narrative took shape.</p><p>For Turner — who frequently posts <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jamesturner_42/p/C91eDvWqS8K/?hl=en">hilarious mashup illustrations</a> and who designed notable pokémon like <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Polteageist_(Pok%C3%A9mon)">Polteageist</a> — one of the goals of the game was to create a unique clash of styles. Not only should the dimensions in <em>The Plucky Squire</em> play different, but they should look different as well. It’s an idea that came about early in development; initially, when Jot jumped into the real world, he was cel-shaded to keep his cartoony style. Eventually, though, it became clear that a more realistic, almost toy-like version of the character worked better.</p><div><p><cite>Image: All Possible Futures</cite></p></div><p>“It reduced the realism of the outside world quite significantly in a strange way,” Turner says of the cel shading. “Even though the outside world was very real, if the object that you’re looking at 90 percent of the time [isn’t], it starts to affect how you see the rest of the world.” He adds that “the idea of contrast was really important to the game.”</p><p>A good example is early on in <em>The Plucky Squire</em> when Jot is in search of a bow-and-arrow to complete a quest. This involves jumping through a portal into the real world, navigating a very messy desk filled with obstacles, and then jumping into a card ripped out of <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> to battle an elf. When Jot finally reaches his destination, there are three distinct art styles onscreen: storybook 2D, realistic 3D, and detailed fantasy art. “I thought that clash of styles would be the most jaw-dropping,” Turner explains.</p><div><p>“There’s a big gap outside of Nintendo.”</p></div><p>Outside of its visuals, <em>The Plucky Squire</em> is also notable for being an experience that works really well for all ages. The action and puzzles have just enough depth to them to be satisfying while not being intimidating for younger or less experienced players. It’s like a streamlined <em>Zelda</em> adventure, with some nice quality-of-life features, like an optional hint system that doesn’t give too much away. It’s a style of game that can be hard to find outside of something from Nintendo (which includes the upcoming <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24232567/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-hands-on"><em>Echoes of Wisdom</em></a>). But titles like <em>Astro Bot</em> and <em>The Plucky Squire</em> are showing it’s possible for other developers, as well.</p><p>“There are lots of people that want to play those games, and they haven’t been catered to as much as they possibly should have been,” says Turner. “It does feel like there’s a big gap outside of Nintendo where it would be nice if we had those games more regularly. There’s a need for them.”</p><p><small>The Plucky Squire <em>is out now on the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.</em></small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"Don't be afraid. Darkness is a good thing," says a gravely voice as animated night-vision goggles sink into water.</p>
<p>We then see an older, grey-haired man similarly sink beneath the surface of the water, and cut to a wreath-covered coffin. The name blazoned across it is "beloved father" Douglas Shetland.</p>
<p>"Once you get used to the shadows, you see bad people for who they really are."</p>
<p>Fisher fans fear not, though – after we cut away from the coffin, bold text tells us that Sam Fisher is in the series, too, and is voiced by Hollywood actor, Liev Schreiber.</p>
<p>"And they'll never see you coming for them."</p>
<p>We then hear, then see, night-vision goggles powering up.</p>
<p>If you can't wait for more Fisher fun, don't forget that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/step-aside-netflix-splinter-cell-is-getting-a-bbc-radio-4-adaptation">BBC recently adapted the Splinter Cell series for radio</a>.

            <p>PlayStation's delisted shooter Concord reportedly cost £300m ($400m) to develop.</p>
<p>PlayStation podcast Sacred Symbols <a href="https://x.com/longislandviper/status/1837157796137030141">said</a> it spoke to someone "who worked on Concord" who revealed the development cycle was "so much worse than you think" and full of "toxic positivity", which meant critical feedback was ignored.</p>

<p>The podcast host also alleges that Concord was "internally referred to as 'The future of PlayStation' with Star Wars-like potential".</p>
<p>The "toxic positivity" claim has been further backed up by Kotaku.</p>

<p>"A sense the game would come together because the team was too good to fail."</p>
<p>The reporter could not, however, corroborate the $400m sum, <a href="https://x.com/ethangach/status/1837243116560212142">saying</a> it is "not the number I've heard".</p>
<p>Some developers familiar with PlayStation similarly <a href="https://x.com/TheCartelDel/status/1837181985380307055">dispute</a> the $400m figure. Others <a href="https://x.com/akaBORT/status/1837175727885586569">suggest</a> the sum likely includes the acquisition cost of buying Firewalk.</p>
<p>Concord was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">removed from sale</a> this month, just two weeks after its launch on PS5 and PC. Game director Ryan Ellis admitted that "while many qualities of the experience resonated with players, [the team] also recognise that other aspects of the game and our initial launch didn't land the way we'd intended."</p>
<p>Sony then issued refunds to all players.</p>
<p>Within days of Concord being pulled offline, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-director-reportedly-steps-down-as-studio-awaits-sony-decision-on-games-future">Ellis reportedly stepped down</a>, leaving the team at Firewalk Studios in limbo.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-xbox-rumors-intensify-ahead-of-tgs-2024/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>With the Tokyo Game Show 2024 scheduled for next week, the rumors of a Final Fantasy XVI Xbox announcement have already intensified.</p>
<p>Game Producer Naoki Yoshida had already <a href="https://wccftech.com/square-enix-producer-naoki-yoshida-reiterates-the-studios-committment-to-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reiterated</a> the company's commitment to Microsoft's platform following the release of Final Fantasy XIV. Now, two different insiders have claimed that Final Fantasy XVI, as well as the Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters, will be announced soon for Xbox.</p>
<p>The first one to do so <a href="https://x.com/ryanfrombronx/status/1837120881757171945?t=FIiYJyREktY9rykFyuEPyw&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was</a> the leaker previously known as Midori and now revealed to be 'Ryan from Bronx'. A few hours later, Windows Central's Jez Corden said in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd9zw7G6Yk4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest episode of the Xbox Two podcast</a>:</p>
<p><em>I'll just say that now, if you're expecting Final Fantasy VII to be announced at Tokyo Game Show, don't expect that this time around, but I think what you'll see is some Final Fantasy. I don't know exactly what, but you'll see some Final Fantasy, which will hint at a broader partnership. Maybe if you're lucky it'll be on Game Pass too.</em></p>
<p>We've known that the Final Fantasy VII Remake Xbox port would be harder to pull off for Microsoft, mostly because of tighter exclusivity deals signed by Square Enix with Sony. However, Final Fantasy XVI should be less problematic, and there's a good chance it will be announced soon for Microsoft's console following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dlss-3-to-boost-performance-in-god-of-war-ragnarok-final-fantasy-xvi-dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-and-enotria-the-last-song/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC launch from earlier this week</a>. It will be interesting to see how the game performs on Xbox Series S, though, given that FFXVI taxes heavily not only the PlayStation 5 hardware but also powerful PCs, as noted in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb-foBOBq1I&amp;t=1179s&amp;pp=ygUPZGlnaXRhbCBmb3VuZHJ5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry's analysis</a>.</p>
<p>As for the Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters, it is unlikely there were any actual exclusive deals, and the Xbox port was just a matter of when Square Enix would be willing to allocate the necessary resources.</p>
<p>Anyway, these announcements should take place during <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-tgs-2024-broadcast-will-be-worth-tuning-into-says-journalist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft's Xbox TGS 2024 broadcas</a>t, slated for Thursday, September 26.</p>

Now you can be just as obnoxious as they are.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197260" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Agatha All Along Star Sasheer Zamata On Witchcraft And Star Trek" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="348" data-playlist="197260,197209,196923" data-current="197260"><div><p>Agatha All Along Star Sasheer Zamata On Witchcraft And Star Trek</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22805.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Here’s what you need to know about Pest-Thread Spears and where to find it.<br></p><h2 id="h74883"><a id=""></a><strong>Pest-Thread Spears stats and features</strong></h2><p>Pest-Thread Spears takes 1 Memory Slot, costs 28 FP to cast, and requires 26 Faith to use.</p><p>This Incantation grants you the ability to fire out sticky strings to deal damage to enemies.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/kill-team-hivestorm-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Kill Team</em>&nbsp;Hivestorm is the launch box for the brand-new edition of <em>Kill Team</em>. The new version features some rules changes, but still ties in and links back to the previous version. In this article, we'll have a look at what's in the box, go through some of the changes, and look at anything else you will need to know to get started.</p>
<p><em>Kill Team</em> is a skirmish wargame, set in Games Workshop's larger <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> setting. As a skirmish game, <em>Kill Team</em> features a small number of elite troops, fighting special operations battles, rather than huge battles fought with entire armies. We've covered <em>Kill Team</em> in depth since the first edition, and you can read our <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/kill-team-guide" rel="noopener" target="_blank">guide to the previous edition of&nbsp;<em>Kill Team</em></a>, or check our Gallowdark coverage in <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/warhammer-400000-kill-team-into-dark-preview" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our Kill Team Into the Dark preview</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>What Does Kill Team Hivestorm Contain?</h2>
<p><em>Kill Team</em>&nbsp;Hivestorm contains:</p>
<ul><li><em>Kill Team</em> Core Book</li>
<li><em>Kill Team</em>&nbsp;Hivestorm Dossier</li>
<li>11x Tempestus Aquilon miniatures</li>
<li>11x Vespid Stingwing miniatures</li>
<li>A token set</li>
<li>Approved Ops card pack</li>
<li>10x D6 dice</li>
<li>1x game board and 14x pieces of Terrain for&nbsp;Killzone: Volkus</li>
<li>Kill Team Upgrade&nbsp;Equipment Pack containing 30x&nbsp;equipment miniatures and measuring tools</li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kill-team-hivestorm-5.jpg?itok=liDe1rYZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kill-team-hivestorm-5.jpg?itok=tJBl_uBx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>What Do I Need To Use The Kill Team Hivestorm Box?</h2>
<p><em>Kill Team</em>&nbsp;Hivestorm is a full starter set for the new edition of <em>Kill Team</em>, so it contains everything you need to play. It also only contains one Approved Ops card pack, so if you want to play using that with 2 players, you will need to pick up another pack.</p>
<p>Missing from this edition, which was included in the last season of <em>Kill Team</em>, are the cards for the included kill teams, but Games Workshop has suggested that alongside each pack release, the datacards will also be available for a short time, so we may see those (and the cards for all the previous released kill teams) release with Hivestorm.</p>
<p><em>Kill Team</em> Hivestorm does include the rules for using the previous 2 seasons of <em>Kill Team's</em> scenery, so if you want to have the fully available experience, you can add it</p>
<ul><li>Killzone:<i>&nbsp;</i>Gallowdark scenery box</li>
<li>Killzone: Bheta-Decima scenery box</li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kill-team-hivestorm-3.jpg?itok=UM3z5dG7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kill-team-hivestorm-3.jpg?itok=4duQhPCe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>What Rules Have Changed In Kill Team Hivestorm?</h2>
<p>The latest version of <i>Kill Team</i> uses many of the same rules as <em>Kill Team</em> 21, with a few changes.</p>
<ul><li>The movement symbols have gone, it's just movement in inches now</li>
<li>The Group Activation and the Defence stat have gone, players now roll 3 defense dice when shot and try to score equal to or over their save stat with each dice</li>
<li>Counteract has now been added, so if you run out of operatives to activate and your opponent can still activate, when you would normally activate, you can perform a 1AP action with an operative that has already been used that turn (each operative can only counteract once)</li>
<li>A solo/cooperative horde mode, Joint Ops, has been added</li>
<li>But the narrative Spec Ops missions appeared to have dropped away</li>
<li>It also looks like the set 20 operative roster is gone, and you simply pick your fighters each game using the selection rules for your kill team</li>
</ul><h2>What Kill Teams Do You Get In Kill Team Hivestorm?</h2>
<p><em>Kill Team</em> Hivestorm, as standard with <em>Kill Team</em> boxes, includes 2 brand new kill teams, the&nbsp;Astra Militarum Tempestus Aquilon kill team and the&nbsp;Tau Empire Vespid Stingwing kill team.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kill-team-hivestorm-4.jpg?itok=o4UN4tmW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kill-team-hivestorm-4.jpg?itok=xoNx1Cio 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h4>Astra Militarum&nbsp;Tempestus Aquilon</h4>
<p>The Tempestus Aquilon are elite Astra Militarum (or Imperial Guard) operatives that can deploy a portion of their numbers from above during the game. They can bring their leader plus 9 other operatives, including the awesome Aquilon Servo-Sentry, which moves slower than the other operatives (4 inches as opposed to the Aquilon's operatives 6), but it can fire twice with a choice from its arsenal of 3 weapons. The other operatives deploy with hot-shot weapons (pistols and carbines) and the Astra Militarum's usual love for heavy weapons.</p>
<p>When deploying, you have to set up at least a third of your force in your dropzone (the rest can deploy to special drop markers later in the game), but if you use your standard troopers (of which you will have 3) in your drop zone, they have a strategic gambit that lets them all take a free Reposition (new action name for a standard move) action but can't push more than 3 inches away from your drop zone. This means that your entire kill team is going to be putting pressure on your opponent and advancing towards them, or deploying from the sky in subsequent turns.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kill-team-hivestorm-6.jpg?itok=9JBFz4gS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kill-team-hivestorm-6.jpg?itok=j_bx-nFd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h4>Tau Empire&nbsp;Vespid Stingwing</h4>
<p>The Vespid are an alien race that joined the Tau Empire, and now have access to their equipment and weaponry, which combines with their ariel mobility to create dangerous warriors. All of the Stingwings have fly, which means that terrain has no effect on their movement and they can freely move up and down levels when they move. Their mobility also links to their neutron weapons, which gain Piercing 1 when they move. As an aggressive alien race, they tend to shoot and charge the nearest enemy, unless you spend Communion Points (which you have D3 of to use each turn) to override this and allow you to choose their targets.</p>
<p>The Stingwings can take 10 operatives, including their leader and the Oversight Drone. The basic Vespid Warrior comes armed with a Neutron Blaster, which has Devastating 2. Devasting immediately inflicts its listed value in damage to an enemy operative for each critical hit that's retained in combat, allowing you to really ramp up the damage on enemies</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kill-team-hivestorm-2.jpg?itok=TA-QJqLJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kill-team-hivestorm-2.jpg?itok=6p1GeHjV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>What Are Our Final Thoughts On Kill Team Hivestorm?</h2>
<p>I really like the changes to the rules and the changes to the rulebook itself. It all feels like a really nice flow now. The counteract rules are great and really help when running low model count elite teams, and also if you get trounced in your first few turns, it doesn't feel quite so oppressive as it did. The way <em>Kill Team</em> now handles products is a welcome change. The difference between essentials and enhancements being really clear is great for new players (we've been calling the key products <em>Kill Team</em> Essentials since our <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/warhammer-40k-kill-team-guide">first guide in 2018</a>). The solo/co-op horde mode is welcome, but it looks like it's at the expense of the narrative play, which is a shame. I'd also like to see the included kill team datacards in the boxes like they were last year for <em>Kill Team</em>. Having to pick them up separately seems odd.</p>
<p>The way that the previous scenery sets are drawn in works well, and keeps the previous seasons of <em>Kill Team</em> relevant, making this new edition not feel like an oppressive change that makes the previous product redundant.</p>
<p>The 2 new kill teams in Hivestorm are a lot of fun. I can see myself playing the Tempestus Aquilon for a while. Their drop deployment shenanigans are really rewarding when you get it right, and the mobile Stingwings are the perfect opponent for them. It's also great to see <em>Kill Team</em> back in multi-level ruins. I love the amazing corridors of the Gallowdark, but for me,&nbsp;<em>Kill Team</em> is at its best in 3D terrain.</p>
<h2>Should I Buy Kill Team Hivestorm?</h2>
<p>The <em>Kill Team</em> core book will be available separately, so if you just want to jump into <em>Kill Team</em> with your old teams, then you can pick that up and get going, but if you want the new kill teams, Killzone, and all the extras like the new equipment and Approved Ops card pack, then Hivestorm will be your most cost-effective way in.&nbsp; Both new kill teams are awesome and the new Killzone suits them perfectly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>TwitchCon is unfolding in San Diego as we speak, and as usual, the platform’s leadership team took to the stage to discuss the evolutions occurring on the site. In a segment speaking about the future of the platform, Twitch’s Dan Clancy revealed what’s coming next, including boosted broadcast resolutions, transparent enforcement, and mobile app improvements.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-everything-revealed-at-twitchcon-san-diego">Everything Revealed at TwitchCon San Diego</h2>



<p><a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2024/09/20/everything-we-announced-at-twitchcon-san-diego/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Twitch team revealed</a> that violations will be made more transparent going forward, with users getting more information about strikes and enforcement action. It’ll begin with chat-based infractions, with Twitch providing snippets of comments that led to enforcement action being taken against a user.</p>



<p>Also, strikes will be made temporary going forward. Depending on the severity of the strike in question, it’ll expire after a certain period, per the latest update. This means that strikes won’t last forever against an account, as they do now.</p>



<p>In terms of broadcasting boosts, Twitch will start offering ‘Enhanced Broadcasting’ that’ll allow streamers to put out their content in a 1440p resolution. This will be deployed region-by-region over the next year. </p>



<p>Streamers will also be able to broadcast both horizontally <strong>and </strong>vertically in the coming months.</p>



<p>On the topic of streaming changes, Twitch is making things more collaborative, launching ‘Shared Chat’ as a way of fusing communities. When streamers kickstart the ‘Stream Together’ mechanic, their respective chats will be linked, working together as one.</p>



<p>As 70% of new viewers come to Twitch via the mobile app, the team is constantly working to improve the functionality of the platform.</p>



<p>With other improvements being made to the Creator Clubs and Guild features, Twitch is evolving in the right direction, but there’s still plenty of work to do if the platform wants to become profitable and consistent.</p>

<p>Ironmouse is suffering at the hands of YouTube following an untimely and unexpected channel shutdown. It was revealed just hours ago that the globally renowned VTuber had been hit by a takedown that has brought years’ worth of videos offline. Ironmouse explained on Twitter that she is embroiled in a legal battle with the video-sharing and streaming platform.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-out-of-nowhere">Out of Nowhere</h2>



<p>Following a string of copyright strikes, Ironmouse’s main VOD channel was taken down by YouTube. This was <strong>somewhat </strong>on the table for Ironmouse, who had referenced a potential shutdown before the channel was taken offline. She said on stream:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s going to get deleted because I don’t want to dispute it because I don’t want to submit my personal information to whoever it is.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Per the regulations of the platform, Ironmouse’s <strong>main channel </strong>was closed down because it was <strong>affiliated </strong>with the VOD channel that was previously taken offline on September 9. The rule states that users cannot circumvent a ban or a profile termination by uploading content elsewhere, hence the closure of the main channel.</p>



<p>On Twitter, <a href="https://x.com/ironmouse/status/1837260536792174962">Ironmouse stressed</a> that she is working with a legal team to straighten out the situation, but YouTube’s rules are pretty cut-and-dry. By way of a response, Ironmouse’s community took to social media to slam YouTube.</p>



<p>Last year, Ironmouse became the first VTuber to win Content Creator of the Year at The Game Awards, and she has been on an upward trajectory ever since. </p>

Like Fanatical's other build-your-own bundle deals, the Diamond Collection has a sliding price scale based on how many games you add to your bundle, but the price per game decreases the more you add. The bundle starts at three games for $15 ($5 per key), then goes up to five games for $23 ($4.60 per key), and seven or more games for $31.50 ($4.50). There's no limit on how many games you can add to your bundle, so can even grab the full 22-game selection for just $100.</p><p>As for the games on offer, one of the best deals is The Action, Strategy, and RPG Triple-Pack, which includes three games in a single pack: cyberpunk action RPG The Ascent, roguelike RPG For the King, and top-down horde shooter From Space.</p><p>Another highlight on the list is Starship Troopers: Terran Command, which turns the alien-blasting premise of the movie and books into a real-time strategy game where you command soldiers against hordes of arachnid threats. Wasteland 3 is another good game, as this party- and turn-based strategy combat adventure is set in a post-apocalyptic world that dynamically reacts to your decisions. It's a good-looking game with a fascinating narrative and deep gameplay systems that you can lose yourself in for hours. Those are just a few of the many other games available in Fanatical's Diamond Collection.

The companies accused Pocketpair, the studio behind the overnight “<em>Pokémon</em> with guns” sensation, of patent infringement.

Pocketpair responded the next day. “At this moment, we are unaware of the specific patents we are accused of infringing upon, and we have not been notified of such details,” it wrote. “It is truly unfortunate that we will be forced to allocate significant time to matters unrelated to game development due to this lawsuit.”</p><p>It <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/serkantoto/status/1837070775427420411&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/serkantoto/status/1837070775427420411" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">could be weeks</a></span> before the exact allegations of patent infringement are outlined by Nintendo in subsequent filings, but in the meantime, new reporting and analysis has started to shed some light on what the company’s main line of legal attack might be, and why it’s decided to go after Pocketpair in the first place. While the early online controversy around <em>Palworld</em>’s similarity to<em> Pokémon</em> had to do with its creature designs, the lawsuit that Nintendo has filed eight months later is about what players actually do in the game. </p><p>One of those things is throwing a spherical object at fantastical creatures to capture them and store them inside. Nintendo has a patent for a version of that mechanic, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamefile.news/p/flappy-bird-foundation-dong-nguyen-trademark&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/flappy-bird-foundation-dong-nguyen-trademark" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as recently reported by <em>Game File</em></a></span>. Delving into the details, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/news/453508/pokemon-palworld-lawsuit-patent-infringement&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/news/453508/pokemon-palworld-lawsuit-patent-infringement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Polygon</em> broke out the precise language</a></span> of what that patent, which was filed in 2021 and approved just last year, specifically covers:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p><em>In a first mode, an aiming direction in a virtual space is determined based on a second operation input, and a player character is caused to launch, in the aiming direction, an item that affects a field character disposed on a field in the virtual space, based on a third operation input. In a second mode, the aiming direction is determined, based on the second operation input, and the player character is caused to launch, in the aiming direction, a fighting character that fights based on the third operation input.</em></p></blockquote><p>As you can see, it’s not merely throwing one thing at another thing to capture it inside, but a specific sequence of events based on particular inputs. We still don’t know if this is one of the actual patents involved in Nintendo’s lawsuit, or what a court will decide if it is. (The case was filed in Japan.) But if it is, the timing could narrowly work out in the Mario maker’s favor. Why was the patent so recent given that Pokémon has been around for decades? Probably because it wasn’t until 2022's <em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</em> that a game actually contained players capturing Pokémon with Pokéballs in 3D spaces like this. </p><p>Japanese patent attorney Kiyoshi Kurihara recently told <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://news.yahoo.co.jp/expert/articles/59f880c5e13b9292f0e3ab2d1d55ce8bdbfdb97f&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://news.yahoo.co.jp/expert/articles/59f880c5e13b9292f0e3ab2d1d55ce8bdbfdb97f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Yahoo Japan</em></a></span>, according to a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://automaton-media.com/en/news/whats-the-killer-patent-nintendo-is-suing-palworld-for-japanese-patent-attorney-offers-in-depth-analysis/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/whats-the-killer-patent-nintendo-is-suing-palworld-for-japanese-patent-attorney-offers-in-depth-analysis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">translation by<em> Automaton West</em></a></span>, that Nintendo and The Pokémon Company filed subsequent “divisional” patents based on the above one earlier this year and asked for the review to be accelerated, with approval on one of them coming just last month. Kurihara suggested this may have been part of a strategy to button up its patent language ahead of pursuing legal action against Pocketpair for infringement. </p><p>This isn’t the first time Nintendo has gone after another Japanese video game company for patent infringement. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.shacknews.com/article/102763/nintendo-files-40-million-lawsuit-against-mobile-developer-colopl#:~:text=Modojo%20%40%20Shacknews-,Nintendo%20Files%20%2440%20Million%20Lawsuit%20Against%20Mobile%20Developer%20Colopl,a%20number%20of%20company%20patents.&amp;text=Those%20who%20follow%20game%20news,itself%20into%20various%20legal%20suits.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.shacknews.com/article/102763/nintendo-files-40-million-lawsuit-against-mobile-developer-colopl#:~:text=Modojo%20%40%20Shacknews-,Nintendo%20Files%20%2440%20Million%20Lawsuit%20Against%20Mobile%20Developer%20Colopl,a%20number%20of%20company%20patents.&amp;text=Those%20who%20follow%20game%20news,itself%20into%20various%20legal%20suits." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Back in 2017</a></span>, it went after mobile studio Colopl for its Japanese smartphone game <em>White Cat Project </em>for alleged patent violations related to “special technology used to operate a joystick over a touch panel.” The two sides eventually<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.siliconera.com/white-cat-project-developers-to-pay-nintendo-3-3-billion-yen/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.siliconera.com/white-cat-project-developers-to-pay-nintendo-3-3-billion-yen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> reached a settlement</a></span>, with Colopl paying Nintendo roughly $20 million. Industry analyst Serkan Toto, who leads the consulting firm Kantan Games, pointed to this example in an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.404media.co/cold-blooded-business-nintendo-is-patent-trolling-palworld-because-it-got-too-big/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.404media.co/cold-blooded-business-nintendo-is-patent-trolling-palworld-because-it-got-too-big/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interview this week with <em>404 Media</em></a></span>.</p><p>  “So first of all this lawsuit is filed under Japanese law, so it has nothing to do with the U.S., nothing to do with the UK or EU law at all,” he said. “And second point is that I think that Nintendo took its time to really build the case, map everything out, including counter arguments that the other side might bring up in a lawsuit, and how to counter them and make absolutely sure that they think they will win before filing the lawsuit.”<br></p><p>Toto painted a somewhat dire picture of Pocketpair’s likely chances of prevailing against Nintendo given its track record, and suggested that the timing of the lawsuit might be connected to Tokyo Game Show. Pocketpair was expected to announce a PlayStation 5 version of <em>Palworld</em> there months after partnering with Sony on a joint venture to expand the IP and merchandize it. Sony has declined to comment on the lawsuit so far. </p><p>“You can bet your life that Nintendo hates this company, and they couldn’t find an angle with the character designs,” Toto said. “This is why they are not mentioned in their press release. So they come with these technical peculiarities.” He added that he thinks the goal is to hurt Pocketpair financially. It’s unclear exactly how much the game has made so far, but it had already reached<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1752753619429163190?lang=en&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1752753619429163190?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> 19 million players</a></span> shortly after coming out, including through Game Pass as part of a deal with Microsoft. </p><div><p>We’ll see what eventually comes out once Nintendo makes its case against Pocketpair public. In the meantime, the company is keeping its cards close to its vest. “We filed the lawsuit at this timing after careful investigation of the content that is the subject of this lawsuit,” it said in a statement. “We will refrain from commenting on topics that relate to the content of the lawsuit.”</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/what-the-heck-has-been-going-on-at-annapurna-interactive-an-investigation<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Last week, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-12/annapurna-video-game-team-resigns-leaving-partners-scrambling" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg reported</a> that 25 people comprising the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/annapurnas-entire-gaming-team-has-resigned">entire staff of Annapurna Interactive</a> walked out the door in a group resignation. But while some of the circumstances around their departure emerged in the reporting, one pressing question was left unanswered: why?</p><p>Having spoken to multiple individuals close to the situation who requested anonymity due to fear of reprisal, as well as an Annapurna spokesperson, IGN has pieced together a somewhat complex answer. Disagreements over the direction of the Interactive division, chaotic departures, communication breakdowns, and a perceived lack of leadership transparency at Annapurna Interactive led to a staff walk-out that has left 25 individuals jobless, Annapurna leaders scrambling, and numerous developers concerned about their contracts with the publisher.</p><h2>A Company Divided</h2><p>Though the collapse of Annapurna Interactive as we once knew it started earlier this year, its roots lie in the company's historical leadership structure. Annapurna Interactive was initially conceived as the gaming division of Annapurna Pictures, which was founded by film producer and billionaire Megan Ellison in 2011. Annapurna Interactive itself was spun up in 2016, tapping a staff of industry veterans including including former Sony creative director Nathan Gary, former Sony executive producer Deborah Mars, and former Sony producer Hector Sanchez for leadership roles. Sanchez left the company in 2019, and former Capybara Games co-founder Nathan Vella was brought on that same year.</p><p>The film side of Annapurna's business has undergone well-publicized struggles. In 2018, it was <a href="https://variety.com/2018/film/news/annapurna-larry-ellison-megan-ellison-vice-1202975648/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bleeding enough money</a> to prompt Ellison's father, multi-billionaire Larry Ellison, to step in. By 2019, Annapurna Pictures was reportedly <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2019-08-07/annapurna-pictures-explores-bankruptcy-in-a-major-potential-blow-to-indie-film" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">teetering on bankruptcy</a>, and in the ensuing years its film and TV output slowed significantly. Variety reports that Ellison <a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/megan-ellison-annapurna-scott-rudin-temper-1234951651/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">disappeared from public life in 2019 almost entirely</a>, leaving her business to largely run itself during the height of the pandemic. She reemerged in 2021, only to name Gary president over all of Annapurna, with Mars and Vella stepping into co-head roles at the Interactive division.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>In the ensuing years, Annapurna Interactive continued to grow, releasing financial and critical successes such as Stray, Outer Wilds, What Remains of Edith Finch, and Cocoon. While the company claims the Annapurna Pictures side of the business hasn't struggled in recent years, saying that film and TV were more profitable than Annapurna Interactive in 2023, a spokesperson alleged to IGN that Gary was a less-than-ideal steward of Annapurna Pictures. Under his guidance, they claim, resources were pulled away from film and TV, key executives were pushed out, and the company was largely refocused on gaming. Annapurna tells IGN that Gary also elevated co-founder James Masi to chief administrative officer, a role the spokesperson suggested was unnnecessary at a company of Annapurna's size. Notably, Annapurna did launch an animation division under Gary's tenure that released the critically-acclaimed film Nimona just last year, though an Annapurna spokesperson reached out to IGN post-publication with the assertion that it was Ellison who brought in Nimona as the foundation for what would become the animation division. IGN has reached out to Gary, but he declined to comment.</p><p>IGN understands that opinions of Ellison within Annapurna Interactive prior to 2024 varied from indifference to latent mistrust given <a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/megan-ellison-annapurna-scott-rudin-temper-1234951651/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">previous reports on her behavior toward employees</a>. Anonymous sources I spoke to all cited a strong fear of reprisal from Ellison in particular, given her resources, history, and reach. A few people referenced creative or compensation disagreements during their time at Annapurna that contributed to a general feeling Ellison would not keep promises. Multiple sources we spoke to described Ellison as a largely hands-off leader and rarely present in the gaming division, an attitude that for years suited many of Annapurna Interactive's employees just fine.</p><h2>Ad-Verset effects</h2><p>This was the state of things at the start of 2024 according to our sources. Prior to March of this year, work at Annapurna Interactive was business-as-usual, they say, until employees were suddenly informed mid-month that James Masi had been unexpectedly let go. An Annapurna spokesperson confirmed Masi was made redundant, saying that Ellison had <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/megan-ellison-second-coming-nimona-1235842667/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chosen to step back in</a> at the company and oversee the Annapurna Pictures side again in an effort to re-invest in the film and TV side of the business. As a part of this, Annapurna claims that Ellison reinstalled Gary as head of Interactive, and deemed Masi's role unnnecessary.</p><p>However, at this time, Gary also left the company. Annapurna claims he left of his own accord in response to Masi's firing and his change in role. But sources say employees were told in the following days by leadership within Annapurna Interactive that Gary had been fired along with Masi. The belief that two of their leaders had been fired seemingly out of the blue sparked confusion and fury, and a handful of individuals quit in protest, including at least one other Interactive leader.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The sudden resignation of multiple key individuals came as a shock to the company, and IGN understands that Ellison held a video call with Annapurna employees to discuss what had happened and find a way to move forward. On the call, Ellison allegedly expressed a desire to keep the entire group, including those who had been fired or resigned, together. In the following days, all the departed staff returned, including Gary and Masi, and discussions began for a potential spin-off of the company that would allow Gary and Ellison to achieve their respective visions with minimal disruptions to partner developers.</p><p>Roughly, the plan was for Gary and the Annapurna Interactive staff to become a new company called Verset, with ownership split between Annapurna and Verset's leaders. Verset would oversee all currently existing signed Annapurna Interactive projects, with revenue split between itself and Annapurna proper in Annapurna's favor. It would also be free to sign its own, independent deals. Developers IGN spoke to report being made aware the spin-off was happening in the following months, and were reassured their contracts would be fulfilled.</p><p>While employees understood such a venture would take time to get off the ground, in the ensuing months a number of events occurred that made some skeptical of Ellison's commitment to parting with Annapurna Interactive. In early summer, sources tell us that employees discovered Hector Sanchez had been quietly rehired back at Annapurna by Ellison and was working on gaming projects without the knowledge of the rest of the Interactive staff. The news wasn't made official until August that Sanchez had been appointed president of interactive and new media at Annapurna — a title that seemed to some as potentially at odds with Vella and Mars' roles at Interactive.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Annapurna, for its part, claims that talks between Ellison and Sanchez began as far back as February for Ellison to fund a new venture Sanchez was planning <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hectorsanchez_after-5-eventful-years-ive-reached-the-activity-7160635971250589696-MDwF/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">after departing Epic Games</a>. As talks continued, Annapurna says Sanchez began negotiating with Remedy Entertainment for a deal related to film and TV spin-offs of its properties. However, when spin-off negotiations began to crystalize at Annapurna Interactive, Ellison offered Sanchez a position at Annapurna. The intent, per the spokesperson, was for Verset to become the company's indie arm, and for Sanchez to lead efforts in the AAA and AA-gaming space, including transmedia properties.</p><p>Which is how, months later, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/control-and-alan-wake-tv-and-movies-on-the-way-thanks-to-new-annapurna-partnership">Annapurna announced it was partnering with Remedy Entertainment</a> on film, TV, and other projects including funding support for Control 2. The press release, which IGN received, referenced both Sanchez and Ellison. But it doesn't reference Annapurna Interactive at all, and IGN understands Annapurna Interactive employees were only informed the deal was happening that morning. Employees, unaware of Ellison's plans or the status of the spin-off, were confused, concerned, and frustrated about the direction of the company and the future of its Interactive division, Verset or no Verset.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>While all this was going on, sources say that discussions with Ellison regarding the spin-off appeared to have stalled out, and in August Annapurna officially terminated discussion. Annapurna claims this was due to Gary's lack of response to requests for feedback on legal drafts, and in a statement sent to IGN after publication, doubled down. "Any implication Annapurna was backtracking on the deal is false. We agreed to high-level deal terms and signed a term sheet in early April, which makes it all the more surprising that we never got a response."</p><p>Meanwhile, multiple people told IGN that in those final months, they began to see signs of Ellison exercising greater involvement over Annapurna Interactive's deals, projects, and budgets in a way that began to make them further uncomfortable with the direction the company was taking overall.</p><p>All of this came to a head at the end of August when all 25 Annapurna Interactive employees including Gary, Vella, Masi, and Mars signed a joint resignation letter. The group gave two weeks notice and departed the company together on September 6 leaving Ellison, Sanchez, and newly-hired chief strategy officer Paul Doyle working on a semblance of Annapurna's gaming efforts. Sources tell IGN that up to the letter being sent and after, the group asked Ellison to work with them on other possible solutions such as the aforementioned spin-off, but did not receive any interest.</p><p>IGN also understands that despite the two-week notice, partner developers did not learn about the sudden exodus of all their Annapurna contacts until a day or two before it occurred. Annapurna claims they didn't have enough time to collect developer contact information to alert them sooner, while Annapurna Interactive sources say they received no guidance from the company during that period as to who should tell developers, when, and how. An Annapurna spokesperson reached out post-publication to IGN to deny this, claiming it had active and open conversations with the Interactive staff on how to communicate the news.</p><h2>Annapurna Aftermath</h2><p>While IGN couldn't glean any details on the future of the 25 departed employees, there are some indications that the group is collectively working on some new venture together. A <a href="https://verset.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website for Verset</a> appears to be online at the time of publication with a PR alias, which IGN reached out to for comment. IGN was also unable to find any posts or other discussions from the departed members indicating they were looking for employment elsewhere. Whatever their future plans, IGN understands that the group did not have a ready-made venture waiting when they left, as some have speculated. If they build anything new, it will be largely from scratch.</p><p>Meanwhile, at Annapurna itself, efforts are underway to right the ship. Multiple developers I spoke to expressed a mixture of frustration and confusion at the sudden departure, but several told me they felt confident in Sanchez's ability to honor existing obligations. Several individuals with projects at different stages of development told me about meetings they'd had with Sanchez in the wake of the event that they reported had reassured them. Sanchez has previously stated his intention both to backfill roles as well as work with outside agencies to fulfill Annapurna's contractual obligations, and IGN has confirmed this process is ongoing. Earlier this week, Annapurna also posted an <a href="https://annapurnainteractive.com/en/jobs/publishing-team" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open role for a QA Manager</a> overseeing "multiple external QA teams."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The unusual situation appears to have impacted a few specific projects in unique ways. On August 30, iam8bit <a href="https://x.com/iam8bit/status/1829618620776734871" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shared an announcement</a> that an upcoming PlayStation 5 physical edition of Outer Wilds: Archaeologist Edition had suffered from a manufacturing error, and did not include the Echoes of the Eye expansion as expected. Annapurna Interactive at the time said it would "continue to investigate", while iam8bit offered either a digital DLC voucher to impacted customers, or a replacement corrected physical copy. Both Annapurna and Interactive sources have told IGN that this issue is unrelated to the resignations, and Annapurna reassured that it will not be impacted by the upheaval at the company.</p><p>Then there's Blade Runner. Last summer, Annapurna Interactive announced it would be developing its first in-house game, based on the Blade Runner franchise, titled Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth. However, game director Chelsea Hash appears to be one of the 25 individuals who resigned, per LinkedIn, and IGN understands that all other full-time members of the development team joined her. Annapurna has told IGN that development on Blade Runner 2033 will continue despite the departure of its entire team.</p><p>An Annapurna spokesperson also shared the following statement when asked for further comment:</p><p>"The whole situation is a baffler, but now we're focused on moving forward. We've had really great conversations with an overwhelming majority of our existing development teams and are grateful for their partnership. If our inbox is any indication, a ton of developers continue to want to be a part of what we're building, and we look forward to seeing their pitches. We've also had an influx of quality job applicants and are excited to build a team passionate about our mission to tell original stories that aren't being told elsewhere. P.S. We're hiring."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The whole situation is a baffler.</p></div><p>Annapurna has splintered into two groups, both of which are now working to pick up the pieces. The remains of Annapurna Interactive (or perhaps a future Verset) consist of 25 individuals who felt strongly enough about perceived mismanagement, poor communication, apparent spontaneous layoffs of leaders, and one another that they were willing to give up paychecks and stability at a time of overwhelming industry job and funding uncertainty. When IGN approached its sources close to this group about Annapurna's version of events (specifically, the conflicting information around Masi and Gary's alleged resignation/firing and the collapse of spin-off discussions), they reacted with skepticism, but did not feel they could safely provide more specific details.</p><p>Meanwhile, at Annapurna, a tiny leadership team is struggling to ensure that around 40 projects have the support they need, while the company's partners have been left at various stages of development and uncertainty as to what comes next.</p><p>Annapurna Interactive as we once knew it — a beloved publisher of critically-acclaimed, unique, beloved indie games — is no more. What, if anything, will rise to take its place?</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. Got a story tip?

The upcoming set is based on the iconic <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.target.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F81938%2F2092%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fmega-fallout-red-rocket%2F-%2FA-92357170&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fnew-fallout-mega-set-based-on-the-iconic-red-rocket-gas-station-up-for-preorder%2F1100-6526618%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f%26utm_source%3Dgamefaqs%26utm_medium%3Dpartner%26utm_content%3Dnews_module%26utm_campaign%3Dhomepage&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Red Rocket truck stops</a> seen dotting the ruined landscapes of the video games and TV series, and comes with a Vault Dweller figure, T-60 Power Armor suit, and everyone's favorite wasteland companion, Dog Meat. Mega's Fallout Red Rocket set will cost $80 and launches November 10. Preorders are available now at Target.</p><h2>Preorder Mega Fallout Red Rocket set</h2><p><strong>$80</strong></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4370433-redrocketthumb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4370433" data-ratio="0.56328125" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4370433-redrocketthumb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4370433"></a><figcaption>Mega Fallout Red Rocket Truck Stop set.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4370433-redrocketthumb.jpg"></figure><p>This 824-piece kit packs a ton of detail and numerous fun references Fallout fans will enjoy. Those include a Nuka Cola vending machine stocked with Nuka Cola bottles, a Vault-Tec bobblehead, and a laser rifle. The designs of the Vault Dweller and Dog Meat figures are also based on the appearances of the characters from various Fallout video games. The interior of the set is modular, making it easy to access, and you can deck it out with a few additional elements like wall hangings, a power armor repair station, and a work bench--just like in Fallout 4.</p><p>The Red Rocket truck stop is the second official Fallout set from Mega. The first was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-power-armor-collection-mega-bloks-set-is-up-for-preorder-and-its-super-affordable/1100-6525581/" data-ref-id="1100-6525581">a set of five Power Armor suits</a> that launched August and quickly sold out at Amazon, so we recommend preorder the Red Rocket truck stop soon if you're interested since it's also likely to sell out fast.</p><p>Target has some more options if you're looking for Fallout collectibles, including figurines of the Amazon series' three protagonists--Lucy, Maximus, and the Ghoul. Those are also available for preorder and release on November 3.
