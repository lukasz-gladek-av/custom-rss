            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/visions-of-mana-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix has revealed the&nbsp;<em>Visions of Mana&nbsp;</em>release date, and the latest adventure in the long-running&nbsp;<em>Mana&nbsp;</em>series is coming pretty soon.</p>
<p>Per a new release date trailer,&nbsp;<em>Visions of Mana&nbsp;</em>launches across PC and consoles on August 29th, which means this is the longest&nbsp;<em>Mana&nbsp;</em>series fans have ever had to wait for a new mainline installment.</p>
<p>Prior to&nbsp;<em>Visions</em>, several <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/square-enix-will-shut-down-echoes-of-mana-mobile-game-year-after-release">mobile games</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/square-enix-files-trademark-for-collection-of-mana-in-europe">collections</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/trials-of-mana-remake-gets-april-release-date">remakes</a> of prior&nbsp;<em>Mana&nbsp;</em>games were released, but this is the first fully new&nbsp;<em>Mana&nbsp;</em>game to be released in 18 years.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/visions-of-mana-release-date-combat.jpg?itok=ZkPtZAIi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/visions-of-mana-release-date-combat.jpg?itok=pnBkCjsh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Visions of Mana&nbsp;</em>is the first new mainline&nbsp;<em>Mana&nbsp;</em>game in 18 years.</figcaption></figure><p>The new launch trailer sets up the story for&nbsp;<em>Visions of Mana</em>, shows off some of the combat, and also introduces us to the game's five playable characters.</p>
<p>Protagonist Val's childhood friend Hinna is chosen to be an Alm, a person who must give their soul to the Mana Tree in order to "rejuvenate the flow of mana power", per the Steam page.</p>
<p>She seems to be harboring doubts, however; she expresses a desire to remain and "keep making memories" with Val, so it looks like we're dancing the&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy X&nbsp;</em>foxtrot again.</p>
<p>Other playable characters include Oracle of Wind Careena, Radiant Sword Morley, Queen of the Deep Palamena, and Woodland Custodian Julei, and you'll be able to build a three-person party based on the combination you prefer.</p>

<p>Each character will bring their own combat style, and you'll need to experiment in order to discover which characters work best for certain enemies and boss encounters. Hinna, however, won't be playable; she'll play a sideline support role, <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/visions-of-mana-closer-look">per Square Enix</a>.</p>
<p>If you know&nbsp;<em>Mana&nbsp;</em>well, you'll be pleased to know that the iconic Ring Menu is making a return, and you'll need to assign moves to it if you want to use them in combat.</p>
<p>There's also a class system that allows you to access powerful elemental attacks, healing spells, and battle-altering buffs and debuffs, so finding the right class for each character is paramount.</p>
<p><em>Visions of Mana&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2490990/Visions_of_Mana/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10008215/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/pre-order-visions-of-mana/9PCV22TJT44T/0017" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on August 29th.

<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/disco-samurai">Disco Samurai</a> is a game that’s so difficult I’d have given up playing sooner if it didn’t contain so many of my absolute favourite <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action game</a> things. Tense, decisive duels. Violence that’s both brutal and a little silly. Scalpel-sharp parry n' strike back-and-forths. Short stages that dole out chunky progression hits of dopamine, as quickly as they wrest those hits away from you with another humbling beatdown. Perhaps most importantly, it aims to do one thing - rhythm combat - and does it brilliantly. It's got teeth, but it's also got <em>groove</em>.</p>

<p>In the time it takes you to read this, you could grab the Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2576410/Disco_Samurai/">demo</a>, and become about 4% better at the game. You’ll need that 4%.</p>
<p>Unlike other rhythm combat games I’ve played, slashing off-beat doesn’t reduce your score here. Instead, you just won’t attack. The music itself is crunchy 4/4 techno, so nothing too hard to wrap your head around. (Why not disco? you ask. It takes place in a town <em>called</em> Disco, I respond, just as perplexed.) Parrying works the same way. Only on-beat deflections are successful, though you’ll know when one is coming due to an indicator. Each foe has a stamina meter, and they’ll enter a cartoony star-headed stun state once you whittle it down with parries, slashes, and some other moves I’ll get to in a sec.</p>

<p>If you don’t want to dent your lovely katana though, you can just dash. Again, only on the beat. We chop off left feet ‘round these parts. I’m not entirely sure why you <em>would</em> dodge, since it doesn’t affect your foe’s stamina meter, but maybe it comes into play more later. As you perform hits, dodges, and parries, you’ll gradually build up a flow meter. What happens when you build enough? A gun. A gun happens. You get about four shots per full meter with the default pistol, so this is less of a super move and more something you can weave in to your repertoire. If you want to spend a bigger chunk of flow, you can kick. Vases and other environmental objects make lovely smashing sounds, and also do big damage. Love a good 'big sound, big damage' combo, me.</p>
<p>You’ll die <em>very</em> quickly if you start making mistakes, especially as whiffing moves seems to embolden the besuited bastards trying to kill you into attacking harder. But you will get your health back after each short, single-room stage. Much of the time, those deaths will come from overhead attacks. These are entirely unfair (read: I’m bad at them) slashes that you’ll have to hold the parry for exactly one beat to block. It’s the weaving of these attacks into regular attack patterns that keeps your foes both deadly and satisfying to overcome. After all, you only ever feel as super a sword bastard as the sword bastards you’re making look foolish, as my favourite bible verse goes.</p>
<p>I’ve had issues with feeling overly restricted with rhythm combat in the past. I bounced off <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-hellsinger">Metal: Hellsinger</a> for this reason, but I’m not getting that with Disco Samurai. A better critic than me once observed that a great joy of games is the feeling of performing a role well - acting out stealth so good it befits Solid Snake, or ripping and tearing without hesitation, just as the real Doom Guy would after he gets off his shift at Argos. That’s the deal here, I think. You don’t have much leeway for self-expression, but the rhythm and danger coaxes you into some deeply engaging choreography. Sometimes, life is too much samurai, not enough disco, but I reckon this one has the balance down pat.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/visions-of-mana-summer-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Visions of Mana</a>, the next entry in Square Enix's popular action role-playing game series, is launching in a little over two months on PC and consoles.</p>
<p>A new trailer shared today, which provides a new look at the game's world, characters, and action-based combat system, confirmed an August 29th release date on PC via Steam and Windows Store, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>
<p><iframe title="Visions of Mana | Launch Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Io4_CfCLlW4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Visions of Mana will be the first new entry in the Mana series, Seiken Densetsu in Japan, in over fifteen years. While the story doesn't seem to move past the boundaries set in previous entries in the series, involving a journey to the Tree of Mana to rejuvenate the flow of mana power, the vibrant visuals and a more action-oriented approach to combat are set to make the game stand out from the rest of the series, although it will be interesting to see if it will be able to replicate the quality of some of the best entries in the series like Trials of Mana.</p>
<p>Visions of Mana launches on August 29th on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. More information on the game can be found on its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2490990/Visions_of_Mana/">Steam store page</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-rivals-preview-out-for-overwatchs-crown.898947/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/marvel-rivals-preview-out-for-overwatchs-crown<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>is a fitting name for the upcoming hero shooter by Netease, because I daresay this game will rival&nbsp;<em>Overwatch 2.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>During Summer Game Fest, we got a chance to play a few rounds of&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals.&nbsp;</em>This is an objective-based hero shooter, but you should be familiar with a lot of the cast -- they are, after all, many of Marvel's all-stars as playable characters.</p>
<p>In fact, if you are at all familiar with&nbsp;<em>Overwatch</em>, you'll be right at home with&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>. Both games share similar objectives and follow that same core philosophy when it comes to heroes and abilities, but there's enough here to be its own game.</p>

<h2>A Hero for Everyone</h2>
<p>The roster is, of course, split into three roles: vanguard (tank), duelist (DPS), and strategist (healer).&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>&nbsp;does distinguish itself in that its from a third-person perspective not unlike&nbsp;<em>Smite,&nbsp;</em>but at its core, this is a hero shooter.</p>
<p>And this game is all about the heroes. I'm a big fan of the cast -- you have both recognizable characters as well as some that are more niche and less well-known.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spider-Man and Hulk are some of the most recognizable characters around, so it's nice to see Luna Snow, Namor, and some others as a contrast to this.</p>

<p>Heroes have a set of abilities, and the logic mostly follows that of&nbsp;<em>Overwatch</em>. Like you have an ability to aid in mobility, an ultimate, so on and so forth. Some of these are super bombastic and battles truly do feel like a bunch of super heroes clashing.</p>
<p>You'll even see the effect of battle on the environment. I caught a glimpse of a building taking substantial damage from all the chaos. Not to mention,&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>' art style is excellent, colorful look as if plucked right out from the pages of a comic book.</p>
<p>My several games went about as well as I'd hoped. It was super quick to adapt and get used to the controls, and the characters I played all felt faithful to their character.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Scarlet Witch, for instance, uses magic as her primary ability with this sort of siphon ability, and can launch magic missiles, too. Rocket makes heavy use of his technology and can heal enemies with alt-fire -- as a nice little detail, he can hop on the back of Groot.</p>
<p><em>Marvel Rivals</em>&nbsp;is a shockingly good time. After being a little jaded by&nbsp;<em>Overwatch 2</em>, this seems like a perfectly suitable alternative, even if you aren't a huge Marvel fan.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="328" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">After a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/dragon-age-the-veilguards-gameplay-needs-to-win-back-fans-as-reveal-trailer-reaches-198000-youtube-dislikes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">less than well received reveal trailer</a>, <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> appears to have curried some favour back thanks to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-gameplay-shows-varrics-tragic-loss-of-bianca-at-solas-hands-and-eldritch-demons-from-the-veil/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its gameplay trailer</a>, which confirmed a number of key details about the game. BioWare has since shared more information, including how this <em>Dragon Age</em> will be noticeably more linear than its predecessor.</p> <p data-characters="695" data-current-count="695" data-injectable="true">Speaking with<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-the-first-preview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> IGN</a> during an extended preview of the game, director Corinne Busche explained how, for <em>The Veilguard</em>, the development team opted for a “mission-based structure.” By comparison, <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-dragon-age-inquisition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a></em> had a semi-open world structure, consisting of multiple areas players could freely explore. Given the industry’s slight obsession with crafting large open worlds for people to run around in, I’m surprised BioWare has decided to go in the opposite direction for the new <em>Dragon Age</em>, but Busche said this will be to the game’s benefit: “We believe that’s how we get the best narrative experience, the best moment-to-moment experience.”</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via BioWare</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="509" data-current-count="809" data-injectable="true">That’s also not to say players will be railroaded from one objective to the next. Some missions will offer more opportunities for exploration than others, with optional content, hidden secrets, and branching paths to discover. As Busche said, “It does open up, but it is a mission-based, highly curated game.” In addition, she provided light details on <em>The Veilguard</em>‘s side-quests, sharing one example about investigating a missing family which lets you search for clues in a bog area.</p>
 <p data-characters="684" data-current-count="684" data-injectable="true">I’m sure some will be disappointed to not get the opportunity to freely roam <em>The Veilguard</em>‘s setting of the Tevinter Imperium region. But this mission-based structure is not too dissimilar to what BioWare did with the much lauded <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-mass-effect-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mass Effect 2</a></em>. I reckon most players will be fine with it as long as the story and character writing are on par with the previous games. Plus, it means BioWare can avoid the issues some games with open worlds suffer from. For example, plenty of Ubisoft’s open world settings have been criticised for being littered with so many objectives that they feel like they’re only there to pad the world out and stop it from feeling empty.</p>
 <p data-characters="305" data-current-count="305" data-injectable="false">We won’t have to wait much longer to see how well fans take to <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> as the game is scheduled to launch for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC this fall. Given it’s been almost a decade since <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em> came out, the wait will hopefully have been worth it.</p>

<p data-characters="227" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you jumped into <em>Fortnite</em> this week expecting to see a new set of Week 3 Quests ready for you to complete, you may be scratching your head, wondering where they are. Here’s why this week’s challenges are missing. </p> <p data-characters="223" data-current-count="223" data-injectable="false">Every week, Epic Games drops a fresh set of Quests into the game, which rewards you with XP when completed. This XP is then used to rank up your <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-fortnite-wrecked-season-3-battle-pass-cosmetics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 3 Battle Pass</a>, unlocking more skins and cosmetic items for you to use. </p> <p data-characters="87" data-current-count="310" data-injectable="false">Unfortunately, this week there are no no challenges as of yet, and I can tell you why. </p> <figure data-current-count="610" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>No challenges to complete so far this week.

However, Epic Games tweeted that the patch had been delayed until Thursday, June 13, meaning that the challenges haven’t been added to the game yet. </p> <h2 id="h-when-will-forntite-s-week-3-quests-appear" data-injectable="false">When will <em>Forntite’s </em>Week 3 Quests appear?</h2> <p data-characters="253" data-current-count="606" data-injectable="true">Epic has confirmed that the Week 3 Quests will arrive with the v30.10 update on June 13. It’s unclear if they will unlock as soon as downtime ends or if we’ll have to wait until 2 pm BST / 9 am ET / 6 am PT when challenges normally go live. </p>
 <p data-characters="264" data-current-count="264" data-injectable="false">We’ll likely learn more about what’s happening when downtime ends, which normally happens at around 12 pm BST / 7 am ET / 4 am PT. We’ll be up and ready for all the <em>Fortnite</em> action tomorrow, so make sure to check back for guides and patch notes. </p>

            <p>Ahead of the highly-anticipated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-everything-we-know-9415">Elden Ring DLC</a> expansion Shadow of the Erdtree, FromSoftware boss Hidetaka Miyazaki has said he understands why many players use guides to help them with the studio's games, but doesn't want them to be a necessity.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/elden-rings-developers-know-most-players-use-guides-but-still-try-to-cater-to-those-who-go-in-blind-if-they-cant-do-it-then-theres-some-room-for-improvement-on-our-behalf/">PC Gamer</a>, Miyazaki said the team expects players to consult guides when playing through its games. "There's going to be a wealth of information on the web and in their communities where they have access to the secrets and the strategies," he noted.</p>
<p>But, even though the FromSoft team does expect many of its players to turn to a guide or two to help them negotiate the Lands Between and Shadow of the Erdtree's Land of Shadow, the studio still believes players should be able to enjoy its games without additional help.</p>

<p>"We obviously understand [players use guides], but we don't make or plan anything with that as a prerequisite," he said. "If anything, we try to cater to the player who is completely blind and wants to go through organically. If they can't do it, then there's some room for improvement on our behalf, and we'd like to try to embrace those players more in the future."</p>
<p>Miyazaki added that those getting ready to play Shadow of the Erdtree specifically will have plenty of experience with Elden Ring's base game, and therefore the team has "faith that they will be able to continue, find these secrets and overcome these challenges".</p>
<p>Of course, there's nothing wrong with using guides when playing games, and indeed Miyazaki called it a "perfectly valid playstyle".</p>
<p>"We don't necessarily cater to players who are reading guides as they go... we respect those players who like to approach it with a guide in hand. We just want to let you know it's not our prerequisite, designing the game in their favour," he closed.</p>

<p>During last week’s Summer Game Fest showcase, Riot came out guns blazing with a shocking announcement. The developers <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valorant-console-release-confirmed-riot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed the console release</a> for their popular first-person shooter, Valorant, with a limited beta rolling out for PlayStation 5 on June 14. </p>



<p>It hasn’t even been a whole week since the announcement, and the leaks have already surfaced. The latest one provides players with the complete console trophy list for Valorant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As per <a href="https://www.truetrophies.com/news/valorant-ps5-platinum-trophy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">True Trophies</a>, players will be able to unlock 16 trophies/achievements for Valorant on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. However, players should note that there are no Platinum trophies for Valorant on the  PS5. </p>



<p>Besides that, it is surprising to see that there are more Silver and Gold trophies than Bronze trophies for the console port. In most games, some of these challenges wouldn’t be worth higher than Bronze. Challenges like dealing 500,000 damage or using your Abilities 4,000 times can easily be attained by playing the game long enough, but completing these tasks will fetch you a Gold Trophy. Check out the full list of Valorant’s console trophies/achievements below.&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Who’s next? – Get 1 Kill (Bronze)</li>



<li>And that’s how it gets done! – Win 1 Game (Bronze)</li>



<li>Right between the eyes. – Get 300 Headshots (Silver)</li>



<li>They’re super dead! – Get 1,000 Headshots (Gold)</li>



<li>That’s going to leave a scar. – Deal 250,000 damage (Silver)</li>



<li>Looks like I got a little carried away. – Deal 500,000 damage (Gold)</li>



<li>Time for a field test. – Use your Abilities 2,000 times (Silver)</li>



<li>Take control. – Use your Abilities 4,000 times (Gold)</li>



<li>Here comes the party! – Use your Ultimate 125 times (Silver)</li>



<li>Must I do everything? – Get an Ace (Gold)</li>



<li>Five in, five out. – Get a Flawless (Gold)</li>



<li>Beep beep beep, enough of that. – Successfully defuse a Spike with less than a second remaining (Silver)</li>



<li>I’m built different. – Earn a Clutch (Silver)</li>



<li>I know exactly where you are. – Get 10 Wallbang Kills (Bronze)</li>



<li>Next time we’ll use wooden sticks! – Get a Thrifty (Silver)</li>



<li>You want to play? Let’s play – Use your Ultimate 300 times (Gold)&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>In other news, Valorant’s limited beta test goes live in a few days. Players must be in NA, EU, or JP regions to join the test. If you are eligible, sign up for the Valorant console beta through this link or a referral link that comes through a personal invitation from Riot. Lastly, players should own a PlayStation 5 or an Xbox Series X/S.

    </div><div>



            <p>
A new, unofficial online database of game listings from the Epic Games Store has been launched and promptly rifled through - turning up mention of numerous unannounced PC game projects.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://epicdb.org/">EpicDB</a>, similar to SteamDB, is now offline - after Epic Games itself realised its private store data was being probed.
</p>
<p>
"We released an update tonight so third-party tools can't surface any new unpublished product titles from the Epic Games Store catalogue," an Epic Games spokesperson told Eurogamer.

<p>
Many of the games spotted were listed under codenames, though a few were not. Saber Interactive had a listing for a Turok project, for example (though whether this is a new game or remaster is unknown). 
</p>
<p>
Some that were listed under codenames were also easily identifiable. It's publicly known that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-bioshocks-setting-and-time-period-detailed-in-new-report">BioShock 4, in development since at least 2019</a>, is being <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-in-development-at-new-2k-studio-cloud-chamber">worked on under the title "Parkside"</a>. This was indeed listed as one of several games in development by publisher 2K.
</p>
<p>
Still others were listed under unknown codenames - though enterprising internet users on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ddua4x/epicdb_several_publisher_games_are_being_leaked/">reddit</a> and video game fan forum <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-lot-of-unannounced-games-are-leaking-via-epicdb.898755/">ResetEra</a> believe they have uncovered what some could be. 
</p>
<p>
A bit of digging in the Epic Store files suggests a Sony Interactive Entertainment project codenamed "Utah" is in fact a The Last of Us Part 2 PC port. (Remember that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2-reportedly-pc-ready-and-has-been-for-months">report which recently claimed the game was done and ready</a>, but potentially awaiting the arrival of HBO's next The Last of Us TV season.)
</p>
<p>
More interesting, perhaps, is a project codenamed "Semla" from Rockstar Games. Based on its filesize being close to the filesize of Red Dead Redemption 1 on PS4, there's suggestion that this could be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-1-finally-heading-to-pc-new-datamine-suggests">the mythical PC port of Rockstar's beloved cowboy western</a> that's long been expected. 
</p>
<p>
And then there are other codenames that are just fun to see. Sega currently has in-development projects codenamed "Porridge", "Croquembouche" and "CurlyWurly". Ubisoft has  food-themed ideas for its codenames, including "Puffpastry" and "Profiterole". Saber Interactive has "Chimichanga". And Square Enix has "Butterkaka". Mmmm... time for some lunch.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-is-mission-based-rather-than-open-world-sex-scenes-will-have-nudity/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>At Summer Game Fest 2024, BioWare has finally <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-summer-game-fest-presentation-impressions-back-in-thedas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> a lot about Dragon Age: The Veilguard, the fourth mainline installment in the fantasy RPG franchise.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean there aren't still many unanswered questions. One of those was the degree of openness of the world design. Dragon Age: Inquisition added semi-open world maps, but in an interview <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-the-first-preview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with IGN</a>, Game Director Corinne Busche hinted that this new game will be less open and more mission-focused by comparison.</p>
<p><em>Yeah, so it is a mission-based game. Everything is hand-touched, hand-crafted, very highly curated. We believe that's how we get the best narrative experience, the best moment-to-moment experience. However, along the way, these levels that we go to do open up, some of them have more exploration than others. Alternate branching paths, mysteries, secrets, optional content you're going to find and solve. So it does open up, but it is a mission-based, highly curated game.</em></p>
<p><em>Some of them are highly curated, especially when it involves the motivations and the experiences of the companions. You're really along on this journey with them. Others, you're investigating a missing family… and the entirety of this bog is open up to you. You're searching for clues, finding a way to solve their disappearance. So really it's not a one-size-fits-all solution. But I do want to emphasize that hand-crafted and curated is our approach.</em></p>
<p>This is probably BioWare getting back to its historic strengths after some criticism for the open world design of Inquisition and Mass Effect Andromeda. That said, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-gets-first-gameplay-and-details-tremendous-amount-of-handcrafted-side-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">speaking to Wccftech</a>, BioWare also confirmed there will be a 'tremendous' amount of side content in Dragon Age: The Veilguard. Hopefully, that means we'll still have a meaty game on our hands this Fall, even without an open world to explore.</p>

<p>On another note, Busche also <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-confirmed-to-let-you-romance-any-companion-you-want-will-include-nudity-it-gets-pretty-spicy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talked</a> about the romantic relationships that players will be able to develop in the game. Interestingly, companions could get together on their own if you don't romance them yourselves. There will also be some nudity for certain sex scenes, depending on how 'spicy' the companion is.</p>
<p><em>Their past experiences or partners, they'll reference them and indeed who they'll become romantic with. For instance, we saw Harding. I might be playing a straight male character flirting with her, but I choose not to pursue a romance. She might get together with Taash. So my perception, my identity has no bearing on their identities and that comes through really strongly.</em></p>
<p><em>It's not until the later parts of the game where you really commit to romance and it gets pretty spicy. Some of them are more spicy than others. Just like real life, our companions have such diverse personalities. Some of them are more physical, more aggressive, and some of them are more... we have a gentleman necromancer, for instance, that is more intimate and sensual. Of course, we are an M-rated game. We do have nudity.</em></p>
<p>BioWare stressed that the writers have strived to make friendships just as compelling as romances for those players who'd rather stick to that type of relationship.</p>
<p>Last but not least, the studio <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-will-allow-you-to-import-your-choices-from-previous-games-through-the-character-creator" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> how it's going to integrate choices made in previous games. Whereas Dragon Age: Inquisition had its own Dragon Age Keep app that could be used to import saves from earlier installments, there won't be any of that here due to the incompatibility between the different clients.</p>
<p>Instead, Dragon Age: The Veilguard has everything baked into the character creator, where players will have the opportunity to fully recreate their own Inquisitor from the previous title. Here, they'll also get to select what happened in their version of the previous stories, and it'll obviously influence the plot in some way.</p>
<p>The developers are targeting a Fall 2024 launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. It'll likely be around the 10-year anniversary of Inquisition, which occurs between 18 and 20 November.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-ports-issues-next-gen/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 should see a fair amount of ports and support if its performance will indeed be in the ballpark of the Xbox Series S, but things may drastically change once next-generation consoles from Sony and Microsoft are out.</p>
<p>Speaking during the latest episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MooresLawIsDead" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moore's Law is Dead'</a>s Broken Silicon podcast, Taylor Christensen and Jacob Sutton, co-founders of the Spirit of the North series development team Infuse Studio, discussed the next Nintendo gaming system and if it will give the same troubles many developers had porting games to its predecessor. Jacob Stutton said that if the leaked specs are real and the console's performance is comparable to the Xbox Series S, this generation's lowest common denominator, the system should see a fair amount of support and ports. Since current generation multiplatform games have to target the Microsoft console, developers won't have to make huge sacrifices to get their games running on the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>This, however, is eventually going to change in the future. As with every recent Nintendo hardware, the Switch 2 is launching in the middle of the current generation, and its specs are likely not going to be high enough for smooth porting once the next-generation systems from Sony and Microsoft are out. This happened with the original Switch as well, as the console has trouble running Unreal Engine 4 games without massive sacrifices and is obviously incapable of running Unreal Engine 5 games. In addition, Jacob Stutton highlighted that throwing more hardware doesn't magically solve other issues, such as software being unable to take full advantage of a system's specification, making the example of the Unreal Engine 5.4 update, which only recently introduced better multicore utilization leading to potentially much better performance.</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has yet to be officially revealed. We will update you on the system as soon as more information comes in, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <p>
The Communications Workers of America (CWA), one of America's largest unions, has filed Unfair Labour Practice charges against Microsoft supplier Lionbridge Technologies.
</p>
<p>
According to the <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/communications-workers-america-files-unfair-labor-practice-charge-against-lionbridge">CWA</a>, Lionbridge laid off the entirety of an Idaho-based team, equating to 160 people, after they engaged in union-related activity. This team, the CWA said, provided QA testing for Activision.</p>

<p>
In addition, the CWA stated Lionbridge had offered workers a severance package which "required them to agree to overly broad confidentiality terms and to waive rights protected under the National Labor Relations Act". The CWA says the US National Labor Relations Board has <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/news-outreach/news-story/board-rules-that-employers-may-not-offer-severance-agreements-requiring">ruled this practise to be unlawful</a>.
</p>
<p>
Those affected were allegedly told their termination was due to their project coming to a close, however the CWA said others on the same project elsewhere remained in employment. It noted that those in Mexico and Poland "continue to work", despite what Lionbridge told the Idaho team about the project coming to an end.
</p>
<p>
This is not the first time the Microsoft supplier has been accused of engaging in what the CWA describes as "union-busting". The same thing happened in 2016, when Lionbridge laid off union members in Bellevue, Washington. This <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2016/unionized-microsoft-supplier-to-close-lab-one-month-after-completing-first-contract/">particular batch of layoffs</a> reportedly happened "shortly after workers finalised a first collectively bargained contract with the company", with the CWA stating: "That unit also provided subcontracted labour to Microsoft."
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">“We do much the same work that union-represented Activision QA employees do. Microsoft should make sure that everyone working on its games is treated w/ respect in line w/ its labor principles, including employees of contractors" - Al Bussabarger, former Lionbridge Test Associate <a href="https://t.co/LqtV2hmjlH">https://t.co/LqtV2hmjlH</a></p>— CWA (@CWAUnion) <a href="https://twitter.com/CWAUnion/status/1800537113831858437?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 11, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>
The CWA now wants Microsoft to hold its contractors such as Lionbridge to the same standards the company has set for itself. Two years ago, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/microsoft-and-cwa-enter-labor-neutrality-agreement">Microsoft signed a labour neutrality agreement with CWA</a>, which would go into effect 60 days after the closure of its then-ongoing acquisition of Activision Blizzard. Earlier this month, the CWA and Microsoft announced that they had <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/cwa-enters-neutrality-agreement-microsofts-zenimax-studios">extended their labour neutrality agreement to cover workers at ZeniMax Media Inc</a>.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has reached out to Microsoft and Activision for further comment on today's report.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/alice-b-is-leaving-rps-come-say-goodbye.898893/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/alice-b-is-leaving-rps-come-say-goodbye<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>On a Monday in early 2018, Adam Smith, Rock Paper Shotgun's deputy editor at the time, handed in his notice. On Thursday that same week, I emailed Alice Bell, a person I'd never spoken to before, to ask if she would consider applying for the role.
</p>
<p>Alice thought it over for a week, and then emailed her response: no.
</p>
<p>Thank god I was able to change her mind, so I could spend the next six years giving her shit about it. But now Alice is leaving RPS, and you should join me in saying goodbye.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Alice's writing sounds like how I want RPS to sound: funny and smart, yes, but best of all able to be strongly critical while still unafraid to be a fan of a game she loves. These are a mixture of qualities that it's almost impossible to find in a writer, and typically you get an imbalance towards one or t'other: too cynical, or too game-pilled, or funny but insubstantial, or thoughtful but so, so dry.
</p>
<p>Yet the balance is present across Alice's work for the site. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/tfi-friday">TFI Friday</a>. Announcing her love for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-love-you-giant-women-of-the-assassins-creed-odyssey-dlc">giant women</a>. Recurring confusion at video game merch - from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bloodlines-2-bath-bombs-are-exactly-what-youd-expect">bath bombs</a> to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-is-everyone-making-terrible-trainers-for-their-video-games">trainers</a>. Coming up with the idea to commission <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-miss-rezzed-so-much-that-we-turned-it-into-a-free-tabletop-rpg">a tabletop RPG based on Rezzed</a>, so readers could experience it when it was cancelled due to the pandemic. Conceiving of and delivering our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/apply-to-rock-paper-shotguns-work-experience-programme-for-ethnic-minorities">ethnic minority work experience programme</a>. Her <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/moon-diary">Ritual Of The Moon diary</a>, about a game designed to be played for five minutes per day for 28 days. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/the-rps-electronic-wireless-show">Electronic Wireless Show podcast</a>, the only podcast you need in her opinion (which will return, with Alice still hosting). More reviews and shitposts than I can possibly link to.
</p>
<p>That's not to mention Alice's work behind the scenes. Consider the context of RPS at the time Alice was hired. Back in 2018, we were about to double the size of the team by hiring six people and branching into video, guides and hardware coverage. I told Alice that we'd gently introduce her to the various tasks of her new role, an intention I sincerely held until around 11am on her first day - a change of mind Alice has been giving me shit about for the past six years. I dumped a mountain of work on Alice that day, and while I haven't been editor-in-chief of RPS in a few years, she never let me down while I was.
</p>
<p>I'm conscious that I'm personally getting the balance all wrong here, that this sort of sappy outpouring of praise without jokes is very un-Alice. In a more perfect world, we'd all be roasting her for leaving, but we don't live in that world. Instead, I need to address the redundant elephant in the recently acquired room. Last month, Rock Paper Shotgun's parent company Gamer Network was bought by Ziff Davis, and following that transaction the decision was made to cut staff within Gamer Network. Alice's role was one of those cut.
</p>
<p>I can't properly articulate how angry and sad I am about this, and I won't try. I know most of you reading this already feel the same way.
</p>
<p>I'm confident that RPS will be fine, eventually, as it always has been when great people have left before. I'm confident that Alice will be better than fine; Alice is going to conquer the world, as former RPS writers often do. (You should <a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/grave-expectations-alice-bell/7424574?ean=9781838958428">buy</a> her <a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/displeasure-island-a-grave-expectations-mystery-alice-bell/7661083?ean=9781838958435">novels</a>, if you haven't already.)
</p>
<p>This confidence doesn't make me any less angry or sad. Instead, I'll hold onto the fact I'm friends with Alice outside of work, where I get to experience the best of her: not the supportive, thoughtful colleague everyone describes below, but the funny, gossipy, gleefully mean friend who shares my love of four-hour YouTube videos and obscure internet drama. <em>Thank god I was able to change your mind.</em>
</p>
<p><strong>Ed:</strong> Back in the golden era of the office days, I remember Alice and I first bonded over Love Island when she heard my former work sidekick James and I talking a bit too loudly about it in our Metabomb corner (the esports site we used to work on). Every morning from then on she'd join us for a quick daily "DID YOU SEE LAST NIGHT" debrief. That's when I knew we'd get along just fine.
</p>
<p>I started at RPS a few years ago, having been absorbed by the first of The Takeovers. I went from an esports-y guides writer who'd done a couple of features for our pals at Eurogamer (cheers to Donlan for giving me a chance), to a staff writer all of a sudden. It was a big change! I knew a few of the folks already, but above all else, Alice really helped me settle in. She took me under her wing, gave me loads of guidance on words and were just like, really nice.
</p>
<p>Over the years she'd land on my work and dissect it in a way that I look back on and think, "Only Alice could've done that". She'd sit with me and explain through clear, concise points how I could improve or rejig or think differently about things - to better my confidence.
</p>
<p>I owe Alice a lot, to be honest. I wouldn't be where I am without her fighting my corner, as she believed I could edit other people's words when I ummed and ahhed over the step up. Later, she'd happily lend me advice on how to manipulate letters so they'd look nice on a page and read much betterer. I'm still working on how I relay those nuggets of word advice to those I work with, but Alice has instilled in me a lot of certainty I didn't have previously. One thing I've taken away which she'd be pleased with: trust my gut when it rumbles. 
</p>
<p>She might think these very words on this very page are a bit daft, or a bit much, or a bit cringe. She should know by now that I am not only fond of cringe, I <em>bathe</em> in cringe. She's probably still got CMS access, so she might try to attack the unpublish button, but as you read this I'm probably fending her off with a copy of Grave Expectations in one hand and Displeasure Island, its sequel, in the other. I grabbed my copies from my local bookstore, so you certainly can too. I could use the help! Oh god, she's about to hit me with The People's Elbow.
</p>
<p>I won't launch into how much she's done for the site itself and for so many others. It's immeasurable, really. Just know that it has been a joy. And will <em>continue</em> to be a joy, as I pester her and distract her from the exciting projects she'll be beavering away at otherwise.  
</p>
<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong> When Alice B interviewed me for this job and asked what games I was personally looking forward to, I told her one of them was Sherlock Holmes: The Awakening. She replied with an intrigued eyebrow raise and asked 'Really,' as if she too had a bemused appreciation for the rough-around-the-edges feel of Holmes versus Cthulhu as envisioned by Frogwares, a developer you can't help but root for despite the fact that everything they make is sorta falling apart at the edges.
</p>
<p>When I did get this job, I was pleased to find that Alice truly did share snippets of my odd tastes, especially when it comes to underrated adventure games and schlocky movies. It's rare to find a person who appreciates The Legend of Kyrandia 2: Hand of Fate and has actually spent time analysing the plot of Van Helsing, a movie that made the questionable decision of basing its storyline on Dracula's eggs. This potent appreciation of weird is what made Alice such a great writer for this corner of the internet. She will be greatly missed, we are less without her, and next time I play a Frogwares game, I will do so in her honour.
</p>
<p><strong>Nic:</strong> Ah, but can we hire Alice's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-asked-a-lot-of-people-what-would-you-do-to-a-clone-of-yourself">clone</a>? Alice did <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/whats-on-your-bookshelf-author-and-games-writer-abouter-alice-bell">Booked For The Week</a> for me on Sunday, read that please.
</p>
<p><strong>Ollie:</strong> When I arrived at the office on my very first day, Alice immediately made me about 70% less anxious, seemingly without even trying. For the next five years, in between consistently writing some of the best words on the site, she would continue to make RPS feel like a second home and a second family. Even if she did think I'm a lot posher than I am.
</p>
<p><strong>Kiera:</strong> I don't need to tell you all how talented Alice B is, her work speaks for itself. What I will say though, is that in the somewhat short time I've been at RPS, Alice was one of the most genuine, funny people to work with. When freaking out over my first Game Club pick, Alice helped guide me through the process and provided invaluable feedback. Instead of giving my work a blind pass, she took the time to give me tailored, insightful suggestions to push my work further and out of my comfort zone. It's a real pity to see her go. I think I could have learnt so much more from her boundless experience in the field. Hopefully, we'll work together again at some point. Although, I'm positive someone very lucky will snap her up long before that. Good luck Alice.
</p>
<p><strong>James:</strong> Alice, I’ve been saying this a lot recently, in less printable language, but this is utter codswallop. Complete poppycock. A load of balderdash festooned with bunkum. I’m sorry that these circumstances preclude the send-off you deserve, which would likely involve barrelling out the doors on a golden chariot pulled by a dozen miniature horses, down an aisle of the finest scented candles and surrounded by confetti where every piece is a valid, obscenely profitable book deal.
</p>
<p>Still, the cool thing about being as enviably talented as Alice Goddamn Bell is that we all know you’ll end up doing something great. Probably several, all at once. For now, I’ll just say thank you for making the site what it is, for countless good times on the podcast, and for being a pal. RPS will endure, but only because we’ve all become a bit more Alice-like from working with you.
</p>
<p>Talk soon, yeah?
</p>
<p><strong>Brendan:</strong> The job of games journalist gets a few reactions. People recoil, or they say “cool”, or they have no idea what you mean. A select few, upon learning about this role, will deeply covet it. They will enlist in the career as if it is a war. When people tell Alice they want to be a games journalist because they love video games, she often gives them the following advice, the soundest, simplest counsel I have heard in our sickly trade: you may love to play games, trooper, but do you love to write?</p>
<p>Observe the truth of this. Anyone can play Assassin’s Creed, not everyone will feel compelled to write <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-tour-of-regular-people-having-regular-jobs-in-assassins-creed-odyssey">a tour guide to its regular Grecian inhabitants</a>. Anybody can indulge in nostalgia by playing their favourite game from the early 2000s; few will be driven to write about their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/remember-how-great-ascii-art-used-to-be-in-game-guides">favourite online ASCII art</a> for those games. Anyone can play obscure indie experiments about the moon, not everyone will <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ritual-of-the-moon">devote 28 days to said game with ritualistic rigour</a>. Alice does not simply love (some) video games, she is that person who loves to write. As if you needed more proof, she's only gone and written <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/22779103.Alice_Bell">two bloody crime novels</a>. WHAT THE FUCK.</p>
<p>Her departure is a loss for RPS, but I suspect it will be a net gain for the world of writing. She is equally capable of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bethesda-could-have-shown-us-anything-with-starfield-and-they-chose-grey-rocks-again">a lethal takedown</a>, a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/spiritfarer-review">swell of kindness</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-accidentally-gave-me-a-power-fantasy">all </a><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/when-will-video-games-give-me-their-sad-murder-mums">the insight</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-dont-have-to-be-polite-about-the-game-awards-or-pretend-it-actually-cares">in-between</a>. From the shadowrealms of redundancy, Alice appeared to us in a goodbye call and asked everyone at RPS to “stay weird”. And, gotta say, it was hard to sit there and pretend like my eyes were not blurring out every face on the screen like a really shit episode of Traffic Cops.</p>
<p>I am being professionally sad here. But also personally. Only a few months ago, I was let go from an industry job (tl;dr – Embracer bullshit) and, by some grace or cunning, the very next day Alice Bell appeared in my inbox offering work, like a grizzled hand reaching up from a trench to pull a lost dog of war back down to the safety of boards and muck. Today, it stings that I have no power to return the favour. But if there’s one thing I know, as Alice winks at the camera and dashes off into the overworld of smoke and words, it’s that she actually doesn’t need my help to clear her way. Doesn’t need my cover fire, my always-alliterative artillery, nor rounds of rhetoric celebrating her ability. I don’t care. I’ll stand up and fire a full belt of this shit all the same. AHHHHH-HHHH-HHH-HH-H-h-h-h!</p>
<p><strong>Edwin:</strong> I first met Alice Bell when she did a summer internship for Official Xbox Magazine, where I was online editor till we all got laid off in 2014. I have one story I always tell about how she borrowed my Skyrim savegame for a feature, and proceeded to humiliate me in the office by complaining loudly that I’d barely done anything other than become Thane of Whiterun, then threw away all my carefully hoarded in-game books while I was away at a press event, for reasons I can’t recall. She also mocked me for listening to Keane, right in front of Edge. This kid will go far, I said to myself, through the tears.
</p>
<p>Alice B, you contain and create immensities. You will shrug off the arbitrary terms of your departure and out-videogames-journalism us all, assuming you don’t level up and disappear triumphantly into another sphere. You’re the kind of writer I think the games media needs but probably doesn’t deserve – somebody with an appetite and imagination for things beyond games which can then be called upon to think about games differently, and who can draw in younger writers who are similarly adventurous. You are also incredibly funny, and a supportive, compassionate editor who has signed off on some of the least expected and most rewarding freelance pieces I’ve read.
</p>
<p>There are many great writers in this space, but I think everybody struggles with the basic insularity of a form of journalism that is enthusiast by nature and which doesn’t allow the time for cultivating wider knowledge, because the games are so big, and the biggest of them want all the time we have. It’s a sappy cliché but genuinely, Alice, your work shines a light. Who else would write a whole column on Nancy Drew? Anyway, I’m about to overdo it so I’ll shut up now. I wish you the very best for the next thing. Whatever happens, we’ll always have Whiterun.</p>

            <p>Mock reviews are a widespread practice within the games industry, yet due to the secretive nature of the work involved, they remain an under-discussed branch of the feedback process – particularly in comparison to fields such as QA and player testing. With most mock reviews and game evaluations written under heavy NDA, it's perhaps unsurprising that we hear little about this line of work.</p>
<p>With the help of experts in publishing, PR and game consultancy – combined with my own knowledge as a freelance consultant and mock reviewer – this article aims to demystify the mock review process, and explore how game evaluations provide a useful form of feedback at different stages of the development process.</p>

<li><a href="#section-3">How do I become a mock reviewer or game evaluator?</a></li>
</ul>
</section>
<h2 id="section-1">What is a mock review?</h2>
<p>In its most basic form, a mock review resembles the sort of review you would see published by games media. It's a written essay that discusses the strengths and weaknesses of a game, intended to mirror the external critique that a game would face at launch. Mock reviews are typically commissioned by publishers or marketing agencies, and often written by people with a background in games journalism.</p>
<p>"The idea is that publishers really want to gauge the potential success of their title and what a critical landscape will look like," says Sterling McGarvey, head of consulting at game consultancy firm Hit Detection. "Oftentimes, the goal is not to be broadsided by surprise reviews."</p>
<blockquote>"Oftentimes, the goal is not to be broadsided by surprise reviews"<cite>Sterling McGarvey</cite></blockquote>
<p>Alongside a written article, clients will ask mock reviewers to provide a score, or an estimate of how the game would rank on Metacritic. McGarvey notes that publishers now increasingly value community sentiment as a way of gauging a game's success at launch, but as a forecasting metric, "Metacritic is easier and neater for all parties involved."</p>
<p>Depending on the project, reviewers could be required to give a general overview of their impressions of a game – as if they were publishing a real review – or be asked to focus their feedback on specific areas. This could be something such as a potential sensitivity issue, the game's narrative, or a particular set of mechanics.</p>
<p>"We pull together key messaging points when we're starting a campaign… and a lot of this is [about] how these key messaging points are coming across," says Rebecca Attard, head of global integrated communications at Splash Damage. "If something we really want to lead on is gunplay mechanics, we will focus a lot more on 'How do you find the gunplay mechanics, and what kind of things would you recommend in terms of players creating their build-outs?'"</p>
<h3><ul>
<li><p><strong>Mock reviews, game evaluations, and when they happen in development</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
</h3>
<p>Although often used interchangeably, the terms 'mock review' and 'game evaluation' describe two slightly different forms of feedback. A mock review is typically a straightforward written review with a score.</p>
<p>"I have done only one pure mock review thus far in my career as a consultant," says PR consultant at Future Friends Games Natalie Flores, who has also conducted game evaluations for consultancy firms Magid and Hit Detection. "I've mostly done large reports spanning over 30 pages, amassed over the course of multiple surveys, roundtables, and many hours of writing; mock reviews have been a very small part of them."</p>
<p>These larger reports – in which mock reviews form only one section – are often termed evaluations. These can contain varying forms of feedback, such as breakout paragraphs or questionnaire results. The other key difference between mock reviews and game evaluations is when they take place during the development process.</p>
<p>"The term mock review is used as a blanket term," says McGarvey. "I look at a mock review as something that comes late in the development process, where perhaps there's not necessarily room to make changes, whereas a game evaluation can come at any stage of the development process. If [Hit Detection] were to evaluate a game, we can look at something as early as concept and provide some feedback just based on the collective expertise of the team. We look at what the landscape [might] look like a couple of years down the line and extrapolate.</p>
<blockquote>"A lot of this is [about] how these key messaging points are coming across"<cite>Rebecca Attard</cite></blockquote>
<p>"Other times, we will look at something that's just barely playable, alongside design documents and supporting materials… The idea being that we would look at the vision of the game, what we're playing, the scope of it, the development time they have remaining – and think 'If you're able to hit these elements of your vision, this is where we see you potentially landing with this'. It's just based on when the client feels it's appropriate, and they want to get some feedback on their game."</p>
<p>Though it may sound counterintuitive to commission a mock review close to release – when further changes cannot be made – these late-stage reviews still have their uses.</p>
<p>"There's two things that we're trying to do here: manage the messaging, [and] make sure that we know what to lean into, what to lean away from," says Lewis Denby, founder and managing director of indie marketing agency Game If You Are. "Also, you can use them to manage client expectations."</p>
<p>So in essence, mock reviews provide a final heads-up on what critics will say about a game upon release – allowing for last-minute changes to marketing campaigns – and give publishers and PR agencies the opportunity to manage internal expectations of how a game will perform.</p>
<p>Mock reviews can be carried out internally: sometimes by a publisher's communications department, or even a dedicated in-house evaluations team. Yet alongside these internal reviews, publishers will often look to consultancies or freelance consultants to gain an outside perspective.</p>
<h3><strong><ul>
<li>Not just for big publishers</li>
</ul>
</strong></h3>
<p>Mock reviews and game evaluations can be commissioned by clients of all sizes. McGarvey says that while his work at Hit Detection used to be "heavily AAA," the consultancy has now evolved to "occupy a variety of niches," also including smaller budget AA titles ("your $30 games," he says) as well as indies.</p>
<blockquote>"There's two things that we're trying to do: manage the messaging, [and] make sure that we know what to lean into, what to lean away from"<cite>Lewis Denby</cite></blockquote>
<p>Denby says that for smaller teams, commissioning feedback is a matter of finding "the most valuable thing you can spend your limited budget on to help drive you towards success."</p>
<p>Commissioning a lengthy report might not be a sensible way to spend this budget, but asking evaluators to write about first impressions can be more helpful. This could involve giving the evaluators a trailer, media pack, screenshots, and asking them to play a 30-minute build.</p>
<p>"That can be so informative for indie developers, because a lot of the time these are things that they're so close to, they haven't realised that in the first five minutes of their game, there's a giant difficulty spike right off the bat," says Denby. "Or there might be something about the way they're talking about the game, or presenting the game, that's stopping people from even wanting to load up the demo in the first place. And that's often the biggest hurdle for small studios and solo devs – just getting that foot in the door."</p>

<h2 id="section-2">Why are mock reviews and game evaluations useful?</h2>
<p>As previously discussed, publishers typically commission mock reviews to gain an understanding of the critical reception a game will receive upon release, while evaluations highlight problem areas that can be addressed before launch. Developers can also become very close to their projects, sometimes making it difficult for them to impartially critique their own work. In these cases, mock reviews and evaluations are able to provide a more 'detached' form of feedback.</p>
<p>"It's very easy to not be able to see the wood from the trees, because you're in it every day," explains Denby. "We sometimes speak to indie developers who say 'We're really confident that we know how people respond to this game because we've taken it to shows and got feedback from people playing it.' And what I always say to that is… people don't want to be mean to your face. And actually, the feedback that's really valuable is that from people who you don't know, and have no vested interest whatsoever in your feelings."</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Rebecca-Attard.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>Rebecca Attard, head of global integrated communications at Splash Damage</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Evaluators can also provide guidance on how to present games to the media at launch. Attard explains that Splash Damage often equips mock reviewers with guides and documentation of the sort that would be given to critics upon release. Mock reviewers can give feedback on these guides, identifying places where journalists and influencers could potentially become confused.</p>
<p>"I've also used mock reviewers early in the cycle when we're doing things like events, or a big press beat, to look at the demo we're putting out and look at the presentation around it to ensure that the way we're talking about this game – based on what they're playing, and what we're saying – is really clear," Attard adds.</p>
<p>Developers are often aware of the problem areas within their own games, but may need further evidence to back up any proposed changes. For this reason, game evaluations can be useful for internal politicking.</p>
<p>"Sometimes, a developer will ask for something from the higher-ups and be unable to get that thing – say, for example, budget for a particular feature or segment that they know will improve the game," says Flores. "A developer can consult outside experts like mock reviewers to see if the experts will agree with them… The developer can then take the expert evaluation to the higher-up, as they will now have a stronger argument they can present when asking for what they need."</p>
<h3><strong><ul>
<li>The difference in feedback compared to QA and playtests</li>
</ul>
</strong></h3>
<p>Developers receive feedback on their games from a variety of sources: QA, consumer playtests, and influencer playtests being just some examples. All of these forms of feedback are valuable, and in addition to these, game evaluators can bring a different perspective to the table.</p>
<p>"When you want to bring in game evaluators, you're looking for a perspective that understands media, that understands consumers and community to some degree," McGarvey explains. "It's on-the-job training that you bring, there's a certain degree of intangibles from your experience reviewing games."</p>
<figure>

 </a>
<figcaption>Lewis Denby, founder and managing director of indie marketing agency Game If You Are</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Compared to QA testers – who do invaluable work highlighting specific bugs and technical problems – the job of a mock reviewer is more about critical analysis.</p>
<p>"What we're really trying to understand from a mock review is – what is going to be the reaction of the media when they play this?" Denby says. "What sort of emotions or thoughts or feelings does it conjure up? What sort of likelihood of coverage is there? All these sorts of things can be really relevant."</p>
<p>Attard notes that mock reviewers will often look at games in a more "impartial" way than consumers do in playtests.</p>
<p>"Users tend to get hooked up on little niggles that they might not necessarily like. Whereas a mock reviewer can give us a much broader view of everything, and in a much more considered way, written up into a report that isn't just raw feedback."</p>
<h3><strong><ul>
<li>The importance of using a wide range of reviewers</li>
</ul>
</strong></h3>
<p>In most cases, publishers will commission mock reviews from several critics at once. There can also be several rounds of mock reviews or evaluations on a single project, taking place at different stages of the development process.</p>
<blockquote>"It's definitely good to keep your list of mock reviewers fresh, to bring in other perspectives as well"<cite>Rebecca Attard</cite></blockquote>
<p>The reason for this is to gather a broad range of perspectives. Attard gives the example of a strategy game: for this, she would likely bring in an experienced strategy gamer, alongside a reviewer who's more of a generalist, in order to gain two different perspectives on the game. She adds that Splash Damage typically brings in both English language speakers and non-English language speakers, as this gives an understanding of different markets.</p>
<p>"We tend to do at least four different mock reviews from different markets and different individual journalists, because it is so important to not just focus on one."</p>
<p>"It's definitely good to keep your list of mock reviewers fresh, to bring in other perspectives as well," she adds. "It's also a generational thing – there's certain things that the older generation might look for that the younger generation don't, and that gives you a fresh take on it with the younger generation."</p>
<h2 id="section-3">How do I become a mock reviewer or game evaluator?</h2>
<p>Most mock reviewers have a background in games journalism, and transition to evaluation work once they have significant experience writing reviews. The first step towards becoming a game evaluator, therefore, is to build up a portfolio of work that shows you can critically analyse a game and clearly explain your thoughts.</p>
<p>"I would recommend honing your criticism skills," says Flores. "Write your thoughts down after you finish a game, make a coherent argument about your perspective. Know how to relay this verbally, too – you'll be doing plenty of talking and responding to questions from the developer with the more involved mock review assignments out there."</p>
<blockquote>"Networking is, at its best, genuine relationship building, so don't count yourself out if it's something you're still working on"<cite>Natalie Flores</cite></blockquote>
<p>Writing reviews for your own blog is a useful way to refine your skills and demonstrate an interest in games journalism but, as Denby notes, you will likely need experience writing for professional outlets before you can take on mock review work.</p>
<p>"We need to see that you have gone through that process – working under an editor, having professionally published content – because we need to understand that you have created content of the sort that we want to understand."</p>
<p>Alongside gaining experience as a professional reviewer, it's useful to build up your knowledge of the game development process. It's important that you are able to look past bugs to understand the developer's vision. Equally, when evaluating a game later in the development process, your suggestions need to be realistic for the project's remaining development timeframe.</p>
<h3><strong><ul>
<li>Be a generalist, but have a speciality</li>
</ul>
</strong></h3>
<p>Although it sounds paradoxical, being a mock reviewer requires both a general understanding of the gaming landscape, and the ability to specialise. A broad knowledge of gaming news, industry trends, and community sentiment is useful when giving feedback to clients, allowing you to highlight potential marketing opportunities or risks. Being a generalist also allows you to work on a wide range of projects. Yet it's also helpful to be known as an expert in a couple of areas. Evaluating a game in a genre you know well will allow you to make comparisons to similar games in the market, providing clients with useful context.</p>

<p>If there is a specific game design element that you are particularly good at analysing – such as UI/UX design or onboarding – you can also make this your niche. Publishers may seek you out if you are known to be an expert in a specific genre, or if you can provide useful insights into a particular aspect of a game's design.</p>
<p>"If you've got a niche that's outside of the usual 'this game is good or bad,' take that and make it your superpower," advises McGarvey.</p>
<p>Some evaluators specialise in identifying best practices in areas such as accessibility, or diversity and inclusion.</p>
<p>"Accessibility is an area where there's a lot of people doing great advocacy and consultancy work," adds McGarvey. "The work that those organisations are doing helps everybody as a whole… A rising tide raises all ships, and these advancements, in my opinion, are making games better."</p>
<h3><strong><ul>
<li>Promote yourself, and get networking</li>
</ul>
</strong></h3>
<p>Attracting mock review work is also a matter of making yourself visible, and building a reputation for producing high-quality reviews. As a journalist, you may well have a platform on social media, so it's worth leveraging this to display your work. A portfolio website allows publishers to check your past reviews, and see if you would be a good match for their project.</p>
<blockquote>"Being able to divorce 'what do I think about this game' from 'what will people think about this game' is a really key component"<cite>Sterling McGarvey</cite></blockquote>
<p>PR firms and consulting agencies often do outreach to reviewers to ask for their help with mock reviews. Equally, you can be proactive by emailing PR agencies, and letting them know that you're available for work. Over time, opportunities may come your way through word-of-mouth recommendations, and through networking.</p>
<p>"Networking is, at its best, just genuine relationship-building, so don't count yourself out if it's something you're still working on," says Flores. "Just be polite and kind; have some convictions and don't be afraid to voice them constructively on social media… and become someone known for being reliable and doing good work."</p>
<h3><strong><ul>
<li>What makes a good mock reviewer or evaluator?</li>
</ul>
</strong></h3>
<p>First and foremost, a good evaluator is able to look at an early game build and give useful feedback without being distracted by bugs which are likely to be fixed during the development process. Giving feedback on a game's flow or difficulty curve will be useful for developers; spending three paragraphs describing a bug is unlikely to be helpful.</p>
<p>An ability to detach yourself from your personal tastes and present a wider view of the critical landscape can also be beneficial. McGarvey describes this as the ability to externalise.</p>

<p>"Being able to divorce 'what do I think about this game' from 'what will people think about this game' is a really key component," he adds.</p>
<p>Denby mentions that it's helpful when evaluators simply write a review as they would for a publication, rather than trying to pre-empt what the developers might be looking for: "Just review it, imagine that this is what you were putting out there into the world, because that is ultimately what we're trying to gauge when we distribute this code – what's likely to happen."</p>
<p>Finally, for Attard, one of the most important qualities an evaluator can have is the ability to communicate effectively and forge positive working relationships with publishers.</p>
<p>"Some [evaluators] come back with things that aren't necessarily that positive, and [publishers] have to be able to accept what they're saying and not get frustrated or annoyed at them," Attard says. "That's where having a good relationship – where someone is able to really communicate with you about the process, or the reasons why they're saying these things – is key."</p>

        <p>Employees have shared news of closure on social media</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Sumo Group has reportedly closed Timbre Games.</p>
<p>This follows an announcement yesterday that <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sumo-group-to-reduce-staff-by-up-to-15">Sumo would be reducing staff by 15%</a>, putting nearly 250 employees at risk of redundancy.</p>
<p>The closure wasn't included in the announcement, but employees shared news of the studio's shut down on social media.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, we learned today that Timbre Games is closing and our entire studio's team of exceptionally talented and wonderful people will no longer be employed," recruitment coordinator Jenna Dore shared on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7206352897406607360/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
<p>"It has been a true blessing to work at Timbre, and I am so thankful to have gained such valuable experience and met all of the incredible humans I have come to know and love every day at work."</p>
<p>Technical director <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7206334477617274880/">Campbell Dixon</a> added: "It's been an incredible journey over the past three years, starting this studio from nothing and growing to a team of almost 100 people. I'm heartbroken and so disappointed that we won't be able to finish our game or show anyone the amazing work that we did."</p>
<p>Based in Vancouver, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sumo-opens-second-studio-in-canada">Timbre Games opened in 2021</a> as part of Pipework Studios, which <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sumo-group-acquires-pipeworks-for-usd100m">Sumo acquired for $100 million in September 2020</a>.</p>

In case you weren’t aware, though, you can’t jump straight into it unless you’ve at least managed to defeat two of the base game’s optional boss fights; a feat a significant number of players still haven’t done.</p> <p data-characters="567" data-current-count="567" data-injectable="true">During a <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/news/202402/22335199.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview with Famitsu</a> this past February, <em>Elden Ring</em> director Hidetaka Miyazaki revealed that, in order to access the <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> DLC and its new area, the Realm of Shadow, you need to have already killed Starscourge Radahn and Mohg, Lord of Blood. Sounds simple enough, but everyone knows that <em>Elden Ring</em>‘s boss fights are anything but simple or easy to beat. What’s more, you could very easily miss Mohg during your own playthrough, so be sure to read our guide on <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-beat-mohg-lord-of-blood-in-elden-ring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to find and beat Mohg</a> in case you haven’t done so already.</p>

On Twitter, <a href="https://x.com/CohhCarnage/status/1800313422535364790" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitch streamer Cohh Carnage</a> revealed that, on Steam, only 37.8% of players had acquired the Shardbearer Mohg achievement you get for killing Mohg. This prompted publisher Bandai Namco to <a href="https://x.com/BandaiNamcoUS/status/1800330011171496440" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">tweet out a warning/reminder</a> on June 11 and, since then, the number’s only gone up to 38.7% according to <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/stats/1245620/achievements" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official Steam stats</a>.</p>
 <p data-characters="563" data-current-count="563" data-injectable="true">Things look a bit better on PlayStation and Xbox.

Looking at the stats, there are also plenty of people that haven’t even defeated Radahn yet. At the time of writing, 54.5% of Steam players, 77% of PlayStation players, and 70% of Xbox players have received the Shardbearer Radahn achievement for beating him.</p>
 <p data-characters="471" data-current-count="471" data-injectable="false">It’s likely that a portion of those players simply dropped off <em>Elden Ring</em> sometime after buying it, and may have no intention of returning to the game. Fortunately, for those who do want to play the DLC and haven’t got round to defeating Radahn and/or Mohg, the <em>Elden Ring</em> community is full of people willing to share advice. Plus, the game has a summon mechanic that lets you call on other players for aid during fights, so be sure to take advantage of that.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/12/demons-mirror-is-like-two-games-for-the-price-of-one-and-it-actually-works/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>There are a lot of deckbuilding roguelikes out there, and there are also a fair few match-3 games out there, but to my knowledge, Demon’s Mirror is the only game that combines all of these ideas into one. It’s a fairly strange genre mashup, and one that I initially struggled to wrap my head around, but once it clicked, it all made sense.</p>
<p><iframe title="Demon's Mirror - Next Fest Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fqOYLReTfT4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Basically, you’ve got a character who has various cards they can use. Some of these will impact the enemies, some will impact you, and some will impact the board. You have to balance spending your available energy on cards and on matching things on the board. Every chain you create on the board costs one mana more than the one before, and then resets on the next turn. So, if you want to destroy an attach an enemy has placed on the board, you’ll need to keep that in mind.</p>


<p>As you chain things together on theboard, you can also reduce the cost of cards in your hands with the right passives, which will allow you to essentially cheat cards out for free if you play your, well, cards right. It’s a good mix of the two systems, and it does work pretty well for the most part. It’s hard to escape that feeling of “these two things shouldn’t be together,” but ultimately, Demon’s Mirror is a fair amount of fun to play.</p>


<p>Previewing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1600910/Demons_Mirror/">the Steam Next Fest demo</a> ahead of time, I could only access a small portion of what the game will offer, so I can’t speak for how powerful your builds can feel as you progress through different levels, but there are plenty of hints for how strong you can make yourself if you’re a good mix of lucky and smart. Even with only the first level to experiment with, I still found a few different playstyles to try out. There are also meant to be other characters as well, so that’s something to look forward to if this concept sinks its claws in.</p>
<p>Movement is your standard Slay the Spire affair, so you finish a battle, choose the next room, and so on. It’s a tried and tested method, and the only issue with it is that it feels so familiar when you’ve got a battle system that’s so unique. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, I just feel like we could have had something else in its stead, and Demon’s Mirror would stand out even more from the crowd.</p>

<p>Actually, I did have one other issue with it, and that’s that I wanted to keep playing! I don’t like repeating the same first level again and again, even though it changes between runs. I want to see how far a build can take me and explore the meta progression a bit more. That being said, when the biggest issue with a game preview is that you want to play more of it, it’s pretty clear that something special is going on. I’m very keen to see how Demon’s Mirror progresses, and you can try it out yourself now thanks to Steam Next Fest.</p>

            <p>US labour union the CWA (Communications Workers of America) have <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/communications-workers-america-files-unfair-labor-practice-charge-against-lionbridge">filed Unfair Labor Practice</a> charges against Activision QA supplier Lionbridge Technologies. As <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/cwa-accuses-activision-qa-supplier-lionbridge-of-retaliatory-layoffs">Game Developer</a> reports, the CWA allege that Lionbridge fired an entire 160-person team in Idaho in retaliation for union-related activities.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The CWA accuse Lionbridge, who also subcontract labour to Activision owner Microsoft, of making the layoffs "in retaliation for workers engaging in protected organizing activities and protected speech when raising issues regarding their working conditions."</p>
<p>It’s also alleged that, following the firings, Lionbridge offered severance that required the laid-off employees to "agree to overly broad confidentiality terms and to waive rights protected under the National Labor Relations Act." As the CWA point out, the US National Labor Relations Board has <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/news-outreach/news-story/board-rules-that-employers-may-not-offer-severance-agreements-requiring">ruled this practise to be unlawful</a>.</p>
<p>The laid-off workers were told that their termination occurred because the project they were working on had ended. Despite this, other teams in Mexico and Poland continue to work on the same project.  The CWA point out that Lionbridge has what they call a "documented union-busting track record." In 2016, Lionbridge <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2016/unionized-microsoft-supplier-to-close-lab-one-month-after-completing-first-contract/">laid of all 16 of its unionised employees</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/CWAUnion/status/1800537113831858437">Posting on X</a>, the CWA quoted former Lionbridge Test Associate Al Bussabarger. "We do much the same work that union-represented Activision QA employees do," reads the quote. "Microsoft should make sure that everyone working on its games is treated with respect in line with its labor principles, including employees of contractors." This post was to add additional context to the original CWA post on the filing against Lionbridge, made by the CODE-CWA, a "Tech, Games, and Digital Industries" group with support from the CWA.</p>
<p>In August of last year, the CODE-CWA <a href="https://x.com/CODE_CWA/status/1696518155336593704">announced</a> that there were more than 4,000 tech, game &amp; digital worker members in the CWA. We’ve seen an uptick in staff from large companies forming and voting in favour of unions in the past few years, notably in areas related to QA, including those at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cd-projekt-staff-form-union-after-layoffs-and-want-everybody-in-the-industry-to-join">CD Projekt</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-qa-contractors-vote-unanimously-to-unionise">Bioware Edmonton</a>,<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/blizzard-albany-qa-testers-vote-unanimously-in-favour-of-unionising"> Blizzard Albany</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zenimax-qa-workers-just-formed-the-largest-union-in-video-games">Zenimax</a>. </p>
<p>The Blizzard Albany workers, notably, faced pushback from Activision, which was shot down<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/activision-blizzard-appeal-against-blizzard-albany-qa-union-vote-rejected"> by the NLRB</a>. The CWA themselves filed an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/activision-blizzard-hit-with-another-unfair-labour-charge-from-cwa">unfair labour charge against Activision Blizzard</a> in October, 2022. In March of this year, staff at Sega Of America <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sega-of-america-staff-have-ratified-a-union-contract-the-first-to-do-so-at-a-major-us-studio">became the first such group to ratify a union contract</a> at a major US studio.</p>

        <p>"We're not sure when (or if) we will resurrect this great beast," co-founders say</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Armello developer League of Geeks has announced that it's going on a hiatus for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://leagueofgeeks.com/blog#gone-fishin">blog post</a> penned by Ty Carey, Trent Kusters, and Blake Mizzi, the co-founders announced that the team is going to take "extended time off" and that they're not sure "when (or if) [they] will resurrect this great beast," due to the current economic difficulties in the industry.</p>
<p>Solium Infernum, which released in February to critical acclaim, will continue to be supported with bug fixes and minor content updates, but "its sales revenue cannot fund further active development or DLC," they added.</p>
<p>Jumplight Odyssey, which <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/league-of-geeks-well-fight-till-the-last-breath">had been put on hold indefinitely in December</a> a few months after its Early Access release, will not go back into active development but will still get a full release within the next year.</p>
<p>"Jumplight Odyssey has, as of this point, not found workable and timely investment that would reinstate development on the title," the post read. "We would love nothing more than to see this project finished, but unfortunately, development will remain on hiatus.</p>
<p>"We are aiming to bring it out of Early Access at some point in the next 12 months. This is unlikely to be the fully realised v1.0 release we had originally planned, though we will try to find some way to tuck the game in with our limited, remaining resources."</p>
<p>Armello will continue to be online as well, with plans for the Armello board game unaffected by the changes as it's being handled by King of the Castle Games.</p>
<p>"The vast majority of our team have moved on to exciting new endeavours and those who remain are going to take a well deserved break over the next few months," the co-founders said.</p>
<p>They added: "Makin' <em>[sic]</em> video games is hard, excruciatingly hard these past few years, but the smart, lovely people we got to do it with, both inside LoG and out, made this crazy business worth it every single day."</p>
<p>We talked to Kusters in December as <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/league-of-geeks-well-fight-till-the-last-breath">League of Geeks cut off 50% of its workforce after an investment fell through</a>. We had <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/league-of-geeks-its-a-very-serious-time-for-a-studio-of-our-size">talked to the co-founder a couple of months before the news as well</a>, at the time highlighting just how much of a difficult time it was for large indie developers, due to lack of funding.</p>

		<p>Trailers, trailers, trailers. I know it’s been a long week for people that like to know what games are coming out in the next two years, but bear with me. I’ve got one more for you to watch, and it’s a good one! Handmancers is a roguelite deckbuilder, which isn’t all that unusual at this point, but this one does two things that make it stand out: first, it’s from a first-person perspective, so you can look your deckbuilding foes in the eye(s), and secondly, it looks absolutely lovely. This is a good thing.</p>
<p><iframe title="Handmancer Announcement Trailer - Demo Available Now" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eXhZ9T428so?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Coming from developer 58Blades, and published by Skystone Games, Handmancers plays on the fact that you’re using your hands to cast cards and spells, and that you can see them. You’ve got to craft your deck, level up your cards, and think about the strategy you’re going to employ to take down your enemies. There’s also powerful artefacts to equip – I’m guessing that these will grant you particular boons, or special attacks – so you’ll really have to think about your loadout and how your playstyle, deck and artefacts work together. There’s a trio of card types: Parchment, Stone and Blades, and I’m thinking that they’ll function like Fire Emblems weapon triangle. I could, of course, be entirely wrong. I’m more certain that being a roguelite, you can probably expect to lose fairly regularly too. It sounds great, and if you’re a fan of strategising and planning out your tactics then Handmancers could be a winner.</p>

<p>It also looks absolutely fantastic. The enemies and central characters look characterful and memorable, and there’s a vibrant, cartoonish strand to the art design. If the tactical gameplay stands up to the delightful visuals we’re going to be in for a treat.</p>

<p>If this all sounds like the perfect mix, 58Blades have released <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2423290/Handmancers/">a brand new demo</a> for you get a flavour of it all for yourself.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/major-epic-leak-hints-at-unannounced-games-coming-to-epic-games-store/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>[<strong>Update</strong>] After publishing our story, we received a statement from Epic on this matter (via an Epic PR agency):</p>
<p><em>“We released an update tonight so third-party tools can’t surface any new unpublished product titles from the Epic Games Store catalog.”</em></p>
<p>[<strong>Original story</strong>] A major Epic leak might hint at plenty of unannounced games coming to the Epic Games Store, including titles from major publishers.</p>
<p>Remember the NVIDIA GeForce Now leak <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-leak-lists-final-fantasy-vii-ix-remake-half-life-2-remastered-mgs2-hd-and-lots-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from some years ago</a>? Numerous high-profile titles were included in that leak, including former exclusives from Nintendo, Microsoft, and Nintendo. Fast forward three years, and we might now have another massive leak via EpicDB - a database project for the Epic Games Store. Interestingly enough, the host <a href="https://epicdb.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">of the database now appears to be down, and the page can't be accessed</a>. As <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-lot-of-unannounced-games-are-leaking-via-epicdb.898755/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a> by ResetEra user 'MondoMega' yesterday, the database apparently included plenty of details from yet-to-be-published games from a variety of publishers, including major ones such as Bethesda, Sega, Square Enix, Rockstar, but also PlayStation and Microsoft.</p>
<p>Although the NVIDIA GeForce Now leak included actual titles, this new leak includes mostly codenames for upcoming games. As such, it's quite hard to link a particular codename to a specified game, but on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ddua4x/epicdb_several_publisher_games_are_being_leaked/?share_id=6m1QV-LYimeoJ1TcX40o5&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reddit</a>, several users have gone a long way to try and find matches for the codenames. Notable titles on the recently updated list include The Last of Us Part II, as well as BioShock 4, possibly an Uncharted title, Red Dead Redemption 1, Rise of the Ronin (could also be Ghost of Tsushima), and many more. It should be noted, that the leak also includes now-cancelled games. Still, it's an interesting find, and we're pretty sure that it will be worth the read. We've included a part of the list below:</p>
<p><em><strong>SIE:</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Kondo (likely Rise of the Ronin, thanks Andybabez20. Could also be Ghost of Tsushima as multiple people mentioned!)</em></li>
<li><em>Carrack (this one is pretty interesting, a Carrack is a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrack" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">14th century sailing ship</a>. So I'm not sure what this could be. Maybe a Sea of Thieves like game?&nbsp;<strong>Edit: Could also be Uncharted, thank you 7373838jdjd</strong>)</em></li>
<li><em>Utah (This is the Last of Us Part 2, thank you AdFit6788)</em></li>
<li><em>RhodeIsland</em></li>

<p>SteamDB is a hugely valuable resource that anyone in the industry frequently leans on to ascertain player numbers, performance charts, price history, and much more. It’s a treasure trove of data that has been plugged into Steam’s APIs for years, picking up every tidbit and statistic that emerges from the relatively transparent platform.</p>



<p>Recently – and quite suddenly – EpicDB launched, bringing about a similar service for the Epic Games Store, one of Steam’s leading competitors on PC. However, as soon as the product hit the internet, countless details about unreleased games, unpublished DLCs, and upcoming projects were revealed through the APIs.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-mega-leak-time">Mega Leak Time</h2>



<p>In a monumental data repository, users are discovering that the EpicDB platform is giving away a little more than intended. Every item listed on the Epic Games Store has a space, and that space houses information about a title such as its performance on the platform, when it was first created as an item in the table, and when it was last updated – and with what.</p>



<p>Unfortunately for Epic Games, the service – which is operated by a third party – seems to be giving away more than intended. For instance, it has revealed references to The Last of Us Part II on PC, a Turok title from Saber Interactive, DLC for the unreleased Sonic x Shadow Generations, and a bunch of lines referring to the Final Fantasy IX Remake. For instance, nestled within the latter item are data points referring to a ‘Deluxe Upgrade’, some pre-order bonuses, and a series of game versions used for testing and debugging.</p>



<p>Most of the juicy content is hidden somewhat behind codenames, but there’s a lot that can be easily decoded. Some users have uncovered references to Morrowind (whatever that might mean), and there’s even a nod to ‘Bloodborne Remake’, but many have surmised that it’s a fake listing. </p>



<p>Sadly, it’s impossible to discover more at the time of writing <a href="https://epicdb.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">as the website</a> has been taken down and trying to access it yields little more than an error page. Only time will tell if it comes back up.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/alan-wake-ii-night-springs-dlc-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/alan-wake-ii-night-springs-dlc-review.898836/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/alan-wake-ii-night-springs-dlc-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Standalone in the dark.</h2></div><div><section><p>There certainly weren’t many flaws to shine a shaky flashlight beam on in Alan Wake II, but one thing I did lament in 2023’s excellent survival horror sequel was the total absence of Night Springs episodes on the in-game televisions. These quirky, Twilight Zone-inspired tales were a consistent joy to discover in Alan Wake’s original 2010 adventure, so to find them seemingly off the air as though they were the casualties of some sort of in-game writers’ strike was a touch disappointing. The good news is that the series has returned in a now fully-playable form thanks to the Alan Wake II: Night Springs DLC, which serves up three standalone stories that take us back to the small town of Bright Falls and beyond. They’re admittedly a little on the short side since I was able to knock all three episodes over in a single two-hour sitting, but I certainly had a blast with these twisted new nightmares while they lasted.</p><p>Night Springs’ first episode, Number One Fan, is definitely both the goofiest and goriest in the collection, allowing us to play as obsessive Alan Wake fan Rose Marigold as she waits tables in Bright Falls’ Oh Deer Diner. This action-heavy installment begins with Rose topping up coffee cups and clearing away pie crumb-covered plates, but she’s soon compelled to blaze a trail through a bloodthirsty mob after she’s sent an SOS from Alan Wake himself, who’s apparently been kidnapped. How does she receive this request for help? Via an unexpected transmission through the puckered maw of one of those wall-mounted Big Mouth Billy Bass singing fishes that thousands of disappointed dads unwrapped on Fathers Day in the year 2000. Yep, things in Night Springs are enjoyably off-kilter almost from the very outset.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Alan Wake II: Night Springs DLC Review screens</h3></div></output><p>Number One Fan completely strips the survival component out of Alan Wake II by strapping a fully automatic shotgun to Rose’s shoulder and lining the pockets of her apron with an almost limitless supply of shells. The whole episode takes place during the magic hour shortly before sunset so none of the enemies are cloaked in shadowy shields, and therefore there’s no need to burn the darkness away with a battery-hungry flashlight before you can dispatch them. Instead, the combat in Number One Fan swaps the series’ signature light-based fights for more high tempo running and gunning. Although its crunchy gunplay may be more straightforward, it still manages to be an ultra violent delight thanks to the campy ‘50s rock music that propels it and the cutesy quips that Rose spouts with each axe-wielding maniac she mulches – like she’s a pump-action-toting Princess Peach. Night Springs’ first episode kicks the collection off with a concussive sequence of skull-shattering bangs in Rose’s relentlessly entertaining and revved up rescue mission.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Night Springs’ first episode kicks the collection off with a concussive sequence of skull-shattering bangs.</p></div><h2>Guest Side Story  </h2><p>The second episode, North Star, slows the pace down considerably as you plunge into the inkiest depths of darkness you’d expect from an Alan Wake adventure. I was initially thrilled to step back into the shoes of Jesse Faden from Control here, however my enthusiasm took a bit of a hit when I realised that she hadn’t brought her amazing shape-shifting gun and spectacular suite of superpowers from the 2019 action epic along with her. Still, this midnight stalk through the creepy Coffee World theme park featured in Alan Wake II’s main campaign successfully ratchets up the tension after the comparatively carefree murder spree of the previous episode, arming Jesse with a flashlight and regular, non-transforming pistol as she is pit against the same spooky silhouettes that had me nervously shooting at shadows in last year’s game.</p><p>North Star is also the more puzzle-oriented of the episodes featured here, and I enjoyed cracking keypad codes and manipulating the mechanical controls of a ferris wheel during this brief investigation into the mysterious disappearance of Jesse’s brother. Still, I can’t help but feel that of the three episodes included in Night Springs, this second one is the least remarkable. It fails to leverage the jaw-dropping skill set of its guest star, and a lot of what transpires in it feels like well-made but fairly standard survival horror fare. This whole second episode effectively went down like a hot beverage from the Coffee World concession stand – stimulating enough, but it also left me with a slightly bitter taste in my mouth.</p><h2>Serling Silver</h2><p>Thankfully, Night Springs’ third and final episode, Time Breaker, is the best and boldest of the bunch and rounds out this collection in the most mind-bendingly meta way possible. Here we’re cast as the real-world actor Shawn Ashmore, who we find reprising his role as Sheriff Breaker from Alan Wake II in a brand new game being directed by developer Remedy Entertainment’s creative director, Sam Lake. During a break in production and after a hilarious moment with Lake giving an extremely self-aware and exhaustingly acronym-heavy explanation of his new game’s plot, Ashmore is blinked into another time and space by Night Springs’ Rod Serling stand-in and multiversal maestro, Mr. Door.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>What follows is a surreal string of sequences through ominous forest paths and disorientating hotel corridor loops, psychedelically shifting from the monochrome presentation of early television to the vivid colours of comic book paneling that seem to intentionally mirror Remedy’s past work on the Max Payne series. To say anything more would be to spoil too much, but there are some excellent story surprises and left-turn level designs to be found here that rival the most outside-of-the-box moments from the main Alan Wake II campaign, and it meant that Night Springs finished on a thoroughly hypnotic high note that left me wanting more.     </p><div data-cy="carousel"><h3>Tristan's Favourite Horror Games</h3><p>Intensity in ten entries.</p></div></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>Alan Wake II: Night Springs is a compact collection of standalone stories that veer from entertainingly violent shootouts, to tense stretches of survival horror, before settling on and reveling in the utterly batshit craziness that makes Remedy’s multiverse of madness so keenly absorbing to explore. There’s admittedly not much new here from a gameplay perspective, and it feels like a bit of a tease to play as a version of Control’s heroine stripped of her special abilities in the second episode. Even so, the highs I felt during my short return to Alan Wake’s universe greatly outweighed the lows, and I’d gladly play through another collection of bite-sized side stories if Remedy ever decided to bake another batch. Could there be more Night Springs in the future? Hope springs eternal. </p></div></div><div><div><h3 data-cy="object-review-title">Alan Wake II: Night Springs DLC Review</h3><div><p>great</p><p>Alan Wake II: Night Springs veers from ultra violence to tense survival horror, before settling into the multiversal madness of the series at its best.</p><a href="https://www.ign.com/person/tristan_ign_au" title="Tristan Ogilvie"><span></span><figcaption><p>Tristan Ogilvie</p></figcaption></a></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

  <p id="hMcu2l"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24171654/star-wars-acolyte-series-jedi-sol-force-powers-mind-reading"><em>The Acolyte</em></a>’s third episode brought up a whole lot more <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24171372/star-wars-high-republic-acolyte-when-timeline-what">questions than it answered</a>. For instance: What’s up with that Force Cult, how were Mae and Osha born, why are the Jedi here to begin with, why is the dialogue so bad, and what actually happened in that fire? But the most important question of all is: How in the hell did all that stone catch on fire?</p>
<p id="z5CjnH">Of course, Star Wars is a series full of deep and complex lore, so here are our best attempts to explain exactly how a mountain caught on fire in <em>The Acolyte</em>. </p>
<p id="5ga5CJ">[<strong>Ed. note:</strong> This post contains spoilers for <em>Star Wars: The Acolyte</em> episode 3.]</p>
<p id="r4iZHi">Before we get into explanations, it’s important that we go over the event in question a little bit first. The fire in the mountain on Brendok is the inciting incident for everything else that happens in <em>The Acolyte.</em> It’s what separates Mae and Osha, and what gives both of them their diametrically opposed views on the Jedi. So when we got the flashback in episode 3, it initially seemed like it might be a complex event, rife with childhood misunderstandings and missed perspective. Maybe from what Osha saw it seemed like Mae created the fire, while Mae saw that it was some kind of Jedi accident, leading to her hatred. </p>
<p id="uR4Sfu">Unfortunately, none of this is what actually happens in the episode. Instead, we see kid Mae clearly and emotionlessly say that she would rather kill her sister herself than see her leave, then set the entire mountain temple on fire. While the events that led up to the fire are a pretty extreme disappointment — even if the show could just be using this inexplicable child murderer plot as a smokescreen for a later surprise — it’s still somehow the fire itself that seems silliest. Mae takes Osha’s sketchbook, lights up its pages using a lamp, and then throws it into the stone hallway... which promptly ignites like it’s made of dry wood. Here’s where we have to meet the show way more than halfway. </p>
<h2 id="kyK8UL"><strong>Theory 1: The alternate-material theory </strong></h2>
<p id="CNmZJy">Perhaps what looked like stone inside the mountain was actually a different material? While most of the temple we see on Brendok in <em>The Acolyte</em>’s third episode appears to be carved straight into the mountain, maybe the coven of witches actually coated the interior tunnels of their home with some extremely flammable, non-rock material. </p>

<p id="MmrFC2">This is the silliest and most cop-out theory possible, but is also a little bit of an old-school Star Wars explanation too. Just like setting fires in space or the scream of TIE fighters, it’s something silly and fun that defies all explanations of Earthly science, and that’s fine. Of course, this would be a little easier to stomach if <em>The Acolyte</em> were taking itself a little less seriously, and if the fire in question didn’t leave so many of the people involved paralyzed with guilt, full of regret, dead-set on vengeance, or simply dead altogether. Silly problems are great to meet with silly answers, but tragedies deserve something a little more thought-out.  </p>
<h2 id="wBzCL8"><strong>Theory 2: The hidden-culprit theory </strong></h2>
<p id="BFVjCM">This theory revolves around the idea that what we saw in episode 3 was only part of the story. Sure, Mae made a childish, rash assertion that she wanted to kill her sister, but her sketchbook fire should have simply fizzled out, except that another perpetrator used the Force to spread the flames. </p>
<p id="bZ7f2S">The most-likely outcome of a theory like this would be that someone from Mae and Osha’s coven fanned the flames to try to get the girls out and blame the Jedi. The culprit here, probably, would be the Zabrak witch who seemed to be having a bit of a power struggle with the twins’ mom. Perhaps she’s stronger, and more dangerous, then she appeared and simply decided that destroying the coven’s home and splitting up Mae and Osha would be the witches’ only path forward. She could even be the dark figure training Mae in the future and tasking her with killing the Jedi who visited Brendok.</p>
<p id="ytwaoA">An even more exciting version of this theory, however, is that all this destruction was caused by the Jedi all along. Mae, despite her horrific proclamation that she was going to murder the only other child she’d ever known, was mostly blameless and was instead set up and then left to die by a band of Jedi desperate to get their hands on a promising new recruit. This would be genuinely shocking. Not out of line entirely with the dark edges lurking around the Jedi in Star Wars canon (after all, how <em>do </em>they get all those youngling recruits?), but still more gutsy and interesting than almost anything we’ve seen of them on screen. </p>

<p id="gj4aY3">Making the Jedi the true villains of the Brendok fire would mark a meaningful indictment of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24173217/star-wars-high-republic-temptation-of-the-force-tessa-gratton-excerpt">High Republic Jedi</a>, an example of them determining themselves to be judge, jury, and executioner for this extremist outlier cult. Just because they determined the cult to be wrong, they massacred everyone there and attempted to steal both children, but when even that proved too difficult, they simply took one and left the other to die. </p>
<p id="eURhjz">Even in spite of what would be the show’s silly attempt at misdirection, and its often frustratingly wooden dialogue or samey characters, this reveal would be a genuinely exciting one. A real, daring stance on a certain era of Jedi history that, at least in some sectors of the galaxy, was far darker than we had ever thought possible. </p>
<h2 id="XPQnft"><strong>Theory 3: The Disney’s Star Wars theory </strong></h2>
<p id="6folEM">The third theory is the simplest of all: <em>The Acolyte</em> is simply a deeply unserious show, interested in saying something new about the Jedi, the Force, or the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/23462255/andor-anto-kreegyr-rebels-luthen-anton-krieger">Star Wars universe more broadly</a>, but too concerned with appearances to get the details right — both in terms of storytelling and lore. This theory suggests that there’s no more to the events than we saw on screen: Mae lit a fire in an attempt to kill her sister; it got bigger than she thought and had far-reaching consequences that she blames on the Jedi while shirking her own part in it. With this theory, even if the Jedi did a few things wrong, it would still wash out, with most of them being heroic in the end, leaving everything basically in the same place it started. </p>

</p>
<p id="xI82xM">On paper, this theory would be a profound disappointment. In practice, however, it just feels like what we should expect from most modern Star Wars stories. These projects <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/23475574/andor-luthen-stellan-skarsgard-finale-star-wars-character">rarely have the guts to really shake up the franchise</a> and introduce something truly shocking, instead always bringing the status quo back at the end, or simply <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24167362/star-wars-acolyte-high-republic-future">pushing toward events we already know the outcome of</a>. </p>
<p id="VS74qj">Star Wars is firmly in an era of stagnation. So hoping for something fun, interesting, or daring out of a very silly-looking fire, even if it’s set in a totally new time period, is probably a little more than we should expect from the series at this point. Instead, it’s hard not to imagine that <em>The Acolyte</em>’s biggest moment so far is nothing more than rock that inexplicably caught fire because the plot needed it to. </p>

Now, Sega is going back to one of their most critically acclaimed Sonic titles with a re-release of Sonic Generations that includes new content in the form of Shadow the Hedgehog levels. And much to my surprise, that new content is incredibly fun.</p><p>The Summer Games Fest demo for Sonic + Shadow Generations separates the two Sonic levels from Shadow’s newly-built content. For Sonic, the two courses available were Green Hill Zone as Classic Sonic and Green Hill Zone as Modern Sonic. To call these levels drastically different, or even slightly different, from the original release of Sonic Generations would probably be a stretch. Both Green Hill Zone stages are functionally the original release running at a higher resolution. This is not a remake of Sonic Generations in any way and it should not be expected to be one.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Sonic X Shadow Generation State of Play Trailer</h3></div></output><p>That said, Sonic Generations is popular for a reason, and both these levels were still fun to play. In the Classic Sonic version, the shorter and apparently younger Sonic goes through a traditional version of Green Hill Zone that could have been pulled out of any of the older 2D titles. Modern Sonic, meanwhile, grinds on rails, stunts on enemies, and escapes from a giant robotic fish in the air while boosting through. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I cannot overstate how unnecessarily hard Sega goes on these Shadow levels. </p></div><p>The Shadow side is where the Sonic + Shadow Generations gets interesting, providing brand new and more modern content in Shadow’s own revisiting of his past. The only platforming stage available for Shadow is Space Colony Ark paired with the boss fight for the Biolizard, both from his debut game of Sonic Adventure 2. The latter level was in the 3DS version of Sonic Generations, but this was made from the ground up for this release and is not ported from that 3DS version.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>In Space Colony Ark, the level pingpongs Shadow along a massive space colony. It tutorializes Shadow's Chaos Control ability, which freezes time and all objects around him to attack or use as platforms. A missile barrage coming from an enemy cannon can be an option to get to a new path with proper use of Chaos Control, which is time-limited. If you fail, it’s just one more reason to replay the level and try to get better.</p><p>Through the Ark, Shadow will occasionally engage in cinematic moments, like using Chaos Control on a missile so large that he has to punch it numerous times to send it backwards into the space fortress it came from, blowing it up.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Halfway through the level, a familiar alien creature visits Shadow, transforming the world around him. He lands in a crimson city that looks similar to Westopolis from Shadow’s own game from 2005. As Shadow chases the alien nemesis through a world literally being built around them, the speedster hedgehog interrogates the villain through ambient dialogue and short cinematic scenes. For the Shadow fans in the audience, you need not worry that they dialed back the story for this iteration.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The ending of the Biolizard boss fight does not cease to be cool even if it has been used before.</p></div><p>The other Shadow level, the boss fight with the Biolizard, is less ambitious but still fun. It is a standard Sonic series boss fight that largely involves dodging energy waves on the ground and then jumping up to the boss’ weak point for some punches and kicks the way Shadow loves to do. The ending once again has Shadow beating up a large blast of energy back to the opponent, but it does not cease to be cool even if it has been used before.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>At the end of every phase, Shadow uses his homing attack to reach the top of the Biolizard’s back and deliver major damage. It’s a classic Sonic boss fight trope, but the act of making it up there still feels frantic and fun.</p><p>I cannot overstate how unnecessarily hard Sega goes on these Shadow levels. For what feels like a small addendum to an otherwise no-frills release, it is clear Sega is trying to make something decently memorable within the series for the Sonic Generations’ new content. It might be a trite comparison that makes veterans of the 16-bit console war bristle, but like Bowser’s Fury was the standout inclusion with Super Mario 3D World on Switch, I suspect that Shadow’s levels will steal the show for Sonic Generations. </p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Epic Games is readying a new Lego Fortnite update, set to arrive on 13th June, that'll expand the brick-based survival mode with two new difficulty settings catering to polar opposite tastes.
</p>
<p>
First up is Lego Fortnite's new Cozy Mode, designed to offer a laidback experience somewhere between the peril-free japes of Sandbox Mode and the standard-difficulty Survival Mode. Cozy Mode's default settings give players a smattering of combat to keep them on their toes, but with enemies set to easy and all survival meters - hunger, temperature, and stamina - disabled.
</p>
<p>
"Whether you're a beginner survivor or a builder who likes a little bit of thrill," Epic explains on its website, "Cozy mode's up your alley! Create a world and get greeted by Slumber, a friendly face who’ll guide you through your journey step-by-step."
</p>

<p>
At the other end of the spectrum, fearless players wanting to really ramp up the survival challenge also get a new option in Lego Fortnite's v30.10 update, this time in the form of a permadeath Expert Mode. Central to this brutal new offering are Storm-Wild enemies - new opponents that do more damage, have more health, and move faster than standard enemies - but Expert Mode gives the latter a boost, increasing their strength, too.
</p>
<p>
The big challenge, though, comes from that permadeath mechanic. If a player loses all their hearts, they'll be permanently eliminated from their world - but there's a way to avoid that devastating fate. Anyone carrying a Totem of Return upon death is revived in their bed with their backpack, whereupon the totem will be immediately destroyed.
</p>
<p>
Players brave enough to face Expert mode will have the chance to earn three new trophies - the Grasslands Trophy, Dry Valley Trophy, and Frostlands Trophy - each unlocking after defeating a biome specific Storm-Wild Brute then interacting with a Level 10 village.
</p>
<p>
And that's on top of the various Lego Fortnite improvements, adjustments, and bug fixes included in the new update. These range from clearer error messages - specifying low memory issues or instances when too many constructs are nearby - to swimming wolves and reduced skeleton spawns in villages. Full patch notes can be <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/lego-fortnite-v30-10-adds-cozy-mode-and-expert-mode">found on the Fortnite website</a>.
</p>
<p>
Fortnite's latest season, the Mad-Max-inspired Chapter 5 Season 3, is currently underway, bringing with it a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-is-coming-to-fortnite">timely Fallout crossover</a> and - according to data miners - an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-new-season-adds-fallout-nuka-cola-as-files-point-to-upcoming-pirates-of-the-caribbean-crossover">upcoming Pirates of the Caribbean crossover</a>. The latter inclusion tallies with a previously leaked roadmap detailing Fortnite's plans for 2024 - a roadmap whose veracity has seemed increasingly likely since Fortnite's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/billie-eilish-coming-to-fortnite-adding-weight-to-a-much-discussed-leak">Billie Eilish crossover</a> went live in April.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/all-elder-scrolls-5-skyrim-editions-in-order<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Quickly becoming Bethesda Game Studio's most successful release and one of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-selling-video-games-of-all-time-grand-theft-auto-minecraft-tetris">best-selling games of all time</a>, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim has remained a fixture of the company's lineup even years after it hit shelves, with the studio repackaging and reselling it multiple times. From handheld ports and next-gen upgrades to full-on VR recreations, Skyrim is a game that you can play pretty much anywhere at this point.</p><p>But, with so many versions of Skyrim to choose from, which should you play in 2024? With multiple editions spread across PlayStation, Xbox, PC and even Switch, it can be tricky to know which release of the game is best suited for the experience you're searching for. Luckily, we've got you covered. Below, we've put together a full guide on all the versions of Skyrim currently available and what's included in each package. You should have plenty of time to play it before <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elder-scrolls-6-latest-news-trailers-rumors-release-date">The Elder Scrolls 6</a> arrives.</p><h2>How Many Versions of Skyrim Are There?</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/05/01/skyrimspecialedition-1280-1510795773755-1626181651526-1682920471357.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>In total, there have been <strong>seven </strong>unique releases of Skyrim released across nine different platforms. One of these is a version completely playable through Amazon Alexa known as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/06/11/e3-2018-amazon-alexa-skyrim-very-special-edition-is-actually-real">Skyrim: Very Special Edition</a>, which functioned entirely through voice commands. It was largely released as a simple, fun nod to the countless memes about how frequently Skyrim was remastered and, although we can appreciate Alexa dryly describing your epic showdown with a wandering Mudcrab, we won't include it in the list.</p><p>We'll also be moving past 2013's <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/06/06/skyrim-legendary-edition-now-available">Skyrim: Legendary Edition</a>, which was a bundle including the base release of the game and its three expansions. With the release of Special Edition in 2016, Legendary Edition was delisted from Steam. Although you can technically still buy second-hand physical copies of this version on Xbox 360 and PS3, it's not a product Bethesda still sells and so it's one we'll skip over.</p><p>That leaves us with <strong>five</strong> different versions of Skyrim to run through. So, without further ado, let's get started.</p><h2>Every Skyrim Edtion in Order</h2><h3>1. Skyrim - PC, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 (2011)</h3><a href="https://assets2.ignimgs.com/2016/06/12/skyrimspecialedition04riverwoodjpg-9d0ddd.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The first version of <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a> that launched all the way back in 2011, the standard edition is about as vanilla as Skyrim gets. Launching on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and PC, it laid the foundation for the game's various updated ports in the years following its launch. However, in 2024, it's probably not worth seeking out.</p><p>Unless you still have an Xbox 360 or PS3 to hand, this will mostly be an option for PC players, and even then, most digital PC storefronts don't even have it appear in their search bars following the release of Skyrim: Special Edition. As for why, It comes bundled with none of the expansions or the visual and gameplay updates that were included in the more modern versions of the game. Considering Special Edition Skrim is quite frequently discounted on storefronts like Steam and GOG, the Standard Edition has been made slightly redundant in the years since.</p><p>That being said, if you're looking to tap into Skyrim's older modding scene, it may still be worth checking out. On both Steam Workshop and Nexus, you'll find mods for the original version of the game, and while they may not be as advanced as the mods that can be built on Special Edition, there's a ton of them to try out.</p><h3>2. Skyrim: Special Edition - PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X (2016)</h3><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2012/06/07/gargoylejpg-acfe7c.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Launching five years after the standard edition, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-special-edition">Skyrim: Special Edition</a> is the most common version of the game currently available. Bundled in this version, you'll get all three of the game's major expansions, Dawnguard, Hearthfire and Dragonborn, as well as <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/skyrim-special-edition-official-gameplay-trailer-2">a suite of visual upgrades</a>, including remastered textures and vastly upgraded lighting.</p><p>One of the biggest additions is access to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-skyrim-se-mods">the Creations tab</a>, which allows you to download free mods made by the community as well as paid Creation Club content packs licensed by Bethesda. This feature is included on console too, meaning you can finally get a taste of the game's modding scene without needing to play the game on PC. Skyrim: Special Edition is often discounted on console and PC, but it can also be downloaded through <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-much-does-xbox-game-pass-cost">Xbox Game Pass</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-plus-tiers-explained-ps5-ps-plus">PlayStation Plus Extra</a>, making it one of the easiest versions to get your hands on.</p><p>This really is the core version you'll be looking at if you just want a no frills, standard Skyrim experience with all the quality of life updates that come with more modern hardware. It's easy to get either through subscription services or sales, and has all of the expansion content included, as well as the option to extend your playtime or mix things up with in-built access to mods.</p><h3>3. Skyrim: Special Edition (Nintendo Switch) - Switch (2017)</h3><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2017/06/12/skyrimswitch-shield-watermark-1497051957-1497246732781.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Although technically another port of Skyrim: Special Edition, the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/03/skyrim-on-switch-is-everything-you-hoped-it-would-be">Nintendo Switch version</a> deserves its own spot on the list for being a full handheld port that you can play on the go.</p><p>The Switch release also has a few unique features outside of its portability. Players can switch on motion controls, using the JoyCon to attack with a sword or pull back the string of a bow, while the game also includes unique <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-5-skyrim/Zelda_Gear,_Master_Sword,_and_Amiibo_Unlockables">Zelda-themed items</a>, including Link's tunic, a Hylian Shield and the Master Sword. If you're looking to clear a few dungeons on your commute to work, this is the version for you.</p><h3>4. Skyrim VR - PC, PlayStation 4 (2017)</h3><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2017/06/28/skyrimvr-magic-watermark-1497052192-1498692124608.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Just a year after the release of Special Edition, Bethesda decided to release an alternate version of Skyrim that would ramp up its immersion to new heights. This new port was <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-vr">Skyrim VR</a>, which does exactly what it says on the tin. Using a PSVR or Windows-based headset, players can hop into Skyrim's world recreated in virtual reality, allowing them to explore its icy plains from a new perspective.</p><p>Skyrim VR includes the full base game and its expansions while implementing motion controls, with players using VR controllers to swing swords, draw bows and pick up items. In essence, it's another version of Special Edition but fully experienced through a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-vr-headset">VR headset</a>, so if you want a new way to explore Skyrim and have the tech necessary to play it, it could be one to try out.</p><h3>5. Skyrim: Anniversary Edition - PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, Switch (2021)</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2021/11/05/image-2021-11-05-145823-1636124304089.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The latest version of Skyrim, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-anniversary-edition">Skyrim: Anniversary Edition</a> launched in 2021 to celebrate the game's ten-year anniversary. In essence, it's more of an expansion to Special Edition than a full-fledged remaster, bundling together a list of over <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-anniversary-edition-and-new-creations-detailed">70 Creation Club mods</a> for a discounted price. Included are new quests, weapons, armor sets, houses, enemies, dungeons, spells and features, alongside a lot more.</p><p>You can buy Skyrim: Anniversary Edition as a full game, but if you already own Skyrim: Special Edition, you can upgrade to the Anniversary edition for a lower cost instead. Anniversary Edition definitely isn't an essential add-on to the game, but if you've already wandered the world of Skyrim for years at this point and want to freshen things up for your next playthrough, it's worth a look.</p><p><em>Callum Williams is a  freelance media writer with years of experience as a game critic, news reporter, guides writer and features writer.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/assassins-creed-shadows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> is the next big RPG in the series from the team at Ubisoft Quebec, and the rule for recent RPG-style entries in the series has been “bigger is better.” <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/assassins-creed-origins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Assassin’s Creed Origins was big</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/assassins-creed-odyssey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Assassin’s Creed Odyssey</a> was bigger, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/assassins-creed-valhalla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Assassin’s Creed Valhalla</a> was perhaps even a bit larger. So, does Ubisoft plan to push the scope even further for AC Shadows? Thankfully for those who found some recent AC games a bit overwhelming, the answer is no.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/assassins-creed-shadows-japan-is-roughly-similar-in-size-to-egypt-in-origins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent Video Games Chronicle interview</a> with Ubisoft Quebec’s Simon Lemay-Comtois, Assassin’s Creed Shadows scales things back to a map “roughly similar to Origins.” Mind you, AC Origins still had a very sizable 80km² world, but at least the map inflation is being curtailed somewhat.</p>
<p>Lemay-Comtois further detailed what part of Japan the game focuses on, as Ubisoft won’t be trying to render all of Japan, despite the nation’s relatively compact size.</p>
<p><em>“The story that we focus on is mostly on central Japan, so we don’t expand all the way to the entirety of Japan, so therefore we knew we had a rough idea for the territory we wanted to cover. So, something important happens in Kyoto, something important happens in Osaka, Azuchi – we need these places, so how faithful to these castles can we be, because they’re very interesting, so we build out those castles, they have a very big footprint.</em></p>
<p><em>And then we think about how much of the world do we need between those castles so that it becomes credible and feels like an adventure as you move between them, and it doesn’t take a real four days of horseback riding to get from one to the other. So, it’s kind of a tricky thing to develop, but eventually we find our footing with the types of cities and castles that we want to represent and that’s what justifies the size of our world map.”</em></p>
<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows sneaks onto PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PS5 on November 15. Yesterday Ubisoft shared over <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-13-minutes-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first footage of its samurai and ninja protagonists in action</a>.</p>

                <p>Epic recently announced that it will add difficulty settings to its survival game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/">Lego Fortnite</a>, with the v30.10 update later this week, on Thursday, June 13.</p><p dir="ltr">The v30.10 update will introduce Cozy and Expert mode.

As detailed by a <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/lego-fortnite-v30-10-adds-cozy-mode-and-expert-mode" rel="nofollow ">Fortnite blog post</a>, Cozy mode is primarily meant for those who are new to survival games and aren't looking for too much of a challenge.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, Expert mode will be catered to those looking for more of a challenge. In this mode, Storm-Wild creatures will do more damage, receive more health, and move faster than normal enemies. In addition to storm enemies receiving a buff, permadeath will be enabled in Expert mode. But if they have a Totem of Return equipped, they'll spawn back at their bed with their backpack.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite all the new hardships Expert mode players will have to endure, it isn't all bad, because they'll be able to unlock three trophies to show off. The trophies players will be able to unlock will consist of accomplishments tied to the Grasslands, Dry Valley, and Frostlands. To unlock them, they'll need to defeat the biome-specific Storm-Wild Brute and then interact with said biome village at level 10.</p><p dir="ltr">For more Fortnite content, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-chapter-5-season-3-the-best-landing-spots-during-wrecked/2900-5459/#1">gallery highlighting the best spots to land for Chapter 5 Season 3</a>.</p>

It requires doing a lot of exploring, fighting, and intuiting, and by the end, you'll know the new destination pretty intimately.</p><p dir="ltr">After spending a whole lot of time in the Pale Heart of the Traveler, we've narrowed down exactly how to get everything you need to unlock Khvostov and where it's all hidden. You'll first need to find all the hidden Region Chests, then complete all six variations of the Alone in the Dark quests, and <em>then</em> find a bunch more hidden collectibles. Here's everything you need to know to find just about everything in the Pale Heart of the Traveler and walk away with Khvostov for your troubles.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Step_1__Region_Chests">Step 1: Region Chests</a><ul><li><a href="#The_Landing_Region_Chest_Locations">The Landing Region Chest Locations</a></li><li><a href="#The_Blooming_Region_Chest_Locations">The Blooming Region Chest Locations</a></li><li><a href="#The_Impasse_Region_Chest_Locations">The Impasse Region Chest Locations</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Step_2__Search_All_Six_Cysts">Step 2: Search All Six Cysts</a><ul><li><a href="#Searing_Light_Cyst_Encryption_Location">Searing Light Cyst Encryption Location</a></li><li><a href="#Slayer_Lost_Cyst_Encryption_Location">Slayer Lost Cyst Encryption Location</a></li><li><a href="#Aerial_Ace_Lost_Cyst_Encryption_Location">Aerial Ace Lost Cyst Encryption Location</a></li><li><a href="#Pervading_Darkness_Cyst_Encryption_Location">Pervading Darkness Cyst Encryption Location</a></li><li><a href="#Sword_Dance_Cyst_Encryption_Location">Sword Dance Cyst Encryption Location</a></li><li><a href="#Moth_Infested_Cavern">Moth-Infested Cavern</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Step_3__Claim_The_Legendary_Version_Of_Khvostov">Step 3: Claim The Legendary Version Of Khvostov</a></li><li><a href="#Step_4__Collect_All_8_Visions_Of_The_Traveler">Step 4: Collect All 8 Visions Of The Traveler</a></li><li><a href="#Step_5__Complete_Overthrows_In_Each_Pale_Heart_Location">Step 5: Complete Overthrows In Each Pale Heart Location</a></li><li><a href="#Step_6__Open_The_Golden_Chest">Step 6: Open The Golden Chest</a></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="Step_1__Region_Chests">Step 1: Region Chests</h2><p dir="ltr">The easiest part of this whole undertaking is tracking down all nine Region Chests hidden throughout the Pale Heart. These are usually in weird and out-of-the-way places, but they're marked on your map so you'll at least know where to go when you start your hunt. Region Chests are indicated by the little plus signs on your map, which will give you a good starting point. There are three chests in each of the main Pale Heart areas: The Landing, The Blooming, and The Impasse. Each will give you a piece of an encrypted key. You're looking for 15 of these, and the first nine come from Region Chests.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="The_Landing_Region_Chest_Locations">The Landing Region Chest Locations</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>The Landing Chest 1</strong> - From the transmat zone, turn right and go up the stairs. Ahead is a cave and, beside that, a basin area where water is pooling and enemies are hanging out. If you look up, you'll see a building stuck into the wall with a round facade and a balcony-like space, too high to immediately reach. That's where you're headed.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4317387-destiny2thelandingclimbingtochest1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4317387" data-ratio="0.56338028169014" data-width="1917" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4317387-destiny2thelandingclimbingtochest1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4317387"></a><figcaption>Look for small ledges on this wall to climb up to the building above.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4317387-destiny2thelandingclimbingtochest1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">To the left of the building, you should see some ledges jutting out from the woody wall, which you can reach from the high ground across the pool.

Each one drops from a boss in Overthrow, the new patrol activity you can complete in the Pale Heart. To get them, you just need to run complete, four-stage Overthrows in each of the Pale Heart locations that feature them: The Landing, The Blooming, and The Impasse.</p><p dir="ltr">While these can take a while to complete, you don't have to do anything special to get through them, nor do you have to wait a particularly long time to get all those Motes. Each consecutive Overthrow you run in a location will rotate the boss, so you can do three Overthrows in a row in one location to get all three Motes for that spot. The bosses drop them, so look for them on the ground (they're purple diamonds).</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie has noted that if you get your final Mote from a particular boss in The Landing, it can bug the process, so do that set first, just to be safe.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Step_6__Open_The_Golden_Chest">Step 6: Open The Golden Chest</h2><p dir="ltr">With all the Motes in-hand, you'll get a new version that combines them into a single item. Return to the Tower in the Lost City and head to the room where you dropped the Visions of the Traveler. You should now be able to open the final golden chest, finally earning you the Exotic Khvostov 7G-0X.</p><p dir="ltr">Check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-guides-hub/1100-6523936/" data-ref-id="1100-6523936">Final Shape guide hub</a> for even more coverage of the latest Destiny 2 expansion.</p>
