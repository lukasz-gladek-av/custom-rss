<figure><a title="Terminator 2D: NO FATE" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a4c73a00baf37/terminator-2d-no-fate.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Reef Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure><p>Reef Entertainment and Bitmap Bureau's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/terminator_2d_no_fate">Terminator 2D: NO FATE</a> has been delayed due to coordination and manufacturing issues with the physical release.</p>
<p>Now coming on <strong>31st October 2025</strong> — as opposed to its original 5th September release date — publisher Reef apologised for the delay and thanked fans "for bearing with us".</p>
<p>The delay affects both the physical and digital version of the game, and will allow "the team at Bitmap Bureau extra time to apply some final polish to the game itself".</p>
<p>"We would like all players to have the opportunity to experience the best version of <em>Terminator 2D: NO FATE</em> together", Reef concludes, praising fans hype and support for the pixel art arcade-style game.</p>

<p>We're more than happy to wait; this is one of our most-anticipated games of the year, so while we're champing at the bit to get our hands on it, we're sure the final game will be worth it.</p>
<p>We spent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/its-like-on-steroids-versus-our-previous-titles-how-terminator-2d-no-fate-changes-the-past-and-future">a good chunk of time chatting to the devs of Terminator 2D</a> about how the game is much, <em>much</em> bigger than anything Bitmap has tackled before, and just how you balance inspiration with faithfulness.</p>
<p><em>Let us know what you think of the delay in the comments</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> boxed set has been announced. In collaboration with Netflix, Wizards of the Coast is producing <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Welcome to the Hellfire Club</em>, a box packed with adventures taken straight from the world of their hit series, <em>Stranger Things</em>.</p>



<p>In an official press release, Wizards of the Coast's Managing Game Director, Justice Arman, explained that <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Welcome to the Hellfire Club</em> is not unlike <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-dungeons-dragons-heroes-of-borderlands-starter-set-is-biggest-yet" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">other starter sets</a> available. It contains five pregenerated characters, four prewritten adventures, multiple monster and character tokens, and reference cards for different monsters, spells, and magic items.</p>

The adventures, monsters, and game pieces are all pulled straight from the Netflix series, Stranger Things. Specifically, the material is based on the character Eddie Munson from Season 4, the rock-music-loving head of the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> group, the Hellfire Club.</p>

<p><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Welcome to the Hellfire Club</em> is packed with inside references to the Netflix series. Every piece in the set is drawn in a distinct artstyle invoking the 1980s. The adventures will include creatures from the show like the Demobat and the Demodogs as well as a new creature from the Upside Down. In addition, each adventure is loosely based on <em>Stranger Things'</em> four seasons.</p>

<p>The set even includes a double-sided map of Greyhawkins, a fantasy world created by Munson. The name is a portmanteau of the iconic <em>D&amp;D</em> setting Greyhawk and Hawkins, the small town where <em>Stranger Things</em> is set.</p>

<p><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> has been a key part of <em>Stranger Things</em> since its debut in 2016. The main cast aren't just avid players, but promote the fantasy TTRPG's core values of communication and teamwork to confront larger-than-life threats. Several of the series' major antagonists even share names with certain <em>D&amp;D</em> baddies, like Demogorgon, Mind Flayers, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interview/liches-vecna-and-stranger-things-our-time-with-chris-perkins" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">and Vecna</a>.</p>

<p><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Welcome to the Hellfire Club</em> well release on October 7 at an MSRP of $49.99. The set will also be available digitally on D&amp;D Beyond. The release coincides with the premiere of Stranger Things' fifth and final season on November 26.</p>

It’s a four-cost White Artifact Creature that essentially arrives with +1/+1 counters and can proliferate, making it an ideal fit for the Blitzball star’s deck.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s gone from being a couple of dollars not long ago to climbing to around $15.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next up, <a href="https://zdcs.link/akKEq3?object_uuid=ab0c3354-8393-4fa0-87f4-a32795436496&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Magistrate’s Scepter</u></a> is a 3-cost artifact that can be powered up with charge counters then used to take an entire extra turn. Given how quickly Tidus can get those counters, this Core Set 2019 card is now up to $5 from just a few cents a few weeks ago.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Away from counters, I’m pleased to see <a href="https://zdcs.link/av4JjP?object_uuid=ab0c3354-8393-4fa0-87f4-a32795436496&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Stoneforge Mystic</u></a> climbing. This two-cost card (of which I have a lovely full-art version) is an ideal inclusion in the Limit Break deck with its equipment focus, and lets you find your equipment more quickly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s gone from being less than $20 to up to around $50 in recent listings, often more. And, on a similar note, <a href="https://zdcs.link/QVXdkO?object_uuid=ab0c3354-8393-4fa0-87f4-a32795436496&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Codsworth, Handy Helper</u></a> from the Universes Beyond: Fallout set is still maintaining a price of around $20.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">TCGPlayer has also pointed out that one Edge of Eternities card is likely to be very popular for anyone playing a Slivers deck.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/9YWgql?object_uuid=ab0c3354-8393-4fa0-87f4-a32795436496&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Thrumming Hivepool </u></a>costs less the more of the Sliver type you have, gives them double strike and haste, and creates more Sliver tokens at your upkeep phase. Put it all together, and you’re generating a veritable army within a couple of turns in the mid to late game.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Crashers: No Harmonic Done</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, we pointed out that <a href="https://zdcs.link/91jZnx?object_uuid=ab0c3354-8393-4fa0-87f4-a32795436496&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Vivi Ornitier</u></a> had begun dropping again, and then its value climbed a bit, but the same can’t be said of <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJglxG?object_uuid=ab0c3354-8393-4fa0-87f4-a32795436496&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Harmonic Prodigy</u></a> which remains great to pair with him.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s down to around $10, and could be ideal for any Wizard-based spellcaster decks you’re puting together.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As we close out the Final Fantasy era, we’re seeing other drops, too. One to keep an eye on for your White decks is <a href="https://zdcs.link/aBg8gV?object_uuid=ab0c3354-8393-4fa0-87f4-a32795436496&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Summon: Knights of Round</u></a>. This fan-favorite spiked in June but has levelled out at around $30 and could drop further.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another Summon, <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qdb8bx?object_uuid=ab0c3354-8393-4fa0-87f4-a32795436496&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Bahamut</u></a>, is also on the way down having now hit around $26. It’s still dropping, too, and given it can be an ideal ‘big finish’ to a game (and has 9/9 for its stats), it’s worth a look.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, <a href="https://zdcs.link/Q4755k?object_uuid=ab0c3354-8393-4fa0-87f4-a32795436496&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Tifa Lockhart</u></a> has also seen a drop. She’s down to around $5, having been double that just a few weeks ago.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lloyd Coombes is an experienced freelancer in tech, gaming and fitness seen at Polygon, Eurogamer, Macworld, TechRadar and many more. He's a big fan of Magic: The Gathering and other collectible card games, much to his wife's dismay.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/splitgate-2-will-go-back-to-beta-to-undergo-a-massive-rework-amid-more-layoffs-and-splitgate-1-shutdown</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">On June 6, 2025, 1047 Games launched Splitgate 2. Now, less than two months later, the developer is about to “unlaunch” it. It's also taking Splitgate 1 offline, and laying off 45 employees.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today, 1047 revealed its plans to temporarily wind down support on the game it just released so the studio can go heads-down on what it says will be a complete overhaul of Splitgate 2. The game will remain playable during this time, and will still receive its promised Chapter 3 update and some bug fixes, but other than that, Splitgate 2 as we know it is done.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">…That is, until early 2026, when the studio promises it will return with “big, sweeping changes.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While all this sounds pretty dire, it might not come as a surprise to Splitgate 2 players. The game launched to middling reviews, was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splitgate-2-director-refuses-to-apologize-for-make-fps-great-again-hat-then-apologizes-anyway"><u>mired in controversy from the jump</u></a>, and has since seen a steep drop-off in players and plenty of criticism and frustration from those who stuck around. At the time this piece was first drafted, a quick look at the main page of the Splitgate subreddit shows almost nothing but complaints about the game, memes about the game’s general state, and various threads and links to articles about the sinking player counts. It doesn’t paint a pretty picture.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When I spoke to CEO Ian Proulx last week, he referenced one particular Reddit thread entitled “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Splitgate/comments/1lzfv20/if_youve_stopped_playing_tell_me_why/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>If you’ve stopped playing tell me why</u></a>” that is effectively a laundry list of player complaints. He says he and the 1047 team read each reply and catalogued them, scrutinizing what the most-cited issues were. He admits that Splitgate 2, as it launched, is “not a finished product yet.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This doesn't feel like a launched game as much as we want to pretend it was, and obviously we said it was. It feels like a beta. There's bugs still. There's features that are missing that —  obviously not every game has to have every feature — but there's certain things that should be in a finished product. There's too many bugs, and we're hitting the reset button.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To be clear, he doesn’t think Splitgate 2 is all bad. He’s most proud of the gameplay, the gunplay and movement. But Proulx admits that there are too many other issues, technical and structural, hindering players from enjoying the good that’s there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think we've heard from the fans and from the gamers, they want something closer to Splitgate 1,” he says. “And so I think for us, this feels like a beta. It feels like a beta to me, it doesn't feel like a launch. And I think we have to do a bit of a reset to actually listen to the fans, to the gamers, and address the feedback, fix the bugs, implement the features that should have been there on day one, but also make some big changes that the Splitgate community wants.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What a Community Wants</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">What does the community want, then? A lot, Proulx says, but he boils it down to three major components. The first, he says, is demonstrated by that Reddit thread and summed up as “basic features.” Splitgate 2 needs a leaderboard. It needs better progression. There are a lot of seemingly little elements missing that add up to the game feeling unfinished.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Second, he says Splitgate 2 needs more portal walls and more opportunities for portals generally. 1047 already started adding more portal walls in the game’s alpha, but didn’t go far enough.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And third, Proulx thinks they need to make adjustments to game modes, though he isn’t quite sure what just yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“A big focus of ours is getting closer to just that classic arena game mode experience. I don't know exactly what that's going to look like, but I think we've done a lot of round-based modes, and we'll still have some round-based modes, but players, they want to play the game and shoot stuff and have a good time and maybe play the objective.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I ask Proulx if he intends to do anything to change the game’s current monetization model. Splitgate 2 is free-to-play, but its in-game storefront has been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Splitgate/comments/1l576z1/splitgate_2s_ingame_store_is_a_masterclass_in/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>heavily criticized on a number of fronts</u></a>. Players have said its season pass is confusing and gates too much content behind purchases, they’ve pointed out that the “discount” listings at launch were deceptive as to what items actually cost, and highlighted that awkward real-money-to-currency exchanges make it difficult to understand or accurately pay for just what you want, and nothing extra.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If the community wants X, and that's what they want, it doesn't really matter what I want.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Splitgate 2 will remain free-to-play, Proulx says, and players will keep all the items they’ve already purchased. He’s not doing refunds, he says. But when the game comes back in 2026, he does want to “simplify” the monetization situation. When I ask for specifics, Proulx says he’s still thinking about it and will likely shift based on player feedback. But he’s currently considering a more basic battle pass, one you simply purchase once for a three-month period or so, and receive linear rewards from as you play more of the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Proulx isn’t fully certain right now of exactly what Splitgate 2 needs to be, and wants to let the community shape that decision. He tells me that, this time, 1047 will do regular playtests with the community on a separate branch of this game to collect feedback, similar to what the team did with Splitgate 1. “If they hate it, we can say…great, we’re not going to do that. Scrap it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I ask him if he has now, or ever has had, a strong vision for Splitgate 2 and the kind of game he wants to make. Does he think it possible the community could be wrong about what’s best for the game? Could his vision become compromised by player requests?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If the community wants X, and that's what they want, it doesn't really matter what I want,” Proulx says. “But even what I want, I mean, I think a lot of what the community is asking for are things that I agree with. I think certain decisions we made early on, I think we almost got a little bit too scientific about it. Splitgate 1, there was no theory, there was no strategy. It was just, let's go make a fun game because it's cool…And I think with Splitgate 2…we kind of started with all these design goals, which is good, but I think we got a little bit too obsessive about, oh, let's do this because it checks that box, as opposed to just like, well, is it fun? I don't know. It doesn't really matter what you theorize about if it's not as fun.”</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Try, Try Again</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">But how did Splitgate 2 end up here in the first place?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Proulx, the team was “too ambitious.” He says they tried to do too much with Splitgate 2, between the game’s arena mode, battle royale, and map creator, and ended up only getting each of those things done “80% instead of one or two things 100% of the way there.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He also thinks another issue was that 1047 kept Splitgate 2 far too secretive for too long, out of a fear of leaks. Proulx mentions Apex Legends, which “shadow-dropped” seemingly out of nowhere to incredible success with no build-up at all, as an indicator that such a strategy can work well. But that’s also the opposite of what worked for Splitgate 1 – something Proulx suggests he should have learned from for the sequel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of Splitgate 1, it’s not long for this world. As a part of this new doubling down on improving Splitgate 2, the first game’s servers will be shut down in about a month. 1047 says it’s “exploring the possibility of supporting offline or peer-to-peer matches,” and that it intends to include a “dedicated experience” in Splitgate 2 that “delivers on the promise of the original.” But in the short-term, Splitgate 1 will be no more.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Per 1047, this decision was made because it has cost the studio “hundreds of thousands of dollars over the past couple of years” to keep Splitgate 1 online. It’s cutting costs in other ways, too. Last month,<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/splitgate-2-developer-1047-games-announces-round-of-layoffs" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u> the company laid off an unknown number of individuals</u></a>. With today’s announcement, 45 more staff will be let go, 28% of the current total. “We definitely have to get our burn rate down,” Proulx says when I ask him about the company’s financial situation. “There's no doubt about it. I'd say financially, thankfully, we are in a position where we can afford to do something like [the unlaunch] and take our time, but it's going to take time. So we're figuring that out.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The cost-cutting measures do beg the question of both the veracity and, if the allegation is true, the wisdom of the company allegedly spending over $400,000 in influencer marketing ahead of Splitgate 2’s launch. This was according to an <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-1047-games-spent-409k-influencers-splitgate-2s-failed-lombardi-jyyve/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>analysis posted on LinkedIn</u></a> from Streamforge’s Nick Lombardi, using “estimates based on publicly available data and market rates from Streamforge’s algorithm.” The alleged influencer spend was reported on by a number of outlets, but Proulx responds when I ask him about it by saying that the article has “a lot of things that are factually incorrect.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There are definitely things in that article that are accurate,” he says. “But yeah, I'd say it's, I don't know, 60% accurate. Do I think that that strategy worked? I don't know. I mean, I think that you have to do a little bit of everything. I think you have to have some influencers, you have to have some PR, you have to have some paid advertising. I can tell you certain ads ran more efficiently than others, but I think it's all part of the same equation.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Proulx goes on to say that influencer marketing is tricky – it’s hard to say just how many users a game actually acquires from a given influencer promoting a game, making it difficult to track success.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But I also think you can't buy yourself a successful launch,” he adds. “Splitgate 1's budget was next to nothing, and it still had a really massively successful launch, and that was because we had built a lot of goodwill with the community… I think influencers and ads will add fuel to the fire, and if you have a really hype game with a passionate community that feels like they're being listened to, then that will amplify. And if you don't, then it'll help a little bit.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If this was a 10 out of 10 game, people would still be playing it and happily spending money and grinding and telling their friends.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Proulx is essentially hoping to, in 2026, take a second crack at launching Splitgate 2. Aside from the issues with the game itself, its first launch last month was marred by other controversies. It started when Proulx wore a hat that read, “Make FPS Great Again” onstage at the game’s Summer Game Fest reveal, a <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/01/27/689191278/the-symbol-of-the-maga-hat" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>reference to U.S. President Donald Trump’s signature “Make America Great Again” hats</u></a>. In a speech onstage at the same event, Proulx remarked that he’s “tired of playing the same Call of Duty every year,” which resulted in wide criticism from both developers and Call of Duty fans. And then, upon launch, a $145 microtransaction bundle was soundly rebuked by gamers for its predatory similarities to the very games Proulx and 1047 claimed to be pushing back against with Splitgate 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Proulx has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splitgate-2-director-refuses-to-apologize-for-make-fps-great-again-hat-then-apologizes-anyway"><u>since apologized for all of the above controversies</u></a>, and actively revoked the high-priced microtransactions. But now, with a second crack at releasing Splitgate 2 on the horizon, I ask Proulx if there’s anything he intends to do differently, and if he thinks these issues meaningfully impacted the initial Splitgate 2 launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yes, I definitely would've done things differently,” he says. “I will say I think we would be in the position we're in regardless of any of that stuff. Obviously, I don't think that stuff helped us, and I don't plan on doing any more stunts like that, but I think the reality is if this was a 10 out of 10 game, people would still be playing it and happily spending money and grinding and telling their friends, and that's my feeling. And so I think the past is the past, and we've made a lot of mistakes. Not just that we've made many mistakes over the last 10 or however many years it's been, and we keep learning and we iterate and we improve, and that's what we're going to keep doing.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once Chapter 3 is out, Splitgate 2 will officially go quiet until early next year while the team rebuilds. That team will be smaller than before, with a number of friends and colleagues having lost their jobs through no fault of their own. 1047 won’t be spending money on Splitgate 1 servers, but it also likely won’t be making much off microtransactions, making funding a more serious question. Some fans, inevitably, will not stick around to see if Splitgate 2 is a comeback story. Others remain permanently put off by the game’s launch controversies. It’s not exactly a cheery period for 1047 Games, but in Proulx’s eyes, the studio has been through worse. “We had much darker days” during Splitgate 1 development, he says. “A lot of almost quitting, a lot of tears… So it's a tough road ahead. Of course it is, right? This is not an easy industry.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But he’s adamant that, regardless, he isn’t giving up on Splitgate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's brutal, but we're not going away. We're not quitting. We absolutely love this. We love every single part about it, the good and the bad. And we've been here before and we've come out the other end, and we're going to just keep doing what we can to stay alive.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-the-night-is-the-sensual-coming-of-age-anime-i-craved-as-a-teen.1250331/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Anime, like video games, offers a unique way of<a href="https://aftermath.site/1000x-resist-anniversary" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> providing guidance</a> when life feels particularly aimless. For kids my age, that wisdom was kept secret. Anime wasn’t mainstream at school or welcomed at home, so the lessons I learned about facing life's hardships felt like smuggling contraband with existential subtext from the odd books I’d beg my mom to buy every Sunday at church. Still, I had a Goldilocks problem: the anime I found didn’t match my in-between space of adolescence and adulthood; it was either too salacious or too focused on spectacle, losing the nuance. I yearned for something honest and reflective, without having to dig through its mass appeal to find something truly meaningful—something that sparked wonder or didn’t leave me emotionally drained. Nothing ever seemed like the perfect analogy for my teenage-to-adult years, which were neither purely sensible nor purely salacious.&nbsp;</p><p>Ahead of its second season debut on HIDIVE, I finally watched an anime called <a href="https://yofukashi-no-uta.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Call</em> <em>Of The</em> <em>Night</em></a>, and discovered it’s the kind of coming-of-age supernatural story I wish I had growing up.&nbsp;</p><p>On the surface, <em>Call Of The Night</em>, created by <a href="https://x.com/cot_510" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kotoyama</a> and animated by <a href="https://lidenfilms.jp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Liden Films</a>, plays with familiar genre conventions where a budding romance develops between a human and a vampire. However, it’s how the show <a href="https://aftermath.site/lets-plays-sleep-youtube" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">explores insomnia</a>, intimacy, and late-night wanderlust in its tepid romance that drew me in. The series centers on Ko Yamori, a middle school student who struggles with going to school, falling asleep, and understanding love. To cope with his first problem, he starts skipping school and breaking curfew to roam around town at night, experiencing that euphoric feeling of being alive while the rest of the city sleeps or buzzes with nighttime energy.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>So light spoilers for that.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>One night, he meets a girl named Nazuna Nanakusa, who tells him she believes that people who can’t sleep like him do so because they aren’t satisfied with how they spent their day and can’t find rest until they let go of their inhibitions. After pretending to sleep when she offers to help him by inviting him to her place and sleeping on her futon, he discovers she’s a vampire. Mind you, he doesn’t figure out her vampiric nature through clues or detective work, but because she bites his neck and begins feeding on him. When he asks why he didn’t turn into a vampire, she reveals that the show’s take on vampirism isn’t that simple.&nbsp;</p><p>In this universe, for a human to become a vampire, they have to be bitten by a vampire they genuinely love. Instead of running away after learning too much about vampires to keep himself safe, Ko channels <a href="https://gizmodo.com/what-we-do-in-the-shadows-guillermo-de-la-cruz-badass-1849401674" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Guillermo from <em>What We Do in the Shadows</em>,</a> seeing it as a perfect chance to solve all three of his problems at once. His new goal is to fall in love with Nazuna and become a vampire.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Call of the Night | HIDIVE" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3Gy9f_fTfVY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><em>Call Of The Night</em> isn’t my first rodeo with vampiric romance anime. I’ve served my time with formative manga like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosario_%2B_Vampire" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Rosario + Vampire</em></a>, which the <em>Call Of The Night</em>’s premiere hews close enough to with its protag inexplicably having the tastiest blood, making its resident vampire go steady with him on that principle alone before it drifts into ecchi harem territory with an encyclopedia of equally down-bad heroines.&nbsp;</p><p>What made <em>Call Of The Night</em> engaging for me was its genuine portrayal of how there’s no magical age when you fully understand everything as a teenager (or as an immortal vampire). Throughout the show, Ko's rebellious rejection of societal norms in his quest to become an adult ultimately leads him to face the same limitations that trap the adults who have surrendered to a structured life. For starters, falling in love isn’t easy even when you truly want to.&nbsp;</p><p>Each episode of <em>Call Of The Night</em> unfolds like a slice of nocturnal life. Ko and Nazuna drift through late-night dates that feel both normal and electric. One scene where Ko encourages Nazuna to feed off him humorously illustrates the long road ahead. Hoping to get turned early in season one after feeling a tug on his heartstrings, Ko realizes nothing has changed. It turns out that her feeding connects Nazuna to Ko’s emotional state, leading her to reveal that his newfound attraction isn’t love; it’s just lust.</p><figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><span><figure><figcaption>That's rough, buddy. </figcaption></figure></span></figure><p>From there, <em>Call Of The Night</em> takes the time to actually interrogate what it means to be young and in love. Nazuna is an abrasive, guarded tsundere, and while Ko meets other vampires that are easier to get close to, he still wants Nazuna. Their romance is a slow-burning tug of war. While Nazuna doesn’t necessarily fall first, she’s fallen harder for Ko. Instead of leaning into it, she masks her feelings behind teasing and dirty jokes to get a rise out of Ko or ducking behind videogames whenever things get too tender.</p><p>Beneath it all, Nazuna is not just scared of vulnerability, but of being responsible for Ko losing the spark that drew him to the night in the first place. Throughout the series, Nazuna plays up the façade that her nocturnal life is endlessly freeing, even as it threatens to calcify into something depressive and hollow. The show later reveals that she fears that Ko will see through the mysticism of vampirism and will regret his decision to become one, and also for falling for her.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="ＴＶアニメ「よふかしのうた」振り返り特番" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j9Gk1VacWoo?start=64&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>After finishing Season One, <em>Call Of</em> <em>The Night</em> didn’t just become an anime I wish I had watched growing up; it earned its place among the essential shows I recommend to others right now. For better or worse, my coming-of-age anime diet mainly consisted of <em>Neon Genesis</em> <em>Evangelion</em> and <em>FLCL</em>. Both are brilliant in their own fractured ways, but neither really provided a blueprint for growing up in a healthy environment beyond horny teenage angst and manic pixie dream girls, all tailored to the protagonist’s psychological projections (and mommy issues), whether they piloted mecha or drove a Vespa. Still, they are both shows that portrayed the pursuit of getting laid as a fundamental part of growing up, with little scrutiny into that idea. <em>Call Of The Night</em>, by contrast, leans into the complicated emotions you first start to discover as a teenager, when pursuing romance and sex is all brand new.&nbsp;</p><p>As a coming-of-age anime, <em>Call Of The Night</em> stands out as a quietly introspective, emotionally sincere, and unapologetically strange series that doesn’t try to shout for attention to seem deep. It offers plenty of space to breathe, wonder, and maybe even heal—and that’s true for its vampire ensemble as well—and I find that outstanding.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/tyler-the-creator-dont-tap-the-glass-hip-hop-rap-kendrick"><h3>We Should All Outgrow Our Heroes Like Tyler, The Creator</h3></a><p>Turns out all it takes to shake hip-hop’s foundations was “Don’t Tap The Glass” daring its rap listeners to put the keyboard down and dance

<p>We've known about the game's release date on PC, PS5, and Xbox for a while now, but in a video posted on social media, Randy Pitchford has confirmed that the Switch 2 version will follow shortly afterwards — on <strong>3rd October 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Pitchford manages to draw out the reveal in the video posted on X earlier today, but eventually alleviates fans' concerns about the game's portable port.</p>

<p>So, we'll have to wait just an extra three weeks to get our hands on this one. Not bad at all!</p>
<p>Thankfully this was much better news than what has previously been circling Gearbox founder and CEO Pitchford previously. The industry icon <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/randy-pitchford-defends-borderlands-4-pricing-comment">was forced to defend a statement</a> he made about game prices where he said "if you're a real fan, you'll find a way", in response to a potential $80 price tag.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/splitgate-dev-would-like-to-add-a-map-editor-a-single-player-experience-and-more/">1047 Games</a>, the studio behind Splitgate and Splitgate 2, whose co-founder boldly proclaimed from the Summer Game Fest 2025 stage that Splitgate 2 will <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splitgate-2-director-refuses-to-apologize-for-make-fps-great-again-hat-then-apologizes-anyway">"<em>make FPS great again</em>,"</a> admitted that they have <a href="https://www.splitgate.com/news/building-the-splitgate-you-deserve">launched Splitgate 2 "<em>too early</em>,"</a> and have announced that the studio will undergo a massive overhaul of the game before re-launching sometime in early 2026. Alongside this announcement was the reveal that the studio is laying off more members of the development team, and the servers for the original Splitgate are getting shutdown next month.</p>



<p>Splitgate 2 officially launched on June 6, 2025, on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S, and though it'll still be playable for the foreseeable future and will still get the upcoming Chapter 3 update, 1047 Games has effectively announced that it has 'unlaunched' the game, and is bringing it back to a beta state. </p>



<p>"<em>We've heard your feedback, and we agree with you,</em>" the studio writes in its statement, which was published on its website and to the game's official account on X and attributed to co-founders Ian Proulx and Nicholas Bagamian. "<em>We launched too early. We had ambitious goals with Splitgate 2, and in our excitement to share it with you, we bit off more than we could chew. We rushed certain features, made some boneheaded mistakes, and most importantly, we didn't give you the polished, portal-filled mayhem you fell in love with. So we're going back to beta. We'll be heads down until early next year, rebuilding major parts of the game to capture the spirit of what made Splitgate special.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>That means reworking progression from the ground up, adding more portals to our maps, simplifying monetization, refocusing on classic game modes you've been asking for, and more, which we'll share soon</em>."</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>To the Splitgate community,</p><p>We believe in Splitgate 2. This game means everything to us – it's been our life for almost 10 years, starting in our dorm room, and we're more committed than ever to delivering the incredible experience you deserve.</p><p>We’ve heard your feedback, and we…</p></div>— Splitgate 2 (@Splitgate) <a href="https://twitter.com/Splitgate/status/1947717804364353641?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 22, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>The statement goes on to confirm that the studio is laying off more staff, with 45 people <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splitgate-2-will-go-back-to-beta-to-undergo-a-massive-rework-amid-more-layoffs-and-splitgate-1-shutdown?utm_source=threads,twitter">reportedly</a> losing their jobs at 1047 Games, and so that the cuts don't impact the team too heavily, OG-Splitgate is getting its servers shut down "<em>in a month.</em>" </p>



<p>1047 Games says that though it would love to keep those servers online, "<em>it's cost us hundreds of thousands of dollars over the past couple of years, and we have to prioritize our team.</em>" It is however "<em>exploring the possibility</em>" of creating an offline mode and/or peer-to-peer matches, so that dedicated fans of the first Splitgate game can still play it beyond the shutdown.</p>



<p>The studio also promises to have "<em>a dedicated experience in Splitgate 2 that delivers on the promise of the original,</em>" when Splitgate 2 re-launches in 2026. </p>



<p>"<em>We've faced a lot of dark days and have made many mistakes,</em>" the statement reads as it begins to conclude. "<em>But we've learned a lot and</em> <em>are as determined as ever to make Splitgate as great as possible. Splitgate has been our life for 10 years, and we wouldn't have it any other way. We've got work to do, but we aren't giving up. We love this game and we love this community too much to ever quit. So we won't</em>."</p>



<p>After 1047 Games launched with all the confidence in the world, it's clear that it was sorely misguided when Splitgate 2 officially launched last month, which players knew without the studios' co-founders having to admit it. There are still plenty of questions regarding what the changes will be exactly, how the game will still be playable, whether it will now appear as 'Splitgate 2 - Open Beta' on consoles and PC, and when exactly the OG-Splitgate servers will be taken offline.</p>



<p>It's all together not at all what 1047 Games envisioned when they were looking ahead at Splitgate 2's launch earlier this year. By the time the studio is ready to re-launch the game next year, it'll be interesting to see if anyone is still waiting around for 1047 to "<em>make FPS great again</em>," and if anyone will even care that it's back after what's been a mixed bag of a first launch, to say the least.</p>

		<p>I had a moment last night where it became clear that without intervention, I would not stop playing <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>. This intervention came in the form of imagining the personal shaming that would be directed my way if I did not beat <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 </em>before leaving for Europe, as I'd promised Janet. The zingers she would send me way if I broke that covenant? I dread it. So I put down a game I was <em>reallyreally </em>enjoying and started another game I am <em>reallyreally </em>enjoying. That said, the endgame of <em>Clair Obscur</em> is a mess, something I hope to get deeper into during a spoiler podcast that we'll record when I return from that trip. BTW, Rob is on the mend but doing better and should be present in some stuff this week.

You don't have to care about <em>Hopshot</em>, btw, to enjoy this interview. We do talk a fair bit about the platformer, but it's a broader convo.</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Rematch</em> – Me, Janet, and Cado are going to head onto "the pitch" and try to "win."

We absolutely love this. We love every single part about it, the good and the bad. And we’ve been here before and we’ve come out the other end, and we’re going to just keep doing what we can to stay alive.” That means suspending new content plans for the game after season 3 while the team works on overhauling core parts of the design, killing the servers for <em>Splitgate 1</em>, and laying off more staff. </p><p>The major pivot comes <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Splitgate/comments/1lzfv20/if_youve_stopped_playing_tell_me_why/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Splitgate/comments/1lzfv20/if_youve_stopped_playing_tell_me_why/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a week after a thread on the game’s subreddit</a></span> asked fans to do some soul searching about why they’ve stopped playing<em> Splitgate 2</em> and what could one day bring them back. Some players complained about basic stuff like not being able to pick game modes when they queue. Others were more turned off by the sequel’s departure from the arena-shooter roots of the original. “I found <em>Splitgate 1</em> more fun. It scratched the <em>Halo</em> itch for me. <em>Splitgate 2</em> no longer does that because it has heroes, loadouts and attachments,” one wrote. </p><p>From the variety of responses and preferences, it’s clear there’s not one or two obvious things that can turn the shooter’s fortunes around, which is why Proulx says the studio is going to work on a soft reboot instead, similar to how it did with the original <em>Splitgate</em>. “I think there’s a lot of things <em>Splitgate 2</em> does extremely well,” he <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/news/614738/splitgate-2-unlaunch-announcement-1047-games-layoffs&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/news/614738/splitgate-2-unlaunch-announcement-1047-games-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>Polygon</em></a></span>. “I think we have a very polished actual core experience in terms of gun gunplay movements, graphics, et cetera. But I do feel like we bit off more than we could chew, and we have three games in one between Arena and Battle Royale and our own Map Creator.”</p><p>One big area of criticism at launch as <em>Splitgate 2</em>'s microtransactions, which many players felt were overreaching and too expensive, even after some prices were brought down. Anyone who did already spend money on the game won’t be getting a refund either. All of those cosmetics will continue to be available throughout this year and presumably once the game relaunches in 2026, but anyone who’s already sunk a good chunk of change into <em>Splitgate 2</em> at launch might feel a bit burned. The likely alternative, however, could mean the game and studio shutting down entirely. </p><p>That will be the case for <em>Splitgate 1 </em>at least, whose roughly 100 concurrent players on Steam will soon be heading into their final matches. 1047 also wouldn’t confirm the number of new layoffs to <em>Polygon</em>, but confirmed more are on the way following a small round in June. And then there’s the dumb “Make FPS Great Again” MAGA hat  Proulx wore to kick things off when announcing <em>Splitgate 2</em>'s battle royale mode during Summer Game Fest Live while ICE protests were going on elsewhere in LA. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/splitgate-2-apology-video-maga-hat-ranked-battle-royale-1851784272&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/splitgate-2-apology-video-maga-hat-ranked-battle-royale-1851784272">He initially defended it</a></span> and said he wouldn’t apologize. He later did walk it back but pointed to <em>Death Stranding 2</em> director Hideo Kojima wearing a similar one at some point and not getting any flack for it. “Yes, I definitely would’ve done things differently,” he <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/splitgate-2-will-go-back-to-beta-to-undergo-a-massive-rework-amid-more-layoffs-and-splitgate-1-shutdown&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splitgate-2-will-go-back-to-beta-to-undergo-a-massive-rework-amid-more-layoffs-and-splitgate-1-shutdown" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told<em> IGN</em></a></span>. “I will say I think we would be in the position we’re in regardless of any of that stuff. Obviously, I don’t think that stuff helped us, and I don’t plan on doing any more stunts like that, but I think the reality is if this was a 10 out of 10 game, people would still be playing it and happily spending money and grinding and telling their friends, and that’s my feeling. And so I think the past is the past, and we’ve made a lot of mistakes.”<br></p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/splitgate-2-maga-refunds-reboot-beta-season-3-servers-1851786742]]></content:encoded>

Unfortunately, this is the story of one fan's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/donkey-kong-bananza/" data-ref-id="5000-671287">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> project gone horribly wrong, and while it can't be fun for the poor guy at the center of it, watching it unfold sure has been pretty funny.</p><p>Recently, a TikTok user (<a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-donkey-kong-bananza-yellow-spray-paint-cart-1851786727?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=SocialMarketing&amp;utm_campaign=dlvrit&amp;utm_content=kotaku" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via Kotaku</a>) by the name of <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@gardnerhartung?lang=en" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Gardner</a> shared that they wanted to paint their Switch 2 cartridge of the critically acclaimed 3D platformer yellow. The rationale behind the move is a simple one rooted in nostalgia: Nintendo has previously released Donkey Kong games with banana-yellow cartridges, like Donkey Kong 64, which Gardner flashes on camera as a reference point in the first of two videos.</p><p>I can already hear everyone groaning and screaming at their screens. I was there too, but it's worth it to enjoy the rest of this cringe-inducing ride.</p><p>Gardner then proceeds to crudely pry apart the crimson red Switch 2 cartridge, showing multiple failed approaches before it is finally cracked open. Once it is, they remove the card with the game files on it and take the spray paint can to each half of the cartridge casing. The first video ends as they piece it back together and insert the game in the console only to find it gets stuck about halfway through and can't actually fit back into the slot.</p><p>One comment on the first video reads, "Seems like the paint might melt and stick in the system when it heats up. This feels like a bad idea." If only that commenter knew how right they'd be within just 24 hours.</p><p>To make matters worse, Gardner returned with a second video a day later showing that despite the system's resistance to the painted-over case, they insistently jammed the game in anyways, where it is now irretrievably stuck. They even take a pair of pliers to the system but simply cannot pull it out, instead chipping the yellow paint and even breaking the cartridge. Eventually Gardner relents, hilariously saying, "Without tagging Nintendo, somebody let me know what I should do to get it out of my system. Again, I'm chilling because I'm going to play the game for a while but I'd love your suggestions."</p><p>As you might expect, Gardner's ridiculous journey for a yellow Bananza cartridge has already gone viral. Some chimed in with what they believed to be advice, like multiple comments suggesting they should've just 3D printed a yellow case and reprinted the game's art, but many of the commenters are also just poking fun at Gardner's dedication and misfortune.</p><p>One comment simply reads, "It's NOT THAT SERIOUS," alongside a crying emoji. Another jokes, "Guy buys a Switch 2 with Donkey Kong built in!!!" The most devastating of the bunch simply says, "Is now a bad time to mention it isn't even the right shade of yellow?" Ouch.</p><p>I guess the big takeaway here is that the next time you want to undertake a DIY project with your expensive gaming system, please just ask around the internet before doing a very costly amount of damage. I hope they're really enjoying Donkey Kong Bananza, because that seems to be the only thing that Switch 2 is going to be playing for the foreseeable future.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>For the last few years, subscription gaming services like Apple Arcade and Netflix have offered mobile game developers something of a haven for high-quality, premium mobile games: a type of game that had become vanishingly rare following the rise of the microtransaction-stuffed free-to-play model. But as these services’ once enviable lineup of indie games dwindles, that haven appears to be shrinking.</p><p>In 2021, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22759628/netflix-games-global-rollout-mobile-android-devices">Netflix announced a new gaming initiative</a>, offering users a chance to play games through the streaming service’s mobile app. Apple launched a similar program <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/25/18280589/apple-arcade-gaming-subscription-release-date-pricing-features">with Apple Arcade</a> just two years before that. Both services offered an interesting value proposition: Pay a monthly subscription fee to get access to a library of premium games, with some of those games available as mobile exclusives. Those games would have no ads or in-app purchases, and the money paid to studios would ostensibly be used to fund the development of more games.</p><div><p>The games themselves covered an interesting range of genres and topics, from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/29/23378549/netflix-desta-the-memories-mobile-ustwo-games">strategy games featuring depression and dodgeball</a> to finding one’s place by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24206836/arranger-puzzle-game-review-netflix-summer-game-fest">literally rearranging the space around you</a>. Netflix funding something like <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24190846/harmonium-the-musical-developer-interview-deaf-culture-experience">Harmonium: The Musical</a></em>, a game about a Deaf girl’s love of music, signaled that the platform was taking its gaming initiative seriously, bringing titles from off the beaten path to the platform. But now that game <a href="https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/netflix-games/harmonium-the-musical-no-longer-set-to-release-on-netflix-games/">appears to have been pulled</a> from Netflix’s lineup.</p></div><p>In addition to serving as a publisher, Netflix took the additional step of outright purchasing game studios like <em>Oxenfree</em> developer Night School Studio and <em>Cozy Grove</em> studio Spry Fox to make bespoke games for the service. But late last year, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/22/24276700/netflix-gaming-studio-closure-blue">Netflix closed down the studio</a> it spun up to produce what was going to be the service’s first blockbuster AAA game. Then, just this month, it announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/692227/netflix-games-delisting-hades-braid-gaming-strategy">it was going to delist some of its most notable third-party titles</a>, including indie darlings like <em>Hades</em> and the <em>Monument Valley</em> series.</p><div><p>Netflix is increasingly focused on games tied to its own content. In its most recent quarterly earnings report, <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2025/q2/FINAL-Q2-25-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">the platform briefly extolled its continued investment</a> in titles like <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/20/24325810/squid-game-unleashed-netflix-mobile-game">Squid Game: Unleashed</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/645952/black-mirror-game-thronglets-season-7-netflix">Thronglets</a></em> — games tied to Netflix-produced<em> Squid Game</em> and <em>Black Mirror</em>, respectively.</p></div><p>This focus, though, seems to come at the expense of adding existing original games from independent developers. It’s easy to understand this shift. While these services don’t share much about hard numbers, third-party reporting suggested that the majority of Netflix users <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/8/23296545/netflix-games-1-percent-subscribers">never engaged with the platform’s gaming offerings</a>. And the games they were playing, in however limited amounts, were familiar titles. It’s no surprise that <em>GTA</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/23/24048412/gta-is-netflixs-biggest-gaming-launch-so-far">had Netflix’s biggest game launch</a>.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The </em>GTA series<em> are some of the most-played games on Netflix.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>At GDC 2025, Netflix’s president of games, Alain Tascan, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/633481/netflix-gaming-strategy-alain-tascan-interview">spoke to <em>The Verge</em> about the platform refocusing its gaming efforts</a>, saying of indie games, “We will continue supporting some of them, but I feel that indie gamers are not really coming to Netflix to find indie games.”</p><div><p>So far Apple has only <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/675241/apple-game-center-app-replace-rac7-sneaky-sasquatch-acquisition">purchased a single game studio</a> to make content for Apple Arcade, though its retreat to more casual offerings follows a similar pattern as Netflix. Original or indie games appear less frequently in favor of those attached to big, family-friendly IP like <em>Uno</em>, <em>Angry Birds</em>, and <em>Bluey</em>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/newsroom/2025/06/apple-arcade-welcomes-nine-new-games/">all three of which are featured in Apple Arcade’s July update</a>. <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/inside-apple-arcade-axed-games-declining-payouts-disillusioned-studios-and-an-uncertain-future/">Payouts from Apple Arcade have reportedly been shrinking</a> while developers have complained that it’s hard to get their games noticed on the platform.</p></div><p>The free-to-play model has conditioned users that spending money for gaming content can be optional. Casual games like <em>Monopoly Go</em> make money through in-game advertisements or opt-in consumer spending on microtransactions, and few traditional paid games outside of <em>Minecraft</em> are now able to break through that mindset.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20893691/apple-arcade-subscription-gaming-price-premium-games-zach-gage-noodlecake-snowman">Subscription services were viewed as a kind of equalizer</a>. With investment from Apple and Netflix and elsewhere, quality games could be brought to a platform not generally associated with quality gaming experiences. Developers could fund their vision and not have to worry about monetization, while consumers could access those games with a monthly subscription and no added costs.</p><p>But a few years in, the aim of these services has been adjusted, and casual games designed to keep eyeballs on an app for as long as possible, or promote the latest streaming series, have won out. Despite strong lineups of indie games, neither Netflix nor Apple could really cut through the noise, and their offerings are no longer unique. Worse still, the unique games they did have now have fewer places to go.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/analysis/711575/netflix-games-apple-arcade-mobile-games]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>1047 Games has made some major announcements today regarding Splitgate 2, the original Splitgate, and changes at the studio. First, and most importantly, staff are being let go from 1047 games as the studio reassesses its resources to work on Splitgate 2. Splitgate 2 will be going back into beta though will remain available to play, and the original Splitgate servers will be going offline next month due to the costs associated with keeping it running.</p>
<p><iframe title="Splitgate: Battle Royale Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ob8fNw6a8O0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In its statement, 1047 Games stated it was shutting the servers of the original game to minimise job losses at the studio. As the rebuild for Splitgate 2 gets underway, 1047 Games has said that it will be carrying out more playtests and player surveys, so feedback shapes the way the game evolves to meet player expectations. You can read the full statement from 1047 Games below.</p>
<p><em>“We believe in Splitgate 2. This game means everything to us – it’s been our life for almost 10 years, starting in our dorm room, and we’re more committed than ever to delivering the incredible experience you deserve.&nbsp;<wbr></em><em>We’ve heard your feedback and we agree with you:&nbsp;we launched too early. We had ambitious goals with Splitgate 2, and in our excitement to share it with you, we bit off more than we could chew. We rushed certain features, made some boneheaded mistakes, and most importantly – we didn’t give you the polished, portal-filled mayhem you fell in love with.<wbr></em></p>
<p><em>So we’re going back to beta.&nbsp;We’ll be heads down until early next year, rebuilding major parts of the game to capture the spirit of what made Splitgate special. That means reworking progression from the ground up, adding more portals to our maps, simplifying monetization, refocusing on classic game modes you’ve been asking for, and more, which we’ll share soon.<wbr></em></p>

<p><em>Now more than ever, we need your help.&nbsp;We’re returning not just to our roots in what we build, but in how we build it – with you. That means more playtests, more surveys, more listening, and truly being community first. Our goal is to combine the DNA of the first game with the best improvements from the second.<wbr></em></p>
<p><em>Rebuilding the core experience isn’t a quick fix; it’s a long-term commitment. To give ourselves the time to build the Splitgate you deserve, we’ve made the incredibly difficult decision to reduce certain roles and shift our resources to focus on this rework. This is heartbreaking. These are our teammates and our friends, and they helped build what we have today. They’re receiving severance and job placement support, and we’re committed to doing everything we can to help them through this transition. We hope to bring them back when we can.<wbr></em></p>
<p><em>In an effort to retain as many team members as possible, we’re also going to be shutting down OG Splitgate servers in a month. While we’d love to keep servers online indefinitely, it’s cost us hundreds of thousands of dollars over the past couple of years, and we have to prioritize our team. Like us, we know this game means a lot to so many of you, so we are exploring the possibility of supporting offline or peer-to-peer matches. And when we return, we plan to have a dedicated experience in Splitgate 2 that delivers on the promise of the original.<wbr></em></p>
<p><em>In the meantime, Splitgate 2 will remain playable,</em> and we’ll still be shipping Chapter 3, as well as fixes and high-priority changes. We hope you will continue to play and support the game. As always, please keep the feedback coming. <wbr><em>We’ve faced a lot of dark days and have made many mistakes, but we’ve learned a lot and are as determined as ever to make Splitgate as great as possible. Splitgate has been our life for 10 years, and we wouldn’t have it any other way. We’ve got work to do, but we aren’t giving up. <wbr>We love this game and we love this community too much to ever quit. So we won’t.”</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/borderlands-4-everything-we-know-return-og-looter-shooter/">Borderlands 4</a> is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-release-date-moved-forward/">September 12, 2025</a>, but that's not the date that it'll be arriving on Nintendo Switch 2. Gearbox needs a little bit more time with that version of the game, and today, Gearbox president, Randy Pitchford, announced the separate release date in a video posted to X.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Though he hams it up as if the Nintendo Switch 2 version won't make it in 2025, the actual launch date for Borderlands 4 on the Switch 2 is October 3, 2025, making its release arrive a week and change less than a month from its arrival on other platforms.</p>



<p>"<em>Look, I know we promised that the game would come inside of 2025,"</em> Pitchford began<em>. "We promised that it would come before the end of the year, and...game development is very hard.</em> <em>But I do have an update for you, we do have a date now. We have a date for the Nintendo Switch 2 version, of Borderlands 4</em>. <em>You guys, that date...that date is...October 3! It's October 3 you guys! It's not next year, it's not even the holiday, it's so much before Christmas, it's so much before Thanksgiving, it's October 3 you guys, wooo! *horn noise.* I'm psyched, I'm psyched. Get it!</em>"</p>



<p>Compared to the rest of the platforms, it'll be interesting to see how Borderlands 4 performs on the Switch 2, and though it's perhaps a bit upsetting for Switch 2 owners that they'll have to wait nearly a month after everyone else can get their hands on Borderlands 4 to play it themselves, they'll at least be able to see the beginnings of whether Gearbox is able to deliver on its promise that the endgame in Borderlands 4 is the<a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-series-best-endgame-yet-gearbox/"> "<em>best endgame</em>"</a> in the series so far.</p>



<p>Especially if the Switch 2 version is somehow more expensive than the other versions of the game. That's not likely to happen, but with all the <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-wont-cost-80/">issues that Borderlands 4 has had around pricing</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/randy-pitchford-apologizes-for-the-misunderstanding-caused-by-saying-a-real-fan-would-find-a-way-to-buy-borderlands-4-at-80/">Pitchford having to apologize</a> for telling fans that even if it had ended up being $80, they should have found a way to pay it, the last thing this game needs is another pricing controversy.</p>
