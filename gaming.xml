            <p>
Two and a half years after <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-confirms-new-the-witcher-game-in-development">announcement</a>, CD Projekt finally gave it the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-gets-its-a-first-trailer-and-yes-ciri-is-the-star">big reveal treatment</a> late in 2024, confirming Ciri to be the focus this time around. And now Doug Cockle - voice of former series protagonist Geralt of Rivia - has had his say, calling the switch to a new main character, a "really, really interesting move for all kinds of reasons".
</p>
<p>
Speaking to Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-dev-cd-projekt-red-talks-ciri-fan-reaction-playable-geralt-coyness-and-if-the-game-will-honour-your-previous-choices">shortly after The Witcher 4's reveal</a> last year, CD Projekt called Ciri's promotion to lead "really exciting" in terms of the opportunities it opened up, "by just virtue of who she is [and] what we can do with her in terms of the gameplay as well." And it turns out that's a sentiment Geralt voice actor Doug Cockle also shares.
</p>
<p>
"I'm really excited," he <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cd-projekts-decision-to-go-with-ciri-as-protagonist-for-the-witcher-4-a-really-interesting-move-for-all-kinds-of-reasons-geralt-actor-says">recently revealed to IGN</a>. "I think it's a really good move. I mean, I always thought that continuing the Saga, but shifting to Ciri would be a really, really interesting move for all kinds of reasons. But mostly because of things that happen in the books, which I don't want to give away because people, I want people to go read. So yeah, I think it's really exciting. I can't wait. I can't wait to see what they've done."

<p>
Of course, Cockle is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/geralt-of-town-that-was-definitely-doug-cockles-white-haired-monster-hunter-in-the-witcher-4s-reveal-trailer">now confirmed to be returning as Geralt</a> in The Witcher 4, despite the character's demotion - although it's not currently clear how substantial a role he'll play. The actor had already <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/geralt-voice-actor-confirms-he-will-be-part-of-the-witcher-4">let slip he'd be "part of" the new game</a> last August- earning himself a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/doug-cockle-got-slapped-by-cd-projekt-for-saying-geralt-is-in-the-witcher-4-but-not-as-the-main-character">bit of a slap on the wrist</a> from CD Projekt - and it was finally made official when Geralt popped up at the end of December's reveal trailer to utter a gravelly, "See you on the path".
</p><p>
Unfortunately for impatient sorts, The Witcher 4 is likely still some considerable way off (CD Projekt's hasn't even announced a release year yet), but fans can, at least, get a fresh Cockle fix much sooner. The actor is reprising the role of Geralt of Rivia in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-doug-cockle-starring-animated-witcher-movie-sirens-of-the-deep-gets-february-arrival-date">upcoming animated movie The Witcher: Sirens of The Deep</a>, which joins the streaming service on 11th February.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/synduality-echo-of-ada-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/synduality-echo-of-ada-review-in-progress.1089210/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/synduality-echo-of-ada-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The first time I lost my mech in Synduality Echo of Ada was on my second sortie, and lot of things went wrong. I didn’t buy insurance beforehand and I took way too much stuff out with me because I hit the wrong button, and then I chose not to take a moment to repair right before I got into the encounter that killed me. I made a series of avoidable mistakes followed by a bad decision, and this mech-flavored extraction shooter made sure I lost everything I had for it – so it’s a good sign that, after I was done cursing Synduality and then myself, I was immediately excited to try and get it all back. I have much more to do and see before I am ready for a final review, but that trial by fire will certainly stick with me until the end.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Synduality has a pretty cool premise: In the far future, humanity has been nearly wiped out by a mysterious blue rain called the Tears of the New Moon. In addition to killing humans on contact, the blue rain also made animals and plants gigantic and aggressive. To survive, society has moved underground and adopted the use of enormous mechs called Cradlecoffins to explore the surface world and gather energy-producing AO Crystals to survive. You step into the role of a nameless, faceless Drifter — someone who pilots a Cradlecoffin. Your goal? Get up there, get the things you need to upgrade your base and make some cash, and get out before the locals turn your Cradlecoffin into a grave.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Synduality Echo of Ada Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Cradlecoffins aren’t your traditional mechs. They’re slower than something you’d find in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/armored-core-6-fires-of-rubicon-review"><u>Armored Core</u></a> – though similarly armed, as they’re still bipedal and wield weapons – but faster than the behemoths you’d see in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mechwarrior-5-clans-review"><u>MechWarrior</u></a>. Ready for a deep cut? They’re actually a lot like the mechs from 2002’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/11/04/phantom-crash-review"><u>Phantom Crash</u></a>, which is to say they are a nice balance of being reasonably fast but still heavy and limited in terms of, shall we say, vertical mobility. Armored Core mechs can dunk like Jordan. Cradlecoffins got no ups.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But you’re not alone. In addition to your mech, you’ve got a Magus — think a humanoid AI you can fully customize and play dress up with — helping to guide you when you’re out on the surface by marking objectives on your map, alerting you to threats, and even keeping track of the weather. You can be as normal or as strangely intimate as you want about the creation process, though it kinda seems as if Synduality assumes you’re more likely to pick a robo-girlfriend than a robo-boyfriend based on the clothing choices available. (Even the AI-controlled Cradelcoffins have robo-girlfriends.) There are several different personalities to choose from, including supportive mentor lady, demure, eager-to-please girl; encouraging big brother, and spicy athlete who just wants you to be the best version of yourself. They’re a weirdly likeable little crew — I chuckled when my spicy athlete robo-girlfriend essentially told me to stop whining and eat my veggies (read: weeds that we had removed from the base) or she’d beat me up. And since they’re the only companion you’ll have for most of your time with Synduality, their presence is welcome.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Most of the other players I've seen aren’t out there to kill you.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to their clothes and look, you can also customize the special abilities and focus of your Magus, whether that’s finding AO Crystals, providing more info about different Enders (the name for that superpowered flora and fauna I talked about earlier), or giving you the low-down on the other Cradlecoffins you’ll run into once you pop out on the surface. So far I’ve liked both the one that’s good at protecting me from the evil rain and the one who has a knack for spotting other Cradlecoffins at range because hearing another engine in this game is <em>stressful</em>, but I appreciate that you can tailor your Magus to assist you be the best Drifter you wanna be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ll run into other players in Synduality’s world, but in my experience, most of them aren’t out there to kill you and take your things. Usually, an encounter with another player means the two of you being very cagey, aiming your guns at each other, until one of you finally uses the wave emote. Then the other returns it and you both go on your way. It’s admittedly tense, and an extraction shooter like this should be, because you’re never more than a single insurance-less run away from losing all your things. The whole “we’re all working together to help humanity” thing sets up that cautious camaraderie, but there is always the danger that someone’s gonna see your shiny shotgun and think “I want that and I don’t wanna work for it,” so… you know. This does seem (so far) like a kinder, gentler extraction shooter, but you should still be careful around other people, even if they do the wave emote.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Managing each mission means making a lot of interesting choices. How far from the elevators that bring you to and from the safety of the underground are you willing to venture? What kind of materials are you looking to collect for your base, and how much are you going to risk to get them? How much ammo will you head out with? What kind of mech? Will you prioritize carrying capacity or defense? All of these choices matter, and you may regret your words and deeds when you’re sitting at low health with no repair kits, far away from an elevator in a world where everything wants to kill you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So far Synduality has mostly just been this loop played over and over again, but it’s at least an amusing one, with a little bit of fun base building and dress-up in-between that I haven’t had a chance to dig too deeply into yet. What’s less amusing are the microtransactions and battle pass (we live in hell!) that can speed up the process of getting a better Cradlecoffin substantially despite this not being a free-to-play game. You get almost nothing in the free track of that pass, which is a standard-issue problem to some degree, but I’ll need to play more to see how much these systems feel like they impact the overall pace of progression without spending any money. I don’t think I would have all the nice things I have now, which replaced the stuff I lost, if I didn’t have that battle pass.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I am at least enjoying Synduality for now, though I have yet to unlock the single-player missions or the second map. Once I put some time into those, expand my base, and just generally Do More Stuff, I’ll have a better idea of where Synduality falls. Until then, I’ll be out in the world, trying not to die too much. Buy insurance, kids. It’s a scam, but it may save your life – or, at least, your mech.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

The first thing you'll want to double check is whether there are any typos or spelling mistakes. Roblox codes have to be entered exactly as the developers intended, and can even be case sensitive. Make sure there aren't any spelling errors, and that the lower and upper case letters are all in the correct place.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If everything has been typed in correctly then that means the code is, unfortunately, expired. Roblox codes typically only last for a short amount of time, so if you see a code you like, you need to act quick and redeem it while it's still active.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">How to Get More Anime Guardians Codes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">New Anime Guardians codes are shared by the experience's creator, Zero Developer Studio, on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/MdXq9qZG3k" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the game's official Discord server</a>. We update this page regularly, but if you want to get codes as soon as possible, it's best to join the Anime Guardians Discord server where you'll see codes posted in real-time. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">What is Anime Guardians In Roblox?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Anime Guardians is a Roblox tower defense game that should appeal to fans of experiences like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/anime-world-tower-defense-codes">Anime World Tower Defense</a>. The aim of the game is to defend your base from wave after wave of enemy forces. To protect your base, you'll have to place auto-battling characters, known as units, on a map in the best positions possible so they can strategically defeat the opposition quickly and efficiently. On the battlefield units can be upgraded so you can easily take on tougher enemies, while during your downtime you can also add new characters to your anime-inspired army via the game's gacha-style summoning system. Characters in Anime Guardians are inspired by a range of beloved shows including Bleach, Jujutsu Kaisen and Re: Zero.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Dion has spent over five years doing games journalism for UK national newspaper websites and is now a writer for Gamer Network.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>The first teaser trailer for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-witcher-4-release-date-trailer-news/2900-5228/" data-ref-id="2900-5228">The Witcher 4</a> confirmed what fans had long suspected by depicting <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-dev-explains-why-ciris-the-star-this-time-confirms-geralt-will-appear/1100-6528460/" data-ref-id="1100-6528460">Ciri as the game's new lead character</a>. Through the first three games, voice actor Doug Cockle portrayed the previous main character, Geralt of Rivia, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-dev-explains-why-ciris-the-star-this-time-confirms-geralt-will-appear/1100-6528460/" data-ref-id="1100-6528460">he will reprise his role in the sequel</a> as well. But Cockle is far from disappointed about taking a backseat this time, and he's eager to see Ciri get the spotlight.</p><p>"I'm really excited," Cockle told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cd-projekts-decision-to-go-with-ciri-as-protagonist-for-the-witcher-4-a-really-interesting-move-for-all-kinds-of-reasons-geralt-actor-says" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>. "I think it's a really good move. I mean, I always thought that continuing the saga, but shifting to Ciri would be a really, really interesting move for all kinds of reasons, but mostly because of things that happen in the books, which I don't want to give away because... I want people to go read. So yeah, I think it's really exciting. I can't wait. I can't wait to see what they've done."</p><p>Cockle also related that CD Projekt Red <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-actor-says-on-second-thought-hes-not-sure-if-geralt-is-actually-in-witcher-4/1100-6528324/" data-ref-id="1100-6528324">gently admonished him</a> for sharing his theories about Geralt's presence in the game.</p><p>"I was never really out of their good books," said Cockle. "All developers are like this. They want to keep their surprises and I actually didn't know anything, so I was just making guesses at things and stuff like that. And probably one of their requests was to just to stop guessing, 'Doug, you might be right. You might not be right. It doesn't matter if you are talking me. Doug, who plays Geralt, whatever you say is going to be taken as something.' So it was a very, very light slap on the wrist. It wasn't really a big deal."</p><p>Cockle is reprising his role as Geralt in Netflix's upcoming animated film, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/geralt-faces-a-war-between-the-land-and-the-sea-in-the-witcher-sirens-of-the-deep/1100-6528810/" data-ref-id="1100-6528810">The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep</a>. That will premiere on Netflix on February 11, while The Witcher Season 4 is expected to arrive later this year. As for The Witcher 4, CD Projekt Red <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-is-now-officially-in-production-new-teaser-image-revealed/1100-6528058/" data-ref-id="1100-6528058">ramped up production</a> at the end of 2024, and the game doesn't currently have a release date.</p>

                <p>Captain Blood, a pirate-themed action-adventure game that was supposed to launch in 2010 but has been stuck in development hell since then, will finally come out on May 6.</p><p>Captain Blood is an Xbox 360-era action-adventure game through and through, following a pirate captain on a quest to save a damsel in distress after other, more evil, pirates kidnap her. To accomplish that, the titular antihero needs to punch, slash, and shoot his way through anyone who gets in their way, completing the occasional quick-time event or fighting powerful enemy bosses. It looks like a throwback to action games on consoles like PS2 and Xbox 360, which makes sense as that's the era of gaming Captain Blood is actually from.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9RGxq68w" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DvC9RGxq68w" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/age-of-pirates-captain-blood" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Development on Captain Blood</a> reportedly began as far back as 2003, as Russian developer Akella planned to make a game based on a novel by author Rafael Sabatini. A game titled Captain Blood was first <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/04/22/1c-announces-e3-line-up" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">teased at E3 2004</a>, but it switched teams and restarted development multiple times before the project settled with publisher 1C Company around 2008. GameSpot even went <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/captain-blood-hands-on/1100-6192241/" data-ref-id="1100-6192241">hands-on with Captain Blood</a> around this time, already lamenting that it had "been in development for several years now." While a release was supposed to happen by 2010, it kept getting delayed and ended up never releasing due to parties involved with the game going bankrupt and other legal challenges surrounding the game.</p><p>All of that meant Captain Blood was left stuck in development hell after 2010...until now. In 2024, video game publisher SNEG Ltd. acquired the rights to Captain Blood and began working on an offical release. After one last small delay from late 2024 to 2025, we finally have a concrete release date for this action-adventure game. While we have no idea whether or not the game itself is any good, it's impressive that a game that seemed cursed to never release is finally coming out.</p><p>Captain Blood launches for PC, Steam, Mac, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch on May 6, priced at $25.</p>

The card game features many famous and obscure Disney characters from movies like <em>Beauty and the Beast, Cinderella, Snow White</em>, and more. I’ve been playing since last year and have had a great time with it. But I also know that getting into <em>Lorcana </em>can seem overwhelming and confusing at first. </p><p>However, there’s actually a really simple, cheap, and easy way to get into Disney’s hit card game. All you need to do is buy the <em>Lorcana </em>Gateway kit. That’s it. </p><h2 id="h2142"><a id=""></a>Buy A <em>Lorcana </em>Gateway Kit!</h2><p>No, seriously, if you and a friend, spouse, or sibling want to start learning and playing <em>Lorcana</em>, just buy the Gateway kit. That’s all you need! This starter kit contains two decks, four booster packs, a playing mat, damage tokens, a handy rule book, and a guide that walks both players through learning <em>Lorcana</em>. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://go.skimresources.com?id=33330X1579802&amp;xs=1&amp;xcust=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ravensburger.us%2Fen-US%2Fproducts%2Fgames%2Ffamily-games%2Fdisney-lorcana-tcg-gateway-11098399&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=33330X1579802&amp;xs=1&amp;xcust=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ravensburger.us%2Fen-US%2Fproducts%2Fgames%2Ffamily-games%2Fdisney-lorcana-tcg-gateway-11098399" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">While the retail price of this kit is $25</a></span> or more, its regularly marked down for half that or less at places like Walmart and Best Buy.<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://goto.target.com/c/379647/81938/2092?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fravensburger-disney-lorcana-gateway-trading-card-game%2F-%2FA-90178605%23lnk%3Dsametab&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://goto.target.com/c/379647/81938/2092?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fravensburger-disney-lorcana-gateway-trading-card-game%2F-%2FA-90178605%23lnk%3Dsametab" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody"> I found a copy at Target recently for $12 and that deal is available online</a></span> as of this writing. At that price, the Gateway kit is one of the best deals in card games. </p><p>Just make sure you buy a Gateway kit specifically, and not a Treasure Trove or Starter Deck box. These can sometimes cost around the same price and offer some of what’s found in the Gateway box, but they aren’t the same.</p><figure id="" data-id="363abeecb1bbb2b5c33328a5388293b8" data-recommend-id="image://363abeecb1bbb2b5c33328a5388293b8" data-format="jpg" data-width="800" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ravensburger / Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="363abeecb1bbb2b5c33328a5388293b8" data-recommend-id="image://363abeecb1bbb2b5c33328a5388293b8" data-format="jpg" data-width="800" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The <em>Lorcana</em> Gateway kit’s cover has Mickey Mouse, Elsa, Maleficent, and Stitch on the front and features a big gold sticker that says “Learn to Play!” It also says “Gateway” on the bottom of the front of the box. That’s the one you want to buy! </p><p>I’ve played a lot of card games, both physical and digital, and learning them can be a hassle. And my wife has far less experience with card games than I do. But in just a few hours, we were both playing the game without looking up rules or making mistakes. And more importantly, we were having fun.</p><h2 id="h2143"><a id=""></a>The Gateway kit is the perfect way to learn <em>Lorcana</em></h2><p>The key is that <em>Lorcana’s </em>Gateway Kit isn’t just a bunch of cards, but instead a fully developed system that slowly builds up each player’s deck and options over time. </p><p>You start with just 30 cards each containing simple, basic characters. You then play a few matches and work together to complete challenges laid out in the guidebook. These tasks are usually simple, but make you engage with the game’s mechanics. So you might have to both play five high-cost cards, or challenge and defeat seven characters, things like that. </p><p>Once you’ve completed all the challenges and feel comfortable with the rules and cards so far, you unlock new cards via reward pack boosters. In here you’ll find specific new cards that add a few more rules and options to your deck. Then you complete more challenges and repeat until you’ve unlocked all the rewards. At that point, you’ll each have a full <em>Lorcana </em>deck of over 60 cards and you’ll completely understand how the game works.</p><p>This is the best way to learn a card game in my opinion. It’s fun, cooperative, and super effective. And you can reset the Gateway kit using a guide found inside and teach other players using the same box. Nifty! </p><h2 id="h2144"><a id=""></a>What to do after you learn <em>Lorcana</em></h2><p>Okay, so after learning how to play <em>Lorcana </em>using the Gateway kit, you might want to keep playing and collect more cards. Now what? Personally, I recommend picking up a few starter decks. These contain 60 cards and a booster pack and let you quickly get your hands on a pre-built deck with some solid synergy options. </p><p>You can also start buying boosters online or in card shops. I’d avoid some retailers that sell them at full price (or more!) and instead look for places selling these 12-card packs at a discount.</p><figure id="" data-id="cdfdd19c7bd0fb857e1177d06a5d777f" data-recommend-id="image://cdfdd19c7bd0fb857e1177d06a5d777f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ravensburger / Disney / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cdfdd19c7bd0fb857e1177d06a5d777f" data-recommend-id="image://cdfdd19c7bd0fb857e1177d06a5d777f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you do start to buy booster packs and starter decks, you might also want to invest in a few deck boxes, some card sleeves, and something to hold your excess cards in when they aren’t in a deck. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://go.skimresources.com?id=33330X1579802&amp;xs=1&amp;xcust=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ravensburger.us%2Fen-US%2Fproducts%2Fdisney-lorcana%2Faccessories&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=33330X1579802&amp;xs=1&amp;xcust=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ravensburger.us%2Fen-US%2Fproducts%2Fdisney-lorcana%2Faccessories" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">There are official <em>Lorcana</em>-branded products</a></span> if you want to go that route, but these tend to be a bit pricey.

<p>It probably happens to you all the time. You’re sitting there immersed in a new video game, and then a new character is introduced, and you swear that their voice actor sounds familiar. You spend time looking up everything they’ve done, scrolling through the list in hopes you find something you recognize. We’ll make life a little easier with the Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth voice cast!</p>



<h2 id="h-main-voice-cast-for-final-fantasy-7-rebirth">Main Voice Cast for Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</h2>



<p>The cast of Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is quite large and varied, with a slew of main characters, supporting characters, and more than a few side characters you’ll interact with occasionally but not frequently. They’re all mostly memorable in some way, thanks in no small part to their highly talented voice actors!</p>

<li><strong>Teen Wolf – Theo Raeken</strong></li>



<li><strong>Pretty Little Liars – Mike Montgomery</strong></li>

<h2 id="h-what-other-else-is-sephiroth-s-voice-actor-in">What Other Else is Sephiroth’s Voice Actor In?</h2>

<li><strong>Supergirl – Superman</strong></li>



<li><strong>Superman &amp; Lous – Superman</strong></li>

However, putting titles down like "New 3D Mario, New Mario Kart, [and] a Legend of Zelda remake/remaster" is going to attract attention.</p><p>Nintendo hasn't confirmed that a new Mario game or a Zelda remake/remaster are on the way, and it's likely their inclusion here was either a mistake or guesswork. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/super-mario-odyssey-review/1900-6416795/" data-ref-id="1900-6416795">Super Mario Odyssey</a> was one of the first big games on Switch, and it seems very probable that Nintendo will have the next AAA Mario game for Switch 2. It also stands to reason that another Legend of Zelda won't be far behind. Whether either or both projects are real and ready to arrive this year remains to be seen.</p><p>Although more information about Switch 2 will be revealed at the Nintendo Direct on April 2, the company has shared a new video that reveals <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-video-reveals-how-snappy-joy-con-removal-works/1100-6528933/" data-ref-id="1100-6528933">how the snappy Joy-Con removal works</a>. Meanwhile, a Switch developer has offered his breakdown of the Switch 2 reveal to explain <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-switch-2-is-significantly-more-powerful-according-to-a-game-dev/1100-6528921/" data-ref-id="1100-6528921">the sheer power of the new system</a>. Nintendo hasn't revealed a more specific release date than 2025 for Switch 2 yet, but some are predicting <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-some-believe-the-switch-2-may-not-launch-until-june/1100-6528854/" data-ref-id="1100-6528854">a June launch</a>.</p>

Previously, the Xbox could only support up to 16TB of space on a single USB-connected drive.</p><p>With the new update, Xbox systems can now partition hard disks larger than 16TB into segments to use the full physical storage space. A single 24TB hard disk can now be formatted into multiple partitions (the largest still being 16TB) so you can archive more games, apps, and media than ever — if that’s something you’ve wanted to do.</p><p>However, if you have already been using a hard disk greater than 16TB with Xbox, the company says you’ll need to erase it first to take full advantage:</p><div><blockquote><p>Drives greater than 16TB that have already been formatted will be unaffected by this change and would need to be reformatted to take advantage of the updated support for larger drives.</p></blockquote></div><p>Although you still can’t play current generation games directly off an external drive, it can be useful to back up all of your installs anyway, or games made for older systems. You won’t need to redownload entire titles such as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24283801/comcast-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-large-downloads">the 300GB-plus <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em></a> using an internet connection when you feel like playing it again after a hiatus, unless they need an equally-sizable update.</p><p>Xbox is also releasing an update that enables new network quality indicators for cloud gaming sessions to tell you if your connection is slow and affecting your gameplay. They will appear in red bubbles on the upper right side of the screen, telling you what is happening, such as packet loss or increased ping, which can help you troubleshoot your connection.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/22/24349728/gdc-state-of-the-industry-survey-2025-results<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>One in 10 game developers lost their job in 2024. That’s according to the results of the annual <a href="https://gdconf.com/news/gdc-2025-state-game-industry-devs-weigh-layoffs-ai-and-more">Game Developers Conference state of the video game survey</a>. The survey sampled over 3,000 developers and covered a number of topics including industry layoffs and what kind of games developers are working on.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/8/24065868/a-dark-shadow-falls-across-the-gaming-industry">Prolific layoffs</a> have <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24177290/video-game-industry-layoffs-studio-closures-record">ravaged the industry</a> over the last two years making the question of their impact on developers one of the most important in the survey. In addition to 10 percent of developers losing their jobs, 41 percent of respondents said they had been impacted by layoffs in some way, either by being laid off directly or seeing coworkers or colleagues in other departments let go. The survey also noted that the number of people impacted is potentially much higher because of the students and graduates who reported having a difficult time simply getting a job in the industry at all.</p><p>When asked what reason companies gave for layoffs, 22 percent said restructuring while 18 said declining revenue. 19 percent gave no reason at all. Developers, though, have their own ideas about why layoffs keep happening. In an analysis of responses to what developers think the reason behind layoffs is, the majority were general statements about the industry’s over-expansion during the pandemic. Companies acquired workers and studios in hopes of meeting a level of demand for games that dried up as covid restrictions loosened. However, some developers believe the reason for layoffs is much simpler. Companies like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24283812/microsoft-q1-2025-earnings-revenue-profits-windows-xbox-gaming-surface">Microsoft</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/7/24215155/sony-sees-strong-gaming-growth-despite-weaker-ps5-sales">Sony</a> still reported growing revenues despite multiple rounds of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/31/24210476/bungie-to-layoff-220-employees-new-project">layoffs</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24151047/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-microsoft">studio</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282900/sony-shutting-down-concord-firewalk-studios">closures</a>. It’s no surprise then that 13 percent of respondents attributed layoffs to corporate greed.</p><p>In addition to layoffs, the last few years have also seen the failure of a number of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/3/24234909/sony-concord-ps5-shutdown-poor-sales-launch-pc">high-profile, big-budget, live-service games</a>. While there has been some success in that area with new games like <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, it’s generally tough to launch a live-service game that can compete with the overbearing likes of <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Roblox</em>, and <em>Call of Duty</em>. 2024 was also the year that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/21/24348727/balatro-5-million-copies-the-game-awards"><em>Balatro</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24162572/animal-well-platforming-difficulty-bigmode"><em>Animal Well</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24237778/astro-bot-review-ps5-game-of-the-year"><em>Astro Bot</em></a> dominated headlines and award lists suggesting a greater appetite for those kinds of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23589879/hi-fi-rush-making-of-interview-xbox">smaller-scoped, single-player experiences. </a>It’s interesting, and perhaps concerning then, that according to the survey, over 30 percent of AAA developers are working on a live-service game.</p><p>When it asked developers their thoughts on live-service games the survey answered, “One of the biggest issues mentioned was market oversaturation, with many developers noting how tough it is to break through and build a sustainable player base.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A pattern of stickers spelling out the N-word on a Desert Eagle skin caught the attention of several viewers during a professional Counter-Strike 2 match broadcast. The CS2 player using the skin has addressed it, claiming that they didn’t realize what was being displayed.</p>



<p>While the player may not have noticed during the match, the CS2 community certainly did, and so did the tournament organizer.</p>



<hr>



<p>During an online match in the ESL Challenger League in Europe, 9Pandas player Vladislav “Krad” Kravchenko was spotted using a Desert Eagle with a pattern of stickers spelling out the N-word. The stickers are mirrored because Krad plays left-handed, but it’s still very clear what the original sticker placement was trying to do.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The sticker spelling resulted in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/1i6zt5e/9_pandas_krad_had_a_deagle_with_the_n_word_in_an/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a post</a> on the primary Counter-Strike subreddit, where many speculated that Krad received the skin recently in a trade, and wouldn’t know what was on it until getting into a game. On X, Krad <a href="https://x.com/Kradcs/status/1882033348199297031" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">provided</a> his explanation, claiming he had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-buy-counter-strike-skins-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bought the skin</a> less than a week ago and didn’t notice the word spelled out because he plays left-handed.</p>



<p>When someone buys a skin through Steam or another market, the listing itself doesn’t include the sticker pattern. However, Steam and most markets offer players the option of inspecting the weapon in-game before buying. Additionally, the in-menu weapon inspection screen is always right-handed, even if the player’s settings are left-preferred, so an inspection would clearly show the inappropriate pattern.</p>



<p>The ability for players to have custom control over where they apply stickers was added almost a year ago. Immediately, players used the new feature to <a href="https://dotesports.com/counter-strike/news/cs2-devs-arent-mad-theyre-just-disappointed-in-nsfw-player-sticker-crafts">apply various NSFW words and designs</a>. On January 22, 2025, Krad <a href="https://t.me/kradcsgo/1531" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> via his Telegram account that he has received a two week ban from ESL because of the Deagle.</p>

The game lets players create and personalize their own avatar the use in the games single-player and online co-op modes. The game features eight explorable regions full of puzzles to solve, creatures to catch, and gardens and homes to decorate. The island's seasons change as you play, with each season featuring its own unique quests and activities, totalling over 80 hours of content. The mobile version has proven popular with players, and the upcoming console and PC versions will give new players a chance to check out the game when it launches on March 25.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-is-discounted-on-launch-day/1100-6524388/">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD Is Discounted On Launch Day</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/last-chance-to-grab-3-movies-on-4k-blu-ray-for-only-33-at-amazon/1100-6528683/">Last Chance To Grab 3 Movies On 4K Blu-Ray For Only $33 At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-ps5-reprint-restocked-at-amazon/1100-6528630/">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Physical Edition Gets PS5 Reprint - Snag It While You Can</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-2500-piece-legend-of-zelda-lego-set-is-now-available-at-amazon/1100-6523747/">The 2,500-Piece Legend Of Zelda Lego Set Is Now Available At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-lego-sets-are-available-now-check-out-all-six-in-the-launch-lineup/1100-6528603/">Mario Kart Lego Sets Are Available Now - Check Out All Six In The Launch Lineup</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-lego-sets-launch-at-major-retailers-including-amazon-and-walmart/1100-6528629/">Fortnite Lego Sets Launch At Major Retailers, Including Amazon And Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/backbone-one-iphone-and-android-controller-is-50-off/1100-6524903/">Backbone One iPhone And Android Controller Is 50% Off</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-release-date-4k-blu-ray-preorder-amazon/1100-6528224/">The Lord Of The Rings: The War Of The Rohirrim 4K Steelbook Release Date Announced</a></li>   </ul> </div>

<p>Developer Don’t Nod has announced that Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage Tape 2 has been delayed by a month. The announcement came on Wednesday via the <a href="https://dont-nod.com/en/lost-records-bloom-and-rage-faq/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">studio’s website</a>. </p>



<p>Tape 1, titled “Bloom”, is scheduled release on February 18th while Tape 2, “Rage”, is now set to launch on April 15 rather than March.</p>



<p>“We want to give the team the necessary time to refine the experience, address more bugs, and enhance the storytelling for a truly immersive continuation of the journey,” the studio said.</p>



<p>“We feel that this extra time is necessary to ensure we deliver the experience players and fans deserve. We are confident that this delay will allow us to provide you with a richer experience and we can’t wait for you to live the full journey of Swann, Nora, Autumn, and Kat.”</p>



<p>Despite the delay, Don’t Nod says that they have “surprises” up their sleeves in between the release of Tape 1 and Tape 2. What those surprises are, however, wasn’t hinted at in the announcement. </p>



<p>Upon release, Tape 2 will be a free downloadable update for Lost Records.</p>



<p>Last October, Don’t Nod announced a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/life-is-strange-developer-dont-nod-likely-facing-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“reorganization project”</a>  in order to “safeguard its competitiveness in an increasingly demanding and competitive ecosystem”. This project would would result in layoffs at the studio, though it’s unknown if that was part of the reason for the game’s delay.</p>



<p>When it does release, Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>



<p>What do you think of the delay of Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage Tape 2? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Now that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dragon-age-the-veilguard/">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> has shipped and BioWare is free to pour its resources into the fifth entry in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mass-effect/">Mass Effect</a> series, players are naturally getting excited. But according to former executive producer Mark Darrah, it'll take some time for BioWare to really get the game development wheels turning.</p><p dir="ltr">"Mass Effect isn't ready to suddenly have a team of 250, 300 people working on it," Darrah said in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GR5p4maGiRE">newly released video documenting the production of Veilguard</a>. "In the past when BioWare was toying with being on just one project, like on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/anthem/">Anthem</a> or The Veilguard, that project was up and running at full speed so it was able to suck in every available resource. It had enough existing infrastructure that it was able to absorb everything."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR5p4maGiRE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GR5p4maGiRE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"That's not exactly what's happening [with Mass Effect 5]," Darrah continued. "You see this when you go on to people's social media profiles. People who worked on The Veilguard, some of them are going onto [work on] Mass Effect, but some of them are moving into other parts of the EA organisation because Mass Effect isn't ready for them."</p><p dir="ltr">Darrah worked for BioWare for 23 years, so although he may not be a current employee, he does likely have a pretty good idea of the studio's inner workings. At any rate, the lack of advertising for Mass Effect 5 also suggests that the game's development is still in its infancy. It was first announced in 2020, but it's been crickets from BioWare since then.</p><p dir="ltr">"This [decision to focus on one game at a time] might be great," Darrah said of BioWare's steady, focused approach to the game's development, "Because what it means is BioWare--for really the first time ever--is able to singularly focus on a single project, is able to put all [its] attention on a single project, is able to put everything it has towards a single goal, which is making the best Mass Effect it possibly can."</p>

In addition to revealing insights on the wave of layoffs and increased interest in PC game development, the results show a major year-over-year shift in developer opinions on generative AI technology.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Specifically, developers are </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>much</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> more pessimistic about tools like Copilot, ChatGPT, and MidJourney than they were the prior year. In 2024, 21 percent of game developers thought generative AI would have a "positive" impact on the video game industry. In 2025, that number has dropped to 13 percent.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Meanwhile, the number of survey respondents who think it will have a "negative" impact on the industry increased from 18 percent to 30 percent. This change comes even as more developers report using generative AI tools, with the number rising from 31 percent in 2024 to 36 percent in 2025.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But one eye-opening slide shows who is adopting AI tools in game development—and for the most part, it's not the people programming or creating assets for games. The heaviest AI use showed up for those working in "Business &amp; Finance," at 50 percent of respondents. Next up were those in "Production &amp; Team Leadership" and "Community, Marketing, &amp; PR"&nbsp; at 40 percent of respondents each. Developers in all other departments reported less use.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/five-takeaways-for-game-developers-from-matthew-ball-s-state-of-gaming-data" target="_self" data-discover="true">Five takeaways from Matthew Ball's 2025 State of Gaming data</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Why hasn't adoption reached the rank-and-file of game development yet? Well one respondent who answered the question "what concerns do you have about Generative AI, and what can be done to address them?" may have had the simplest answer—one that goes beyond the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/12/01/1084189/making-an-image-with-generative-ai-uses-as-much-energy-as-charging-your-phone/">ethical</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/generative-ai-is-scraping-your-data-so-now-what">concerns</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> over using the technology. "No matter how you put it, generative AI isn't a great replacement for real people and quality is going to be damaged," this person said.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="If developers aren't excited about AI tools, why are so many companies promoting them?">If developers aren't excited about AI tools, why are so many companies promoting them?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The lack of enthusiasm from developers attending GDC is almost an inverse of the breathless hype surrounding generative AI in the broader marketplace. You'd think there would be more alignment if you take claims about the technology at face value. After all, boosted productivity and faster asset creation aren't </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/owlchemy-labs-ceo-andrew-eiche-thinks-devs-should-be-bullish-about-ai">inherently bad things</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">—developers have been creating tools to solve those problems for as long as there's been a video game industry.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It seems developers view AI tools as going beyond supporting productivity and creativity. "I think AI generated code is currently low quality, and can give rise to subtle bugs that the person using the AI doesn't understand," one respondent told GDC. "If the models advance far enough, this concern might go away, but I'm skeptical. I think right now developers are better [off] avoiding AI code, unless it is for something small like a one time use script."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"People will end up having to review generated content rather than create things themselves, which is not what we all get into the industry for," another wrote.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A third respondent warned that the video game market could become "oversaturated" with "low effort or AI created projects, content, and games that are put out to make money," comparing it to the mobile free-to-play market, currently dominated by fast-follow games that are constantly A/B testing to maximize placement in the iOS App Store and Google Play Store.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These attitudes run counter to other surveys about developer adoption of generative AI. Organizations like venture capital firm Andreesen Horowitz (a16z) have </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/tkexpress11/status/1869416258275533019">polled developers</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and reported that 73 percent of game studios using AI technology, and that about 67 percent of developers are "excited" about using AI in game development.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What's driving that gap in results? "A16z's methodology is opaque so it's hard to say for sure, but it's almost certainly a sampling issue," Omdia analyst Liam Deane explained to us. "If you ask developers to answer a survey about AI in games, the people who respond are inevitably going to be much more interested in AI than the average developer."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He noted that the Game Developer Collective survey (run by Omdia in partnership with Game Developer) has found 35 percent of game developers are reporting the use of generative AI tools, a number that runs parallel to data from the State of the Industry survey. "These two surveys have very different methodologies, so the fact that they produce such similar results is a good sign that the data is pretty accurate."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Whatever you think of the data, what matters most at the end of the day is whether the rank-and-file are comfortable using generative AI tools to make fun, successful games. So far signs say they're not quite there yet.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The question is—will they ever be?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game Developer, Omdia, and Game Developers Conference are sibling organizations under Informa.</span></span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.
