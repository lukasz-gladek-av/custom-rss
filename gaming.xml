            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/content-warning-sales-two-million<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Spooky horror hit&nbsp;<em>Content Warning&nbsp;</em>has managed to reach a pretty impressive sales number within its first two months on release, publisher Landfall has revealed.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/LandfallGames/status/1797602340197060916" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a message on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Landfall says&nbsp;<em>Content Warning&nbsp;</em>has hit 2.2 million sales in two months, which means that more than 8.8 million players currently own the game on Steam.</p>

<p>If you're wondering how the math checks out,&nbsp;<em>Content Warning&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/get-content-warning-free-for-april-fools-from-creators-of-tabs">available for free</a> during the first 24 hours of its release, and 6.6 million players redeemed the game during that period (including me, although to my shame I'm yet to play it).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/content-warning-sales-2.2m-field.jpg?itok=1hIZl-Q_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/content-warning-sales-2.2m-field.jpg?itok=Xjwweysp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Content Warning&nbsp;</em>is selling pretty well.</figcaption></figure><p>Following on from&nbsp;<em>Content Warning</em>'s free period, it maintained a pretty solid level of player interest, selling 100,000 copies within a 24-hour period and going on to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/content-warning-sales-footage">hit the 700,000 mark in a week</a>.</p>

<p>The game was originally released on April Fools' Day, but unlike many of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/april-fools-day-2024-gaming-roundup">other "announcements" on that fated day</a>,&nbsp;<em>Content Warning&nbsp;</em>isn't a joke; it's a proper game you can actually play, and it looks like many people have done just that.</p>

<p>In case you missed out on the fun the first time around,&nbsp;<em>Content Warning&nbsp;</em>is a game in which you and your friends explore spooky locations in order to try and "go viral", as the kids say.</p>

<p>If you've played&nbsp;<em>Lethal Company</em>, you're in similar territory with&nbsp;<em>Content Warning</em>, although instead of avoiding monsters, you'll be trying to film them as much as possible (without running out of oxygen, naturally).</p>




<p>The more you film, the more viral you'll go. If only things worked that way in real life, eh? You can use your ad revenue in order to upgrade your gear and film even more spooky stuff.</p>

<p><em>Content Warning&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2881650/Content_Warning/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>. Make sure to check it out if you're looking for&nbsp;<em>Lethal Company</em>-style shenanigans in a wackier setting.</p>

People have <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@3opossums/photo/7376367674013568299&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@3opossums/photo/7376367674013568299" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">grown up playing this game</a></span> (myself included) and naturally we see a bit of ourselves in this thing that we’ve sunk so much time into.</p><p>That first video established a template for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@_side_11/photo/7375933444729359662&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@_side_11/photo/7375933444729359662" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">countless others</a></span> that then began to crop up on my “For You” page (TikTok’s algorithmic timeline unique to every person), and before I knew it, I was inundated with emotional <em>Destiny </em>TikToks about everyone’s ten-year journeys with the game. </p><p>While a good chunk of the videos I’ve seen simply show the players getting older over time, others reflect how drastic a change can take place in ten years.

See, <em>Cryptmaster </em>is a dungeon crawler with a twist—it’s also a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/world-record-speed-typing-300wpm-mythicalrocket-youtube-1850529090&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/world-record-speed-typing-300wpm-mythicalrocket-youtube-1850529090">typing game</a></span>. The way the player interacts with the world is through typing single words. You control a party of four adventurers, each with their own special attacks, but to trigger them you must first guess and then type in the specific word. Hints for letters in these words are gained as “drops” from slain enemies.</p><p>But X user @countzio discovered that if you never deduce those early attack words, the Cryptmaster gets really pissed off at you. “I refused to learn the first attack in <em>Cryptmaster </em>and my reward was the Cryptmaster calling me dumb and telling me how to refund the game (and an achievement),” they write in a post. The screenshots on the post show exactly that. First, the Cryptmaster breaks the fourth wall and complains that all the player had to do was type “HIT,” and that after a while they straight-up instructed the player to do so, still to no results. He then asks if the player has been playing for two or more hours, as that’s the limit for when you can no longer get a Steam refund. The Cryptmaster then suggests when asked for any additional comments the player should write, “‘I’m an imbecile’ or words to that effect.”</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Frankly, I don’t think this is the game for you. All you had to do was type in the word ‘hit’. I hinted and then I outright instructed you. I even used two separate tooltips. What I’m saying is, it isn’t my fault you didn’t get it.

In some ways, it’s emblematic of<em> Cryptmaster</em>’s overarching approach to an open-ended structure that allows the player to use their own words to interact with the world in interesting ways.

Woods is then shot in both legs, consigning him to a wheelchair. The game later shifts to the year 2025 and we see an older Woods in a wheelchair.</p><p>This new intro suggests Woods <em>will</em> appear in the Black Ops 6 campaign, rumored to be set during the '90s Gulf War. The cutscene also acts as our first look at Woods in Black Ops 6. Perhaps Woods serves the function of being an ‘intel guy’ in the campaign, dishing out information to the player ahead of, and maybe even during, missions over comms.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Frank Woods in a wheelchair in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackOps6?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#BlackOps6</a> in the 90s means Black Ops 2 is canon.</p><p>This means:<br>- Jason Hudson is no longer alive.<br>- Alex Mason may no longer be alive. <a href="https://t.co/ZVN1EAfCxC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/ZVN1EAfCxC</a></p></div>— Jon (@MrDalekJD) <a href="https://twitter.com/MrDalekJD/status/1797742778014937583?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 3, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>There are some unanswered questions, however. Black Ops 2 has two different endings, one in which Alex Mason survives, the other in which he is dead. Perhaps Black Ops 6 will resolve this by making one of the two endings canon.</p><p>As for the Woods intro, Warzone players are currently trying to work out what causes it to appear. It seems random, but there may be some mechanic underpinning its appearance. Meanwhile, there are a number of Black Ops 6-related challenges in Warzone right now, encouraging players to jump in to connect the dots between releases.</p><p>Microsoft will fully unveil Black Ops 6 during its Xbox Showcase event on June 9. Microsoft has confirmed <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-insists-it-wont-lock-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-behind-a-new-game-pass-tier-at-launch">Black Ops 6 is the first Call of Duty to launch straight into subscription service Game Pass</a>.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-first-impressions-of-the-big-dlc</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-%E2%80%93-first-impressions-of-the-big-dlc.889239/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-first-impressions-of-the-big-dlc<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>There was something magical about that first playthrough of Elden Ring – when everything was new and there was a prevailing sense of discovery and awe as I rode through The Lands Between, stumbling upon the horrors of Caelid, the beautiful vistas of Limgrave and Liurnia, and the treasures that awaited after a challenging dungeon. Which is why my three hours with Elden Ring’s DLC: Shadow of the Erdtree was so exciting, because it felt like I was playing Elden Ring again for the first time, in a brand new realm to explore, with new discoveries, new surprises, new gear, and you’d better believe new challenges, even despite my provided level 150 character with end-game level gear. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>My three hour play session began at the Cocoon of the Empyrean Site of Grace, which is where you do battle with the optional boss <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Mohg,_Lord_of_Blood">Mohg: The Lord of Blood</a>. But this time, instead of an empty boss room, there was an NPC named Leda there as well, who asked me if I too was beckoned by Miquella. By examining the cocoon with Miquella’s withered arm ominously hanging out, I was whisked away to the Realm of Shadow. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>In true Elden Ring fashion, the very first enemy I encountered ended up murdering me.</p></div><p>It’s hard to get a sense for just how big the Realm of Shadow actually is, but I will say that my first steps out into it were definitely reminiscent of the first time I emerged from the elevator and opened the doors into Limgrave. There were obvious areas of interest right from the get-go for me to explore, like a crypt that was directly to my left, some scorched ruins directly up ahead, a large castle far off in the distance, and the towering flaming brazier enemy from the trailer roaming around just on the horizon. </p><div id="196665"><p><h3>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree (Steam Code)</h3></p><div><p>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree is a paid DLC expansion for Elden Ring releasing on June 21 for PC and consoles. Players will seek out the god Miquella in a shadowed world full of new biomes, dungeons, and bosses.</p></div></div><p>Of course, in true Elden Ring fashion, the very first enemy I encountered ended up murdering me, as if to reassure me that despite my level 150 character with a +25 strength scaled axe, along with 80 points allocated to strength, this DLC wasn’t going to be a cake walk for people with end game builds that have run out of things to challenge them in the base game. It wasn’t even a boss, it was just a random enemy that decided to drop down from above while I was exploring some ruins, with its dual-wielded chakrams that kept me tumbling backwards as I tried to dodge its twirling dance that never seemed to end. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree Story Trailer Stills</h3></div></output><p>Once I got my revenge and a paltry couple thousand runes for my trouble – again, this was just a normal run-of-the-mill enemy – I made a break down the beaten path and wound up at the first big dungeon of the DLC: Belurat. The ultimate goal of the DLC is to follow Miquella’s crosses, which essentially act as Miquella’s footprints and signpost the plot-critical path. The first one I found also came with a message that read: “The Gate of Divinity Lies in the Tower sealed by Shadow. That is surely where Kind Miquella is headed. We are no Empyreans but we must locate the path that will lead us there. I will follow the crosses east.”</p><p>Belurat itself was a fairly large dungeon that was somewhere between the size of something like Stormveil Castle and Castle Morne. It’s not quite the size of a Legacy Dungeon from the main game, but still pretty lengthy and filled with plenty of optional side paths, many of which I didn’t get the opportunity to fully explore. It was a fortress filled with all sorts of new nasties, from scorpions of both the small and gigantic varieties, to relatively weak guards that liked to hide around corners waiting to ambush me, to Gravebirds that sat perched on the ramparts, to heavily armored knights with giant weapons that would occasionally use shoulder charges to bash into me from 15 feet away. Every enemy I fought was a new encounter for me to learn, which was an exciting challenge to overcome.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Every enemy I fought was a new encounter for me to learn, which was an exciting challenge to overcome. </p></div><p>The boss of Belurat is one that you no doubt will remember if you watched the reveal trailer. It’s called the Divine Beast, Dancing Lion. It was a difficult fight, and one that required me to make use of one of the new summons in Shadow of the Erdtree: Black Knight Commander Andreas, along with swapping my weapon from the heavy hitting Fireknight’s Fire Greatsword to the much more nimble Backhand Blade, which allowed me to hit and run much more easily. Perhaps the coolest aspect of this particular boss was the fact that its second phase has it alternating between ice and lightning power ups, forcing you to also have to contend with either random lightning strikes, or massive AOE ice attacks that build up frostbite, on top of also avoiding his heavy hitting attacks.</p><p>Eventually I prevailed, gaining the Lion’s head to wear as a helmet (horrifying, but cool), and his remembrance, and moved on to the second main dungeon: Castle Ensis. This place reminded me much more of the Caria Manor, minus, you know, all of the horrifying hand monsters. There were lots of magic-wielding enemies, including a giant in Carian Armor that was much like Bol’s from one of the evergaol boss fights, and an extremely difficult Carian Knight that brought to mind the fight against the enemy that guarded Renalla’s chambers in the Academy of Raya Lucaria. Fitting, because this enemy guarded Relanna, who I probably spent at least 30 to 40 minutes trying to beat. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Relanna was definitely the hardest boss to take down during the preview window, combining fearsome melee sword skills with extremely powerful magic attacks. In her second phase, her two swords would be imbued with red and blue flames, giving them all new attacks that would set the arena ablaze and make them extremely difficult to get out of the way of. And just when I thought I had the win in the bag, she’d float up in the sky and cast a version of Renalla’s Full Moon that would crash into the ground for three devastating shockwaves that could basically one-shot me from full health.</p><p>If it isn’t clear already, Shadow of the Erdtree is hard, but you’re not left completely without a lifeline. Scattered throughout the Realm of Shadow are Scadurtree Fragments that can be brought back to a site of grace and turned in, much like you would a Sacred Tear, or Golden Seed. These fragments will decrease the amount of damage enemies deal to you, but only while you’re in the Realm of Shadow. In addition to that, you can also find Revered Spirit Ash blessings, which can be turned in the same way, but these will instead increase the amount of damage dealt by your spirit summons. </p><div data-cy="carousel"><h3>Mitchell's Favorite Soulslikes</h3><p>My 15 favorite soulslike games, ranked. </p></div><p>While I didn’t get to explore the optional paths as much as I would have liked in my three hours of playtime, I still managed to find plenty of <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Shadow_of_the_Erdtree_New_Weapon_Types">brand new weapons</a>, talismans, armor sets, cookbooks and crafting guides, and even an Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone. The new weapons were very cool too, with some really unique properties and weapon arts that made them behave quite differently from anything in the main game. The Heavy Smithscript Axe, for instance, could be thrown with a press of the heavy attack button, without any sort of cost or resource tied to it, making it very effective both at a distance and close up. The Milady weapon art puts you into a stance with your arm stretched out to the side, and from the stance you can do a number of cool follow-ups, like a leaping and lunging stab that’s very reminiscent of one of Malenia’s attacks. The Backhand Blade actually can be split into two swords when you dual wield it and has a super sick weapon skill that has you dashing to an enemy’s side for a stab to their ribs. </p><p>I felt like I accomplished a lot in my three hours of playtime with Shadow of the Erdtree, but even then, it still felt like there was so much left on the table. Right when my time ended, I was just about to explore a path marked by another one of Miquella’s crosses that led down into what seemed like one of FromSoftware’s famous poison swamps, and just by listening in on other players at the event, it was clear that I missed at least one other dungeon with a seemingly exciting boss fight that I’m very much looking forward to attempting myself. Fortunately the wait isn’t much longer now as Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree is set to release on June 21. </p><p><em>Mitchell Saltzman is a senior guides producer at IGN.

        <p>CEO Danny Kelleher on educating developers on music business models and its recent partnership with Remedy</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>While video game merchandise typically tends to centre around figures, apparel, and collector's items, there's an increasing demand for video game music – to the point where there are well established games-centric labels such as Laced Records.</p>
<p>Laced was founded by CEO Danny Kelleher in 2015, and has since worked on almost 80 IPs across 250 releases, with clients including Devolver, Bethesda, Capcom, Sega, Ubisoft, and Bandai Namco.</p>
<p>Of all the services that Laced provides, its record label is in the most demand. It recently partnered with Remedy once again to release the Alan Wake 2 soundtrack, which dropped on May 13 to mark the franchise's 14th anniversary.</p>
<p>The soundtrack features Petri Alanko's original score, in addition to songs featured in-game performed by singer-songwriter Poe and Martti Suosalo (who plays Ahti in both Alan Wake 2 and Control).</p>
<p>Laced last worked with Remedy for Control, releasing the vinyl and digital release of its soundtrack in 2020.</p>
<p>"Remedy are just really lovely people, and we pitched very hard to bring in Alan Wake 2 as it was something we really wanted," Kelleher tells <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em>.</p>
<p>He notes that Remedy was really supportive and heavily involved throughout the whole process, particularly for the eventual vinyl release that both Remedy and Laced have alluded to online.</p>

<p>"We sent Remedy some copies of our previous vinyls because they wanted to put some of their artwork together," Kelleher explains. "Sometimes we do all the artwork, sometimes the client wants to. With Remedy, they love to get hands-on and have creative direction on the artwork, so we're excited to see what they come up with."</p>
<p>Laced has seen increased demand for physical content in the form of its vinyl and CD releases, but sales performance can "vary massively" between AAA and indie titles.</p>
<p>"It's not as simple as 'if it's AAA, it's going to sell really well, if it's indie it's not'," Kelleher notes. "We've definitely seen that if you get the right indie game, they can absolutely compete on numbers with a lot of the AAA titles we've signed. We just did Inscryption which has sold incredibly well and had a massive response from the community. Cult of the Lamb also did incredibly well."</p>
<p>Kelleher highlights that working with indie developers is a core part of Laced's business model in that it doesn't want to "neglect the indie market" and wants to maintain balance between clients.</p>
<p>"We do have a few indie releases that come out that haven't performed greatly, but we're happy to [produce them] because we want to support that side of the business," he says. "If a release supports an indie developer – especially one where it's literally just two or three people, sometimes self-published – we love getting behind those sorts of developers where possible."</p>
<p>Another area in which Laced wants to maintain balance is physical and digital.</p>
<p>Kelleher explains that physical media continues to succeed thanks to collectors within the gaming community, while releasing soundtracks on streaming services like Spotify provides developers with additional benefits when it comes to registering copyrights and collecting royalties.</p>
<p>"Historically, a lot of publishers have put their content out digitally, but may have missed opportunities or the metadata isn't correct," Kelleher explains. "That's not really the fault of the publishers – this is a new world for them. What we're trying to do is support them and show how to structure digital releases globally, make sure the composers are credited where possible, and that the royalties trickle through correctly.</p>
<blockquote>"It's not as simple as 'if it's AAA, it's going to sell really well, if it's indie it's not'"</blockquote>
<p>"Moving forward, digital is a big thing. We want to make sure that the big clients, as well as the indies, have a support network to be able to deliver the music properly."</p>
<p>Kelleher says that Laced's range of audio services outside of its record label has grown considerably over the past few years. This involves music composition, licensing, sound design and implementation, as well as finding composers and artists to make music for games.</p>
<p>However, the current wave of layoffs and studio closures has had an effect on this.</p>
<p>"We've had a few games that we were working on which were cancelled," he adds. "But we're expecting it all to pick up again as things begin to settle, hopefully towards the end of the year and going into next year."</p>

 </a>
<figcaption>Laced recently partnered with Remedy to release the Alan Wake 2 soundtrack</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Laced's record label has continued to grow in the meantime, which has been built specifically for the games industry in that it doesn't follow the business formula already in place for film and television.</p>
<p>This means that instead of issuing copyright strikes against content shared online, Laced has been building a system that "selectively monetises certain assets" as publishers and developers rely on players sharing their content which often features gameplay videos that includes licensed music.</p>
<p>"For example, if there's a gameplay video on YouTube or an influencer doing a dance to one of the songs TikTok, that's fine," Kelleher explains.</p>
<p>"But if someone has ripped the music from the game and just posted the music up on YouTube, that would be something that we wouldn't take down, but we can go in and monetise on behalf of clients."</p>
<p>Publishing is also a big sector for Laced, one that it wishes to grow alongside its audio services and record label.</p>
<blockquote>"We want the big clients, as well as the indies, to have a support network to deliver their music properly."</blockquote>
<p>"From releasing soundtracks, we realised that a lot of companies aren't registering their music copyrights, which means that they're leaving a lot of money on the table by not collecting it," Kelleher notes.</p>
<p>Last year, Laced set up a publishing business to register music copyrights on behalf of its clients, and began the process of collecting mechanical and performance royalties from societies such as PRS for Music.</p>
<p>"For the moment, [it's all about] educating our clients, showing them how the music and film world has done this for many years, what the model looks like, then building that within games," he explains. "So there's a proper ecosystem and business there for music and, at that point, it should become a serious revenue stream."</p>
<p>Aside from music, Laced also wants to open up to the more traditional side of gaming merchandise having partnered with Devolver to design, manufacture, and sell the developer's items.</p>
<p>"I had no real intention of doing it," Kelleher says. "But through the record label we had already set up manufacturing and e-commerce, as well as fulfilment warehouses in Europe. In the US, we had customer support and e-commerce there too. The only thing we had to change was rather than just making vinyl, we would also make cuddly toys and T-shirts.</p>
<p>"One of the focuses over the next 18 months is to start onboarding new merchandise clients."</p>
<p>Overall, Kelleher says that Laced's main focus for the future is to streamline the business as it works with so many partners across different departments which can result in "a lot of back and forth and approvals."</p>
<blockquote><p>"A lot of companies aren't registering their music copyrights, which means that they're leaving a lot of money on the table"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"When we're also doing publishing, audio, merchandise, you're usually speaking to very different departments which is like running four businesses, so that's been a challenge," he explains.</p>
<p>"What we're doing at the minute is bringing in more of a management structure so we can effectively manage each bit of the business independently."</p>
<p>On a more personal note, Kelleher just wants to see games music succeed as a medium. There are promising signs that video games music is enjoyed by an increasingly large audience, as demonstrated with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/from-the-last-of-us-to-baldurs-gate-3-the-success-of-the-game-music-festival">the recent Games Music Festival</a> and the Final Symphony concert in Birmingham over the weekend – the latter of which Laced put together a vinyl release for and helped the record of.</p>
<p>"I've been advocating for video games music for nine years now, saying this is a serious medium," he says. "Now I think we're seeing a shift to that, and what we're trying to do is put the business model and the structure behind it."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/nvidia-reveals-g-assist-its-new-ai-based-gaming-assistant/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=nvidia-reveals-g-assist-its-new-ai-based-gaming-assistant<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="301" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Everyone knows by now that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/nvidia-rtx-remix-beta-now-out-expect-shiny-remasters-of-classic-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nvidia is knee-deep in the active development and leveraging of AI technologies wherever and however possible</a>, but it’s been unclear what the company’s next major gaming step might be. Now, however, it seems that Nvidia Project G-Assist is its next push onwards.</p> <p data-characters="536" data-current-count="536" data-injectable="true">For what it’s worth, Project G-Assist does seem like something that could be incredibly powerful in relatively short order. Notably, G-Assist is an on-board RTX machine learning algorithm that tries to provide contextual assistance while you’re actively gaming. “Project G-Assist aims to put game and system knowledge at players’ fingertips. Simply ask a question about your game or system performance, and the AI assistant provides context-aware answers,” says Nvidia’s own official G-Assist <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/g-assist-ai-assistant/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a>. </p>
 <p data-characters="242" data-current-count="242" data-injectable="false">Examples of G-Assist being useful include sourcing live information on how to progress in games, but also in real-time settings and PC hardware tuning, which is particularly interesting. Interesting <em>and</em> troubling in equal measure, as it were.</p> <figure data-current-count="542" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Project G-Assist | Your AI Assistant For Games &amp; Apps" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RdsyJQWUUSs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <h2 id="h-nvidia-s-project-g-assist-will-try-to-make-pc-gaming-much-easier-and-more-streamlined" data-injectable="false">Nvidia’s Project G-Assist will try to make PC gaming much easier and more streamlined</h2> <p data-characters="329" data-current-count="329" data-injectable="false">Project G-Assist is, from the looks of it, accessible at all times and can be activated either by pressing the assigned hotkey or by using a wake phrase. Immediately upon being called up, G-Assist can be tasked with a variety of jobs, from sourcing answers to gameplay questions to explaining lore in games you’re playing. </p> <p data-characters="288" data-current-count="617" data-injectable="true">If you, too, are wondering where this information would be coming from, that’s simple: from the Internet, of course! Is it going to be wrong? Possibly! Other AI models in the past have been caught <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/02/22/copyleaks-openai-chatgpt-plagiarism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">skimming the Internet for other people’s work</a> with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/23/24162896/google-ai-overview-hallucinations-glue-in-pizza" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">varying degrees of accuracy</a>.</p>
 <p data-characters="605" data-current-count="605" data-injectable="true">To demonstrate G-Assist, Nvidia used <em>Ark: Survival Ascended</em>, and the AI helper provides concise, actionable answers to the user’s questions in the curated demo. G-Assist is apparently context-aware, and can respond to queries based on what you’re seeing and doing in the game itself: “Because the assistant is context aware, it can personalize its recommendations to the user’s playthrough: it can analyze skill points, the crafting menu and currently locked engrams, for example, and suggest what to pick next to help players conquer higher-level areas and foes,” Nvidia claims.</p>
 <p data-characters="266" data-current-count="266" data-injectable="false">Further, the assistant appears to be capable of applying Nvidia’s optimized game settings on the fly, going so far as to track performance statistics to assess whether there’s anything you could be doing to improve your gameplay experience further still.</p> <p data-characters="298" data-current-count="564" data-injectable="true">“It can intelligently find ways to increase performance per watt, such as dynamically undervolting the GPU while respecting a frame rate target. For laptop users, power usage is of particular importance, determining how long they can play before their battery is depleted,” says Nvidia.</p>
 <p data-characters="222" data-current-count="222" data-injectable="false">We don’t know yet how, exactly, Nvidia might be aiming to release Project G-Assist to the masses, but given the demo, it doesn’t seem that we’ll need to wait all that long to see how it works in practice.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/should-you-turn-off-crossplay-in-ea-fc-24.889221/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/should-you-turn-off-crossplay-in-ea-fc-24/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=should-you-turn-off-crossplay-in-ea-fc-24<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="206" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Crossplay is indeed a double-edged sword when it comes to the general gameplay of <em>EA FC 24</em>. Matchmaking queues may go faster with the feature on, but veteran players may advise you to turn the feature off. </p> <p data-characters="337" data-current-count="337" data-injectable="false">The feature was introduced for the first time in <em>FIFA 23</em> after periods of limited testing among players. Thanks to crossplay, players could play against each other without any platform restrictions (as long as they belong to the same generation of consoles). While enabling it definitely helps in matchmaking, there are a few cons, too. </p> <h2 id="h-should-you-disable-crossplay-in-ea-fc-24" data-injectable="false">Should you disable crossplay in EA FC 24?</h2> <p data-characters="207" data-current-count="544" data-injectable="true">We suggest keeping crossplay on to expedite your queues in<em> EA FC 24</em>. However, if you’re having problems with matchmaking, you may want to consider toggling it off to see if adjusting the option helps. </p>
 <p data-characters="340" data-current-count="340" data-injectable="false">While I did opt to keep crossplay on when <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ea-fc-24-javier-zanetti-birthday-icon-sbc-tasks-solutions/">EA FC 24</a></em> was released, matchmaking has been smoother since I turned it off. Even when the pings are the same, matchmaking between two players on the same platform seems to be a lot smoother. My players on the pitch are far more responsive, and network fluctuations appear to be almost non-existent.</p> <p data-characters="265" data-current-count="605" data-injectable="true">If you have a really smooth internet and don’t like to wait long for matchmaking, you can enable crossplay. As I said, the fluctuations are rare (unless the servers are experiencing severe issues), and your better internet might avoid the problems in my case.</p>
 <p data-characters="244" data-current-count="244" data-injectable="false">Disabling crossplay in <em>EA FC 24</em> is pretty straightforward – just go to Matchmaking from in-game settings, where you can disable it. Do note that this feature is always enabled by default, so you need to turn it off at least once manually.</p> <h2 id="h-what-are-the-advantages-of-crossplay-in-ea-fc-24" data-injectable="false">What are the advantages of crossplay in EA FC 24?</h2> <p data-characters="325" data-current-count="569" data-injectable="true">The most significant benefit comes from faster matchmaking as the available pool of players grows. Earlier, in games like <em>FIFA 22</em>, Xbox players could only play with other users on the same platform, and the same applied to PC and PlayStation. Once crossplay was enabled, the pool suddenly merged all these three player bases.</p>
 <p data-characters="253" data-current-count="253" data-injectable="false">Naturally, quicker matchmaking has many benefits. With crossplay, players can easily play with their friends in co-op sessions without having to worry about their platforms. This was not possible a couple of years back without the presence of crossplay.</p> <h2 id="h-what-are-the-disadvantages-of-crossplay-in-ea-fc-24" data-injectable="false">What are the disadvantages of crossplay in EA FC 24?</h2> <p data-characters="235" data-current-count="488" data-injectable="true">While crossplay allows you to play without any restrictions on your platform, there are certain issues with matchmaking. Several users have reported occasional data fluctuations within matches, especially when server loads are heavy.<br></p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Gunna turn crossplay off until it’s fixed</p>— GullitGang (@GullitGangFC24) <a href="https://twitter.com/GullitGangFC24/status/1789921831517884693?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 13, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="264" data-current-count="564" data-injectable="false">While such fluctuations don’t always occur, they can be problematic, especially if you’re playing competitive modes like Division Rivals and Champions Finals. That momentary drop in your connection could result in conceding goals and leading to losses.</p>

While you attempt to rebuild your ship and escape, you’ll need to find a way to survive through crafting and, particularly after the sun sets, fending off hordes of vicious creatures.</p>
 <p data-characters="472" data-current-count="472" data-injectable="true">There’s a lot of playing around with physics to be had here. Beyond just building structures, <em>Dig or Die </em>tasks you with making sure you actually do so thoughtfully. Build without care or consideration and your structures run the risk of collapsing, pushing your escape back even further. There are also water cycles—including threats of rain, underwater rivers, and other aquatic obstacles—that play into the integrity of your base and your basic survival.&nbsp;</p>

There are also custom game modes that let you start out under a massive ocean or in a world made up of flying islands. Or simply skip all the exploration and play the stripped-down Base Defense mode for concentrated building and defending.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="69" data-current-count="69" data-injectable="false">You can dig and/or die when <em>Dig or Die </em>hits consoles on June 5, 2024.</p>

<p data-characters="273" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The release of <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em> is <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-long-will-destiny-2-be-down-for-the-final-shape/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an obviously monumental event </a>for the classic Bungie franchise, but it was never going to be a flawless event. Bungie admits as much, too, as the company’s announced the full list of known problems to be aware of as we go.</p> <p data-characters="485" data-current-count="485" data-injectable="true">Unless you’re eager to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ive-been-playing-destiny-2-wrong-for-nearly-a-decade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">risk playing <em>Destiny 2</em> wrong </a>as you hop straight into <em>The Final Shape</em>, it’s good to be aware of these issues. Some of the listed problems are fairly inoffensive, while others straight-up warn you about one-and-done reward instances that you may well end up missing out on permanently, if you don’t know what you’re about. It’s not all bad, though: the list isn’t overly long, and it should be easy enough to stay on top of it.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destiny 2 YouTube</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-destiny-2-the-final-shape-s-known-issues" data-injectable="false">Destiny 2: The Final Shape’s known issues</h2> <p data-characters="168" data-current-count="468" data-injectable="true">As per Bungie’s recently updated <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/finalshapeknownissues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Final Shape</em> blog post</a>, there’s about two dozen different issues to be mindful of, as <em>The Final Shape</em> begins to ramp up:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="14" data-items-injection="true" data-current-count="560" data-injectable="true"> <li data-index="0">Players enjoying <em>The Final Shape</em>‘s campaign mode should avoid joining missions in-progress or swapping characters; failing to do so could lead to progress and/or reward loss.</li> <li data-index="1">PC players with 3D audio enabled will not get audio output from <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em>. Bungie recommends switching the option off while playing the game.</li> <li data-index="2">Placeholder art is present during the ‘Leaving the Final Shape Campaign’ pop-up.</li> <li data-index="3">Casting the Prismatic Hunter’s Blink Dagger Super with the Stasis Grapple active nullifies all momentum and causes the character to fall down.</li> <li data-index="4">The Knock ‘Em Down’ Solar Hunter Aspect does not affect the number of Blade Barrage projectiles.</li> <li data-index="5">The Hunter Arc Staff Super description does not mention that certain attacks (i.e. the ground slam and the three-attack combo) apply Blind</li> <li data-index="6">The Deconstruct Perk description does not mention the new effect of refilling loaded magazine ammo from reserves.</li> <li data-index="7">Vestiges do not auto-convert into Memory items if there’s a Memory item present in your Inventory. Players need to obtain a new Vestige after using the Memory for Vestiges to convert into a new Memory.</li> <li data-index="8">Certain old seasonal items and currencies will not be automatically purged from player invenotires</li> <li data-index="9"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-the-final-shapes-exotic-khvostov-looks-like-a-proper-delight/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Khvostov 7G-0X</a>‘s Trait incorrectly claims that the ricochet rounds deal more damage.</li> <li data-index="10">If you had any tracked Triumphs that got Vaulted with the release of <em>The Final Shape</em>, you will not be able to untrack them.</li> <li data-index="11">If you do not open the final chest of the The Blooming Deep Lost Sector before the cutscene plays in <em>The Final Shape</em>‘s campaign, the rewards will be permanently lost.</li> <li data-index="12">Warlocks picking up a Stasis Shard with the Glacial Harvest Aspect active will not receive the healing effect.</li> <li data-index="13">The Berserker’s Bladefury Super does not properly apply the Woven Mail effect on allies when combined with the Into The Fray Aspect.</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="313" data-current-count="313" data-injectable="false">Nothing hugely game-breaking, then, but this is all stuff that we ought to be aware of. Hopefully, Bungie will be able to resolve all or almost all of these problems in the coming days and weeks, and in the interim, it’s at least good to know what we’re up against as <em>The Final Shape</em> finally rolls up.</p> <p data-characters="298" data-current-count="611" data-injectable="false">Note, too, that Bungie does not intend to keep this list up-to-date after the release of<em> Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em>, so don’t expect it to meaningfully change or to be able to track future problems using it. Instead, it’s just a one-off snapshot of issues leading into the new campaign.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/sirius-dice-releases-progress-pride-dd-dice-in-collaboration-with-daniel-quasar-and<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>To celebrate Pride Month Sirius Dice has collaborated with Daniel Quasar, creator of the Progress Pride Flag, and Wizards of the Coast to release a <a href="https://siriusdice.com/products/dnd-progress-pride-dice-set-limited-edition">full set of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> dice that feature the Process Pride Flag</a>. The main catch is that this is an exclusive set of dice, once the 1,500 copies that were created are sold they won't be returning to the store.</p>

<p>In talking about this collaboration Daniel Quasar had the following to say about the importance of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> to their life and the importance of LGBTQ+ representation in the space:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Playing tabletop RPGs has changed my life significantly so getting to experience them from a different perspective has been amazing. My hope with this dice set is that LGBTQ+ players will feel seen, represented and proud as they roll, knowing that someone on the inside is just like them and just as excited to play.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This limited set of dice come with everything from your d4 up to your d20 and cost only $40. For every set of dice sold a donation in the amount of $30 will be made to <a href="https://www.thetrevorproject.org/">The Trevor Project</a>. Assuming my math is correct a $30 donation for each of the 1,500 copies would mean a staggering $45k donation.</p>

<p>For those who may not be aware The Trevor Project is a suicide prevention and crisis intervention organization for LGBTQ+ young people. The organization offers 24/7 services allowing for youths to get access to trained counsellors when they're needed.</p>

			<p>Cyberpunk 2077 continues to be among the best-looking open-world role-playing games released in the past few years, thanks to some impressive mods that push its visuals further in terms of realism, like the DreamPunk graphics overhaul mod.</p>
<p>A new video shared a few days ago by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NextGenDreams" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NextGen Dreams</a> showcases the game running with the <a href="https://www.patreon.com/NextGenDreams" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1.1 version of the mod</a>, which features a complete rework of all weather conditions and lighting, a custom LUT for SDR and HDR, improved ray tracing and path tracing and more. Thanks to the high quality of this graphics overhaul, some of the sequences featured in the video could pass for real-life sequences.</p>

<p>Reaching new levels of realism in Cyberpunk 2077 seems to be the main goal for several modders. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalDreamsyt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Dreams</a> attempted to do so, as seen in a new 8K resolution video, using the Real City Modlist and the latest version of the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/10490" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ultra Plus Better Path Tracing mod</a>, which introduces multiple quality improvements to modes and quality for an improved path tracing experience.</p>

<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and Xbox One. The Phantom Liberty expansion is now available only on PC and current-generation consoles, introducing a new location and one of the best stories told in Night City, as highlighted by Alessio in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/">review</a>.</p>

<p id="6POnTd"><strong>Run time: </strong>2h 9m<br><strong>Director: </strong>Spike Lee<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Denzel Washington, Clive Owen, Jodie Foster<br><strong>Where to watch:</strong> Netflix</p>
<p id="xTIsSL"><em>Inside Man</em> is an undersung classic in one of cinema’s greatest subgenres: the bank heist movie. Starring Denzel Washington at the height of his leading-man powers as a disgraced detective sent to negotiate with a Clive Owen-led group of robbers turned hostage takers, <em>Inside Man</em> is a perfect mix of 2000s bravado. The movie is full of twists and both of its stars getting one over on each other, but like all the best thrillers, it’s not until the final moments that everything comes into place. </p>
<p id="zcfFMU">And while the cast is outstanding, the real star of the show here is Spike Lee, who seems to use this movie to prove that he could be the greatest pop filmmaker of his generation if he wanted to. Few movies can match the raw tension and nervous energy that <em>Inside Man</em> brings to every scene, let alone its high points, like Washington and Owen’s confrontation inside the bank, which feel like a barrage of cinematic magic tricks. All of this leads to one of the most satisfying endings to any heist movie ever, making <em>Inside Man</em> an easy choice for one of the 2000s’ best thrillers. —<em>Austen Goslin</em></p>

<p id="Xn0GOZ"><strong>Run time: </strong>1h 57m<br><strong>Director: </strong>Paul Feig<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Anna Kendrick, Blake Lively, Henry Golding<br><strong>Where to watch:</strong> Netflix</p>
<p id="zfCPL6">Few movies have ever captured the exact feeling of breezing through a summer beach read as effectively as <em>A Simple Favor</em>. Paul Feig’s terrifically fun thriller follows Stephanie Smothers (Anna Kendrick), a mommy vlogger in need of some friends, as she meets the unbelievably cool Emily Nelson (Blake Lively) and her very hot husband, Sean (Henry Golding). </p>
<p id="pJ0vBI">To say more about the movie now would be to spoil one of its dozen or so twists, which would partially ruin the fun. But without giving anything away, <em>A Simple Favor</em> is absolutely delightful in the way it reveals mystery after mystery, somehow finding a new way to get more fun and silly with each revelation. Lively is particularly incredible in the film as a high-society version of Amy Dunne with a way better wardrobe. —<em>AG</em></p>

<p id="rzSdBn"><strong>Run time: </strong>1h 37m<br><strong>Directors: </strong>Joel and Ethan Coen<br><strong>Cast: </strong>John Getz, Frances McDormand, Dan Hedaya<br><strong>Where to watch:</strong> Max, Criterion Channel</p>
<p id="voLCPh">The Coen brothers’ 1984 directorial debut, <em>Blood Simple</em>,<em> </em>is a perfect primer for the darkly comic, eccentrically plotted, idiosyncratic body of work they went on to create. A hard-boiled neo-noir crime thriller set in Texas, the film centers on a deadly love triangle between a bar owner, his wife, and one of his employees. When the attempted affair and elopement inevitably spills over into bloodshed, the would-be lovers are implicated in a tangled plot of money and murder. Frances McDormand shines in her performance as Abby, the dissatisfied wife at the heart of the drama, as does M. Emmet Walsh as Loren Visser, the conniving hitman who throws the whole conflict into turmoil in his own selfish bid for a quick payday.<em> —Toussaint Egan</em></p>

<p id="LCXvIk"><strong>Run time: </strong>1h 48m<br><strong>Director: </strong>Brian De Palma<br><strong>Cast: </strong>John Travolta, Nancy Allen, John Lithgow<br><strong>Where to watch:</strong> Available to rent on Amazon, Apple TV</p>
<p id="obTQmI">John Travolta stars in Brian De Palma’s 1981 mystery thriller <em>Blow Out</em> as Jack Terry, a sound effects technician living in Philadelphia who inadvertently stumbles across a political assassination while recording background noise for a sleazy teen slasher flick. Befriending Sally (Nancy Allen), a distressed call girl and the sole principal witness of the assassination, Jack attempts to unravel and expose the insidious conspiracy behind the killing before the perpetrators can murder her and cover up their involvement. </p>
<p id="mAWhSs">Based on Michelangelo Antonioni’s 1966 film <em>Blowup</em>, De Palma’s film is an inspired contemporary reinvention of an old classic defined by its inventive use of split diopter lenses to achieve focus between foreground and background elements, impressive cinematography that emphasizes the elements of sound design and music inherent to the plot, and a trio of fantastic performances by Travolta, Allen, and John Lithgow as a sadistic hitman hellbent on completing his mission. If that weren’t enough, the ending to <em>Blow Out</em> is arguably one of the most remarkable and devastating of its era, with a twist so well-executed you’ll be left scratching your head in astonishment as to how you never saw (or heard) it coming. <em>—TE</em></p>

<p id="wtiy1Q"><strong>Run time: </strong>2h 6m<br><strong>Director: </strong>Todd Haynes<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Mark Ruffalo, Anne Hathaway, Tim Robbins<br><strong>Where to watch:</strong> Netflix</p>
<p id="pBzhpe"><em>Dark Waters</em> is the kind of harrowing corporate legal thriller we don’t get much of nowadays, and certainly not about real-life stories and cover-ups. The movie follows defense attorney Robert Bilott (Mark Ruffalo) as he investigates the deaths of several cows on a small dairy farm. What he uncovers after that is a massive conspiracy perpetrated by the DuPont company in regard to a toxic forever-chemical called PFOA. After his discovery, Bilott sets off on a massive legal undertaking to hold DuPont responsible for knowingly poisoning thousands of Americans.</p>
<p id="wbElfp">The story itself is nearly beyond belief and scarier than any corporate legal thriller has any right to be. But despite this being mostly a movie about Ruffalo shuffling through boxes and slowly driving by farms, director Todd Haynes (<em>Carol</em>) manages to make every second feel taut and full of conspiracy and danger. —<em>AG</em></p>

<p id="X5LXGS"><strong>Run time: </strong>2h 1m<br><strong>Director: </strong>Ryoo Seung-wan<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Kim Yoon-seok, Jo In-sung, Heo Joon-ho<br><strong>Where to watch:</strong> Viki</p>
<p id="nk15e6">A tightly wound political thriller set during the start of the Somali Civil War, Ryoo Seung-wan’s <em>Escape from Mogadishu </em>doubles as an exciting action movie and a moving plea for the world to move past superficial divisions that prevent us from helping each other.</p>
<p id="pPjUyG">Set in 1991, the movie takes place in a time where both the North and South Korean governments were lobbying hard to be added as United Nations members. The Somali government holds a key vote, so both Korean governments send representatives to make their case. When civil war breaks out, the politicians and their families must find their own way out of the country — but will the group be able to work together, or will decades of generational distrust get in the way of their safety?</p>
<p id="xv1ZSk"><em>Escape from Mogadishu </em>strikes the balance between thoughtful historical film and exciting thriller deftly, and one scene in particular stands out in the latter category: A caravan, fired upon by soldiers, attempts to back its way out of a tight situation, as the camera zooms through each car one by one in an absolutely breathless sequence that will leave you on the edge of your seat. —<em>PV</em></p>

<p id="BPwiFx"><strong>Run time: </strong>2h 50m<br><strong>Director:</strong> Michael Mann<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Val Kilmer<br><strong>Where to watch:</strong> Netflix</p>
<p id="yA49Xh">In an <a href="https://scrapsfromtheloft.com/movies/michael-mann-the-making-of-heat/">interview with Empire published 12 years after the film’s release</a>, Michael Mann described his 1995 masterpiece <em>Heat</em> not as a heist thriller, but as a “symphonic drama,” an opera of heightened emotions centered on two men whose single-minded obsessions put them at odds not only with one another and their respective sides of the law, but the people who otherwise love and care about them. <em>Heat </em>is not only that, it is also indisputably one of the greatest movies of the ’90s, featuring two career-best performances from the legendary Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. </p>
<p id="c0411J"><em>Heat</em> is... well, an absolute heater of a movie. It’s a masterful thriller clocking in at nearly 3 hours, and yet every minute feels consequential and moving. The story of Neil McCauley (De Niro), a career thief and his cat-and-mouse battle against LAPD Lt. Vincent Hanna (Pacino) is an explosive epic bursting with gunfire that rattles like percussion instruments and pensive silences that pronounce emotional intensity too complex to express through words alone. If you have never seen <em>Heat</em> before, now is the opportunity to correct that error, and even if you have seen it already, I guarantee you’re well overdue for a rewatch. <em>—TE</em></p>

<p id="Ccglwj">A career-making hit for Park Chan-wook (<em>Oldboy</em>, <em>The Handmaiden)</em>, <em>JSA </em>is a mystery about a murder on the border between the two Koreas. Swiss Army Major Sophie E. Jean (Lee Young-ae) is sent to the Demilitarized Zone to investigate an incident on the border that left two North Korean soldiers dead and one South Korean soldier (Lee Byung-hun) wounded. After the wounded South Korean soldier confesses to the killings, the investigator gets conflicting reports from the two sides about what happened. At times funny, joyful, crushing, and pensive, <em>JSA </em>cuts right through to the human stakes of the maintenance of borders and government conflicts. —<em>Pete Volk</em></p>

<p id="tSmuPp">John Cassavetes’ 1976 neo-noir thriller is one of the finest works by one of the masters of American independent cinema. The movie follows a nightclub owner (Ben Gazzara, in a stunningly good performance) who gets in way over his head and is asked to kill somebody to pay off his gambling debts. A rich character study with an all-timer lead performance, stunning use of tinted frames to bring out color, and Cassavetes’ cunning eye for group dynamics, <em>The Killing of a Chinese Bookie </em>is a high mark of 1970s American filmmaking. —<em>PV</em></p>

<p id="oShUWc">Jean-Pierre Melville’s hugely influential neo-noir is a meticulously paced, slow-burn crime thriller. Quiet hitman Jef (played by all-time great movie star Alain Delon in one of his most memorable roles) gets pulled into a tough situation when he’s spotted after killing a target. Soon, Jef is not just on the run from the police, but from other figures in the organized-crime underworld.</p>

<p id="Wnx4TF">This 92-minute thrill ride is one of many stellar French crime thrillers on Netflix. In it, Lino (former stunt man Alban Lenoir) is an expert mechanic who has been forced to work for a group of dirty cops. When he’s framed for murder, Lino has to find the one thing that can prove his innocence: a lost bullet in a missing car. With high-octane action sequences and great car stunts, director Guillaume Pierret executes a simple premise to perfection. The sequel, also on Netflix, is just as good (if not better). <em>—PV</em></p>

<p id="GYLp0m">Fritz Lang’s 1931 thriller <em>M</em> is widely considered arguably his magnum opus — second perhaps only to his seminal 1927 sci-fi epic <em>Metropolis </em>— but also one of the greatest films of all time. Set in Berlin, the film follows the investigation of a psychotic child murderer whose reign of terror has plunged the city into a fit of hysteria and suspicion. As the criminal underground of Berlin find the noose tightening around them in the police’s unsuccessful campaign to capture him, they take it upon themselves to root out this evil and bring him to justice. <em>—TE</em></p>

<p id="7Hli8O">John Schlesinger’s 1976 thriller <em>Marathon Man</em> is perhaps best remembered for one scene in particular, wherein Dustin Hoffman’s character, Thomas “Babe” Levy — a New York graduate student writing his thesis on American fascism — is brutally tortured by an elderly Nazi war criminal with dentistry tools, all while being asked, “Is it safe?” The whole movie is worth witnessing in full, with a byzantine conspiracy involving devious assassins, undercover government agents, a hidden cache of stolen diamonds, and a hapless layperson thrown into the mix by a whim of unfortunate circumstance. Aside from possessing one of Hoffman’s most iconic roles, <em>Marathon Man</em> is a taut, nail-biting film that withstands the test of time as thoroughly entertaining thriller. <em>—TE</em></p>

<p id="oMcELu">The sole film directed by actor Charles Laughton,<em> The Night of the Hunter</em> is hailed by many as one of the most masterful stories ever committed to the screen. At the heart of the movie’s enduring legacy is Robert Mitchum’s iconic performance as Harry Powell, a misogynistic serial killer with a flair for silver-tongued theatricality. Centering initially on Powell’s plot to romance a gullible widow and uncover the whereabouts of a stolen cache of $10,000, the film later unfolds into an odyssey across a rich expanse of stark, silhouetted environments, as the widow’s children desperately attempt to elude the mad preacher’s murderous intent. If you’re looking for a classic thriller with beautiful imagery, a moving score, and memorable performances, <em>The Night of the Hunter</em> boasts all those in ample amount. <em>—TE</em></p>

<p id="YC8sbm"><strong>Run time: </strong>3h 0m<br><strong>Director: </strong>Sukumar<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Allu Arjun, Fahadh Faasil, Rashmika Mandanna<br><strong>Where to watch:</strong> Prime Video</p>
<p id="KHEup4">This Telugu crime thriller tells the origin story of Pushpa, a gangster who rises up the ranks of a smuggling syndicate that exports red sandalwood, a rare lumber that only grows in South India, overseas. A movie inextricably linked to the globalization of labor, <em>Pushpa</em> opens with an animated sequence depicting how the lumber got to Japan as part of a wedding present, told in reverse. It’s a fascinating way to start the movie, and it immerses you directly into the story and the struggle of the laborers who harvest this rare commodity.</p>
<p id="Nx4bvR">Pushpa (Allu Arjun) is one of these laborers, but he is one of a kind. Uniquely laid back and with enough confidence in himself to ignore any and all authority figures, Arjun brings a vibe to the character that can best be summarized as “the coolest cat around.” While he may not be super smooth around the woman he pines for (Rashmika Mandanna), Pushpa is savvy enough with his brains and with his fists to quickly move up the ladder of the syndicate. But when the unsavory figures at the top of the criminal organization start to feel threatened by his rise, Pushpa has to use all his wits and strength to prevail. A beautiful movie with bright colors, hard-hitting action sequences, and fun musical numbers, <em>Pushpa </em>is one of the coolest gangster thrillers in recent memory. —<em>PV</em></p>

<p id="UyzrGH">A standout low-budget Antonio Banderas vehicle, <em>Security </em>is a 2017 action thriller where Banderas plays a retired Marine Corps delta captain who gets hired as the new security guard at a mall. When a young girl being chased by armed mercenaries (led by Ben Kingsley) takes shelter in the mall, Banderas must use all the training at his disposal to protect her. With great action sequences, a strong lead performance by Banderas, and an economical 92-minute running time, <em>Security </em>is one of the stronger action thrillers available on Netflix. —<em>PV</em></p>

<p id="8g0SqO"><strong>Run time: </strong>1h 57m<br><strong>Director: </strong>Thomas M. Wright<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Joel Edgerton, Sean Harris, Jada Alberts<br><strong>Where to watch:</strong> Netflix</p>
<p id="hNiwCZ">Based on a true story, Thomas M. Wright’s Australian psychological crime thriller stars Sean Harris as Henry Teague, an aloof day laborer with a sordid past who, by way of an acquaintance he meets on a long distance bus ride, meets and begins to work for Mark (Joel Edgerton), a criminal with ties to a much larger crime syndicate in West Australia. Parallel to this is the largest organized police manhunt in the country, one which may or may not have its sights set on Henry and his employers. Things get a little more complicated than that, but then — why spoil the surprise, eh?</p>
<p id="cDtQT9">Wright’s film is packed with dark, subliminal imagery; whole sequences that play out with seemingly mundane detail before quickly morphing into fugue-like nightmares. Edgerton and Harris both deliver exceptional performances, as does Jada Alberts in her role as a dogged Senior Constable determined to bring Teague to justice by any means available. Between the gorgeous cinematography and bracing minimalist score, <em>The Stranger</em> is a no-brainer pick for one of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23402426/best-thrillers-watch-netflix-streaming-movies">best thrillers available to stream on Netfli</a>x. <em>—TE</em></p>

<p id="l2294c"><em>Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance </em>is the first in Park Chan-wook’s Vengeance trilogy, a group of three standout films (including 2003’s <em>Oldboy</em>) that are linked in theme but not in characters or plot. In <em>Mr. Vengeance</em>, a deaf factory worker (Shin Ha-kyun) makes a deal with black market organ sellers to exchange his kidney for one that could be used for his sick sister. When the organ sellers run away with his kidney, he acts on the advice of his girlfriend (Bae Doona) and kidnaps the daughter of his former boss (Song Kang-ho).</p>
<p id="RBq0yI">Like <em>Oldboy </em>and the trilogy’s third movie (<em>Lady Vengeance</em>), <em>Mr. Vengeance </em>tackles issues of class and capitalism through the prism of the action thriller genre. With a standout cast and Park’s terrific visual sensibilities, <em>Mr. Vengeance </em>is a bloody good time at the movies. —<em>PV</em></p>

<p id="qLun66">Of the many excellent collaborations between Akira Kurosawa and legendary movie star Toshiro Mifune, <em>Yojimbo</em> may be my favorite. Mifune plays a ronin who wanders in a small town and unknowingly finds himself squarely in the middle of a gang war. As the ronin’s skill with the sword becomes quickly apparent, the two factions try to bring him into their side of the conflict.</p>
<p id="s16Nvp">Unofficially remade years later Sergio Leone’s <em>A Fistful of Dollars</em>, <em>Yojimbo </em>is a remarkably influential movie, and an unforgettable display of one of the most charismatic leading men to ever grace movie screens. If you’ve gone this far without seeing it — run, don’t walk, to your TV. —<em>PV</em></p>

Geoff Keighley’s annual World Premierathon, and several ostensibly unrelated events orbit it, pile vast mountains of gaming news upon us. For a breakdown of everything going down in the next week, check out <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/e3-summer-game-fest-2024-conference-streaming-when-date-1851507950&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/e3-summer-game-fest-2024-conference-streaming-when-date-1851507950">this handy dandy guide</a></span> for when, where, and how to watch all the showcases. But today we’re here to talk about our hopes and dreams for the headliner.<br></p><p>Summer Game Fest is in its fourth year, and while not every company in the industry is participating, we know enough from his past shows to have a good idea of what to expect, and what to wish for. Here are some predictions (and hopes) for Summer Game Fest 2024.</p></div></div><div><p>BioWare already said it would be giving its long-awaited fantasy RPG <em>Dragon Age: Dreadwolf</em> a proper reveal <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-day-teaser-reveal-summer-2024-1851073899&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-day-teaser-reveal-summer-2024-1851073899">this summer</a></span>. Well, it’s summer now. Geoff has had BioWare reveals at his events almost exclusively over the past however many years: <em>Dreadwolf </em>itself was revealed in 2018 at The Game Awards; BioWare announced it was making a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-4-5-bioware-teaser-release-date-2029-1851009417&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-4-5-bioware-teaser-release-date-2029-1851009417">new <em>Mass Effect</em></a></span> at the same event in 2020. <em>Dreadwolf </em>is practically a shoo-in for this year’s Game Awards. But that’s a safe prediction. So instead, I’m going with a hope: I need my mage pariah boyfriend Dorian Pavus to show up in the trailer. It’s Pride Month. Show him to me. — Kenneth Shepard<br></p></div><div><p>I have no insider knowledge to base this on, but I can’t imagine FromSoftware decided to ship the first<em> Armored Core</em> in a decade without cooking up some expanded content. We’ve gotten plenty of balance patches and smaller updates adding new features and equipment, but there’s plenty of room to add some full-blown missions or an entirely new campaign. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/armored-core-6-review-elden-ring-souls-rpg-fromsoftware-1850765780&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/armored-core-6-review-elden-ring-souls-rpg-fromsoftware-1850765780"><em>Armored Core IV</em></a></span> was just so good and I’m ready for more.</p><p>It would also be in keeping with the series’ history to release a spin-off or direct sequel within the first two years of the previous game’s launch. Am I grasping at straws here? Yes. But hey, the <em>Elden Ring</em> <em>Erdtree</em> DLC took forever. Maybe that’s partly because some folks were still working on <em>Armored Core</em>. I know the game didn’t seem to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/armored-core-6-sequel-hidetaka-miyazaki-mech-fromsoft-1851497631&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/armored-core-6-sequel-hidetaka-miyazaki-mech-fromsoft-1851497631">sell as much as the studio hoped</a></span>, but the only way to win over more fans is with more mech battles. It’s time to return to Rubicon. — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><p>Last year, <em>Alan Wake 2</em> was everything to me. Sure, I play a lotta games in this line of work, but <em>AW2</em> kept me in a trance that lasted long after its conclusion, including a line about loops and spirals that I keep repeating and inserting wherever I can. Naturally, I need more. Yes, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/senua-saga-hellblade-2-sacrifice-review-xbox-pc-1851489149&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/senua-saga-hellblade-2-sacrifice-review-xbox-pc-1851489149">other narrative and cryptic games</a></span> have managed to keep me satisfied in the meantime, but I need more of Mr. Wake and Ms. Anderson, along with Remedy’s wonderful storytelling and game design.</p><p>We know Remedy has been working on something, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/alanwake/status/1796557371046580629&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/alanwake/status/1796557371046580629" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">based on their tweets</a></span>, including a rebrand of their Twi—X account to “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/remedygames/status/1795832621533917371&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/remedygames/status/1795832621533917371" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Poison Pill Entertainment</a></span>,” which, you know, would be the opposite of a Remedy. We’ve seen creative director <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/genepark/status/1749973876308684851?t=QSWHa3YnGyQOgPdCZdRDVg&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/genepark/status/1749973876308684851?t=QSWHa3YnGyQOgPdCZdRDVg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sam Lake in mo-cap gear</a></span>, so we know Remedy certainly has secrets to reveal. Hopefully, we’ll learn what they are soon… — Claire Jackson</p></div><div><p>If Paramount wasn’t going to put out the trailer for the third live-action <em>Sonic the Hedgehog </em>movie in front of one of its own films, last month’s <em>If</em>, what better place to premiere Keanu Reeves as Shadow? Fans (including me) <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-3-movie-trailer-shadow-paramount-1851483101&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-3-movie-trailer-shadow-paramount-1851483101">are going mad waiting</a></span> for even a frame of footage from the upcoming film, and all signs point to a Summer Game Fest premiere. According to Geoff’s highlight trailer, Sega will be showing <em>Sonic X Shadow Generations </em>at the event, and even if the <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 </em>trailer would do fine as a shadow (no pun intended) drop on YouTube, what could it hurt to have a big stage to itself for a few minutes? — Kenneth Shepard<br></p></div><div><p>I might be a huge <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/stellar-blade-nier-yoko-taro-jealous-hyung-tae-kim-1851413085&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/stellar-blade-nier-yoko-taro-jealous-hyung-tae-kim-1851413085">Yoko Taro</a></span> stan who is constantly hoping the madman will announce a new game, but I really do think it could be in the cards for this Summer Game Fest. First off, Taro hasn’t released a major new game since <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nier-automata-the-kotaku-review-1793002839&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nier-automata-the-kotaku-review-1793002839"><em>NieR: Automata</em></a></span> in 2017. While I am a fan of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/yoko-taro-sinoalice-end-update-server-nier-mobile-1849711919&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/yoko-taro-sinoalice-end-update-server-nier-mobile-1849711919">now-defunct gacha games</a></span> he has worked on, as well as the oft-forgotten <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/voice-of-cards-trilogy&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/voice-of-cards-trilogy"><em>Voice of Cards</em></a></span> series, none of his post-<em>Automata</em> projects have been on the same level production-wise. Also, we know he has new projects in the works—in May <em>NieR </em>series producer Yosuke Sait revealed that he and Taro are <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nier-3-automata-yoko-taro-yosuke-saito-1851478254&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nier-3-automata-yoko-taro-yosuke-saito-1851478254">working on a new game</a></span> together, though they wouldn’t confirm if it was a <em>NieR </em>title. Just announce the dang thing already and give me something to live for! — Willa Rowe<br></p></div><div><p>But my one hope is that whatever Taro’s next project is, it isn’t <em>NieR</em>. At this point, we’ve experienced five incredible stories from Taro in the extended Drakengard and Nier universe (that’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/drakengard-3-isnt-just-about-making-a-sequel-not-en-469640600&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/drakengard-3-isnt-just-about-making-a-sequel-not-en-469640600"><em>Drakengard 1</em> and <em>3</em></a></span>, as well as the original <em>NieR</em>, <em>Automata</em>, and <em>Reincarnation</em>). All these stories have been variations on the same themes, and worked incredibly well as pieces of a larger thematic quilt. But I truly feel like the story reached its conclusion with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nier-reincarnation-final-chapter-goodbye-out-now-1851374397&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nier-reincarnation-final-chapter-goodbye-out-now-1851374397"><em>Reincarnation</em></a></span>, which you all should have played. The thing that would excite me most is seeing Taro create something completely fresh that isn’t weighed down by fan expectations of what a <em>NieR </em>or <em>Drakengard </em>game has to be. - Willa Rowe<br></p></div><div><p>I don’t know if Hideo Kojima will appear on stage at Summer Game Fest. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/death-stranding-2-trailer-playstation-gameplay-2025-1850470174&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/death-stranding-2-trailer-playstation-gameplay-2025-1850470174"><em>Death Stranding 2 </em>is looming</a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hideo-kojima-od-jordan-peele-xbox-exclusive-1851083040&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hideo-kojima-od-jordan-peele-xbox-exclusive-1851083040"><em>OD </em>exists</a></span>, and he’s also working on a new espionage game called <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/physint-hideo-kojima-new-game-state-play-1851214597&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/physint-hideo-kojima-new-game-state-play-1851214597"><em>Physint</em></a></span>. But even if the man is not there to show any of those games, I am confident his name will be said on stage at least once. I have no idea what the context will be, but I do not believe Geoff can stand on a stage and not mention his bff Jill. — Kenneth Shepard<br></p></div><div><p>Summer Game Fest 2023 was a two-hour show <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-geoff-keighley-women-diversity-1850553957&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-geoff-keighley-women-diversity-1850553957">with no women</a></span>. There was supposed to be one, Melanie Liburd, who played Saga Anderson in<em> Alan Wake II</em>, but she couldn’t make it due to scheduling conflicts. Surely this year will be better? Hopefully, the big game companies send more women to represent them and their games at the event, and Keighley doesn’t take no for an answer. — Ethan Gach<br></p></div><div><p>Ideally, this prediction doesn’t come true and Ethan’s hope wins out over my cynicism. But the video game industry is always listening and learning and then forgetting the lessons it was taught even a month or two prior. I believe we’ll see more women presenting games on stage at Summer Game Fest 2024, but I will be gobsmacked if the numbers aren’t still lopsided as fuck. — Kenneth Shepard<br></p></div><div><p>Geoff has no doubt upped security after he’s had not one, but two instances of someone getting on stage who should not have been there. This included the infamous <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2022-bill-clinton-orthodox-rabbi-elden-ring-1849873240&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2022-bill-clinton-orthodox-rabbi-elden-ring-1849873240">“Bill Clinton Kid” from The Game Awards 2022</a></span> and another guy who said some shit about <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/geoff-keighley-gamescom-starfield-gta-6-bill-clinton-1850762952&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/geoff-keighley-gamescom-starfield-gta-6-bill-clinton-1850762952">at Gamescom 2023</a></span>. But I still believe someone is going to try a third time, and I am waiting for Geoff’s guards to knock someone out. I fully believe that the need for the show to go exactly how it’s rehearsed will lead to someone getting cold-cocked on a livestream. The question is, which of Geoff’s shows will be the one where it finally happens? — Kenneth Shepard<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p><a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/ubisoft">Ubisoft</a> is gearing up to drop another <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/xdefiant">XDefiant</a> update later today following the online shooter’s launch later last month.</p>
<p><iframe title="XDefiant Preseason Battle Pass Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QnpEl5D_t4Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>XDefiant update Y1S0.2 (which will appear on PS5 as 1.000.009) makes a number of changes to Ubisoft’s new free-to-play title, including improvements to how Crossplay and party invites work.</p>
<p>For those who missed the memo, XDefiant is a high octane, arena-based shooter that is shaping up to be one of <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/call-of-duty">Call of Duty</a>‘s biggest rivals in 2024. What does it bring to the table, you ask? The developers at Ubisoft San Francisco have woven together smooth COD-like gunplay with a splash of <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/overwatch">Overwatch</a> (light hero-like powers, and a focus on team-based objectives). On top of that, the game features Factions inspired by characters from Ubi franchises such as Splinter Cell and Far Cry.</p>
<p>Y1S0.2 is sure to be one of many patches as XDefiant continues to undergo refinement. In future updates, we can expect new content including bonus Factions, maps, events, and (hopefully) even more game modes.</p>

<p>Here are latest changes coming to XDefiant.</p>
<h2>XDefiant Update Y1S0.2 Patch Notes</h2>
<h3 id="U29jaWFs">Social</h3>
<ul>
<li>While in a party, we now display the most restrictive Crossplay setting among the party members, as it applies to the whole party. Also fixed an issue where party members with differing Crossplay settings couldn’t matchmake.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with displaying incorrect player names on some Social screens.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash caused by spamming open/close View Party Invites, but who would even do that, calm down.</li>
<li>On consoles, Ubisoft Connect party invites could display as if they were coming from Xbox or PlayStation Network friends. Fixed that, along with some other weird invite-related things.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="TWlzY2VsbGFuZW91cw==">Miscellaneous</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed some missing terrain textures when players joined matches in progress on some maps.</li>
<li>Input-Based Matchmaking setting status now updates correctly after changing it on Xbox.</li>
<li>Fixed a thing on PS5 where people could sneak into places they shouldn’t via PS5 Activities.</li>
<li>Security improvements, various.</li>
</ul>
<p>Having recently got some hands-on time with the game, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/01/is-xdefiant-a-cod-killer/">here’s what we had to say</a>:</p>
<p>“Exactly how much stopping power XDefiant gains will depend largely on its future roadmap. Thankfully, Ubisoft is no stranger when it comes to running a successful live service, with Rainbow Six Siege making a dramatic turnaround in its first year to become one of the biggest FPS games of all time. XDefiant fans are seemingly in good hands, then, and Ubisoft will need to keep its momentum if it wants to ward off 2024’s upcoming class of shooters from this year’s Black Ops 6 to <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a>&nbsp;and Sony’s&nbsp;<a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/concord">Concord</a>.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pax-dei-early-access-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Mainframe Industries has announced an Early Access release date for its social sandbox MMO&nbsp;<em>Pax Dei</em>, which will have you exploring a massive open world based on the myths and legends of medieval times.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Pax Dei&nbsp;</em>will launch into Early Access on June 18th, which means it's exactly two weeks to the day (at time of writing) until you'll get to play this one.</p>

<p>According to Mainframe,&nbsp;<em>Pax Dei&nbsp;</em>is "currently amongst the most-wishlisted games on Steam", with more than 100,000 players apparently taking part in the game's latest alpha test.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pax-dei-early-access-release-date-building.jpg?itok=nadK-YQf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pax-dei-early-access-release-date-building.jpg?itok=Y9WGVnnp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pax Dei&nbsp;</em>has already amassed some pretty significant interest.</figcaption></figure><p>Although<i>&nbsp;</i><em>Pax Dei&nbsp;</em>is still in the relatively early stages of development, Mainframe says it has "reached a stage where it requires a permanently live game and an active player base" in order to progress.</p>

<p>Game director Reynir Hardarson, whose name you might recognize from his work as creative director with&nbsp;<em>Eve Online&nbsp;</em>developer CCP Games, says&nbsp;<em>Pax Dei&nbsp;</em>"can't be built without players" and that Early Access puts&nbsp;<em>Pax Dei&nbsp;</em>players "on the floor with [Mainframe]".</p>

<p>Two of&nbsp;<em>Pax Dei</em>'s core gameplay loops are, according to Mainframe, already in place. The "peaceful" loop, which involves gathering and crafting, and the "adventure" loop, which encompasses the game's PvE and PvP dimensions, are already present.</p>

<p>The third pillar, the "social" loop, will introduce markets and economy to&nbsp;<em>Pax Dei</em>, and will be incorporated as the game's first major update after its Early Access release, although we're not sure exactly when that will happen.</p>




<p>Mainframe Industries boasts luminaries from the likes of not only CCP Games, but also Blizzard, Ubisoft, and Remedy on its team.</p>

<p>If anyone's going to be able to build a lasting, sustainable social sandbox MMO, it's probably these guys, although I don't think you should expect a&nbsp;<em>Pax Dei&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/eve-online-microsoft-excel-crossover-actually-happening">Microsoft Excel crossover</a> anytime soon.</p>

<p><em>Pax Dei&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1995520/Pax_Dei/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> on June 18th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/interviews/skydances-behemoth-interview-discussing-importance-of-creating-immersive<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Skydance Games is preparing their next big VR title following the success of <em>The Walking Dead: Saints &amp; Sinners</em>, and it’s looking to be a big one. While we had some time to get to know the upcoming <em>Skydance’s Behemoth</em> through an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/skydances-behemoth-preview">early preview session</a>, we still had some questions.</p>

<p>Sitting down with Skydance Vice President of Creative for <em>Skydance’s Behemoth</em>, Shawn Kittlesen, we were able to get a further grasp on the development of the game with a focus on player experience, and how it’s important to create an immersive and engaging experience through physics-based combat mechanics, player choice, and customization.</p>

<p>As the game has been fairly dormant in the public eye since its announcement, we wanted to know a little more about the history of this project and why the team decided to go ahead with VR versus a traditional kind of action adventure.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skydances-behemoth-screenshot-01.jpg?itok=TB4N8ui_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skydances-behemoth-screenshot-01.jpg?itok=forOTGTi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>“Our original team was looking for pioneering technology, with VR being that in games right now,” said Kittlesen. “The team released <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/walking-dead-saints-sinners-hands-on-preview"><em>The Walking Dead: Saints &amp; Sinners</em></a>, and that has gone on to be one of the best-selling VR games of all time.</p>

<p>“The physics-based melee combat in that game lets you kill walkers, which was something fans responded to in such a way that made us think we had to build on this. So taking this idea, we thought, what if any one human enemy was dangerous? What if they could go toe to toe with you using melee combat?</p>

<p>“That’s how we ended up getting into the advanced mechanics [for <em>Skydance’s Behemoth</em>], and then just bringing in as many weapons as we could like swords, axes, blade knives, and a bow and arrow as a ranged weapon. The grappling hook became a way to manipulate the environment and explore.”</p>

<p>While <em>The Walking Dead</em> was a survival game in a very intimate space, the team at Skydance Games then considered what was the opposite of that – wide open spaces. Specifically in that VR can sell the scale in a way that traditional “flat” games can’t.</p>

<p>“We wanted to go the biggest scale with our world, and the Behemoth encounters are these really exceptional punctuation points along the way of the campaign,” said Kittlesen. “The package comes together with everything you’ve learned in terms of traversal, environmental puzzles, and combat.”</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skydances-behemoth-screenshot-02.jpg?itok=uU7VDrxK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skydances-behemoth-screenshot-02.jpg?itok=YhwhXcRc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This was all evident in the demo Skydance Games had on display moments before. While it was run through in about 30 minutes, the slice of gameplay could have taken up to an hour for the sheer number of ways it could be approached, and because <em>Skydance’s Behemoth</em> is the type of game where you can pick your play style a little bit.</p>

<p>“You can hang back and play from range, you can get up close, and I imagine there’s going to be some in the player base who go with a shield only so they can block attacks,” explained Kittlesen.</p>

<p>“Or you can grab enemies and engage your strength and shoot them a great distance. So yeah, player choice is important to us. Wren [the player character], is not canonically gendered in any direction, so Wren can be anyone.</p>

<p>“In the final game, you’ll have a choice of voices for your character, a choice between two different sets of arms, and a choice of range of skin tones too so that whoever’s playing, they can be fully immersed in their character.”</p>

<p>The way anyone plays, it’ll ultimately be up to them. <em>Skydance’s Behemoth </em>is effectively a sandbox, and the game environments are a playground.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skydances-behemoth-screenshot-03.jpg?itok=Bguthdgi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skydances-behemoth-screenshot-03.jpg?itok=1pFmDiG_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Attached to these gameplay elements is an immersive story, and while it won’t be as choice driven like the gameplay loop itself is, it is engineered to be like a thrilling rollercoaster ride.</p>

<p>“Everyone will get the same story,” Kittlesen confirmed.</p>

<p>“It’s just sort of how their approach to getting there, and how they upgrade their weaponry. There are different hero weapons you can acquire along the way, and rather than upgrading your character, you’ll upgrade those weapons.</p>

<p>“You’ll have the choice where you put those resources into customizing the different properties and effects that it has when you do different tasks. You’ll also be able to customize the appearance of it.”</p>

<p>There’s a lot to sift through when it comes to <em>Skydance’s Behemoth</em>’s narrative, and there will be a lot of twists and turns along the way, as well as other characters who you’ll meet during the adventure. But just how long will said adventure last?</p>

<p>“It’s about a 12-hour campaign,” said Kittlesen.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skydances-behemoth-screenshot-04.jpg?itok=o6SjLI40 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skydances-behemoth-screenshot-04.jpg?itok=Kw0Rzoa_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>“We have frequent save points and it’s divided into chunks, so that if a player only has 20-30 minutes they can go in, have a play session, and make some meaningful progress as they make their way through. Anyone’s welcome to play longer, but realistically most VR players prefer a 30-to-40-minute session."</p>

<p>This design was implemented after the team received feedback from the work on <em>The Walking Dead</em>. That means it’s all manual saves, and while there are auto save points, the big boss battles do have that leeway in the form of checkpoints if you need to go back and puzzle out what to do.</p>

<p>These bosses, or Behemoths as the game’s title calls out, were the result of the team at Skydance Games pushing themselves to do something that could only be done in VR. Of course, you can fight boss battles in traditional flat games, but you can’t get a sense of how big that monster is relative to you.</p>

<p>“You can’t look up and have that feeling of awe and the impossibility of it,” Kittlesen explained.</p>

<p>“The demo boss started out at about half its current size, and we decided to keep scaling it up. All the Behemoths are very different, look different, and the largest one is about the size of a skyscraper.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skydances-behemoth-screenshot-05.jpg?itok=kO68gKdG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skydances-behemoth-screenshot-05.jpg?itok=5DlOP45E 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>“All of the fights have distinct phases they go through, but we really want them to feel dynamic so no two are the same.”</p>

<p>Because <em>Skydance's Behemoth</em> is a full-featured game, there will be a number of accessibility options in place because VR has that physical element and everyone has different limitations, including the possibility of feeling motion sickness.</p>

<p>“You saw some of the features – there’s the comfort vignette, which you can dial in to help tunneling so that your periphery can help drive motion sickness,” said Kittlesen.</p>

<p>“The snap turn versus smooth turn setting is another powerful feature. There’s also a color blindness feature, and ultimately you’ll be able to play sitting or standing. This is something that was actually really hard to tune for because you can imagine things like the belt and picking things up.”</p>

<p>In an effort to get as many people as possible to play a game like <em>Skydance’s Behemoth</em>, these type of options are key. The team wants to make games for everyone, which is why it’s coming out on every VR system, and the goal is to attract people to VR in general.</p>

<p>With VR still in a sort of niche space, <em>Skydance’s Behemoth</em> looks to be a huge step up in terms of what developers can actually do with the VR platform. <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/skydances-behemoth-preview"><em>Skydance’s Behemoth</em></a> will be available for PlayStation VR 2, PCVR, as well as Meta Quest 2 and 3 this fall.</p>

<p>Lastly, the PlayStation preview mentioned the Shadow Realm Blessing system, adding stackable buffs to even out gameplay. </p>



<p>Still, a report <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/elden-ring-shadows-of-the-erdtrees-opening-hours-are-absolutely-brutal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by VGC</a> describes the opening hours as “brutal.” The fresh system appears to balance out increased difficulty for the DLC. VGC also said there are “three builds to start from.” </p>

<p>PC Gamer adds in <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-scadutree-fragments-revered-spirit-ash-blessings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new report</a> that players can scour for Scadutree Fragments to increase their Scadutree Blessing level to scale stats.</p>



<p>FromSoftware recently revealed a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-story-trailer/">new story trailer</a> for Shadow of the Erdtree, though today’s previews confirmed much more. The DLC will add new weapons, equipment, and more, including the brand-new Land of Shadow.</p>



<p>Elden Ring remains widely praised among critics and fans alike, and Shadow of the Erdtree is highly anticipated DLC. However, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-reportedly-wont-get-new-dlc-after-shadow-of-the-erdtree/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a recent report</a> spotted a key comment by FromSoftware’s Hidetaka Miyazaki, mentioned during an interview. Miyazaki suggested that Shadow of the Erdtree will be Elden Ring’s “first and last DLC.” </p>



<p>Elden Ring’s Shadow of the Erdtree will release on June 21, 2024, for all available platforms. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[IKEA Is Opening a Roblox Store and Hiring Real Employees to Staff It]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ikea-is-opening-a-roblox-store-and-hiring-real-employees-to-staff-it.889143/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ikea-roblox-store/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>IKEA has just revealed plans to hire ten employees to work in a fully virtual store housed exclusively within the confines of Roblox. The furniture giant confirmed today that ‘The Co-Worker Game’ will come to the Roblox ecosystem on June 24, with ten successful applicants being hired to ‘serve up endless amounts of meatballs’ or organise the virtual furniture displays in and around the store.</p>



<p>The twist here is that these employees will earn a decent wage – around £13.15 per hour. That’s the ‘London Living Wage’ per the latest update, but it hasn’t been confirmed how many hours per week or month the successful applicants will be asked to ‘work’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-let-s-get-digital">Let’s Get Digital</h2>



<p>In a press release published recently, IKEA confirmed that applications for the ten roles are now live and that applicants have until June 16 to get their forms in. It’s a bizarre interview process with some inane questions, but that’s partly what we’d expect from a role like this, which is borderline experimental at best.</p>



<p>It’s reportedly part of an initiative called ‘Careers Done Different’, and it’s part of a drive to entice younger people into a career at IKEA. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/newsroom/corporate-news/ikea-is-opening-a-new-store-on-roblox-pub8a9272d0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">In the press release</a>, IKEA’s Darren Taylor said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><br>We’re excited to be the first brand to launch paid work on Roblox to showcase how we do careers differently, bringing our unique careers philosophy to life. At IKEA, there is no set route to career progression. Our co-workers are able to change roles, switch departments, and grow in any direction they choose, both in the game or in the real world. There are many ways to learn and grow at IKEA, and that’s what IKEA on Roblox is all about.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s a serious process, though. From the initial application, there will be a shortlist drawn up and applicants will need to undertake a virtual interview. The roles are also only open to those aged 18 and over in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. </p>

Remnant II is getting a statue, one that immortalizes the iconic World Stone from the game. </p><p>IGN can exclusively debut the first images of the Remanant II: World Stone statue.

It's limited to 1000 pieces worldwide and features a hand-numbered certificate of authenticity and base artwork.</p><p>The Remnant II: World Stone statue is priced at $149.99 and is slated for release between December 2024 and February 2025.

This is a triumphant sequel that doesn’t just reimagine the soulslike genre as a co-op looter-shooter, but absolutely nails that concept in nearly every way – including many that the original did not. With completely engrossing combat, challenging and memorable boss fights, ultra-dense buildcrafting options, incredibly cool procedurally generated levels, and a clever multiversal concept that allows for a ton of different adventures in one package, it’s very likely going to become one of my most-played games this year. No matter which part of the multiverse you find yourself in, you should do yourself a favor and play this gem."</p><p>In other news, <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/remnant-2-the-forgotten-kingdom-dlc-official-launch-trailer">the DLC Remnant II: The Forgotten Kingdom</a> launched in April 2024.</p><p><em>Jesse is a mild-mannered staff writer for IGN.

Accompanied by a mustachioed robot companion named Oz, the titular Weko sets out to save his home from darkness by locating seven primordial masks, each of which represents one of the seven deadly sins.</p><p>Since the game’s announcement, <em>Weko the Mask Gatherer</em> has enchanted players with its colorful stylings, evoking memories of <em>Spyro the Dragon</em> or <em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</em>. However, this cozy and wholesome mask obscures the slightly darker face of the game. Players must fight off formidable foes in challenging boss fights, each demanding its own set of skills, item combinations and strategic gameplay to overcome. The game, however, carefully balances this intense combat with relaxing puzzles, side quests and locations to explore.</p><p>As Weko undertakes his heroic adventure, he must harness the power of other, more benevolent masks scattered across the land, each offering a different perk or ability to aid the gecko in his quest. Whether players prefer to play defensively or hack ‘n’ slash their way through, they will wield a combination of masks that suits their own play style. Alongside this myriad of masks, players can unlock new weapons, discover hidden secrets, and even acquire mounts to help them traverse the breathtaking world of the game.    </p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><em>Weko the Mask Gatherer</em> is the first game from Swiss indie developers SIRO Games – a talented duo consisting of Robin Haefeli and Simon Da Silva. Between them, they carefully balance Weko’s nostalgic art style and action-packed game mechanics.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Wéko The Mask Gatherer – Release Date Trailer - Steam" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fudJ6d4FB2A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/twitch-streamer%E2%80%99s-mma-event-ends-with-fighter-whipping-his-dick-out-starting-brawl.889125/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/twitch-mizkif-mma-brawl<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Over the weekend, popular Twitch streamer Matthew “Mizkif” Rinaudo <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2161054114?filter=archives&amp;sort=time" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hosted an MMA event</a> at a gym in Austin that he co-owns alongside other fitness-minded streamers. It ended pretty much the only way it could: with a fighter who had just lost whipping his dick out and inciting a multi-man melee in the cage. Rinaudo, commentators, and viewers ate up the ensuing spectacle.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“A fight just broke out at my MMA event, and the fighter is outside getting arrested right now,” Rinaduo <a href="https://x.com/REALMizkif/status/1797035846727585856" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said on Twitter</a>. “I love this sport.”</p><p>He then clarified how it all started for those watching along on Twitch and other platforms, a moment that the cameras – luckily for Rinaudo, who has a vested interest in remaining unbanned – did not fully catch.&nbsp;</p><p>"This fight happened, and the guy who lost whipped his dick out in front of the audience, and was arrested,” Rinaudo wrote.</p><p>In broad strokes, it’s not difficult to see how we arrived here. But sometimes, with enough amassed domain knowledge, you can peer into the depths of a single moment and perceive precisely how the dominoes fell. When I’m not writing about video games or touching grass, I spend my time hoovering up exactly two flavors of trash: MMA news and Twitch drama. So unfortunately, I was made for this moment. Let’s break it down.</p><p>Rinaudo is a streamer who got his start as a cameraman for Paul “Ice Poseidon” Denino, who was <a href="https://kotaku.com/for-twitch-streamer-who-got-swatted-on-a-plane-notorie-1794972701" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">perma-banned from Twitch in 2017</a> after a series of escalating real-life stunts saw him get swatted while boarding a plane. More recently, Denino found himself in hot water on Kick for streaming an encounter between a friend and a sex worker while he and another streamer, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/29/kick-streamers-leave-ceo-ice-poseidon-prank-sex-work/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unbeknownst to the sex worker</a>, hid in a nearby room.&nbsp;</p><p>Rinaudo is also no stranger to scandal, with his biggest – an alleged 2022 cover up of a sexual assault incident between two other streamers – getting him <a href="https://x.com/OTKnetwork/status/1572387360247271427" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">temporarily booted from OTK</a>, the content creation company he owns alongside other big names like Asmongold and Esfand, which already saw another member, Rich Campbell, <a href="https://x.com/RichWCampbell/status/1603869600969547785" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">resign in the wake of his own set of sexual assault allegations</a> in 2022. Also in 2022, a third-party investigation from legal firm Jackson Walker – now, <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/bankruptcy-law/jackson-walker-in-legal-hot-seat-following-judge-romance-scandal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as Bloomberg Law puts it</a>, in "Legal Hot Seat Following Judge Romance Scandal" – <a href="https://x.com/OTKnetwork/status/1609361988467183616" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">found Rinaudo innocent of the coverup</a>, but OTK added in a statement that Rinaudo would remain suspended from OTK's board of directors due to his "callous disregard towards the severity of sexual misconduct and racial prejudice in our space," pending a probationary period. More recently, content creator Mitch Jones <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/esports/news-i-got-assaulted-mizkif-mitch-jones-accuses-otk-co-founder-claims-knocked-strangled" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accused Rinaudo</a> of physically assaulting him in late 2023. So far, no disciplinary action has come of that.</p><p>While a typical stream from Rinaudo is not laden with controversy – he mostly just plays video games, talks shit, and interacts with other OTK members – part of the broader appeal of this corner of the streaming ecosystem is the mess. It’s long-form reality TV, and people only begin to balk when things get a little <em>too </em>real, when they’re reminded that the actions of their faves – incentivized by platforms and thrill-seeking viewers to behave irresponsibly on (and off) camera – have actual human consequences.&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of personnel, OTK’s lineage traces back to Twitch’s earlier, edgelordier days, prior to growing mainstream acceptance as a result of the Amazon acquisition and, later, the <em>Fortnite </em>boom, which came with ad deals and brand safety concerns. OTK in particular straddles an awkward line, attempting to professionalize and host events around streamers, some of whom have checkered pasts and, if they were just getting started now, would likely <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/27/kick-lures-disenchanted-twitch-streamers-for-now-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">default to Kick</a>, not the comparatively-sanitized Twitch. There is, as a result, an appeal to somebody like Rinaudo, who’s almost edgy enough for Kick or <a href="https://www.indy100.com/science-tech/what-is-rumble-kai-cenat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rumble</a>, but savvy enough to know when to rein it in. A subset of Twitch viewers is all about This Kind Of Guy. In their eyes, he’s more real than other Twitch streamers, who are engaged in transparent branding exercises, when in reality he’s just engaged in a different kind of branding exercise, the kind that allows him to be edgy <em>by Twitch standards</em> while not getting banned from Twitch.&nbsp;</p><p>That, in turn, pairs perfectly with MMA, which is a sport made up almost entirely of This Kind Of Guy, some of whom – like <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/sugaseanomalley" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">135-lb champion Sean O’Malley</a> – spend a lot of their free time streaming on Twitch. The modern UFC is full of fighters who love to act edgy, individualistic, and tough while also emphasizing, over and over, that they are compliant Company Men who will fight whenever and wherever the boss, UFC president Dana White, desires. This is by design. To fulfill its <a href="https://www.espn.com/mma/story/_/id/23581729/espn-ufc-reach-five-year-television-rights-deal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lucrative $1.5 billion ESPN broadcast deal</a>, the UFC has to put on events at a breakneck pace, which means that the schedule is king. If fighters drop out of scheduled fights (for example, due to injury) or try to haggle for a timeframe that better suits their needs, they get punished with worse matchmaking, decreased promotion, or more time on the sidelines. Your best bet, then, is to suck up to the boss and the system while otherwise building your own brand as a man’s man in a lawless land (read: one <a href="https://redflag.org.au/article/ufc-30-years-blood-sweat-and-exploitation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ruthlessly controlled by capitalism</a>).</p><p>The tradeoff is that the UFC turns a blind eye to all sorts of inappropriate behavior on the part of its fighters, including <a href="https://au.sports.yahoo.com/sexism-storm-khabib-nurmagomedovs-disgusting-comments-211706790.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sexism</a>, <a href="https://www.espn.com/mma/story/_/id/29959739/dana-white-colby-covington-comments-muzzle-anybody" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">racism</a>, <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/ufc-297-sean-stricklands-homophobic-tirade-latest-in-ufcs-ugly-uninhibited-dive-into-culture-wars/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">homophobia</a>, and – you guessed it – <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/trentreinsmith/2019/11/06/greg-hardy-fights-on-same-ufc-card-as-domestic-violence-survivor-jessica-rose-clark/?sh=355e6b7a382c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">assault</a>. In this sense, the UFC is actually kind of on an opposite trajectory compared to Twitch. In the early 2010s, the organization was desperate for legitimacy in the eyes of the sports world, attempting to shed the remains of its – as late senator <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2018/08/john-mccain-ufc-how-he-grew-to-tolerate-mma-the-sport-he-considered-human-cockfighting.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">John McCain put it in 1996</a> – “human cockfighting” image once and for all. As a result, the UFC, which had <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2711551-mmas-top-10-wildest-out-of-the-cage-brawls" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no shortage of unsanctioned brawls in its early days</a>, briefly enforced something resembling a code of conduct, albeit inconsistently. In 2010, it perma-banned British fighter Paul Daley for angrily striking opponent Josh Koscheck after the end of a match in which Daley was wrestled to the ground for three rounds. In 2013, it suspended then-burgeoning star Nate Diaz <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ufc/2013/05/17/ufc-suspends-nate-diaz/2206831/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for tweeting a gay slur</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>But after securing certain trappings of mainstream acceptance – a uniform deal with Reebok, the aforementioned ESPN deal – UFC brass realized they just… didn’t need to police fighter behavior anymore. In fact, there was more money in <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/04/27/ufc-president-dana-white-explains-companys-political-apathy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">branding themselves as an alternative</a> and, relatedly, as <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-ufc-fight-masculinity-verdict-rcna155252" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the one true MAGA sport</a>, <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/pandemic-helped-ufc-find-another-level-of-success-this-business-is-on-fire-233433085.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">especially once the pandemic rolled around</a> and other sports took a more cautious approach to live events. This arose out of promotional convenience just as much as it did politics. It’s very easy to sell a fight, for example, when one of your guys is screaming at the other about how, if this was a different time, his people would <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=324560952419233" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kill and enslave their people</a>, or in another instance, seeking out an opponent before a scheduled fight to <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/2018/4/5/17203890/watch-conor-mcgregor-throw-a-dolly-through-ufc-223-fighter-bus-window" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hurl a dolly through the window of a bus</a> they were seated on, shattering glass and slicing up innocent bystanders.&nbsp;</p><p>The latter incident preceded <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/2019/5/22/18635315/conor-mcgregor-relives-ufc-229-brawl-underlines-interest-in-khabib-nurmagomedov-rematch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a 2019 brawl</a> not unlike the one at Rinaudo’s event, neither <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/mma/article-12019649/The-10-craziest-outside-cage-moments-UFC-history.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the first nor last of its kind</a> in the UFC. Unlike Daley, who was ejected from the UFC forever after throwing a single post-fight punch, the fighter who kicked off the 2019 brawl – now-retired mega star Khabib Nurmagomedov – faced little in the way of consequences from the UFC, nor did his opponent, Conor McGregor, for whom dolly-throwing now somehow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor#Controversies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ranks among the least of his crimes</a>. Both the bus incident and the brawl were used in future UFC promotional videos. These days, when UFC stars step out of line – whether that means nearly getting into fights <a href="https://www.sportscasting.com/ufc-fight-called-off-after-violent-weigh-in-altercation-injures-fighter-sends-hospital/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on weigh-in scales</a>, having <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzpFZ6fSr-Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weird racially-motivated in-cage confrontations</a>, or <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/sports/ufc-champ-jon-jones-accused-threatening-kill-drug-testing-agent-rcna146747" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">threatening drug testers</a> – White, who faced no meaningful consequences for <a href="https://defector.com/dana-white-hits-his-wife-at-a-club" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">publicly slapping his own wife in early 2023</a>, just <a href="https://www.espn.com/mma/story/_/id/29959739/dana-white-colby-covington-comments-muzzle-anybody" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shrugs it off</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>All of which brings us back to the in-cage melee at Rinaudo’s event over the weekend. Compared to some of the big leagues’ more notorious brawls, it was a pretty tame affair. A couple of the many staff members and teammates of fighters in the cage threatened to throw punches, but mostly they just worked to separate fighters from one another. The whole thing was over after just a minute or so. Rinaudo <a href="https://x.com/REALMizkif/status/1797112078643392536" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">later said</a> that the fighter who kicked it off was “suspended from fighting for 6 months.”</p><p>It’s not clear what he meant by that. Is the fighter suspended only from Rinaudo’s organization, or did a state athletic commission – the body which usually sanctions these sorts of events and metes out fines and suspensions as needed – hand down the order, which would prevent the fighter from competing in other organizations as well? In any case, you need only look at viewership numbers, which <a href="https://x.com/REALMizkif/status/1797046196621410631" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">peaked at over 100,000 concurrents</a> across all platforms, and listen to commentators to learn how people actually felt about this moment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“Let’s go! Let’s go!” shouted one commentator excitedly when the scuffle began, as an in-person audience began to hoot and holler. Twitch chat, meanwhile, filled with messages like “DRAMA” and “OOOOOOO.”</p><p>"Take it easy. Take it easy,” cautioned another commentator. “We ain't gotta go there. We ain't gotta take it there."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"For the sake of viewership, they have to take it there," retorted a third.<br>This is neither shocking nor particularly revealing. At best, it’s instructive. In 2024 – a year in which YouTuber-turned-celebrity-boxer Jake Paul will fight a nearly 60-year-old Mike Tyson, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/31/sport/mike-tyson-jake-paul-fight-delay/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">probably, at some point</a> – this <em>is </em>the show. Fights are not just fights; they are settings, scaffoldings that hold up months of online drama both before and after. Paul and his brother Logan, not coincidentally, were <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-logan-paul-vs-ksi-fight-is-the-natural-conclusion-o-1828642369" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">among</a><a href="https://kotaku.com/logan-paul-vs-floyd-mayweather-was-just-the-beginning-1847046623" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the first</a> to maximize that side of the business, but the UFC had already spent decades blazing a trashy trail before either Paul brother ever stepped foot in a ring. Where once in-cage brawls – or exposed dicks, or discriminatory language, or assault scandals – might have seemed shocking, now they’re just part of the daily tapestry of both combat sports and content creation. They happen, they generate some wacky headlines, and then everybody moves on to the next drama.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-therapist-critical-role-hades-2<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Little Bat Games, developer of "analyze-'em-up" therapy sim&nbsp;<em>Vampire Therapist</em>, has announced that two major high-profile voice actors have joined its game's cast.</p>

<p>The first is someone you'll know well if you're a&nbsp;<em>Critical Role&nbsp;</em>fan or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-vincent-valentine-voiced-matt-mercer">if you've played <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em></a>. It's Matt Mercer, who'll be voicing the vampire Reinhard with what sounds like a characteristically campy accent.</p>

<p><em>Vampire Therapist</em>'s second major new voice acting addition is Sarah Grayson, who plays Selene in the recently-released&nbsp;<em>Hades 2</em>. She's also the voice of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/open-roads-review"><i>Open Roads</i></a>' Aunt August, <i>Gone Home</i>'s Sam, and&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>'s Commander Jehan.</p>

<p>They're joined by a cast that also includes&nbsp;<em>Hades</em>' Cyrus Nemati, who gave his voice to Ares in that game, as well as Francesca Meaux, also of&nbsp;<em>Hades&nbsp;</em>fame.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Newcomer Kylie Clark, who Little Bat says was "trained at the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama", rounds off the cast as we know it so far.</p>

<p>More voice actors could be waiting in the wings to swoop down and charm you in&nbsp;<em>Vampire Therapist</em>, so we'll just have to wait and see who else is in store.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Vampire Therapist</em>, it's a visual novel-style game that puts you in the therapist's chair. You'll get to talk to a range of vampiric personalities, each with their own foibles and problems that need to be worked through.</p>

<p>Little Bat describes the game as a "unique tale of mental health, vampires, and German-inspired nightclubs". The studio says a demo for&nbsp;<em>Vampire Therapist&nbsp;</em>is available now, but it wasn't live at time of writing, so make sure to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2481020/Vampire_Therapist/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">check back later</a> if you want to take a look.</p>

            <p>Yes, I've played a portion of Elden Ring's expansion Shadow Of The Erdtree and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-hollows-out-everything-you-loved-about-elden-ring-and-its-brilliant">I think it's brilliant</a>. But there's one thing I didn't flesh out in the preview and that's the DLC's standalone levelling system, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/to-play-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-you-must-defeat-some-of-elden-rings-toughest-bosses">brought to our attention</a> a month or so ago. Well, here I am to flesh it out! Be warned, though, the role of the system is a jarring thing to condense into words.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>For context, I spent around three hours with Shadow Of The Erdtree's opening area, the Gravesite Plains. So my thoughts on the levelling system aren't set in stone, nor are they definitive just yet. That'll have to wait until I get my hands on the entire thing.</p>
<p>Essentially, though, the standalone levelling system revolves around three things: Crosses, Scadutree Fragments, and Revered Ash Blessings.</p>
<p>Crosses are scattered around The Land Of Shadow and look like brilliant, golden shafts of light. Various NPCs you'll talk to early on mention that they're the "footsteps of Miquella" and that you'll want to follow them. One maggot-faced individual eventually hands you a map - inspectable in your inventory - and asks you to track down as many as you can find within the Gravesite Plains. Presumably if you do, you get a reward? Either way, it cements one of their purposes as a pseudo-Site-of-Grace, guiding you to new areas in the DLC. Crosses are distinct from Graces, mind you: you can't interact with them in the same way.</p>

<p>Crosses are also where you'll often find Scadutree Fragments, which are the new levelling system's key resource. Acting in a similar way to flask shards or Golden Seeds from the base game, you have a choice whether to cash in Scadutree Fragments when you rest at Graces. Do so and you'll receive a flat buff to your stats, but ONLY in the DLC areas. The moment you leave the Land Of Shadow, you'll lose the buff.</p>
<p>As for Revered Ash Blessings, they act in much the same way as Scadutree Fragments, but grant your summonable pals flat buffs. Again - only in the DLC areas. I can't quite remember how I found these Ash Blessings, but I sort of recall getting one after beating a tough miniboss or as rare, super glinty loot in hard-to-reach areas.</p>
<p>I've been umming and ahhing over what exactly FromSoft's going for with these Scadutree Fragments. Based on my small slice of the DLC, I see the buffs they offer as a necessary way to grow stronger for most players, or to offset characters who've entered the DLC a little underlevelled (players who may not have done all the optional stuff in the base game, say).</p>
<p>But making your redemption of the Ashes and Fragments optional also opens the door for masochists who want a tougher challenge without the buffs. Again, it's hard to know just how much harder it'll be without them, but I'll suppose we'll find that out soon enough when the expansion launches on June 21st.</p>

			<p>Fittingly, Bandai Namco invited Wccftech and a number of other global journalists out to experience an exclusive hands-on with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-story-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upcoming DLC expansion</a> for 2022’s Game of the Year, Elden Ring. The venue of choice was a cemetery in sunny Southern California and after a brief bus ride through Hollywood and passing by rows of elaborate tombstones and a live peacock enclosure, we were greeted by a choir quartet and a life-sized statue of Miquella’s Egg taken straight from Mohgwyn Palace. It’s here that Bandai Namco graciously lets us sit down for the first two hours of the upcoming Shadow of the Erdtree DLC and explore at our leisure, all running on an army of Razer laptops.</p>
<p>After a brief onboarding to discuss the setting and ways to access Elden Ring’s Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, we were given free rein to hit the ground running as one of several level 150 champions, all adequately geared up for the adventure with +25 weapons. Not one for a spellcaster in From Software’s masocore adventures, I stuck with a more traditional DEX-focused swordsman who could wield most of the weapon types available with relative ease. While I started leaning toward the simpler swords (including the new Odachi type), it wasn’t until wielding the throwing daggers in both hands that the combat began to shine. There were indications of a perfume bottle-class weapon available for players to use in the DLC that wasn’t present in the base game. Still, sadly, I didn’t have the foresight to dig that deeply and experiment with the zanier weapon types in the interest of time.</p>
<p>To access the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, From Software and Bandai Namco opted to provide a proper explanation on how to play the content that players paid for, a stark change from the Artorias of the Abyss, where players were expected to blindly explore Lordran and track down a broken necklace and about a dozen other steps. This time, players must first take down two key shardbearers to reach Miquella: Starscourge Radahn and Mohg, Lord of Blood (not to be confused with Mohg, the Omen). There are theories abound as to why it’s these two specific bosses that need to be bested in mortal combat to venture into the Shadowlands, primarily focused on the giant egg that Miquella was attempting to breach from and some lore-appropriate theories as to having to release the stars from Radahn’s imprisonment to venture forth.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ELDENRING_SotE_19_4K-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Throwing daggers are largely what they sound like on the cover: a limitless supply of throwing knives that only consume one’s stamina and are otherwise infinite. Wielding one pair is fine, but the weapon properly showcases its ability when dual-wielded and the nameless Tarnished becomes the modern equivalent of a Touhou boss. Dozens after dozens of daggers can be launched with two main drawbacks: enemies can block and mitigate their damage quite easily and the range on what can hit an enemy is shorter than the actual throwing animation, if by a short margin. The latter can be alleviated by locking onto an enemy and approaching until damage numbers are visible. At the same time, the other might need some skills to back it up, such as a charged throw that can deal heavy poise damage and stagger those hiding behind shields.</p>
<p>Some of the other melee weapons in Elden Ring’s Shadow of the Erdtree that I found to provide significantly varied combat from the base game were in the forms of a dueling shield and the inclusion of proper hand-to-hand melee skills. The dueling shield offers protection in line with medium shield classes while also used like a pile bunker to thrust and damage enemies just out of range of your fists. The new melee archetype lets players string together punches and kicks, and position themselves both to the side and even dashing behind enemies with some of the unique skills for the weapons. However, I wish I could say more positive things about the new weapon types (save for the throwing daggers). Still, getting a proper readout on optimally performing damage was difficult when the two main bosses of the DLC had health bars that easily exceeded 10-thousand hit points apiece.</p>
<p>To offset entering the DLC shadowlands well above the intended power curve, Shadow of the Erdtree features a pair of open-world collectibles that passively imbue the Tarnished with more power. One makes the player more generally more effective at dishing out damage/taking less, while the other increases the effectiveness of summoned spirits. Both of these are upgraded by collecting key items and returning them to a bonfire of protection before upgrading them in the same fashion one would upgrade their flasks of crimson tears. I could foresee this as From Software’s way of balancing the DLC by preventing characters well above the normal power curve from approaching the DLC content with a modest degree of difficulty. How players already deep into their third or seventh New Game Plus run would be able to get into Shadow of the Erdtree without being steamrolled by their first boss was something that Bandai Namco didn’t yet have the full answer for when I spoke with a couple of the representatives leading the marketing push. Sadly, no From Software developers were on-site to address these questions during the preview event.</p>

<p>Two hours was only enough time to get a brief taste of the smörgåsbord of new content Miyazaki and his team had been cooking up. However, it was just enough to get a proper feel for the trials and tribulations against a variety of bosses, explore a new legacy dungeon, and walk away with more questions than answers about Miquella’s true role in the upcoming Shadow of the Erdtree DLC. Besting a giant floating Chinese lion dance that constantly shifted its elemental affinity around rewarded me with a pretty sweet lion helm to wear around the Shadowlands, so that was a nice bonus.</p>
<p>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree will launch on June 21st, 2024, and will be available as a boxed physical edition for $79.99 on PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series S|X, as well as deluxe and collectors editions at $99.99 and $249.99 respectively. Players that already own the base game can purchase just the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC expansion for $39.99</p>
