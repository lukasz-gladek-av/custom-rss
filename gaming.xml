            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-therapist-critical-role-hades-2<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Little Bat Games, developer of "analyze-'em-up" therapy sim&nbsp;<em>Vampire Therapist</em>, has announced that two major high-profile voice actors have joined its game's cast.</p>

<p>The first is someone you'll know well if you're a&nbsp;<em>Critical Role&nbsp;</em>fan or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-vincent-valentine-voiced-matt-mercer">if you've played <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em></a>. It's Matt Mercer, who'll be voicing the vampire Reinhard with what sounds like a characteristically campy accent.</p>

<p><em>Vampire Therapist</em>'s second major new voice acting addition is Sarah Grayson, who plays Selene in the recently-released&nbsp;<em>Hades 2</em>. She's also the voice of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/open-roads-review"><i>Open Roads</i></a>' Aunt August, <i>Gone Home</i>'s Sam, and&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>'s Commander Jehan.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vampire-therapist-new-voice-actors-matt-mercer.jpg?itok=30qK7IVN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vampire-therapist-new-voice-actors-matt-mercer.jpg?itok=NINIzWGl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Matt Mercer will voice Reinhard in&nbsp;<em>Vampire Therapist</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Given that the press release announcing Mercer and Grayson's involvement in the project doesn't list specific characters for them, it's possible they'll be voicing other roles in&nbsp;<em>Vampire Therapist&nbsp;</em>as well.</p>

<p>They're joined by a cast that also includes&nbsp;<em>Hades</em>' Cyrus Nemati, who gave his voice to Ares in that game, as well as Francesca Meaux, also of&nbsp;<em>Hades&nbsp;</em>fame.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Newcomer Kylie Clark, who Little Bat says was "trained at the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama", rounds off the cast as we know it so far.</p>

<p>More voice actors could be waiting in the wings to swoop down and charm you in&nbsp;<em>Vampire Therapist</em>, so we'll just have to wait and see who else is in store.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Vampire Therapist</em>, it's a visual novel-style game that puts you in the therapist's chair. You'll get to talk to a range of vampiric personalities, each with their own foibles and problems that need to be worked through.</p>

<p>Little Bat describes the game as a "unique tale of mental health, vampires, and German-inspired nightclubs". The studio says a demo for&nbsp;<em>Vampire Therapist&nbsp;</em>is available now, but it wasn't live at time of writing, so make sure to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2481020/Vampire_Therapist/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">check back later</a> if you want to take a look.</p>

            <p>Yes, I've played a portion of Elden Ring's expansion Shadow Of The Erdtree and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-hollows-out-everything-you-loved-about-elden-ring-and-its-brilliant">I think it's brilliant</a>. But there's one thing I didn't flesh out in the preview and that's the DLC's standalone levelling system, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/to-play-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-you-must-defeat-some-of-elden-rings-toughest-bosses">brought to our attention</a> a month or so ago. Well, here I am to flesh it out! Be warned, though, the role of the system is a jarring thing to condense into words.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>For context, I spent around three hours with Shadow Of The Erdtree's opening area, the Gravesite Plains. So my thoughts on the levelling system aren't set in stone, nor are they definitive just yet. That'll have to wait until I get my hands on the entire thing.</p>
<p>Essentially, though, the standalone levelling system revolves around three things: Crosses, Scadutree Fragments, and Revered Ash Blessings.</p>
<p>Crosses are scattered around The Land Of Shadow and look like brilliant, golden shafts of light. Various NPCs you'll talk to early on mention that they're the "footsteps of Miquella" and that you'll want to follow them. One maggot-faced individual eventually hands you a map - inspectable in your inventory - and asks you to track down as many as you can find within the Gravesite Plains. Presumably if you do, you get a reward? Either way, it cements one of their purposes as a pseudo-Site-of-Grace, guiding you to new areas in the DLC. Crosses are distinct from Graces, mind you: you can't interact with them in the same way.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/elden-ring-erdtree-belurat.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=1200&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=70&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Bandai Namco</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Crosses are also where you'll often find Scadutree Fragments, which are the new levelling system's key resource. Acting in a similar way to flask shards or Golden Seeds from the base game, you have a choice whether to cash in Scadutree Fragments when you rest at Graces. Do so and you'll receive a flat buff to your stats, but ONLY in the DLC areas. The moment you leave the Land Of Shadow, you'll lose the buff.</p>
<p>As for Revered Ash Blessings, they act in much the same way as Scadutree Fragments, but grant your summonable pals flat buffs. Again - only in the DLC areas. I can't quite remember how I found these Ash Blessings, but I sort of recall getting one after beating a tough miniboss or as rare, super glinty loot in hard-to-reach areas.</p>
<p>I've been umming and ahhing over what exactly FromSoft's going for with these Scadutree Fragments. Based on my small slice of the DLC, I see the buffs they offer as a necessary way to grow stronger for most players, or to offset characters who've entered the DLC a little underlevelled (players who may not have done all the optional stuff in the base game, say).</p>
<p>But making your redemption of the Ashes and Fragments optional also opens the door for masochists who want a tougher challenge without the buffs. Again, it's hard to know just how much harder it'll be without them, but I'll suppose we'll find that out soon enough when the expansion launches on June 21st.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-hands-on-preview-the-erdtrees-light-casts-the-longest-shadow/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Fittingly, Bandai Namco invited Wccftech and a number of other global journalists out to experience an exclusive hands-on with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-story-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upcoming DLC expansion</a> for 2022’s Game of the Year, Elden Ring. The venue of choice was a cemetery in sunny Southern California and after a brief bus ride through Hollywood and passing by rows of elaborate tombstones and a live peacock enclosure, we were greeted by a choir quartet and a life-sized statue of Miquella’s Egg taken straight from Mohgwyn Palace. It’s here that Bandai Namco graciously lets us sit down for the first two hours of the upcoming Shadow of the Erdtree DLC and explore at our leisure, all running on an army of Razer laptops.</p>
<p>After a brief onboarding to discuss the setting and ways to access Elden Ring’s Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, we were given free rein to hit the ground running as one of several level 150 champions, all adequately geared up for the adventure with +25 weapons. Not one for a spellcaster in From Software’s masocore adventures, I stuck with a more traditional DEX-focused swordsman who could wield most of the weapon types available with relative ease. While I started leaning toward the simpler swords (including the new Odachi type), it wasn’t until wielding the throwing daggers in both hands that the combat began to shine. There were indications of a perfume bottle-class weapon available for players to use in the DLC that wasn’t present in the base game. Still, sadly, I didn’t have the foresight to dig that deeply and experiment with the zanier weapon types in the interest of time.</p>
<p>To access the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, From Software and Bandai Namco opted to provide a proper explanation on how to play the content that players paid for, a stark change from the Artorias of the Abyss, where players were expected to blindly explore Lordran and track down a broken necklace and about a dozen other steps. This time, players must first take down two key shardbearers to reach Miquella: Starscourge Radahn and Mohg, Lord of Blood (not to be confused with Mohg, the Omen). There are theories abound as to why it’s these two specific bosses that need to be bested in mortal combat to venture into the Shadowlands, primarily focused on the giant egg that Miquella was attempting to breach from and some lore-appropriate theories as to having to release the stars from Radahn’s imprisonment to venture forth.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ELDENRING_SotE_19_4K-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Throwing daggers are largely what they sound like on the cover: a limitless supply of throwing knives that only consume one’s stamina and are otherwise infinite. Wielding one pair is fine, but the weapon properly showcases its ability when dual-wielded and the nameless Tarnished becomes the modern equivalent of a Touhou boss. Dozens after dozens of daggers can be launched with two main drawbacks: enemies can block and mitigate their damage quite easily and the range on what can hit an enemy is shorter than the actual throwing animation, if by a short margin. The latter can be alleviated by locking onto an enemy and approaching until damage numbers are visible. At the same time, the other might need some skills to back it up, such as a charged throw that can deal heavy poise damage and stagger those hiding behind shields.</p>
<p>Some of the other melee weapons in Elden Ring’s Shadow of the Erdtree that I found to provide significantly varied combat from the base game were in the forms of a dueling shield and the inclusion of proper hand-to-hand melee skills. The dueling shield offers protection in line with medium shield classes while also used like a pile bunker to thrust and damage enemies just out of range of your fists. The new melee archetype lets players string together punches and kicks, and position themselves both to the side and even dashing behind enemies with some of the unique skills for the weapons. However, I wish I could say more positive things about the new weapon types (save for the throwing daggers). Still, getting a proper readout on optimally performing damage was difficult when the two main bosses of the DLC had health bars that easily exceeded 10-thousand hit points apiece.</p>
<p>To offset entering the DLC shadowlands well above the intended power curve, Shadow of the Erdtree features a pair of open-world collectibles that passively imbue the Tarnished with more power. One makes the player more generally more effective at dishing out damage/taking less, while the other increases the effectiveness of summoned spirits. Both of these are upgraded by collecting key items and returning them to a bonfire of protection before upgrading them in the same fashion one would upgrade their flasks of crimson tears. I could foresee this as From Software’s way of balancing the DLC by preventing characters well above the normal power curve from approaching the DLC content with a modest degree of difficulty. How players already deep into their third or seventh New Game Plus run would be able to get into Shadow of the Erdtree without being steamrolled by their first boss was something that Bandai Namco didn’t yet have the full answer for when I spoke with a couple of the representatives leading the marketing push. Sadly, no From Software developers were on-site to address these questions during the preview event.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ELDENRING_SotE_21_4K-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Two hours was only enough time to get a brief taste of the smörgåsbord of new content Miyazaki and his team had been cooking up. However, it was just enough to get a proper feel for the trials and tribulations against a variety of bosses, explore a new legacy dungeon, and walk away with more questions than answers about Miquella’s true role in the upcoming Shadow of the Erdtree DLC. Besting a giant floating Chinese lion dance that constantly shifted its elemental affinity around rewarded me with a pretty sweet lion helm to wear around the Shadowlands, so that was a nice bonus.</p>
<p>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree will launch on June 21st, 2024, and will be available as a boxed physical edition for $79.99 on PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series S|X, as well as deluxe and collectors editions at $99.99 and $249.99 respectively. Players that already own the base game can purchase just the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC expansion for $39.99</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/octopath-traveler-ii-xbox-june/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Octopath Traveler II will be arriving on Xbox Series X|S as well as day-one on Xbox Game Pass later this month, it's been claimed.</p>
<p>This information comes from Spanish leaker eXtas1s, who often writes for outlet Exputer, and was recently spot on with <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his information about Lords of the Fallen coming to Microsoft's subscription service</a>. Interestingly enough, the leaker was also among the first to claim that Microsoft is planning to <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-tier-changes-cod/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make changes to Game Pass tiers due to the Call of Duty franchis</a>e. For those in the unknown - Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-day-one-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently confirmed that the upcoming Black Ops 6 will be coming to Game Pass day-one</a>.</p>
<p>On the Exputer forums, eXtas1s <a href="https://forums.exputer.com/threads/octopath-traveler-2-headed-to-xbox-in-june.77/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now writes</a> that he has learned that 2023's Octopath Traveler sequel will be coming to Xbox Series this month. "It's going to be a day-one Xbox Game Pass game, along with the franchise's first game (Octopath Traveler), which could also be added to the subscription service as well", the leaker added.</p>
<p>During Tokyo Game Show 2023, it was confirmed that Octopath Traveler II <a href="https://wccftech.com/octopath-traveler-ii-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would be launching on Xbox Series X|S in early 2024</a>. We've included the game's Xbox announcement trailer below:</p>
<p><iframe title="OCTOPATH TRAVELER II - Xbox &amp; Windows Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5E-BqssreVQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Released in 2023 for PC, PlayStation 5/4, and Nintendo Switch, offers charming characters alongside beautiful visuals, and an interesting story. Here's what we wrote about the sequel in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/octopath-traveler-ii-same-systems-superior-stories" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch review</a> last year:</p>
<p><em>Octopath Traveler II plays it safe when it comes to its core gameplay, offering a handful of small positive tweaks that don’t entirely make up for returning problems like clumsy party management and battles that take too long to wrap up. Thankfully, the game also takes a big, confident step forward in terms of writing, offering a cast of well-wrought, interesting characters, and a vividly-detailed world you won’t soon forget. Octopath Traveler II may have the same old engine under the hood, but the road trip it takes you on is well worth experiencing.</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Skydance's Behemoth Preview - Into the Great Wide Open]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/skydances-behemoth-preview</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/skydances-behemoth-preview-into-the-great-wide-open.889098/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/skydances-behemoth-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As time goes on, the complexity of VR games is ever-changing. Skydance Games is hoping to take further advantage of that particular platform by putting together immersive adventure games such as the upcoming release of <em>Skydance’s Behemoth</em>. Skydance Games is set to bring this project to multiple platforms later this fall, with the goal of building upon melee combat and hand-based physics that was prominent in the VR title <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/walking-dead-saints-sinners-review-oculus-quest"><em>The Walking Dead: Saints &amp; Sinners</em></a>.</p>

<p>I recently had some hands and eyes-on time with <em>Skydance’s Behemoth</em> at a preview event held a couple of weeks ago. The demo, presented in PlayStation VR 2, offered a glimpse of what using the grand scale of virtual reality can achieve when married with a story-driven immersive experience.</p>

<p>While I got to control the very start of the preview, which allowed me to select various comfort settings – something that feels like a necessity when it comes to free-roaming VR – the bulk of what I saw was demonstrated to me by Shawn Kittlesen, Vice President of Creative for <em>Skydance’s Behemoth</em>.</p>

<p>The demo begins with the main character, Wren, who has been afflicted by a terrible curse that will be important to the course of the story. Wren, who can effectively be anyone you want because that’s really the point of immersive VR, enters the Forsaken Lands – a kingdom that’s been decimated by an ancient curse, in order to take on the daunting Behemoths.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skydance_s-behemoth-screenshot-weapons.jpg?itok=3HhHG_Ki 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skydance_s-behemoth-screenshot-weapons.jpg?itok=lVsEbZTb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>These monsters are scattered across the land, so they’ll be fighting any manner of enemies along the way in order to restore life to a civilization's past.</p>

<p>From the jump, it’s clear that <em>Skydance’s Behemoth</em> has put forth loads of detail into crafting its fantasy world. Just looking around, it’s easy to see the details in the environment, and the little things you can pick up such as a sword – which will come in handy for taking on various enemies of course – and other items such as healing greens, or items for crafting.</p>

<p>Using these items has an element of real-life application to them. For example, you will be moving your hand to sheath and unsheathe your sword like you would in real life. Or lifting a healing item up to your mouth to imbibe it.</p>

<p>Furthermore, this methodology extends to basic attacks. Blocking involves holding the sword perpendicular to the angle of oncoming attacks, and you can parry by swimming against an oncoming attack like you would if you were holding a real sword, just by using the VR controllers.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skydance_s-behemoth-screenshot-grappling-hook.jpg?itok=2MsQWO8n 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skydance_s-behemoth-screenshot-grappling-hook.jpg?itok=qxhi2SzA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In <em>Skydance’s Behemoth</em>, one element that sort of sets it apart from other action games is the addition of a super strength ability. It’s an important one because it allows you to use some fun attacks, like slicing an enemy for a fatality.</p>

<p>The damage against enemies is dynamic too, so you can cut them any way you want. That level of freedom is extended to the world itself as well – there are no invisible walls, and Wren can make use of a grappling hook to get around high places. If you want to jump from high areas, you can do that too.</p>

<p>Crafting comes into play in a more organic way. When you want to craft, there’s a specific station you find, and you put the plants you picked up into a pouch. Said pouch can then be placed on your belt so that you can heal yourself along the way.</p>

<p>There’s a lot to explore in <em>Skydance’s Behemoth</em>, with puzzle rooms that net secret items, as well as other nooks and crannies to discover. There might be secrets in places you never expected to find them in.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skydance_s-behemoth-screenshot-combat.jpg?itok=SMby1zb1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skydance_s-behemoth-screenshot-combat.jpg?itok=tqgTD4uN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>With the power of the current generation platforms such as PlayStation 5, atmosphere effects and physics rendering are fleshed out quite well. The PSVR 2 version specifically, is able to approximate PC ultra settings because of the power of the console itself.</p>

<p>At its core, <em>Skydance’s Behemoth</em> is a physics-based game. The physics are real so you can get all sorts of fun effects going like swinging across planks or using the grappling rope.</p>

<p>Throughout the course of the demo, it became clear that it’s important to learn how to adapt to the situations you find yourself in – particularly when engaging in normal enemy encounters.</p>

<p>Toward the end of the demo, we finally saw one of the game’s titular Behemoths, and what a sight it was. Without giving away the plot, there’s a lot of strategy involved in taking one of these things out, and perhaps most importantly, endurance.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skydance_s-behemoth-screenshot-seal-behemoth.jpg?itok=TE96jIMs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skydance_s-behemoth-screenshot-seal-behemoth.jpg?itok=oPu0ZirR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>A familiar comparison might be something like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/shadow-of-colossus-review-timeless-art"><em>Shadow of the Colossus</em></a>, but with you directly getting that first-person experience through VR. That and these Behemoths aren’t on any set pattern – the one in the demo proved to be plenty of challenge just because it wasn’t entirely predictable. Throw some smaller enemies into the mix during the encounter, and it’s quite a task.</p>

<p>All in all, the demo lasted about 30 minutes, and that was by someone who already knew what they were doing. I could have easily played through the same map and spent an hour or more just exploring around if I had had the time.</p>

<p>That said, this little slice of gameplay did give me a grand perspective on what <em>Skydance’s Behemoth</em> is setting out to do. It’s not just some quick, gimmicky attraction to hold your attention for a few minutes at a time. This feels like the real deal – a fully fleshed out, free-roam action adventure that puts key focus on the narrative, and one that isn’t just converting an existing traditional game into VR.</p>

<p>As someone who in the past wasn’t particularly sold on the merits of VR, I can see the appeal here. Singleplayer narrative games hold a special place in my heart as my typical go-to and <em>Skydance’s Behemoth</em> looks to be a magnificent time when it finally releases later this Fall on PlayStation VR 2, PCVR, and Meta Quest 2 and 3.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24170532/elden-ring-dlc-shadow-of-the-erdtree-preview-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="HuDDhY">My first steps into <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22947204/elden-ring-review-from-software"><em>Elden Ring</em></a>’s new <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24126482/how-to-prepare-dlc-gear-quests-endgame"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> expansion</a> feel like coming home again. After traveling there, by touching a withered arm, I step out into a grassy plain, and see a crumbling giant tree in the distance. The land is pocked with intangible gravestones and spirit-world versions of enemies I’ve faced before: dogs and wandering nobles. But it isn’t long until I face something terrifying in this new region, the Land of Shadow, in the form of a giant walking iron brazier filled with embers and burning prisoners.</p>
<p id="JrCtEc">As I try to slash at that hundred-foot monstrosity, I learn pretty quickly that even the highly leveled, generously equipped knight I’ve been given to play as part of a three-hour preview of the DLC is no match for the thing. It kicks huge, unavoidable piles of flaming debris at me as I try to run away. A handful of other unfamiliar monsters — Gravebirds, smaller cousins of the Death Rite Birds from <em>Elden Ring</em>, and lithe ash-skinned humanoids armed with twin circular blades — pile on and thrash my poor knight.</p>
<p id="cOR4kT">Even at a high level, I’m underprepared for what awaits in the Land of Shadow. But there’s a new kind of power-up scattered around the Gravesite Plain and in dungeons nearby: Scadutree Fragments. These new consumable items are splinters from this world’s version of the Erdtree. They bestow Scadutree Blessing on my knight, boosting virtually all of his stats. <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> players will need to hunt these fragments down to contend with the powerful enemies here. In my three hours of playtime, I found a half-dozen of them with relative ease. I also found plenty of the DLC’s other new power-up, Revered Spirit Ash, an item that makes my Spirit Ashes and my steed, Torrent, stronger. </p>
<p id="UJyuOG">Scadutree Fragments and Revered Spirit Ashes can be used at sites of grace in the Land of Shadow to become stronger, similar to how players use <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/22950763/golden-seed-locations-upgrade-sacred-flask-crimson-tears-cerulean">Golden Seeds</a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/22994386/sacred-tear-locations-map-limgrave-liurnia-caelid-altus">Sacred Tears</a> to empower their flasks in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough"><em>Elden Ring</em></a>. The blessings provided by those new power-ups are immediately apparent, but they only supercharge my character while he’s in the Land of Shadow. (While in that land, you’ll see your stats are boosted with the color yellow. Back in the Lands Between, they revert to white.)</p>

<p id="ZUMMfY">Getting to the Land of Shadow requires two major accomplishments in <em>Elden Ring</em>. You must <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/22993446/radahn-location-general-starscourge">defeat Starscourge Radahn</a> at Redmane Castle and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/24087922/mohg-how-to-beat-boss-strategy">Mohg, Lord of Blood</a> at Mohgwyn Palace. Once you do, you’ll be able to transport to this strange new land with the aid of a knight, one of Miquella’s many followers that you’ll meet in <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>’s adventure.</p>
<p id="781GpP">Meeting the followers of Miquella, all of whom refer to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24131400/elden-ring-dlc-miquella-shadow-of-the-erdtree">the mysterious brother of the swordswoman Malenia</a> as “kindly” or “tender,” I was struck by another difference here in the Land of Shadow: a sense of hope. Unlike the despair that permeates the Lands Between in the main story of <em>Elden Ring</em>, the people you meet in the Land of Shadow all seem content.</p>
<p id="7jLzaF">I met a handful of Miquella’s followers at stations known as Three-Path Crosses, said to represent Miqeulla’s footprints on his journey through this land. At these gold, glowing crosses, I met new NPCs and merchants, some of whom gave me items to use or quests to undertake. One, named Freyja, said she was a former ally of General Radahn. Another claimed to be a servant of Mohg. One Miquella devotee, Moore, was a simple-minded merchant. Unlike many of the confused and downtrodden NPCs typical of FromSoftware’s games, the followers of Miquella all seem unusually happy. They all appear to support you on your mission here, despite your status as a Tarnished. (Why they object to that isn’t quite clear, based on my playtime.)</p>

<p id="8smLxh">Beyond the Gravesite Plain is a handful of legacy dungeons, catacombs, and strongholds. The largest that I saw was Belurat, a massive castle settlement with labyrinthine pathways patrolled by new types of enemies. I fought scorpions of pretty big and terrifyingly big sizes, annoying spellcasters, and humanoid giants. </p>
<p id="Dy5gwe">At the end of my trip through Belurat, I encountered the Divine Beast Dancing Lion, a mess of human limbs, fabric, and a lion’s head, previously seen in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23991138/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-trailer-release-date-dlc"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>’s first trailer</a>. The Dancing Lion attacked with a chaotic rhythm, deploying freezing and lightning-based attacks as I tried to keep up with its frenzied dance. My powerful pre-built knight and a pair of summons — two of Miquella’s followers — made the battle relatively easy (it certainly won’t be that easy with my <em>Elden Ring</em> character). After killing it, the Dancing Lion dropped its own head, which I then proceeded to wear as a comically oversized helmet. That new piece of armor amplified my knight’s strength and dexterity, but lowered the effectiveness of my flasks. </p>
<p id="vVGKZx">Before my trip to the castle of Belurat, I stumbled upon a gaol underneath it, where I discovered the most horrible thing I’ve seen in <em>Elden Ring</em> yet. The Belurat gaol, a catacombs-style dungeon, is full of Living Jars who reside there. But here’s the bad part: The scraps of meat that players typically get from smashing those jars is, in this place, still very much alive. For the first time, we get to see what lives inside the jars: a glistening, tumorous monstrosity that will attack you with their own guts and launch themselves to pin you down. Disgusting though they may be, these jar-meat-people still manage to adhere to <em>Elden Ring</em> director Hidetaka Miyazaki’s famous quote about not relying on “the gross factor” to unnerve players. They’re both repulsive and sad to look upon.</p>

<p id="kWa7UU">The other region available during my hands-on time with the expansion is known as Castle Ensis. It’s a mid-scale legacy dungeon guarded by a new type of giant troll; this one can use magic, a herald of what’s to come (i.e., a lot of sorcerers). While exploring Castle Ensis, I encountered a knight with a giant hammer who, in the process of beating me to death with that hammer, signaled that I wasn’t ready to face him. Reps from Bandai Namco suggested to those in attendance that if we were to face such a challenge, we should seek out additional Scadutree Fragments to become competitive.</p>
<p id="55MD6X">I declined that advice and took the other option in <em>Elden Ring</em>: run past everything. By sprinting through Ensis, I successfully made my way to its boss, Rellana, Twin Moon Knight. She’s a former Carian princess and the younger sister of <em>Elden Ring</em> boss <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/22969148/rennala-tips-tricks-strategy-raya-lucaria-academy-boss-weapons-armor-talisman">Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon</a>. Like Rennala, Rellana can throw magical moons at you while <em>also</em> dual-wielding a pair of long blades that deal magic and fire damage. Like the Dancing Lion, I managed to defeat her, but only with the aid of multiple summoned allies who helped me break her poise and stagger her multiple times.</p>
<p id="0tJONS">My victory can also be credited to a brand-new weapon in the game: my speedy but powerful, poise-breaking light greatsword named — of all things — Milady. Light greatsword is a new class of weapon in <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>. Other new additions include the Backhand Blade, a curved sword held at a backward angle that delivers thrust attacks and slashes to enemies’ flanks; Dryleaf Arts, one of the new martial arts weapons that’s not really a weapon, but a style of hand-to-hand combat; and the Red Bear’s Claw, an actual severed bear paw modified with steel claws.</p>

<p id="3Ah71e">New weapon types I didn’t really get to spend much time with are the previously revealed thrusting shields, which are shields that have pointy ends; throwing blades, a variation on the existing throwing knives that can be equipped as a primary weapon; perfume bottles, also now a primary weapon option; and the great katana, which is, well, a larger version of a standard katana. Bandai Namco and FromSoftware promise 100 new weapons in <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>, with the handful of new additions I tested already feeling like fun new variations on existing fighting styles.</p>
<p id="VXwwJU">During my three hours with the game, I feel like I’ve barely scratched the surface of what <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> will add to <em>Elden Ring</em>. I’ve already spotted some fascinating new characters and lore, intimidating new challenges, and intriguing vibes.

<p>As I wait for my first movie to premiere, I wonder if I made the right decisions. Was “Argh for Romance” really going to be the hit I needed to make my studio a success? A general audience romance film centered around pirates doesn’t sound that great, but maybe it’ll resonate thanks to the sets I built and the actors I’ve cast. So I wait for the results to come in, and, much to my surprise, it sits in the middle of the pack and my low-budget debut nets $300,000 in profit for “Just Go With It Films”. I was happy but knew there was more work to be done to become the best production studio around.</p>



<p>Those are the general vibes you get from Blockbuster Inc., the new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1793090/Blockbuster_Inc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">movie sim game</a> from developer Super Sly Fox and publisher Ancient Forge.</p>

Review - The Movies Meets The Sims | Buy, Wait, or Skip" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J2PWVePpYs0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>You start off with an empty plot in Filmwood with dreams of becoming the next big production company. While the game takes inspiration from other management sims like Game Dev Tycoon, there’s a lot more depth here than what many would expect going in.</p>



<p>You have to manage everything in this game. And when I say everything, I mean everything. From the schedule of your staff to where they live to the quality of food you feed them, it’s more than just the acting and set design that makes a successful studio.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And while it sounds like it could be a bit overwhelming, it’s all done in a way that never feels like it’s getting to be too much. Everything is organized and easily accessible, and while decisions on things like housing and food need to be made, it’s not so in the weeds that you’ll get lost. It’s often just a simple menu selection.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Where the heavy depth comes is with the movie and show-creating process. You know, the whole point of Blockbuster Inc..</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-behind-the-camera-in-blockbuster-inc">Behind The Camera In Blockbuster Inc.</h2>



<p>Creating a movie or show is a pretty straightforward process with the level of depth you’d expect based on everything else in the game. To start, you name your product, and choose the type, budget size, genre, theme, and age focus. From there, you have to select your producer, director, writers, and actors while deciding how much or little of various elements should be in the movie. Want a comedy about vampires? You can do that. What about a medieval action flick? That’s no problem.&nbsp;</p>



<div><p>Once you have that basic information finalized, it’s time to choose your sets and direct your scenes. Speaking of sets, you can use the premade ones, build your own for your lot, or utilize the Steam workshop to download sets from other players.</p><p>With your sets chosen, directing your scene comes down to choosing the animations you want to use, the actors involved – you can have up to three in a movie –, any special effects, costumes, and camera positions. As you move through the years and eras, you can unlock better equipment to improve your production quality both during filming and in post production. It’s a nice progression that will see you make better products each time.&nbsp;</p></div>



<p>Here’s the real kicker of the process, though. Full video editing. After filming your scenes, you have to cut, clip, and move the scenes how you want them to make your movie. You can even add sound effects to increase the overall quality. When you’re all done, you can then save your films to your PC to watch back whenever you want.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once a film is out there, you’ll get reviews and feedback, not only for the film as a whole, but each individual scene. You’ll also learn how various actors work together and if the genre you picked was a strong suit for your writers and producers. All to help you make better decisions moving forward.</p>



<p>And like real life, each year there’s an annual award show that will help your studio and actors increase notoriety and revenue as you take home gold.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-expect-the-unexpected">Expect The Unexpected</h2>



<p>Of course, there’s the dark side, so to speak, of running a studio. You have to not only keep your employees and actors happy, but keep an eye out for rival studios keen on poaching your talent as they become more known.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You might have your employees lie about being sick because they were taking an interview with another studio. Another might just throw a tantrum and threaten to quit mid-production. How you handle each situation goes a long way into the respect you earn from your staff and the competing studios.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are even situations that happen that you might not even expect. One such instance was when I started producing my first movie, my lead actor decided to go out and celebrate. That’s all well and good, but he then got into an accident due to driving drunk and needed plastic surgery to fix his face. That would’ve cost my small studio $15,000, which I wasn’t going to just drop on something like this that could’ve been avoided. So, I told him, and his family, I wasn’t paying for it, leaving him “deformed”. He then gained the trait of “ugly” and ultimately became such a problem that I had to fire him. It was a completely unexpected scenario that blew me away.</p>



<p>Now, there are some small issues I have with limitations, specifically with set design and the animations you can choose when creating movies. I feel that for some movies there are plenty of animations, and even set elements to an extent, to pick from while others have slim pickings. It makes you feel like you have to always go towards specific themes and genres to get the best experience when creating your show or movie. It’s something that I think gets added to in future updates, but, right now, it’s a small nitpick of mine.</p>



<p>I also wish editing the animations and camera work was more open. Certain scenes I felt I had less control of than I’d like. Lastly, buying and unlocking newer equipment can feel a bit too easy as you play. It might be by design, but it felt like there was no real challenge in getting better cameras, mics, lighting, and more.</p>



<p>Overall, Blockbuster Inc. is exactly what you’d want from a spiritual successor to a classic game like The Movies. It’s clear the team at Super Sly Fox has a passion for what they’ve built. The freedom you have to do what you want with your movies and shows will keep everyone coming back weeks and months after their first play. And all the extra depth around the movies are just bonuses to an already fun game.</p>

                <p>Voice actress Briana White landed the breakout role of Aerith Gainsborough in 2019's Final Fantasy VII Remake. White also reprised her role for Final Fantasy VII Rebirth earlier this year. However, when it came time for Aerith's show-stopping operatic song, "No Promises To Keep," Loren Allred stepped in to provide Aerith's singing voice. Now, White has revealed why she didn't tackle the song herself, before sharing the relief she felt when Allred performed the scene instead.</p><p>"During recording, I remember that we recorded all of the lines before the theatrical performance, and then there was some reference in the script to singing a song, because she's writing the lyrics in the game," White told <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/06/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-interview-briana-white-aerith-1235943022/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Deadline</a>. "And I'm thinking to myself, 'Are they about to make me sing? Am I ready for that?' I don't think I could handle that. I'd give it my best. I did musical theater growing up, but I am not a trained singer, so I was very nervous. And then it never came back up."</p><p>"It's such a beautiful song, and it's so emotional," continued White. "Of course, I'm tearing up and going; I could never have given that performance. [Allred] does an incredible job. I wouldn't have it any other way, truly."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8ZyP-AsVeA" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/N8ZyP-AsVeA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>While White doesn't sing in the game, she did mention that singing is part of her routine before she attends the recording sessions.</p><p>"I warm up in the car on the way to the booth by singing Disney songs, specifically Disney princess songs," said White. "I think that they have a sort of clarity to their vocal quality, but also a lot of highs and lows, and so that's how I warm up for recording."</p><p>Out of all of the Disney princesses, White believes that Aerith has a lot in common with Rapunzel, which should be interesting if they ever meet during any future Kingdom Hearts sequels.</p><p>"I think [Aerith] actually has a lot in common with Rapunzel," explained White. "And she also has the connection of Aerith [having been] voiced by Mandy Moore in the past, and Mandy Moore voices Rapunzel. But Rapunzel spends most of her life in captivity, and her big arc is being brave enough to go outside and explore the world and see the beauty that it has to offer. She always looks on the bright side. I mean, the connections, they're totally there. I think they would be best friends."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ex-riot-devs-believer-seeks-a-better-way-to-develop-video-games-with-open-source-tool-friendshipper<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <p>CTO Landon McDowell tells us why the new studio is sharing some of the technology behind its debut game</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>The Believer Company has today released its internal development tool Friendshipper as an open-source project.</p>
<p>The studio was founded by veterans from Riot Games and is currently working on a next-generation open-world multiplayer game. Friendshipper is a development tool that the team has been using to improve how efficiently they build this game, such as faster implementation of bug fixes during playtests.</p>
<p>Chief technology officer Landon McDowell tells <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em> the aim of Friendshipper is to "very quickly make changes to the code, quickly do builds, and then get changes in those builds out to ourselves as well as testers."</p>
<p>As for why the studio is sharing this technology with other developers, McDowell puts it down to one simple belief: "There's just a better way to develop video games."</p>
<p>"We've not had the most fantastic experiences throughout our careers, and one of the reasons why we came here is that we knew that we wanted to invest, we wanted to figure out a better way of doing this, for a multitude of reasons," he explains.</p>
<p>"We want to be able to play test more frequently. We want to be able to, as best we can, avoid crunch and some of the more problematic aspects of game development. And we believe that the game development process at its core is part of that."</p>
<p>Since forming last year, The Believer Company has grown to 65 people. Of those, McDowell says only three – "three-ish," to be completely accurate – are dedicated to the development of Friendshipper (although the CTO notes that other members of the team do collaborate on this project at times).</p>
<p>As such, he emphasises that Friendshipper in its current state is just one potential solution to some of the problems game developers face.</p>
<p>"We don't have so much hubris that we think we have all the answers," he says. "We have ideas about things that we want to do differently and things that we want to improve, but there is an entire industry of game developers that have similar experiences and have other ideas about ways to do that.</p>
<p>"The best thing that we can do is to take a shot at what we think are fantastic development tools that are going to solve all sorts of problems in game development. But we want to quickly share that out and start building a community around these tools and ideas so that we can learn and grow from other people's experiences in the industry."</p>
<p>He adds that Friendshipper is also designed to help make development easier because "the act of making games should be a joyous one."</p>
<p>"We believe that players benefit from developers having a great experience developing games," he says. "So we want to share these tools and practices, and build a community around them, because we feel like players as a whole will benefit from the industry adopting development methodologies and practices."</p>
<p>Our conversation with McDowell also touched on other ways in which developers can make games faster, better and cheaper – something the GamesIndustry.biz will explore in more depth during <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/find-out-how-to-make-your-games-cheaper-faster-and-better-with-gi-sprint">our GI Sprint editorial special later this month</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-introduces-a-new-levelling-system-just-for-its-expansion-area/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-introduces-a-new-levelling-system-just-for-its-expansion-area<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="342" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Previews for <em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree </em>are dropping today, and with it, many tidbits about the upcoming expansion. We got to go hands-on with it at an event hosted by Bandai Namco, and one surprising detail we learned about was an additional way to level up your character and their Spirit Ashes, alongside the usual runes and levels.</p> <p data-characters="271" data-current-count="271" data-injectable="false">As part of the gameplay in <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>, the player can come across two different resources: <strong>Scadutree Fragments </strong>and <strong>Revered Spirit Ash Blessings</strong>. Each one corresponds to a different power scale that you can boost up at Sites of Grace within the Realm of Shadow.</p> <p data-characters="454" data-current-count="725" data-injectable="true">Scadutree Fragments give you a boost, increasing the damage you can deal and decreasing damage taken. Even a few made a bit of a noticeable difference in our time with the <em>Elden Ring </em>DLC. Meanwhile, Revered Spirit Ash Blessings proffer benefits to your Spirit Ashes, the summoned allies who can fight by your side in major encounters. Both are found scattered around the open world, as special item pick-ups similar to significant items in the base game.</p>
 <p data-characters="364" data-current-count="364" data-injectable="false">It’s important to note that these new power-scaling measures are <strong>exclusive to the expansion area and content</strong>. So piling up a bunch of Scadutree Fragments won’t make your fight against, say, Malenia any easier. Instead, this seemed like a method for assisting players through some of the tough encounters planned for the <em>Shadow of the Erdtree </em>expansion.</p> <p data-characters="448" data-current-count="812" data-injectable="true">We didn’t get a chance to ask any FromSoft members about the mechanic and why it’s been implemented, but in my own playtime, it did feel like a pretty helpful tool for navigating bosses that would’ve been otherwise much more difficult. Considering there’s a fair level range at which a player could enter the DLC, this might be a way to offer fresh scaling and power increases, even if you’re rocking an endgame build.</p>
 <p data-characters="191" data-current-count="191" data-injectable="false">As for whether it makes the traditionally tough bosses of FromSoftware DLC expansions any easier, we’ll have to wait to see. <em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree </em>launches on June 21, 2024.</p>

The 32-inch Odyssey OLED G8 <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/monitors/gaming/32-odyssey-oled-g8-g80sd-4k-uhd-240hz-0-03ms-smart-gaming-monitor-with-sleek-metal-design-ls32dg802snxza/">(model G80SD) is now available for $1,299.99</a> — making it a smidge cheaper than the first <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/6/23586882/samsung-odyssey-oled-g8-display-price-preorder-specs">$1,499.99 OLED gaming monitor Samsung released last year</a>.</p></div><p>Samsung says the G80SD model is its first AI-powered gaming monitor, featuring the same NQ8 AI Gen3 processor as its recently released <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/tvs/neoqled-tv/">2024 Neo QLED 8K TV</a>. That chip is behind the monitor’s AI-upscaling capabilities, according to Samsung, which enables content and games to be upscaled to almost 4K when run through the monitor’s built-in smart TV apps and Gaming Hub, respectively.</p><div><div><figcaption><em>The slim metal design is, to my eye, unchanged since it was first announced in January.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Samsung</cite></p></div><div><figcaption><em>Here’s the view from the back, showing the monitor’s ports and RGB lighting.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Samsung</cite></p></div></div><p>The company has also updated the G80SD’s cooling system to mitigate OLED burn-in, adding a proprietary “pulsating heat pipe” to the monitor, which Samsung says is five times more effective at diffusing heat than the graphite sheet method it was previously using. The monitor also detects and automatically reduces the brightness of static images like taskbars or heads-up displays in games.</p><p>The G8’s remaining specifications — such as its flat display, 3840 x 2160 resolution, 240Hz refresh rate, and 16:9 aspect ratio — are otherwise identical to what was <a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-expands-odyssey-gaming-monitor-lineup-new-oled-models-ces-2024/">already announced ahead of CES 2024</a>. Samsung says the monitor can deliver 250 nits of peak brightness and supports FreeSync Premium Pro to help reduce screen lag and screen tearing.</p><p>Resolution upscaling has been available in TVs and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/26/21402819/nvidia-shield-tv-update-4k-upscaling-remote-customize">streaming devices</a> for some time now, but I'm still curious to see how well it performs built into a gaming-focused monitor. As <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/7/23543021/oled-monitors-tvs-gaming-office-desk-ces-2023">OLED gaming displays especially</a> keep growing in popularity, the feature could help Samsung’s latest offering stand out against the competition — provided people actually want to use it.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>It's been one month since the sound of engines began. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/these-racing-game-players-are-11-days-into-an-exhausting-race-to-climb-a-deadly-tower">hardest track ever created in Trackmania</a> was published by a team of mappers on May 4th, bringing an intimidating 16-floor tower called Deep Dip 2 into the racing game. It became a magnet for competitive drivers after a prize pool of over $30,000 was offered to the first three players to conquer its hellish heights. The prize has yet to be claimed. Even today, determined racers continue to bang their heads against the brutally designed course, featuring icy surfaces, curving rails, and perilous loop-the-loops that hang kilometres about the ground. Some players have parked their hopes and given up. But others persevere. The top three players have reached the final floor and currently stand shoulder to shoulder, eyes focused on the prize.

<!--more-->
</p><p>At the time of writing, the remaining competitors are warring it out at a particular spot on floor 16, tantalisingly close to the finish line. To proceed, they have to perform a nigh-impossible trick that involves <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2163059065?t=03h44m26s">crawling along a vertical surface on two wheels</a>. It is disgusting. The three players currently in the running are "Larstm", "Hazardu", and "BrenTM" - whose <a href="https://deepdip2.com/leaderboard">personal bests</a> now all stand within a couple of metres of each other.</p>
<p>One racer who has bowed out of the contest is  Øyvind "Wirtual" Iversen, a prominent Trackmania speedster who got as far as floor 14, a hefty achievement in itself. </p>
<p>"It sorta gets to the point where the way we're playing the map now, we just have to drive for half an hour," says Iversen in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxCzLV1pyUs&amp;t=1s">a video</a> where he explains the reasons he is throwing in the towel. "Half an hour of perfect driving without falling just to explore the hardest floor. And it feels very unrewarding in that sense.</p>
<p>"The map I think is too difficult. The difficult floors should be earlier in the map because this way of exploring is so taxing... This is the type of map that you need the determination and iron will of, like, a god. Seriously."</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>He also admits that, as a YouTuber, he can't do the same thing over and over again and expect viewers to keep tuning in. That, and normal life must go on. "If I keep playing Deep Dip now," he says, "it'll be destructive to the rest of my life."</p>
<p>But Iversen also encourages people to support the remaining drivers.

</p><p>"I am so incredibly impressed with their progress," said Iversen, "and you only get such a huge respect for this the more you play the map... It's completely bewildering to me."</p>
<p>Iversen once <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVzsVE60uqU&amp;t=3s">beat Trackmania blindfolded</a>. When someone like that nopes out of a challenge, you know it's a tortuously difficult task. Yet the end is in sight and, barring some Sisyphean nightmare trap metres before the finish line, one of the remaining contestants is sure to take the prize money any day. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24171051/like-a-dragon-yakuza-show-amazon-prime-video-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="CHhuIK">After the huge success of its <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24122477/fallout-tv-series-review-prime-video-show"><em>Fallout </em>series</a>, Amazon has moved quickly to follow it up with another video game adaptation. <em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza</em>, a live-action Japanese production based on Sega’s long-running series of gangster soaps, drops on Prime Video worldwide on Oct. 25, 2024.</p>
<p id="WcxrEy">Well, half of it does, anyway. It’s a six-episode series, to be released in two chunks: the first three episodes on Oct. 25 and the next three on Nov. 1.</p>
<p id="q4ZMwj">The show follows series protagonist Kazuma Kiryu and his friends across two time periods, in 1995 and 2005 — suggesting an adaptation of the first game, which came out in 2005 and followed Kazuma after he was released from a 10-year prison sentence. Kazuma is played by Ryoma Takeuchi, star of the <em>Kamen Rider Drive </em>series. The series is directed by Masaharu Take, with a story by Sean Crouch and Nakamura Yugo, and a Japanese screenplay by Yoshida Yasuhiro and Yamada Kana.</p>
<p id="WWlgej">Amazon describes the show as “an original crime-suspense-action series” that “follows the life, childhood friends, and repercussions of the decisions of Kazuma Kiryu, a fearsome and peerless Yakuza warrior with a strong sense of justice, duty, and humanity.”</p>
<p id="EsdZPD">“Audience will enjoy the show’s human drama and conflict that unfolds around Kazuma Kiryu,” Takeuchi said in a statement. “Moreover, please take a look Kiryu’s intense fighting scenes with the Dragon tattoo on his back.” </p>
<p id="rmbOkf">Reading between the lines, it seems like Amazon has swooped in to acquire an already-filmed independent Japanese production, which explains why the show’s release is only a few months away. Amazon’s streaming muscle and deep pockets mean the show gets a simultaneous worldwide release, supported by subtitling and/or dubbing in 30 languages.</p>
<p id="k7Wafr">Given not just the success of <em>Fallout</em> and HBO’s <em>The Last of Us </em>but the acclaim and ratings bestowed on FX’s mostly Japanese-language <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24138469/shogun-finale-review-war-toranaga-explained-episode"><em>Shōgun</em></a>, this seems like a clever, opportunistic move from Amazon. To the point: “The unfettered appeal for Japanese content from within Japan and other parts of the world has been growing exponentially,” said James Farrell, head of international originals at Amazon MGM studios.</p>
<p id="OWPSPq">It’s not the first adaptation the Yakuza series has had, though — the first game was adapted into <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/23196727/best-video-game-movies-adaptations-tv-watch-streaming">a typically anarchic movie by Takashi Miike</a> in 2007.</p>

Titled “The Spectacular Failure of the <em>Star Wars </em>Hotel,” it goes into excruciating detail about why the immersive (and expensive) experience went off like a Wookie fart in the Jedi Temple. Throughout the video, there are obvious parallels to recent, spectacularly bad video game launches centered around popular IP, like <em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em> and <em>Marvel’s Avengers</em>. It’s almost as if no amount of lucrative lore can save something when it’s rushed or half-assed, am I right?<br></p><p><em>Star Wars</em>: Galactic Starcruiser opened on March 1, 2022 and permanently closed a year and a half later in September, 2023. The “immersive” experience required guests to stay there for two nights—no more, no less. (Nicholson’s stay cost just over $3,000 per person, though the lowest possible option was $1,209 per person.) During your stay, you spend almost the entire time “on” the Starcruiser, which promised wild views of space you could glimpse through its fake windows, and an excursion to Disney’s <em>Star Wars</em> world, aka Galaxy’s Edge. </p><div data-video-id="196653" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: A Star Wars Classic Returns &amp; More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="105" data-playlist="196653,195840,196049" data-current="196653"><div><p>The Week In Games: A Star Wars Classic Returns &amp; More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22209.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>“Immersion” was the big promise here—you’d get pulled into your own unique storyline that was meant to seamlessly weave into other guests’ storylines as well as those of the cast members working at the hotel, like a real-world RPG.

Concept art is just that—a concept, so while there’s some expectation that the final product will at least resemble the concept art, it’s not something that can make or break a video game or a real-world experience. Except, that is, when the wonder and promise of the concept art dwarfs the reality of the final product, or when things from that concept art are excised from the final product entirely. Both of those things happened at the <em>Star Wars</em> hotel.<br></p><p>All of the concept art for the Galactic Starcruiser showed that the common areas would be bustling hives filled with space citizens and droids, while giant windows offered a breathtaking look out into space. As Nicholson shows in her video, the lobby of the hotel has a few tiny windows that are <em>way </em>up high on the walls, far enough away to avoid close inspection, and nowhere near eye-level. Meanwhile, the space station-themed restaurant in Epcot has a ton of gigantic fake windows looking out into virtual space.<br></p><p>Things were clearly rushed or cut here. There was one droid roaming around amongst hotel guests, not several skittering around the space. There were a few actors in alien makeup, not a ton. Many times the actors and droids appeared in balcony in the lobby that was inaccessible to guests. </p><p> Nicholson even points out the rooms were needlessly small—as this isn’t a real cruise ship of the sea or the stars, there’s no similar size restrictions Disney had to stay within—likely to cut costs so that the company could maximize its profits.</p><figure id="" data-id="6a181ec2b8f2ced5a20128dc20889b33" data-recommend-id="image://6a181ec2b8f2ced5a20128dc20889b33" data-format="jpg" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="More concept art of the Star Wars hotel.

You could pay $169 for the Memory Maker package, which ensured that the roaming photographers would snap pictures of you living this immersive experience and that you had access to unlimited downloads of those photos. You could also pay $399 for a half-hour private photo shoot, but this package was added at a later date, and appears to have negatively affected those who bought the original, $169 Memory Maker tier, as Nicholson claims she saw no roaming photographers during her stay—apparently they were too busy covering the private photo shoots.<br></p><p>And, as Nicholson points out, though your stay at the hotel would get you seven hours of time in the Disney parks, there were tons of paid add-ons that were <em>not </em>included: lightsaber building ($220), droid building ($100), or a table at Oga’s Cantina (food and drink not included). The Galactic Starcruiser staff also suggested people arrive the night before their stay so that they wouldn’t miss out on any of the activities—another hidden cost.<br></p><p>All of this is reminiscent of the recent, worrying trend: full-priced video games being released that are littered with microtransactions. This is different from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/live-service-games-95-studios-destiny-suicide-squad-1851221959&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/live-service-games-95-studios-destiny-suicide-squad-1851221959">free-to-play titles</a></span> like <em>Fortnite</em> or <em>Overwatch</em>, which are also littered with microtransactions but at least allow you to get your foot in the door for free. The exorbitant pricing of the <em>Star Wars</em> hotel and its equally pricy add-ons is a direct parallel to AAA games charging the new $70 norm just to offer you even more crap to spend your hard-earned money on.<br></p><p>Like <em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em>.

Nicholson makes a parallel with the notoriously cheap, paid-option-heavy Spirit Airlines, which is still usually a pretty economical way to fly, but can feel more grating because it explicitly charges you for amenities that other airlines bake into the cost of your ticket. Nicholson asks you to imagine Disney’s “immersive” hotel experience is like if Spirit Airlines “actually cost more…and all those amenities still cost extra.”</p><figure id="" data-id="ecb48e871e842a4180bbbea90095e36c" data-recommend-id="image://ecb48e871e842a4180bbbea90095e36c" data-format="jpg" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Concept art shows parents and their kids standing in a Star Wars hotel room." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Concept art shows parents and their kids standing in a Star Wars hotel room." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney / Lucasfilm</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ecb48e871e842a4180bbbea90095e36c" data-recommend-id="image://ecb48e871e842a4180bbbea90095e36c" data-format="jpg" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Concept art shows parents and their kids standing in a Star Wars hotel room." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h41757"><a id=""></a><strong>The <em>Star Wars</em> hotel’s bugged quests</strong></h2><p>For the marketing push leading up to the opening of the Galactic Starcruiser, Disney released a few Imagineer roundtables that delved deeper into what guests could expect. As Nicholson points out, one of those roundtables suggested you’d be able to “help someone stow away” or break someone out of the brig, or run into a “galactic superstar” during your stay. One video even suggested that there was a “love story” on board.<br></p><p>Nicholson’s video lays out how the RPG elements of the Starcruiser worked: the cast (which included a Togrutan, a Twi-Lek, and a Rodian) were the NPCs of this world, and an app that you had to use on your phone let you “communicate” with these characters and others. Those characters would “text” you via the app, and you could reply by choosing a few pre-written options.<br></p><p>There were rumors swirling that the Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) bracelets all the guests had to wear were somehow transmitting info to the actors, including things like whether you’d responded to a specific character positively in the app, which would, in turn, increase (or decrease) your trust score with them. Yes, this is all exactly like how an RPG works.</p><p>Except it didn’t work.<br></p><p>“The gameplay did not work for us at all,” Nicholson says in her video. “At some point there was some sort of critical logistical failure which broke every aspect of it. I was continually frustrated the entire time I was there and I left extremely disappointed. In our particular experience, none of the actions we took at any point directed the course of our story in any way.”<br></p><p>Oh, and the item collection mechanic (yay, fetch quests!) that the Starcruiser had for guests? “It was bad,” Nicholson says. “It isn’t any fun.” Her video shows several, unsatisfying examples of the Starcruiser’s item collection feature. “The ordinary gameplay is just earning you imaginary currency to spend on nothing,” she says.

But instead of it just being a few bugged side quests in <em>Fallout 4</em>, the <em>Star Wars</em> hotel’s entire immersive story was broken. Nicholson’s experience was like if you tried to go Renegade in <em>Mass Effect 3 </em>and nothing you did mattered. The story goes on as if you weren’t even there, the Reapers win, Khalisah Bint Sinan al-Jilani never gets punched in the face. </p><p>Does that sound immersive to you? Or even remotely fun?

It’s the heat death of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the bevy of schlocky, subpar games tied to hugely expensive franchises like <em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em> or <em>Gotham Knights—</em>the late-game excisions made to rush out a product, the crunch to release something quickly to capitalize on fans’ shifting interests.

Going since 2005's original <em>Yakuza</em>, and most recently releasing its ninth mainline entry, <em>Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth</em> in January, 2024, the franchise also sports multiple spin-off games, Japanese-only releases, and the inevitable remakes of older games to confuse anyone who isn’t paying close attention. Oh, and yeah, it switched English-language names over the last five years, ditching the <em>Yakuza</em> moniker for <em>Like a Dragon</em> as its official title.</p><p>Amazon Prime’s show is to compromise on that,  titled <em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza</em>, flipping around the ordering of 2019's game name to ensure maximum confusion. However, it’s not the first live-action TV show based on the game, that honor going to 2010's <em>Kurohyō: Ryū ga Gotoku Shinshō </em>based on the PSP spin-off game, airing only in Japan. It then had a sequel based on the following PSP release, <em>Kurohyō 2: Ryū ga Gotoku Ashura hen</em>. You can find it all on YouTube if you look, and it has some powerful soap opera vibes. It’s safe to say Prime’s version will sport a somewhat larger budget.</p><p>Filmed in Japan, and in Japanese, Amazon plans to subtitle <em>and</em> dub the show for international audiences. It will star Ryoma Takeuchi (<em>Kamen Rider: Drive</em>) as lead character Kazuma Kiryu, with direction by Masaharu Take (<em>We Make Antiques</em>) and Kengo Takimoto (<em>Kamen Teacher</em>), in a six-episode show taking place in both 1995 and 2005.</p><p>The storyline, as described by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/like-a-dragon-yakuza-live-action-series-sega-game-prime-video-1236024275/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/like-a-dragon-yakuza-live-action-series-sega-game-prime-video-1236024275/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Variety</em></a></span>, will be “the life, childhood friends and the repercussions of the decisions of a fearsome and peerless Yakuza warrior with a strong sense of justice, duty, and humanity.”</p><p>It appears to have the official seal of approval by the video games’ writer and producer Masayoshi Yokoyama, who has an executive producer credit on the program. While making it clear that he had no desire to rewrite events based on games he’d previously made, he seems very happy with the job done by others. “If I were ever sent to the past through some kind of cosmic joke, this is the experience I’d want to create. If I had to go through the wringer anyhow, I’d want to make the most engaging versions of Kamurochō and Kazuma Kiryu I could —and this show has it all.”</p><p><em>Like A Dragon: Yakuza</em> will be dropped in two three-episode batches, one on October 25, the next on November 1, although there’s no information yet on how long each episode will be.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-ranked-play-release-date/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/when-is-the-xdefiant-ranked-play-release-date.889038/</guid>

<p>It’s been confirmed for a while that XDefiant will eventually get a Ranked Play, but when exactly will the release date be?</p>



<p>According to the developers, Ranked Play is expected to launch in a “future season”, which admittingly does not give us a lot of information on when it’s coming. XDefiant’s first season, which is set to add three new maps and three new weapons, is set to launch on July 2nd, 2024, with each following season launching three months later.</p>



<p>However, there is a glimpse of hope for those waiting to play XDefiant Ranked Play. The game already has a Ranked Trial Run available, suggesting that the mode will be released sooner rather than later.</p>



<p>The Ranked Trial Run currently sees players battling it out in a 4v4; however, XDefiant lead Mark Rubin has previously suggested that it could be increased to 5v5 later based on feedback.</p>



<p>As the name suggests, Ranked Play is a matchmaking system in which teams of similar skill are matched against each other. This is unlike the randomness in XDefiant’s public matchmaking. It’s currently unclear on what gamesmodes and maps will be available for the mode, but as the game does have some Call of Duty esports professionals on its development team, it’s likely to be somewhat similar to Call of Duty. Domination and Occupy are the most likely candidates for gamemodes, whereas maps will ultimately depend on what the studio deems best.</p>

Applications run to June 16, with the game itself launching June 24.</p><p>“The immersive experience gives players the opportunity to experience IKEA's unique approach to careers where non-linear career journeys are the norm and lateral moves across departments are commonplace,” IKEA said. It is IKEA’s first foray into mainstream gaming.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/04/screenshot-2024-06-04-132544-1717503962760.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image credit: IKEA.</figcaption></figure></output><p>There are paid shifts on offer for 10 successful applicants. They’ll help customers and get promoted to move departments, working in different sections of the store like the Showroom and Bistro, helping people choose their furniture, and even serving meatballs.</p><p>“We’re excited to be the first brand to launch paid work on Roblox to showcase how we do careers differently, bringing our unique careers philosophy to life,” commented IKEA’s Country People and Culture Manager, Darren Taylor. “At IKEA, there is no set route to career progression. Our co-workers are able to change roles, switch departments, and grow in any direction they choose, both in the game or in the real world. There are many ways to learn and grow at IKEA, and that's what IKEA on Roblox is all about.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/04/screenshot2-csxy-wuk-1717504041109.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image credit: IKEA.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Digging into the detail, virtual interviews for shortlisted applicants take place for the fully remote virtual role between Thursday, June 14 and Tuesday, June 18. Each successful applicant will be paid an hourly IKEA Co-Worker rate for their time on the game. You have to be 18+ and in the UK or Republic of Ireland to apply. Successful applicants will be paid £13.15 (approx $16.78) per hour, the IKEA hourly rate of pay for a London member of staff. The wage matches the London Living Wage set in the UK, rather than the lower National Living Wage.</p><p>Roblox, which has an incredible 77.7 million daily active users, is used by a number of companies to promote their brands with virtual experiences. But the platform and the company behind it has been accused of “exploiting” children who develop many of the experiences available to play. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/roblox-ceo-pay-to-earn-isnt-child-labor-its-a-gift">Roblox has denied this</a>.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-playstation-bring-back-killzone-and-resistance</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/it%E2%80%99s-time-for-sony-to-bring-back-killzone-and-resistance.889032/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-playstation-bring-back-killzone-and-resistance<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Following on from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-state-of-play-may-2024-everything-announced"><u>PlayStation’s State of Play</u></a>, we now have a solid look at many of the PS5’s upcoming titles. Your mileage may vary on how the lineup looks but the recurring question of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-are-all-the-ps5-games"><u>where all the PS5 games are</u></a> hasn’t quite been answered. Some of the biggest games at the showcase were remakes or remasters of older games such as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/until-dawn-remaster-will-arrive-in-fall-2024-state-of-play-2024"><u>Until Dawn</u></a> or the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-gets-brand-new-trailer-and-release-date-ahead-of-transmission-stream-state-of-play-2024"><u>Silent Hill 2</u></a> remake, or PC ports of already released titles like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-release-officially-confirmed-state-of-play-2024"><u>God of War: Ragnarok</u></a>. That’s not to say there weren’t some big new PS5 games shown, but one in particular has me scratching my head at what we’re supposed to take away from it.</p><p>That would be <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-gets-new-cinematic-and-gameplay-trailer-and-a-release-date-state-of-play-2024"><u>Concord</u></a>, the debut game from first-party PlayStation developer Firewalk Studios. A 5v5 endless multiplayer shooter, the game didn’t exactly give me the best first impression. The writing and characters in the cinematic trailer feel like microwaved Guardians of the Galaxy leftovers, and knowing that this is an Overwatch-like hero shooter where the pretty cutscenes and lore won’t actually be reflected in the gameplay doesn’t help. Of course, Concord could very well surprise once we get our hands on it, but Sony putting such heavy focus on a game that looks so bland just brings to mind that they have two solid first-party shooter IPs that have been languishing in their back-catalog for far too long: Killzone and Resistance. Why should Sony bring these forgotten franchises back to the spotlight? Let me explain.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>Sony’s FPS Crisis</h2><p>Concord being the first game shown during the State of Play isn’t something that happened in a vacuum. Ever since Microsoft announced its intention to purchase Activision, there has been a question mark hovering above the PlayStation brand, that being what’s going to happen to the Call of Duty franchise now that its direct competitor owns it. A big part of <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sony-claims-microsofts-true-strategy-is-to-make-playstation-like-nintendo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Sony’s argument</u></a> in the regulation case that tried and failed to block the Activision purchase hinged on Call of Duty, with Sony stating during the case that “Microsoft claims that Nintendo’s differentiated model demonstrates that PlayStation doesn’t need Call of Duty to compete effectively. But this reveals Microsoft’s true strategy… Post-Transaction, Xbox would become the one-stop-shop for all the best-selling shooter franchises on console.”</p><p>To address the concern, Microsoft and Sony <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-has-signed-a-binding-agreement-to-keep-call-of-duty-on-playstation-after-its-acquisition-of-activision-blizzard"><u>signed an agreement</u></a> to keep the long-running series multiplatform, but such agreements aren’t bulletproof. Microsoft has full control over the Call of Duty IP, meaning Sony is effectively at its mercy when it comes to that franchise. However, Sony’s argument that PlayStation needs Call of Duty to stay competitive is a defeatist mindset. Call of Duty being the number one shooter franchise is not preordained by the gods. Franchises trend up and down all the time; look at Halo going from the top of the universe in the mid-2000s to simply “one among many” shooters in the modern era, or Overwatch being the biggest thing in the world on launch to now becoming a laughing stock as Blizzard tries and fails to deliver on the many promises of what Overwatch 2 was supposed to be.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Right now, Sony doesn’t have a prominent FPS to call its own.</p></div><p>However, none of that changes the fact that right now, Sony doesn’t have a prominent FPS to call its own. Helldivers 2 was certainly a surprise smash hit, but it’s a third-person shooter with no campaign. There’s also the recent snafu about the PSN login requirement that, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-reverses-course-on-helldivers-2-psn-account-requirement"><u>although it was walked back</u></a>, still caused much chaos in the game’s community and led the game to be <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-pulled-from-sale-in-177-countries-due-to-psn-linking-requirement"><u>delisted in 177 countries</u></a>. Sony needs a big win in the FPS space to counteract Microsoft gobbling up the likes of Activision, Blizzard, and Id Software. Luckily, Sony has two old franchises waiting in the wings that could help it out of this bind.</p><h2>Helghan Forever</h2><p>At a time when a big part of Sony’s brand is its focus on AAA first-party games like The Last of Us, God of War, Horizon, or Insomniac’s Spider-Man games, Killzone being left out to dry is a serious missed opportunity. More so than most other franchises, Killzone was synonymous with the PlayStation brand in the PS3 era, with Killzone 2’s release in February of 2009 being something of a landmark moment for a console that seriously struggled with quality exclusives in its first couple of years. Alongside the likes of Metal Gear Solid 4 and Uncharted 2, Killzone 2 helped change the PS3’s reputation and finally made it a worthy competitor to the Xbox 360. That it was a sequel to a game that was <em>not </em>that well-received in the first place only made Killzone 2 all the more remarkable.</p><p>The first Killzone was released in 2004 on the PS2, and despite much pre-release hype as Sony’s potential answer to Halo, the game received <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/killzone/critic-reviews/?platform=playstation-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>mixed reviews</u></a>. It’s not a bad game by any means, but it’s a disappointing beginning for the franchise given how compelling the world and visual design is. It often felt like a decent game with excellent presentation, including Brian Cox’s stellar vocal performance as Scolar Visari and Joris de Man’s iconic original score. But Killzone 2 showed that it’s sometimes worth taking a second chance on an idea that didn’t work out perfectly the first time, launching to <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/killzone-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>spectacular reviews</u></a> (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2009/01/29/killzone-2-review"><u>including IGN’s</u></a>), and selling <a href="https://kotaku.com/killzone-2-sells-1-million-worldwide-5215424" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>more than a million units</u></a> worldwide in less than two months. The Killzone series would become one of Sony’s marquee franchises in the years that followed, with a PS3 sequel Killzone 3 launching in 2011, and one of the PS4’s launch titles in 2013 being Killzone: Shadow Fall.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Now, we know Guerrilla Games is busy with Horizon these days, but certainly Sony has enough studios under its umbrella to let someone else take up Killzone’s flag. Its unique blend of hard sci-fi space opera, weighty FPS combat, and ‘WWII in space’ aesthetic, coupled with the iconic designs of the Helghast troopers, hasn’t really been borrowed by other shooters on the market. A new game in the series could also finally pull the trigger on a story campaign from the Helghast perspective, something fans have wanted for a long time because of their sympathetic backstory. Given Killzone’s importance to the history of PlayStation consoles, leaving it off the PS5 seems like a massive unforced error. Killzone 2 in particular is close to a masterpiece of sci-fi shooter design and not only deserves a modern facelift, but also a proper new entry to continue the saga. But it’s not the only Sony shooter series that warrants a resurrection.</p><h2>Vive la Résistance</h2><p>As mentioned previously, the PS3 struggled out of the gate given how few quality games were made for the console in its opening year. But out of all the launch titles, the one that stood out the most was Resistance: Fall of Man, an original FPS from Insomniac Games, more well known for Ratchet &amp; Clank and its recent Spider-Man series. Although its multiplayer was bland, the single-player campaign was surprisingly meaty and could also be played in split-screen co-op (remember that?). More so, its story was fascinating – set in an alternate history where aliens called the Chimera invaded Earth in the 1950s  – and Insomniac’s trademark for off-the-wall weapon design made for a great game that kind of got lost in the cultural conversation as more anticipated games launched on the system.</p><p>Despite this, Resistance was a regular player in the PS3’s catalog of franchises, with two direct sequels in Resistance 2 and 3 also released during the console’s lifecycle. Sadly, the series suffered a downturn with the second game, which tried too hard to match the conventions of other shooters in the marketplace at the expense of its own personality. Not only did the collection of creative weapons from the first game get shortchanged by forcing players to carry only two at a time instead of the whole arsenal, but the meager campaign was also dotted with an array of disappointing boss fights that tended to be more scripted sequences than dynamic battles. The multiplayer was improved, but the story was weak compared to the previous entry.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Insomniac righted the ship with Resistance 3, which went back to a lot of what both fans and the developers enjoyed about the series. In an interview with <a href="https://kotaku.com/why-did-resistance-never-get-as-big-as-halo-maybe-it-c-5942309" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Kotaku</u></a>, Insomniac CEO Ted Price said that all the changes in Resistance 2 “may have not been a good thing,” and that “on Resistance 3, we went back to some of our more traditional core mechanics that players did love, and then built a story that was more personal… we're really proud of Resistance 3.” But that improvement didn’t translate to sales and the series flamed out with the third entry and the <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/resistance-burning-skies/critic-reviews/?platform=playstation-vita" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>poorly received</u></a> PlayStation Vita spin-off, Resistance: Burning Skies. Yet if Killzone taught us anything, it’s that one misstep shouldn’t mean giving up on a good series, and the alternate history world presented in Resistance is still rife with creative possibilities. The unconventional arsenal of weapons could be a great way to spice up a multiplayer suite, and there are many unseen eras or locations in the Resistance world that could be the focus of a new campaign should Insomniac or one of Sony’s other developers take another crack at it.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If Killzone taught us anything, it’s that one misstep shouldn’t mean giving up on a good series.</p></div><p>Sony has the resources to put up a fight in the shooter space, such as long-dormant franchises like Killzone or Resistance, or developers known for shooters like Bungie. There are many avenues to build first-person shooters on PlayStation, and games like Concord come from that need. We’ll see how Firewalk’s debut fares, but chasing the highs of other games that are already starting to age past their sell-by date is rarely a winning strategy. Not that Sony shouldn’t try to cultivate new IPs, it absolutely should, but if it needs a competitive edge, it would be worthwhile to highlight the values of the PlayStation brand that are, in fact, specific to PlayStation. And reviving two big franchises in the genre you’re currently struggling with that have pre-established fanbases and are already associated with your console? That would be one way to have that competitive edge a hell of a lot sooner.</p><p><em>Carlos Morales writes novels, articles and Mass Effect essays.

		<p><a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/square-enix">Square Enix</a> has released a new <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> update which is now available to download on PS5. It’s important to note that this patch doesn’t deliver any new content to the JRPG sequel and is mainly aimed at bug fixes.</p>

<p>According to Square, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth update 1.040 “will apply fixes to several bugs, as well as improving the stability and functionality of the overall game.”</p>
<p>You can find a quick rundown of what’s included in the latest patch below. In the meantime, check out <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/22/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review/">Nic’s glowing review</a> in which he scored the game a resounding 9/10, saying: “Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is a beautifully crafted experience that fans old and new will absolutely love. It almost goes too far in correcting the first game’s linearity with broad open areas stuffed with things to do, but there’s also key additions to the combat, and the story running through this middle chapter is masterfully retold. Really the biggest problem you’ll have once the credits roll is knowing that it will be far too many years before we can finish the trilogy.”</p>
<p>Anyway, onto those patch notes!</p>

<h3>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth Update 1.040 Patch Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixes to bugs that would very occasionally prevent game progress under specific conditions.</li>
<li>Fixes that allow the player to acquire photo frames if a bug occurs that would prevent their acquisition after fulfilling the relevant unlock conditions.</li>
<li>Fixes to bugs that are triggered under specific circumstances in battle.</li>
<li>Fixes to a bug where information was not shown on screen when selecting to play Stage 2 of the Gambit Gears mini game on Hard Mode.</li>
<li>Fixes to several display-related bugs.</li>
<li>Improvements to the overall game stability.</li>
</ul>
<p>These aren’t the only improvements that have been made to the game since its launch earlier this year.&nbsp;Gamers who choose to play in Performance Mode will now have the choice of ‘Sharp’ or ‘Soft’ visuals. At launch, there were complaints that the image quality in Performance Mode was too soft, thanks to the significant drop in the dynamic resolution bracket compared to the Quality Mode. It seems that Square Enix has now added an optional sharpening filter or upscaling technique to help.</p>
<p>Publisher Square Enix is said to be making major changes to the way its creates blockbuster hits. This comes after a recent financial report which showed huge losses for the company after its abandonment of cancelled projects to the tune of $140,000,000. As a result, Square will be more selective in which games its chooses to greenlight.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/mainframe-industries-reveals-pax-dei-a-sandbox-mmo-coming-to-pc-and-cloud-gaming-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pax Dei</a>, the sandbox MMORPG in development at Iceland-based studio Mainframe Industries, has found a publishing partner in New Tales, the French team that helped publish the free-to-play collectible card game Waven.</p>
<p>Together, Mainframe and New Tales announced that Pax Dei will debut in early access in exactly two weeks, on Tuesday, June 18. Pre-purchase is available starting today on the <a href="https://playpaxdei.com/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website</a>, with various Founder's Packs options, and the game will be playable via Steam or the dedicated Pax Dei launcher.</p>
<p>Mainframe doesn't shy away from the fact that the game is still very much in Alpha and, as such, in 'heavy' development. It will stay in early access for at least a year, during which major changes will be introduced. At times, full wipes of character progress may even take place. The first big post-launch update will introduce markets and a gold economy to Pax Dei.</p>
<p>I recently had the opportunity to interview Sulka Haro, co-founder and Chief Product Officer at Mainframe, to discuss the game's current state and its future throughout early access.</p>

<p><iframe title="Pax Dei | Early Access Announcement" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m9kbu7qtYR4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>When I <a href="https://wccftech.com/mainframe-ex-ccp-remedy-ceo-the-industry-is-headed-towards-cloud-native-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talked</a> to Thor four years ago, he told me the original goal was to make a cloud-native game Cloud native. It was meant to run directly on cloud servers, but that seems to be gone now. Can you speak to this fundamental change?</strong></p>
<p>We still very much want to publish the game across all platforms, including mobile devices, and see streaming as a critical part of that rollout. 5 years ago, it looked like the game streaming platforms were on a steep rise, and we were assuming there would be a widely available ecosystem for distributing games using streaming available by the time we ship the game. This ended up not happening due to a variety of things and we still have a game we’d like to grant access to, so we’re launching on PC first. But as said before, there are plans to expand the available platforms later.</p>
<p><strong>Will Pax Dei be available to play on GeForce NOW and/or other cloud services? If so, when?</strong></p>
<p>We fully intend to bring the game out to a much wider selection of distribution platforms. As a matter of fact, we’ve announced back in January that we’re working on making Pax Dei available on GeForce Now. Not in June, though! Let’s get this PC launch out of the way first.</p>
<p><strong>Will there be support for Steam Deck?</strong></p>
<p>There’s no official support at this time.</p>
<p><strong>During the Wilderness Alpha, I noticed the lack of proper controller support. Is it coming at the early access launch or later?</strong></p>
<p>We’re actively working on improving the controller access. We don’t have a locked-down ETA for it at this point, but we do want to have this available before too long.</p>
<p><strong>The combat felt quite barebones, especially due to the stiff animations. Are you looking to improve that?</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely. The combat system in the Early Access build has already been improved quite a bit in terms of responsiveness, but we can see how we still have to work a lot to get the combat to the level we aspire. We just did a planning session with the whole team and did agree that combat improvements is one of the focus areas for the rest of the year.</p>
<p><strong>Is there a set amount of active combat abilities that players will have at their disposal?</strong></p>
<p>Each one of the weapons (and shields) has a special ability, which we’re improving all the time. Additionally, we’re adding more spells to a larger selection of gear. If you only played the game for a short period of time in the Alpha, you may never get your hands on the spell gear - as you play in PvE, you can find Relics, which unlock recipes for wearables and wieldables that grant you spells, most of which are in form of active combat abilities.</p>
<p><strong>Other MMOs have class-specific special resources (rage/energy/mana, etc.). Will you add something like that to Pax Dei? What about Ultimate abilities?</strong></p>
<p>Our game doesn’t have classes - we use the gear you’re using to effectively create the classes. So when you go raiding, you’ll want to choose gear that matches the role you want to play (which in turn grants you spells once you’ve found some Relics). This system eliminates the need for class-specific resources - we use stamina to gate the spells and abilities you get from the gear. Not related, we are planning to introduce a second resource by the end of the year that will, to some degree, have a similar role in the game.</p>
<p><strong>Previously, you said that magic would be rather rare in the game. Is that still the case? Do you have to work hard to find magic spells?</strong></p>
<p>When you start the game, you have no access to magic. As you progress in the game, you can find Relic, which unlock recipes that allow manufacturing gear that grants you spells and abilities when worn or wielded. The relics for more powerful spells are quite challenging to find, and as the Relics are consumed as part of the crafting process, magic items indeed are not common, and the powerful spells will be quite rare.</p>
<p><strong>Is all gear going to be tradeable? Could you conceivably lend high-end gear to a newbie to make them competitive right away?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we don’t gate trading and/or using items with character progression. Having said that, new characters will not have progressed in the skills and will not be able to effectively use advanced gear, and of course, a new player is unlikely to have the player skills needed to maximize the use potential of the gear. What this means in practice is that a twinked new player will be immediately useful to you but will not be as powerful as an experienced player with a character that’s in the skill cap in the progression.</p>
<p><strong>In terms of PvE, you talked about the dungeon. Is there a limit to player numbers in dungeons? How does instancing work for dungeons? Could you find other groups there?</strong></p>
<p>Each dungeon has a maximum capacity of players that can be in the same instance at a time. The number is based on the dungeon size &amp; performance requirements to ensure the gameplay experience in the dungeon is pleasant. The instances are not made specifically for a party, so you can find other groups in the dungeons, and new instances are created as needed if the dungeon is full. There’s a system related to the instances in Pax Dei that looks at which instance your party &amp; clan members are and automatically picks the instance with your friends if multiple instances are active. The system also has a different “soft” and “hard” caps for the player routing to give it room to do this social matching to maximize the probability you always end up in the correct instance. This same system also applies to the open world areas of the game, where if a Heartland or Wildland reaches the soft cap, it gets instanced, after which we prioritize the instance for you based on where your friends are.</p>

<p><strong>Will PvP work in dungeons, allowing fights between different groups?</strong></p>
<p>Currently, no - we do not want to create significant PvE content in the game that’d be locked behind PvP flags, so players who do not want to participate in PvP don’t feel like we’re forcing them to PvP. Having said that, we are working on an expansion to the PvP system, which will allow players to flag themselves for PvP in a manner that will also work in dungeons. We’ll tell more about this later.</p>
<p><strong>You spoke about potential rewards for PvP, so what are people getting from PvP activities except for loot from the defeated foes?</strong></p>
<p>Currently, PvP is enabled in Lyonesse, a central area in the world accessible from the four Provinces that feature the buildable areas. Entering the area flags you for PvP. The risk/reward related to entering Lyonesse is about the resources you can find in the area - for example, Pure Iron, which is very good for advanced gear manufacturing, is relatively common in Lyonesse (and very rare outside of the area).</p>
<p><strong>I believe Clan Wars were also mentioned somewhere in the presentation slides. Is that feature coming during the early access phase?</strong></p>
<p>We are indeed working on an expansion to the PvP system, and yes, this will launch during the Early Access. The system is not tied directly to the Clans - the PvP organizations are independent of the Clan memberships of the players. We’re assuming some Clans might choose to go all in on PvP and have the PvP organization and the clan memberships match 1:1, but this is up to the players, and we’re sure there will be interesting mixing of clans across the different organizations.</p>
<p><strong>How would those work? Will there be sieges and stuff like that?</strong></p>
<p>We do want to pull off sieges eventually, but in the short term the PvP will be skirmish based. We’ll tell everyone more once we have a better idea of when the features are going to ship to players!</p>
<p><strong>Will there be some bigger PvP-enabled area than Lyonesse at some point?</strong></p>
<p>The entire world will eventually be PvP-enabled. Having said that, the players who do not want to PvP will not be forced to do so and the plots you’re building are sacrosanct and protected by the Divine Peace, so no destruction will come to the villages players are building currently.</p>
<p><strong>You've listed Churches and Feudal System as upcoming Pax Dei features. How do those systems work? What about Altars and Miracles?</strong></p>
<p>The altars will enable new gameplay through Grace, a new resource attainable from the altars used for Miracles and churches are built… around the altars. Grace will also allow anointing Knights, who are PvP flagged across the entire world, which forms the basis of the Feudal System. We’ll tell more about this when we’re a bit closer to shipping these features.</p>
<p><strong>You said transitions to other provinces will require load times. Is there no way to make it seamless at some point?</strong></p>
<p>Currently, when you play the game, it’s pretty rare to get to a loading screen during a typical play session as the 100 square kilometer provinces already provide a huge area for exploration. At this moment, there are practical limits to level sizes, and 100 square kilometers is already pushing it when it comes to seamless travel in the world. We’ll probably look into this at some point, but at the moment we think our time is better spent on other things like improving the combat feel and adding the new game systems discussed earlier.</p>
<p><strong>Can you move between different instances, perhaps to find friends?</strong></p>
<p>At the moment we don’t have a feature for the players to move between instances. We’ll probably add this eventually, but at the moment this is not critical as the way we’ve implemented the instancing areas means players very rarely experience areas that need instancing and when they do, we have the matchmaking system that places layers into the instance with their friends, so it’s extremely unlikely that you’ll ever experience a moment where you’d need to hop between instances.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Village-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><strong>What options will there be to reach distant players with fast travel?</strong></p>
<p>At the moment, the only fast travel option is the ability to return home. We’re likely to keep the fast travel in the world very, very restricted, as we want distance to matter in the game. There will be features to make travel more pleasant (mounts will definitely appear in the game eventually).</p>
<p><strong>Regarding character customization, will you add more faces and cosmetic options?</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>In the Pax Dei Wilderness Alpha, even with <a href="https://wccftech.com/dlss-3-is-coming-to-horizon-forbidden-west-dragons-dogma-2-like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-pax-dei-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DLSS 3</a> enabled on a PC equipped with an RTX 4090 GPU, the game stuttered every few hundred meters. Will you solve that problem in time for the early access launch?</strong></p>
<p>We’ve made several improvements to the content loading, and you should see significant improvement in reducing those stutters in the Early Access build. The stutters were caused by a multitude of issues not related to the GPU, and the work on these, with the help of some of the profiling data we gathered during the Alpha, has paid off very well. We have a few remaining issues, which we’ll address as part of upgrading to a newer version of the Unreal Engine later this year.</p>
<p><strong>What other improvements have you made to Pax Dei since the last Alpha test?</strong></p>
<p>We’ve made a ton of changes that improve the combat responsiveness. Almost everything that can be touched regarding balancing (from combat to recipes) has been touched. We (finally) have rebinding support. There’s literally a few hundred bugs that have been fixed since the Alpha 2 And other things… we’ll soon be publishing extensive release notes that cover a lot of this in detail.</p>
<p><strong>I know you're using Unreal Engine 5 with Lumen and Nanite. Will you keep updating it as Epic releases new versions?</strong></p>
<p>That is the plan, yes. We’re currently using UE 5.2.1 and have already started working on the upgrade all the way to UE 5.4. We’ll ship the Early Access build with the current engine version and are hoping the first bigger update to the game a few months after the launch will already be using a newer engine version.</p>
<p><strong>You've hinted that the game could eventually require an active subscription to play. However, only three of the oldest MMOs (EVE Online, World of Warcraft, and Final Fantasy XIV) still use that business model. Aren't you worried you might alienate many people unwilling to pay a monthly fee?</strong></p>
<p>The final business model for Pax Dei is not decided yet. In Pax Dei, you’re building your home in the “real” world. Whatever gets built on a given player’s plot must always be maintained - that’s costly (not to mention technically challenging). We also need a system to free up land once players leave the game (or become ‘inactive’). This system will be crucial in keeping the world alive, full of activity and opportunities to meet friends, and avoid having areas of the game become ghost towns. Coupling this with monetization seems to be a well-understood and generally accepted model - in the existing Pax Dei community, at least.</p>
<p>We have yet to fully determine the exact shape and form (and price!). this will take. The good old-fashioned subscription model is certainly something we’re looking at. Still, we are also considering other options, with an eye on balancing the simplicity of usage while allowing players to choose how they want to engage with the game. We also indicated we intended to offer a free tier, allowing players to discover the game before committing to it.</p>
<p>We’re committed to being transparent with our model and we’ll keep our players updated on our progress, with an increasing amount of details and with space to experiment and adjust based on sensitivities and data.</p>
<p><strong>What are the odds you'll expand Pax Dei to consoles after the early access phase?</strong></p>
<p>The funding theory behind Mainframe was to make a game playable on every screen. We’re not excluding anything. That said, let’s get things right on PC first!</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

  <p id="8KK5pH">Skirmish wargaming — traditional miniatures wargaming with a smaller footprint and fewer minis — is having a moment. Used to be there were just a few flavors available, but a new crop of games is suddenly giving all kinds of different energies. Grimdark <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22458895/necromunda-warhammer-40k-getting-started-miniatures-kitbashing-conversions-terrain"><em>Necromunda</em></a>, futuristic <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/22555634/infinity-code-one-crimson-stone-nomad-ariadna-pre-order-release-date-price"><em>Infinity</em></a>, and stalwart <em>Malifaux</em> are all still around, of course. Their action remains brutal, and their rulesets fairly complex. Meanwhile, newcomers <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23810357/cyberpunk-red-combat-zone-review"><em>Cyberpunk Red: Combat Zone</em></a><em> </em>and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/24057441/fallout-factions-nuka-world-preview-release-date-price"><em>Fallout: Factions</em></a> are becoming more established thanks to dynamic sculpts, bright colors, and most importantly, far more simplified rules. There’s also <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/23671326/star-wars-shatterpoint-miniatures-skirmish-game-preview-adepticon"><em>Star Wars: Shatterpoint</em></a><em> </em>and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/24107809/halo-flashpoint-miniatures-game-pictures-rules-preview"><em>Halo: Flashpoint</em></a>, more refined games clearly built for brisk, competitive play.</p>
<p id="2Y5ZbW">Now comes Free League Publishing’s <a href="https://freeleaguepublishing.com/shop/mutant-year-zero/zone-wars-core-set/"><em>Mutant Year Zero: Zone Wars</em></a>, launching today with a<em> </em>new <em>Core Set</em>. It feels like this one is bringing some much-needed comic relief.</p>
<p id="lnGiQO">First launched as <em>Mutant</em> in 1984, the Swedish tabletop role-playing universe has been many things over the years. Funcom’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/9/13/17854952/mutant-year-zero-pc-xbox-one-ps4-tactical-rpg-xcom"><em>Mutant Year Zero: Road to Eden</em></a> refocused the franchise on its goofiest characters, human-and-animal hybrids with bizarre special abilities. It also helped that one of the main characters looks like an up-armored Howard the Duck. All the while, Free League has been working diligently in the background to keep <a href="https://freeleaguepublishing.com/shop/mutant-year-zero/">the modern version of the TTRPG</a> in circulation around the world.</p>
<p id="KXe1oO"><em>Zone Wars</em> smartly puts our duck friend back on the cover, and this time he’s the linchpin of a powerful band of Stalkers, mutant soldiers who enter the dangerous, irradiated Zone to scavenge for artifacts. It’s a simple premise that opens the door to clever scenario-based gameplay and the potential for linked campaigns.</p>

<p id="YmtnF4">The most surprising part is the completeness of this starter set, which includes a few short stacks of unit and ability cards, loads of cardboard terrain, bits and custom dice, but also pre-assembled and pre-shaded monochrome miniatures. Setup took me all of 20 minutes, and just about 30 minutes later I had already grokked most of the mechanics. That’s because the rules in the manual have been put together by Andy Chambers, co-designer of the original <em>Necromunda </em>(1995), and they are rock solid and easy to understand.</p>
<p id="mWANTe">Gameplay is nuanced and engaging, but never tedious. <em>Zone Wars</em> has just enough complexity to keep you on your toes. You’ll need to keep track of where your miniatures are facing, for instance. Charging straight away into melee isn’t always the best move, even when your team has the advantage in numbers. Meanwhile, if you keep your distance it can be hard to level a kill shot. That’s because these little buggers are all pretty resilient!</p>
<p id="V2yCaP">Deal enough damage to a given character, and they’ll become broken. After tipping them on their side, the only available action you can take with them on their turn is recovery. But to recover, you’ll need a special item or a friend nearby to come to your aid. The recovery process involves rolling some dice, combining attributes of the rescuer and the rescued, then tallying up the results. If this succeeds, the broken character leaps to their feet with full health — only to become bloodied. If they go down again they’re absolutely out of action for that particular match, but unlike other more hardcore offerings true character death never happens.</p>

<p id="yxZP9K">The result is a lighthearted game of tactical <em>Whac-a-Mole</em>, filled with endearing critters with charming attributes taking devastating hits. But when they go down in a hail of bullets and feathers, they invariably leap heroically back to their webbed feet, makeshift guns blazing. I know of no other game where a moose-man can run antlers-first into an insect-man to score the winning point.</p>
<p id="CVeGV1">The best part is that even in a linked campaign with multiple missions — of the type offered in the game’s first expansion, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Free-League-Psionics-Expansion-Miniatures/dp/B0CV81X9RB/?tag=polygon05-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Free-League-Psionics-Expansion-Miniatures/dp/B0CV81X9RB/?ascsubtag=___pl__p_23932208__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026tag=polygon05-20&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:99,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;ascsubtag&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;ascsubtag&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23932208__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;polygon05-20&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}"><em>Mutant Year Zero: Zone Wars - Robots &amp; Psionics</em></a> — death isn’t really an issue. Even if your favorite character does go down for a second time in the heat of battle, they’ll absolutely be back for the next game. Because if there’s one thing funnier than doming Howard the Duck at range with a scavenged laser rifle, it’s doing it again... and again... and again over the course of a multi-session campaign. </p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/billbil_kun/status/1797968974560518366" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on Twitter/X, consistently reliable leaker @billbil_kun claimed that Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero is getting an Ultimate Edition.</p>



<p>The post also adds that this special edition will be available in physical format, and that it should have a price tag of $109.99. There were no further details about a release window, or other potential editions. </p>



<p>However, the leaker did reiterate that Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero is coming to Summer Game Fest 2024. Insider Gaming can corroborate that the game will be at Summer Game Fest, with retailers ready to put pre-order information live. </p>



<p>It’s unclear if the devs will reveal more information during the event. Summer Game Fest 2024 will premiere later this week on June 7, and it will feature <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/summer-game-fest-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2 hours of game showcases</a>. </p>

</div></figure>



<p>Bandai Namco announced Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-new-game-announced-at-the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at The Game Awards 2023</a>. Last March, the devs also revealed a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bandai-namco-reveals-dragon-ball-sparking-zero-roster-and-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">promising roster of fighters</a> and key features. That included some big changes, such as a movement boost and new fighting mechanics.</p>



<p>It’s unclear which platforms the Ultimate Edition is coming to, as well as the potential components it will include. However, such editions frequently add exclusive figures, original soundtracks, art books, and more. Such content would certainly help justify the leaker’s claimed price tag. </p>



<p>Billbil-kun has successfully leaked a variety of gaming information. That includes the recent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/astro-bot-officially-announced-at-playstation-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Astro Bot game announcement</a> from PlayStation’s State of Play event.</p>



<p>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero will be available on PC via Steam, PlayStation 5, and the Xbox Series X|S. At this time, Bandai Namco has not confirmed anything about the Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero Ultimate Edition or its pricing.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/what-do-apple-and-googles-direct-to-consumer-changes-really-mean-for-game-developers<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <p>FastSpring also shares advice on how studios can best adopt direct-to-consumer payment solutions</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>The direct-to-consumer payment landscape for mobile game developers is changing. Rapidly. Courts and regulators in both the EU and the US have taken issue with Google and Apple's app store monopolies, which means in the near future, mobile game developers may no longer have to mandatorily surrender a 30% cut on all in-game purchases.</p>
<p>Traditionally, selling in-game items or virtual currency through an external webshop has generally been allowed without additional fees by Apple and Google, so long as you don’t embed payments directly inside your mobile game, or steer players with calls-to-action inside the game to buy items from an external webshop.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Recent regulatory and legal pressure has forced Apple and Google to make concessions on embedded payments. However, these concessions have come with prohibitively high fees that negate most of the financial value of direct-to-consumer. This has spurred lawsuits from app and game publishers like Epic, Spotify, and others, which will further increase pressure. Other game publishers are still in wait-and-see mode as these lawsuits play out.</p>
<p>That said, direct-to-consumer is still a viable growth strategy for mobile game publishers, and there are many excellent examples of success to learn from including Warner Bros' Game of Thrones Conquest, Scopely’s Marvel Strikeforce, and the Supercell store.</p>
<p>How can developers monetise their mobile games with direct-to-consumer today? Well, that's a little more complicated. The freedom of monetizing with direct-to-consumer comes with the complexities of global payment methods, currency localisation, and local sales tax/VAT compliance, all of which need to be scrupulously observed to ensure you don't fall foul of the law. This is where the convenience of a direct-to-consumer payments specialist like FastSpring comes in, saving you not only time but considerable money, too. While it focuses on your payments (and, importantly, fraud prevention), you can stay focused on making great games.</p>
<blockquote><p>"The freedom of monetizing with direct-to-consumer comes with the complexities of global payment methods, currency localisation, and local sales tax compliance</p></blockquote>
<p>"Video game publishers have numerous options when it comes to direct-to-consumer payment providers, making it challenging to determine the best choice," admits David Nachman, CEO of FastSpring. FastSpring is a Merchant of Record (MoR) payment provider, which mean it's a trusted third-party firm that assumes responsibility for processing your payments, and sales tax compliance worldwide. It has almost two decades of experience providing payment solutions to publishers unsure about how best to navigate the complexities of global payments and sales tax compliance.</p>
<p>"Our solution seamlessly integrates payments either directly within video games or on a publisher's webshop. Our comprehensive service facilitates payments through multiple global processors to ensure optimal approval rates, offers a wide variety of payment methods around the globe, manages all global sales tax and VAT compliance automatically, offers robust video game-specific fraud prevention, provides dedicated customer support, and much more."</p>
<p>Nachman says that whilst there's been a lot of progress with lawsuits like Epic v. Google – for which FastSpring was called upon to provide evidence – there's still a lot for developers and publishers to consider even without looming app store rule changes around direct-to-consumer.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Screenshot-2024-06-03-at-7.08.19AM.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>FastSpring can help developers go direct-to-consumer</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Because of its 19 years of experience as an all-in-one payments provider, FastSpring considers itself uniquely placed to "allow video game publishers to spend more time making great games and less time selling them." Thanks to its specialized knowledge of local payment methods, video game-specific fraud prevention, and tax compliance, FastSpring has even helped game developers and publishers break into new markets.</p>
<p>"Marketplaces serve as excellent platforms for reaching new audiences for games, while simultaneously offloading the complexities of payment processing and tax compliance. Game studios simply upload their game to the marketplace and receive their earnings monthly," Nachman explains, acknowledging that a lot of game studios use the familiar method of selling their games through Steam, the PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo online stores, and/or mobile app stores.</p>
<p>"But for game publishers considering a move beyond marketplaces to direct-to-consumer sales, FastSpring is a great choice because we offer many of the payment and tax compliance benefits of a marketplace thanks to our comprehensive all-in-one platform and Merchant of Record model.</p>
<p>"Like a marketplace, the MoR model offloads the burdens of payment processing and tax compliance. However, it does so within an experience directly embedded in your game or on your webshop, and at a significantly lower cost than marketplaces."</p>
<p>As for publishers already selling directly to their players? FastSpring can still help there, too; its global payments coverage enables studios to expand into all-new markets "or as a redundant provider in their existing payment stack to leverage FastSpring’s high approval rates, or simply as a failover option."</p>
<blockquote><p>"FastSpring is a great choice because we offer many of the payment and tax compliance benefits of a marketplace"</p></blockquote>
<p>While FastSpring is ready to help with direct-to-consumer strategies today, Nachman said FastSpring is still committed to the fight for open commerce in mobile with embedded payments and steering allowed without additional fees in the future.</p>
<p>When the Google vs Epic ruling came down last December, Nachman was quick to respond, stating he and FastSpring were "ecstatic that game developers will have more choice in how they bring their games to market." He called it "a major win" that he suspected would "have a huge impact on gamers across the industry" and enable devs "to deliver better games and pricing for their players." And it's this commitment to consumer choice and developer freedoms that FastSpring champions most.</p>
<p>"At FastSpring, we support open computing and believe that people should have choice when installing games and software on their phones," Nachman explains. "We also believe that game developers should have choice over the payment solutions they support in their games.</p>
<p>"Apple and Google have been responding to the recent lawsuits and regulations by updating their terms to 'comply' but these changes so far have resulted in a great big juicy nothing-burger," Nachman adds. The recent app store term changes – which include a 28% fee for transactions that happen outside of the app and a limited ability to load apps outside the respective app stores – include "mind-bending gotchas" that essentially negate any material benefit for players or game developers.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Screenshot-2024-06-03-at-7.07.43AM.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>Supercell operates its own store</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It's because of this that Nachman expects, in the short term, to see game companies start aggressively pushing the line in their direct-to-consumer strategies with mobile games "now that weaknesses have emerged", along with further lawsuits protesting the recent app store terms changes.</p>
<p>In the mid-to-long term, he opines that ongoing lawsuits may force even more changes to app store terms and conditions that are more in line with rulings and regulations.</p>
<p>"One thing we can confidently predict is that Apple and Google will keep fighting to protect their global duopoly, and everyone else will keep fighting for choice," Nachman insists.</p>

        <p>The device will give access to Steam's VR library from PlayStation's headset</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Sony is set to launch a PC adapter for its PlayStation VR 2 headset this August.</p>
<p>Scheduled for release on August 7, the adapter will give PSVR 2 players access to Steam's library of VR titles, which includes Half-Life: Alyx, Fallout 4 VR, and more.</p>
<p>The adapter will be available from PlayStation's own store and "select retailers," Sony said, and will have a $59.99 / €59.99 / £49.99 price tag.</p>
<p>In order to have access to Steam's VR library from a PSVR 2, players will also need a DisplayPort cable compatible with DisplayPort 1.4 (that needs purchasing separately), a Steam account, and a PC meeting the minimum requirements detailed in <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/03/playstation-vr2-players-can-access-games-on-pc-with-adapter-starting-on-august-7/">Sony's blog post</a>.</p>
<p>"PSVR 2 was designed from the ground up specifically for PS5 – so you'll notice that some key features, like HDR, headset feedback, eye tracking, adaptive triggers, and haptic feedback (other than rumble), are not available when playing on PC," Sony's principal product manager Yasuo Takahashi clarified in the announcement.</p>
<p>He added: "While the most immersive way to experience PSVR 2 gaming remains on PS5, we hope players will enjoy the ability to play an expanded lineup of VR games on PC using the same headset."</p>
<p>The PSVR 2 launched on February 22, 2023 and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/psvr-2-sold-just-shy-of-600000-units-in-six-weeks">sold just shy of 600,000 units in six weeks</a>. The virtual reality headset hasn't been a breakaway success, with reports in March 2024 pointing to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sony-reportedly-stops-psvr-2-production-to-clear-the-current-backlog">Sony halting production</a> in order to clear its current backlog of unsold devices.</p>

It will be a story centered on series mainstay Kazuma Kiryu and will follow his life in 1995 and 2005 across six episodes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first three episodes drop Oct. 25 and the last three episodes hit Amazon Prime Video on Nov. 1, and, according to&nbsp;<a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/like-a-dragon-yakuza-live-action-series-sega-game-prime-video-1236024275/"><em>Variety</em></a>, the series will be subbed and dubbed in 30 languages.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The logline for the series describes it as a story set in two time periods – 1995 and 2005 – and follows the life, childhood friendships, and repercussions of the decisions of Kazuma Kiryu, a Yakuza warrior with a strong sense of justice, duty, and humanity. If you're familiar with the series, given the time periods at play here, it sounds like <em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza</em> could be loosely adapting the storyline of Yakuza 1.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Take Masaharu (<em>100 Yen Love</em>) is directing the series alongside Takimoto Kengo (<i>Kamen Rider</i>), and stars Takeuchi Ryoma (various&nbsp;<em>Kamen Rider&nbsp;</em>movies and series) as Kazuma Kiryu. You can see him in the image below:</p>

</article><p><em>Variety&nbsp;</em>reports <em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza</em> will "depict the lives of fierce yet passionate gangsters and people living in a huge entertainment district,&nbsp;Kamurochō, a fictional district modeled after the violent Shinjuku ward's&nbsp;Kabukichō, that acts as the backdrop of the gameplay." Amazon says the series "showcases modern Japan and the dramatic stories of these intense characters, such as the legendary Kazuma Kiryu, that games in the past have not been able to explore."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ryu Ga Gotoku Studios studio head and series executive producer Yokoyama Masayoshi told&nbsp;<em>Variety&nbsp;</em>the following:&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Since the day I first put pen to paper on the original Yakuza script, I've never once thought about revisitng any of my work on the series. It's because I understand all too well the challenges and hardships that come with remaking a finished title. However, if I were ever sent to the past through some kind of cosmic joke, this is the experience I'd want to create. If I had to go through the wringer anyhow, I'd want to make the most engaging versions of&nbsp;Kamurochō and Kazuma Kiryu I could - and this show has it all.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"While the games let you experience their world through the subjective lens, this adaptation will be the ultimately objective way to enjoy the show. I have no doubt fans of the series will be drawn to how it brings the games to life and adds new surprises. Newcomers, I'm sure, will find themselves invested simply in the gritty realism of the show."&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza </em>hits Amazonz Prime Video starting on Oct. 25 and will finish on Nov. 1 this year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>News of this series follows the release of <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/product/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth">Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a>, the eighth mainline installment in the video game series, back in January.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/dig-into-magical-delicacy-a-delicious-metroidvania-lite-when-its-served-next-month/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=dig-into-magical-delicacy-a-delicious-metroidvania-lite-when-its-served-next-month<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="243" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Publisher Whitethorn Games has revealed when fans can get their hungry hands on Skaule’s upcoming main course of a Metroidvania-lite, <em>Magical Delicacy</em>. The game will be available on July 16, offering a new, wholesome twist on the genre. </p> <p data-characters="616" data-current-count="616" data-injectable="true">In just over a month, you’ll be able to get cooking with <em>Magical Delicacy</em> on PC, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S from day one. You can even get the game on Xbox Game Pass the same day, meaning there are plenty of places you can settle down to consume its meaty gameplay. The story reminds me very much of <em>Kiki’s Delivery Service</em> as protagonist Flora, a young witch, arrives in the town of Grat to develop her magical skills. As we all know, though, training as a witch is never straightforward, and Grat has several mysteries to get caught up in and a colorful cast of characters to meet. </p>
 <h2 id="h-players-will-collect-recipes-and-ingredients-build-their-dream-kitchen-and-serve-the-local-townsfolk-in-magical-delicacy" data-injectable="false">Players will collect recipes and ingredients, build their dream kitchen, and serve the local townsfolk in <em>Magical Delicacy</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Magical Delicacy Release Date | PC, Nintendo Switch, Xbox" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mn-5KMaEJuw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="420" data-current-count="720" data-injectable="true">While we don’t know how Flora comes to Grat, once there, she settles down and sets up shop to deliver potions and home-cooked meals to the local townsfolk. <em>Magical Delicacy</em> is a Metroidvania-lite, borrowing some <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/10-best-metroidvania-games-you-can-play-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">elements from the genre</a>, such as unlocking tools for gradual progression, while using others, such as 2D platforming and NPC relationships, to help build out the overarching story and linear questline. </p>
 <p data-characters="432" data-current-count="432" data-injectable="true">The core gameplay revolves around cooking and gathering ingredients. Some can be purchased, while others must be foraged from around Grat. As you progress, you’ll unlock new potions and recipes that will open up new areas of the town and access to new townsfolk. Some of these recipes will require kitchen upgrades, but you’ll get to build it as you play until it feels like your ideal countryside cottage cooking area. </p>
 <p data-characters="382" data-current-count="382" data-injectable="false"><em>Magical Delicacy</em>‘s cooking system isn’t a simple one-button affair. It’s pretty complex and allows for experimentation as you figure out what to cook for every individual you meet. As you move through the story, new ingredients, processes, and recipes only make it more in-depth, but based on the trailer, it seems to replicate cooking in the kitchen fairly well. </p> <p data-characters="444" data-current-count="826" data-injectable="true">Whitethorn Games boasts that, much like a good soup, there’s more to Grat than meets the eye. While cooking and serving the townsfolk is one objective, you’ll lose yourself in others, including meeting ancient figures of legend or old masters of their craft who have long been forgotten. It sounds to me like Flora will help modern-day townsfolk understand more about Grat’s past in a similar way to how you did in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-spirittea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spirittea</a></em>. </p>
 <p data-characters="540" data-current-count="540" data-injectable="false">What I believe is special about <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2231190/Magical_Delicacy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Magical Delicacy</a></em> is that it takes what is often the heart of a family’s day, sitting around a table together to talk about their day and share a meal, and turns it into an entire game. Flora may cook multiple meals, but it’s the cooking that brings the townsfolk out of their shells and helps you, as the player, understand and appreciate Grat. Just like in real life, food can help you integrate with a small community because it’s a great leveler. After all, everyone’s got to eat. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mech-engineers-demo-is-for-people-who-love-hateful-interface-design<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
If you heard loud swearing last night in the Watford area it may have been one of two things: 1) me cussing out my (borrowed) Steam Deck while stealthily accessing the wifi from outside a closed public library, as I don't currently have broadband at home, or 2) me subsequently trying to make head or tail of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mech-engineer">Mech Engineer</a>, in which you take charge of a mobile undersea metropolis and send squads of painstakingly assembled robosoldiers to semi-auto-battle squidgy alien fauna. 
</p>
<p>
Engineering a mech is a Herculean labour whose completion eludes today's puny scientists, and Mech Engineer doesn't aim to make life easier, whatever its putative status as a "means of fun". Mech Engineer is a game with an attitude problem, frankly. I realised this on in-game day two, when the interface coughed up a bunch of damage reports presented as pieces of paper, which I then had to crumple up and toss away individually.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
That interface! There's an innocent 30 seconds initially when you think it's just badly designed. But then you realise that it is a creature of foul and labyrinthine purpose. Broadly, it consists of a Dwarf Fortressy grid-based world map, where you can shunt your city about and send mech squads on missions, with tabs for researching new components, fabricating them, and assembling them into conveniently coffin-sized Gundams you can then fill with pilots. There's a calendar which lets you advance to the next day. Reading those sentences back, it sounds practically transparent. Like XCOM but with extra robots, right? Wrong! Mech Engineer is nothing like XCOM. It is like tying your shoelaces with a pair of scissors. It is like doing jigsaw puzzles in a cesspit after the death of the sun.
</p>
<p>
When I mentioned Mech Engineer to Graham he said it reminded him of MicroProse's older interface 'em ups, in which the thrill arises from the quasi-analog, high-fidelity obfuscatoriness of the simulation itself. I subsequently went away and discovered that yes, MicroProse is Mech Engineer's publisher. I do not have the benefit of Graham's greatly advanced years and accompanying experience of recreational inconvenience, but to me Mech Engineer feels almost like a parody of MicroProse's games on par with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/space-warlord-organ-trading-simulator">Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator</a>.

</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RT8ijnoUak" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>
The interface is a sour quagmire of analog dials, submarine-style viewports, wireframe graphs and incomprehensible LED readouts, laid out in violent contradiction of present day notions of "flow", with several ways of flipping between screens that compete for your attention constantly, on-screen buttons in place of keyboard controls, a habit of miniaturising the most important elements, and a relentless desire to overcomplicate every little interaction. Again, you might think it to be poorly made, but it's very obviously a labour of love. Each individual fitting has a just-so exactness, from the monochrome firing range simulator through the authentically papery bestiary and landscape illustrations, to the sheer range of alarm SFX and mechanical reports that blare from the guts of the beast as you tootle about pressing the wrong bits and getting your pilots slaughtered.  
</p>
<p>
The actual mech engineering is in-depth and seems engrossing. For instance: you have to construct, test and ignite a mech's reactor before slotting it into the chassis, which feels vaguely cathartic - like putting the cherry on a carefully optimised cake's worth of delicately thinned-out armour plating, optional energy shields, and chonky Gatling guns that can themselves be tweaked and whittled to satisfaction. Battle, meanwhile, is fairly hands-off and visually reminiscent of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/duskers">Duskers</a>: you give your squad waypoints and fiddle with things like spacing while they shoot at Space Invaders in real-time on a scratchy radar display, until they run out of ammo or crumple under the stress. 
</p>
<p>
Your pilots have animated portraits, and my word, they are an unsightly bunch even before you feed them to the extra-terrestrials - not so much an army of Doomguys as a cluster of chatbot gargoyles gawping at you from the abyss. Again, there's a just-so feel to it all that hooks my curiosity even as I whinny in anguish, uninstall the demo in a frenzy, and race back to the library at midnight to download something gentler, like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-made-the-witchy-cottage-of-my-dreams-in-tiny-glade">Tiny Glade</a>. Mech Engineer! How I loathe you, especially as I've just realised that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-rally-point-putting-mech-engineer-on-trial-and-error">Sin wrote you up three years ago</a> - honestly, it sounds like the only thing that has really changed in the meantime is that you can now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1428520/Mech_Engineer/">buy the full thing on Steam</a>.</p>

<p>Hypercharge Unboxed by Digital Cybercherries Limited is out now on Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you have ever seen a reel or a TikTok of a game where a bunch of toys are causing chaos with weapons in the middle of a toy store, then you know about Hypercharge Unboxed. The 2020 multiplayer and offline shooter is now officially available through the Xbox store. The game is an indie project that has been developed by a team of 6 people and was first available only through <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/523660/HYPERCHARGE_Unboxed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a>. Commendably, Hypercharge Unboxed has sold more than 40,000 copies within 4 days of its release on the Xbox Store, as per Jake Lucky on X (formerly Twitter).&nbsp;</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The viral game where you play as action figures in a toy store is officially out on Xbox, selling over 40,000 copies in it's first 4 days, a dream accomplished for the lead of this indie dev project <a href="https://t.co/KFjo6tkfBx">pic.twitter.com/KFjo6tkfBx</a></p>— Jake Lucky (@JakeSucky) <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeSucky/status/1797666996135555270?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 3, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Talking about the game, the story revolves around an ancient line of action figures that allows humans to retain their childhood memories with their toys through a magical power called Hypercore. In this first and third-person shooter, you get to play as action figures as you fight against hordes of weaponized toys and save the Hypercore from a villainous faction called Major Evil.&nbsp;</p>

The <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/hypercharge-unboxed/9ngk4zhkbc8x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Standard Edition</a> provides the base game at the price of $29.99.

<p data-characters="259" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>XDefiant</em> is Ubisoft’s attempt at creating a <em>Call of Duty</em> killer, but the company has so much more locked away in its IP vault. That’s why it should be no surprise that a leaker has discovered mentions of maps themed around <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>. </p> <p data-characters="321" data-current-count="321" data-injectable="false"><em>CoD</em> is well-known for its weird and wacky crossovers these days, so it’s not a huge shock that <em>XDefiant</em> aims to follow that pattern too. It’s easier when you own a lot of IP as well, as Ubisoft does, so getting them into your game is much easier and doesn’t require negotiations with the rights owners. </p> <p data-characters="296" data-current-count="617" data-injectable="true">According to Rogue, an <em>XDefiant</em> dataminer, two <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> maps should appear in the game at some point in the future, with the leaker posting a clip featuring sounds from the maps, while also stating that they had found a “good amount of things related to” the locations. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="410" data-current-count="710" data-injectable="true">It would definitely be interesting to see what those maps would look like, with all of the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> maps set well in the past. Whether we would see locations from history or maps based on the more modern-day story that is expected to feature in <em>Assassin’s Creed: Infinity</em>. Other leaks have suggested that a new faction called The Brotherhood could also be linked to the long-running series.</p>
 <p data-characters="322" data-current-count="322" data-injectable="false">Of course, it’s worth remembering that these are leaks and rumors, and haven’t been confirmed by Ubisoft. Therefore, it’s worth taking all of this information with a pinch of salt until we get official word from the developers. Still, it’s hard not to let your imagination run wild at the thought. </p>

            <p>Swedish store and home of flatpack furniture Ikea is hiring 10 people from the UK and Ireland to assist with the running of a virtual store in Roblox.</p>
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/ikea-hiring-roblox-players-run-virtual-in-game-store/">TheGamer</a>, this virtual store is part of a "Careers Done Different" campaign, which Ikea hopes will demonstrate possible career paths available within the company.</p>
<p>Successful candidates will be able to serve meatballs in the store's bistro, and help patrons choose furniture in the showroom. As for pay, Ikea is offering an hourly wage of £13.15/€14.80 for this obviously fully remote, limited contract position.</p>

<p>"With us, you have the opportunity to move departments, flex your skill and get promoted," the application's <a href="https://thecoworker.co.uk/">website</a> reads. "At Ikea, career progression is unique because you can grow in any direction. We believe in recruiting people based on our values rather than simply ticking all the right boxes on a CV."</p>
<p>To apply, those interested will need to answer a range of questions including the deeply insightful: "How do you feel about being turned into pixels?" Applicants will also need to think about what they would do if the bistro ran out of pixelated hot dogs during their shift.</p>

<p>It is not just Ikea that is using Roblox to expand its reach. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-unveils-digital-theme-park-nextworld-on-roblox">Netflix is also coming to Roblox</a>, with the streaming giant recently revealing its "digital theme park" on the gaming platform, known as Nextworld. This will essentially acts as a hub where players can access areas, characters and games based on Netflix properties, such as Stranger Things and One Piece.</p>
<p>For more on Roblox, our Chris Tapsell recently spoke with the studio's head Stefano Corazza about concerns the game exploits children.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2024-conference-schedule">Summer Game Fest 2024</a> takes place this weekend, beginning with Friday's two hour showcase of announcements.
</p>
<p>
Of course, speculation always runs rampant ahead of the show as to what will be shown, with Geoff Keighley himself tempering expectations in a <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2162199165">Twitch livestream</a>. 
</p>
<p>
In the stream, Keighley revealed some games that will and won't make an appearance at Summer Game Fest. He's also released a trailer for the show (below), though this is simply a "mood piece" that comprises games out this year rather than being a firm indication of what we'll see.

<p>
So firstly: what won't be at Summer Game Fest 2024?
</p>
<h3>GTA 6</h3><p>
Sorry, no new trailer for the biggest game on the horizon. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-6-coming-in-fall-2025-publisher-take-two-reveals">release window was recently narrowed to autumn 2025</a>, so a new trailer is still quite a way off.

</p>
<h3>Hollow Knight Silksong</h3><p>
"I think it's going to be a while," said Keighley. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-will-no-longer-launch-in-first-half-of-2023">Sigh</a>.
</p>
<h3>Kingdom Hearts 4</h3><p>
Keighley said people expecting this are "setting themselves up for failure". At least the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-hearts-series-coming-to-steam-next-month">previous Kingdom Hearts games are arriving on Steam this month</a>.

</p>
<h3>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</h3><p>
Presumably Keighley is allied with Kojima on that one. And he's got <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-making-new-metal-gear-solid-style-game-and-movie-for-playstation">Physint</a> to work on instead.
</p>
<h3>Beyond Good and Evil 2</h3><p>
"Your guess is as good as mine," said Keighley. Ubisoft Forward, you're our only hope.
</p>
<h3>The Wolf Among Us 2</h3><p>
There were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-wolf-among-us-2-resurfaces-after-last-years-delay-with-four-new-images">screenshots recently</a>, but don't expect this to feature.
</p>
<h3>Judas</h3><p>
Nothing on Ken Levine's next, though he's already <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-creator-ken-levine-finally-explains-judas-narrative-lego-concept">explained the game's "narrative Lego"</a>.
</p>
<h3>Def Jam</h3><p>
A random one, but don't expect grappling rappers this year.
</p>
<h3>No music act</h3><p>
That'll be saved for The Game Awards. Instead, this is all about game trailers. That means no flute guy either.
</p>
<p>
On the flipside, what do we know will definitely be included?</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-to-announce-long-awaited-features-next-month">Palworld</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atlus-persona-follow-up-metaphor-refantazio-gets-release-date">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-your-first-look-at-monster-hunter-wilds-coming-in-2025">Monster Hunter Wilds</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-announced">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-batman-arkham-game-is-a-meta-quest-exclusive-from-iron-man-vr-developer">Batman: Arkham VR</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-will-release-in-october-dataminer-teases">Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gris-creator-reveals-next-game-neva">Neva</a></li>
<li>Something from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blumhouse-games-hires-horror-game-specialist-louise-blain">Blumhouse Games</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/among-us-teases-upcoming-animated-series-with-blood-splattered-pizza-party-image">Among Us animated show</a></li>
<li>Zombies and probably spaceships</li>
<li>"A cool DLC announcement", though it's unclear if this will be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-everything-we-know-9415">Elden Ring DLC</a> or not</li>
</ul>
<p>
It's a "lighter year" in terms of AAA releases Keighley said, but there remains excitement around smaller releases. The show will mainly consist of already announced games coming later this year. Still, Keighley is only an 8/10 in excitement, which seems a little mean to even put a number on it for those games with announcements.
</p>
<p>
We'll be watching Summer Game Fest live so come join us and check out the site for all the key announcements.
