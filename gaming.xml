            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In between the other big announcements during today's State of Play presentation, like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/housemarque-saros-gameplay-release-date-state-of-play/">release date and gameplay reveal for Saros</a> and our <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-wolverine-new-trailer-provides-first-look-at-gameplay-confirms-fall-2026-release-window/">first proper debut of Marvel's Wolverine</a>, PlayStation took some time to announce the PS Plus Essential games for October, headlined by Remedy Entertainment's excellent Alan Wake 2. We also learned that The Last of Us Part II will be joining the PS Plus Extra game catalog this coming Friday, September 26, 2025, to arrive in time for The Last of Us Day.</p>



<p>Alan Wake 2 will join the service for PlayStation Plus Essential subscribers on October 7, 2025, and joining alongside it will be the indie puzzle game hit Cocoon, and the physics-based comedy game Goat Simulator 3. Their arrival on October 7 also means that you have until October 6, 2025, to add Psychonauts 2, Stardew Valley, and Viewfinder to your library, if you haven't already, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-essential-september-2025-psychonauts-2/">since those are the three games available to subscribers for September 2025</a>.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>For PlayStation Plus Extra subscribers, The Last of Us Part 2 is just one of the games getting added to the service for October, with the rest of them surely getting announced within the coming weeks. We just got the news about The Last of Us Part 2 now because of today's State of Play presentation and its proximity to The Last of Us Day.</p>



<p>We also got a look at some of the games joining the Classics Catalog, which is exclusively for PlayStation Plus Premium subscribers. Two of the titles are classic fighting games, Tekken 3 and Soulcalibur 3, which were marked as "<em>coming soon</em>" to the service.</p>



<p>The third game announced was the Lara Croft Tomb Raider Anniversary, which was also marked as "<em>coming soon</em>," and could imply that these three titles aren't necessarily what will be added to the Classic's Catalog for subscribers in October. We'll see what the full announcement of the PS Plus Extra and Premium games for October reveals when it arrives in a few weeks time.</p>

But one thing they can apparently agree on is that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) should probably stop using them to promote deportation campaigns.</p><p>The DHS posted a <a href="https://x.com/DHSgov/status/1970251208322621530">montage of ICE raids</a> to X on Monday accompanied by the original <em>Pokémon</em> theme song and the caption “Gotta Catch ‘Em All.” The clip also features images from the anime and text overlays using a sort of Temu version of the <em>Pokémon</em> font. A day later, the agency posted a video featuring a viral clip of Theo Von where he stares into the camera and says “<a href="https://x.com/vvsrak/status/1881803443691749635">heard you got deported, dude… bye</a>,” then tacked on stats about how many people had been deported so far under President Donald Trump.</p><p>Both The Pokémon Company and Theo Von objected to DHS using them to promote ICE raids. <a href="https://x.com/theovon/status/1970692062090797341">Von quickly took to X</a>, saying, “Yooo DHS i didnt approve to be used in this. I know you know my address so send a check. And please take this down and please keep me out of your ‘banger’ deportation videos.”</p><p>The statement from The Pokémon Company was, unsurprisingly, a little more diplomatic. “Our company was not involved in the creation or distribution of this content, and permission was not granted for the use of our intellectual property,” the company told the <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/pokemon-torches-dhs-over-gotta-catch-em-all-ice-raid-stunt/"><em>Daily Beast</em></a>. Fans have taken to social media to <a href="https://x.com/pokeBALLZdeep/status/1970573026711269397">urge</a> The Pokémon Company and Nintendo to <a href="https://x.com/ProXFirefly6/status/1970878963951219005">sue</a>, but at least one legal expert sees that as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/784312/pokemon-lawyers-wont-sue-dhs-for-that-video-former-legal-head-predicts">unlikely</a> — despite the companies’ <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/18/24248602/nintendo-pokemon-palworld-pocketpair-patent-infringement-lawsuit">notoriously</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/4/24090357/nintendo-yuzu-emulator-lawsuit-settlement">litigious</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/660815/nintendo-lawsuit-genki-switch-2-accessories">nature</a>. The Pokémon Company’s ex-legal chief Don McGowan told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fans-want-pokmon-to-sue-after-department-of-homeland-security-video-uses-ash-ketchum-to-promote-ice-but-the-companys-former-legal-boss-says-he-wouldnt-touch-this"><em>IGN</em></a> that “This will blow over in a couple of days and they’ll be happy to let it.”</p><p>The post featuring Theo Von has since been <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/theo-von-dhs-deportation-video-down.html?utm_source=flipboard.com&amp;utm_medium=social_acct&amp;utm_campaign=feed-part">removed</a>, suggesting that DHS is perhaps a little wary of angering the podcaster’s fan base. The <em>Pokémon </em>clip remains, however, and the Customs and Border Patrol X account even <a href="https://x.com/CBP/status/1970280164442714348">replied</a> with a GIF of Detective Pikachu under the caption “Border Patrol’s newest recruit.”</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/785288/pokemon-theo-von-dhs-ice#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6NjA5MzU0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Terrence O'Brien</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/785288/pokemon-theo-von-dhs-ice]]></content:encoded>

It’s not quite the new God of War game announcement many may have been hoping to see, but it does come with confirmation that it will launch in October for $84.99, with pre-orders opening October 3 at 10am local time.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/god-of-war-2005">original God of War</a> launched for the PlayStation 2 in 2005 and quickly catapulted Kratos into becoming a PlayStation icon.

Outside of this, though, fans have been left waiting for any news from developer Santa Monica Studio, as the next chapter of Kratos’ journey remains a mystery.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When we were deciding how best to embody the series, we immediately thought the form of the controller lent itself perfectly to Kratos’ omega tattoo," Santa Monica Studio associate art director Dela Longfish explained in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/24/celebrate-kratos-legacy-with-the-dualsense-wireless-controller-god-of-war-20th-anniversary-limited-edition/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation.Blog post</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Campaign Preview: Chaos, Destruction, and Surprising Variety]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-campaign-preview-chaos-destruction-and-surprising-variety</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-campaign-preview-chaos-destruction-and-surprising-variety.1307862/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield has always been defined by scale: sprawling maps, crumbling buildings, and squads working in sync to turn the tide of war. With Battlefield 6, Battlefield Studios is aiming to bring that same sense of chaos and unpredictability into the single-player campaign. After going hands-on with several missions, it’s clear this isn’t just a throwaway side mode – it’s a confident, varied experience that constantly shifts objectives, introduces new tools, and keeps the action fresh. From storming beaches under fire to chasing trains through collapsing tunnels, every level I played delivered a new surprise and kept me constantly excited for what I would experience next. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Fearsome Foursome</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The campaign drops you into the year 2027 as part of Dagger 1-3, an elite squad of U.S. Marines. If you’ve played the recent multiplayer beta – or any Battlefield before – you’ll immediately recognize the squad archetypes. Carter fills the Assault role, Murphy handles Engineer duties, Gecko manages Recon, and Lopez rounds out the team as Support. Curiously, Lopez isn’t playable in the campaign, and Battlefield Studios declined to elaborate when asked why. Whether it’s a design choice or a story reveal saved for later, time will tell. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What makes the campaign stand out so far is how it blends traditional FPS action with light squad management. Each mission hands you a different Marine, but you’re rarely operating alone. You can call on your squadmates mid-fight to use their specialized abilities – Gecko tagging targets, Murphy blowing open defenses, Lopez keeping everyone supplied and revived. It’s not a deep tactical system, but it makes your squad feel integral to success, and it adds a dynamic layer that’s genuinely fun.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>What makes the campaign stand out so far is how it blends traditional FPS action with light squad management.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The small touches sell the squad dynamic even further. Take out an enemy gunner, and your Marine calls out, “MG down!” Drop an engineer, and suddenly you know their SAM launcher is no longer a threat. These callouts double as gameplay feedback, helping you adjust tactics mid-fight. Even in single-player, the firefights carry the tension and layered pacing of multiplayer matches, with squads clashing and roles countering one another. It’s exactly the kind of squad-driven storytelling Battlefield fans have long hoped for.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Buckle Up and Hang On</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">During my hands-on, I had access to three missions scattered across the campaign, and it was immediately obvious why these were chosen. Each mission felt completely different, with objectives that constantly changed the pace and approach. These three levels honestly felt closer to nine, and I had to remind myself partway through missions that I was still in that same level. `</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The first one I played was Operation Gladius, the third stage in the story. It opens with an iconic “war-game” spectacle: storming enemy beaches inside an armored vehicle. From the moment it began, I was floored by the presentation. Mud and smoke obscured my vision while explosions rocked the shoreline. The waves sent our floating tanks rocking back and forth, while a hazy, smoke-filled sky gave me a preview of the battle I was heading into. As the gunner, I was tasked with taking out bunkers and enemy troops, and what could have been a straightforward turret section became a tense scramble to see through debris and support my squad.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once the tanks landed, I, still playing as Murphy the Engineer, began escorting a tank through a war-torn town toward City Hall. This section leaned into classic Battlefield gameplay: waves of enemies, constant destruction, all while keeping the tank operational, while Lopez resupplied and revived me. Gecko tagged threats from a distance, and Carter and I pushed the front line while entire buildings, balconies, and trees collapsed around us. For stretches, it felt like playing multiplayer condensed into an intense single-player package.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The town itself kept me on my toes. Enemies poured out of alleys, rooftops, and damaged buildings, but the destruction turned unpredictability into opportunity. Snipers hiding behind cover could be flushed out with grenades or RPGs, and alternate flanking routes allowed me to approach firefights in multiple ways. The level design rewards thinking like a Battlefield player: if the enemy can occupy a space, so can you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The mission culminated in a massive push on City Hall, reminiscent of defending a hard-won capture point in multiplayer. My squad and I held the line against relentless waves while clearing buildings and mopping up remaining enemies. The chaos of the finale mirrored the opening sequence, cementing the sense that the campaign isn’t afraid to keep objectives moving, destruction constant, and action relentless.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">A Great Script</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The other missions I got to play further reinforced this variety. Mission five began with a tense apartment sweep, clearing floors with my squad while using a sledgehammer to break dow n walls. The shootouts were intense and had me checking my corners diligently as my thermal scope helped me spot the pesky PAX in the dimly lit apartment building. This section ended with a shootout between apartment buildings – a bit of a shooting gallery moment as I waited for enemies to pop up so I could take them down, but still enjoyable nonetheless.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Going underground, the squad and I continued to pick off enemies in smoke and dirt-filled tunnels. Luckily, my thermal-scoped rifle was still in my hands, or this mission would've been much tougher. The mission then pivoted hard into a high-speed car chase through subway tunnels. While one of the more scripted moments of my entire preview, it was still fun to live through the spectacle, even if I felt like I didn’t have much control over what was happening. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After a short jaunt through a construction site, the mission reaches its big explosive moment by blowing up New York’s Brooklyn Bridge. The once intact bridge then becomes the final stretch of this mission, as I was then tasked to make my way through the rubble to disable some transmitters. While completely in shambles, I never found myself lost as I made my way through the bridge, and instead got to take in a Levolution moment in a single-player campaign. Again, I know it’s a scripted set piece, but blasting my way through the ruins still felt like an organic way to push the intense moments of the story further. Overall, the fifth mission once again proved that Battlefield Studios is looking to up the ante every moment they can. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Room to Roam</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Mission eight was easily my favorite. Instead of tight corridors, it opened into a semi-open map that gave me room to experiment. Playing as Gecko, the Recon, I had a bomb-dropping drone and a vehicle I could hop in and out of at will. Jumping into a Jeep with my squad beside me immediately brought back Halo vibes, marking the first mission I played that genuinely felt like I could set my own pace. The initial objective was to take out a few SAM sites, and from what I could tell, it seemed like I could approach them in any order – though my limited playtime didn’t let me fully test that freedom.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The sense of choice made the mission really enjoyable. I wasn’t funneled into predetermined vantage points, so it was up to me to drive around and find good positions for my squad to post up and take down enemies. The drone added a whole new layer of strategy. I could get a bird’s-eye view of the battlefield to scout and mark enemies, then rain bombs down until the enemy spotted and destroyed my drone, which would trigger a brief cooldown before I could deploy it again.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Firing missiles from a first-person perspective to take down helicopters and tanks was incredibly satisfying.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The objectives escalated quickly, moving from taking out SAM sites to guiding rockets with the Switchblade system against waves of enemies. Honestly, this part was awesome – I’ll take more Switchblade missions, please. Firing missiles from a first-person perspective to take down helicopters and tanks was incredibly satisfying, and it honestly makes me want a mini-game just for that mechanic.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The mission wrapped up with a climactic firefight across a dam, the drone continuing to add another chaotic layer while letting me choose how to approach combat. There’s even a Battlefield version of a boss encounter, where an enemy helicopter circles the dam and needs to be taken down. This mission isn’t as explosively over-the-top as some of the others, but the freedom it offers makes it stand out, and it still includes some epic set pieces that are genuinely fun to experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After playing these missions, it’s clear that Battlefield 6’s campaign isn’t filler. Battlefield Studios is taking what makes multiplayer memorable – destruction, unpredictable firefights, and meaningful squad dynamics – and trying to translate it into single-player form. And so far, they seem to be right on target. Whether I was storming beaches, chasing trains, or raining fire from a drone, the campaign consistently kept me on my toes and surprised me with new objectives and moments of spectacle. If the full release keeps this momentum, Battlefield 6 could finally deliver a single-player experience worthy of the series’ scale and intensity – something we arguably haven’t seen since the Bad Company days.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-campaign-preview-chaos-destruction-and-surprising-variety]]></content:encoded>

          <p>For decades now, the <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator</em> franchise has been associated with Microsoft's own DOS/Windows operating systems and, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/07/ms-flight-simulator-on-consoles-finally-a-next-gen-game-for-xbox-series-x-s/">more recently</a>, Xbox consoles (weird exceptions like <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/22409/microsoft-flight-simulator/">this 1986 Macintosh port</a> notwithstanding). However, that era seems set to end as Sony <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enWyMpM0k4E">announced during this evening's State of Play livestream</a> that <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</em> will come to the PlayStation 5 on December 8.</p>

<p>The move isn't entirely shocking for modern Microsoft, which has been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/microsoft-says-its-taking-four-unnamed-xbox-games-to-the-other-consoles/">publishing previous Xbox exclusives</a> on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/08/we-run-a-business-why-microsofts-indiana-jones-will-be-on-ps5/">competing consoles</a> in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/do-xbox-owners-have-a-right-to-expect-console-exclusives/">increasing numbers</a> for a while now. And <em>Flight Simulator 2024</em> has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-has-animals-ai-terrain-careers-and-flydoos/">been available on Xbox Series S/X for almost a year now</a>, as the name suggests, giving Xbox owners a "timed exclusive" at least.</p>
<p>Still, it's a bit striking to see a franchise that literally has the Microsoft brand name <em>integrated into its title</em> moving to a major non-Microsoft platform like this. The impact is a little bit like <a href="https://sonic.fandom.com/wiki/Sonic_Advance">seeing a Sonic game on a Nintendo console for the first time in 2001</a>, after years of Sega <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/03/learning-from-history-sega-nintendo-and-the-first-console-war/">selling itself as the anti-Nintendo</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, for Sonic's big move to happen, Sega had to exit the game console business entirely after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/civis/threads/dreamcast-dead-in-march.1024162/">the market failure of the Dreamcast</a>. Now that yet another major Microsoft game franchise is going multiplatform, one has to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/why-microsofts-next-xbox-should-just-run-windows-already/">wonder what the future of the Xbox as a distinct console even looks like</a>.</p>
<figure><p><iframe allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RnC-0BRz2dY?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></iframe></p></figure>
<p>"We run a business," Microsoft's Phil Spencer <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/08/we-run-a-business-why-microsofts-indiana-jones-will-be-on-ps5/">said in a 2024 interview</a>. "[The video game industry] has been growing for a long, long time, and now people are looking for ways to grow. And I think that us, as fans, as players of games, we just have to anticipate there's going to be more change in how some of the traditional ways that games were built and distributed [are] going to change... for all of us."</p>

		<p>So, you know the DualSense controller? That, but Kratos. Or, in other words, take a white DualSense, put a big red stripe down one side and some nice red buttons.&nbsp;That’s all they have done really, and that makes it very annoying that I love it and want one.</p>
<p><iframe title="God of War 20th Anniversary Limited Edition DualSense Controller | PS5" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1Nd0CB7fiIY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>“In honor of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/god-of-war/">God of War</a>’s 20th anniversary this year, we were thrilled by the opportunity to celebrate this milestone with a new DualSense controller design,” said Associate Art Director Dela Longfish from Santa Monica Studio.</p>
<p>“When we were deciding how best to embody the series, we immediately thought the form of the controller lent itself perfectly to Kratos’ omega tattoo. No matter which God of War game you’re playing, the shape of his red ink against the gray of his ash-covered skin is one of the most iconic elements of Kratos’ look across both Greek and Norse sagas. Our team made sure to represent both of these key tones in the color selection for the controller to make every aspect an authentic homage to the design that has defined Kratos for over two decades. ”</p>
<p>“We hope fans enjoy the controller and can’t thank everyone enough for all of the support you’ve shown Santa Monica Studio over the years!”</p>

<p>The God of War 20<sup>th</sup> Anniversary Limited Edition DualSense will be available in limited quantities for a eyebrow raising recommended retail price of $84.99 / €84.99 / £74.99 / ¥12,480. Pre-orders start on October 3, 2025 at 10am local time at <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/">direct.playstation.com</a> (for U.K., France, Germany, Austria, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg) as well as participating retailers globally.</p>
<p>There’s still a couple of months left in the year so maybe we will get something else to celebrate God of War’s 20th birthday. Maybe a look at that highly rumoured next game set in Egypt? Maybe? Please? Go on Sony.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yet another previously Xbox console-exclusive game is making its way to PlayStation, with Microsoft announcing during today's Sony State of Play event that Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 is coming to PS5 on December 8, 2025. What's more is that at some point in 2026, through a free update, the game will also get support to be playable through PS VR2.</p>



<p>Today's announcement confirms what we've been hearing <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-might-be-the-next-xbox-game-coming-to-ps5/">for months now through multiple rumours</a> that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-the-master-chief-collection-playstation-5-switch-2/">next game to make the jump</a> from an Xbox console-exclusive to PS5 would be Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. Even just last week, <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-playstation-5-november/">there was a new rumour circulating</a> that Flight Sim was going to make its PlayStation debut sometime soon.</p>



<p>Now, not only do we know that Flight Simulator 2024 is making the trip, the fact that it'll have PS VR2 support means that potentially, the best way to play Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 on consoles in, say, a year's time (depending on when the update arrives), will be on a PS5 with a PS VR2 headset.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 - Announce Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S5xeNotR5Hw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>"<em>With up to 125 highly detailed aircraft, we have developed the largest and most diverse fleet ever assembled for a flight simulator</em>," writes Jorg Neumann, head of Microsoft Flight Simulator at Xbox Game Studios, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/24/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-soars-onto-ps5-dec-8/">in a PlayStation Blog post</a>.</p>



<p>"<em>We have</em> <em>an incredibly wide range of aircraft: nimble ultralights</em>, <em>a wide variety of general aviation aircraft, famous bush trip planes, rotorcraft, eVTOLs, airships, steerable balloons, all the way to sleek business jets, a fleet of narrow and wide-body airliners and even heavy military transporters and fighter jets</em>."</p>



<p>This new version will also take advantage of the DualSense controllers haptic feedback and adaptive triggers, and it'll come with support for gyro controls to immerse you even more if you don't have a full flight-stick setup.</p>



<p>Now that Flight Simulator is confirmed, and we've already seen the likes of Forza and Gears of War make their way to PlayStation, we're left waiting on games like Starfield, and of course, Halo. At this point, it just feels like it's a matter of time until all of Xbox's first-party games are released on PlayStation a year after they are released on Xbox, if they don't just make them simultaneous releases. </p>

            <p>
Sony and Housemarque's sci-fantasy shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/saros">Saros</a> got its first proper gameplay trailer at PlayStation's latest State of Play this evening. If you were hoping for more <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/returnal">Returnal</a>, then pour yourself a huge brimming flagon of victory mead, for this is basically Returnal plus a gruff male lead, a sunnier shape-shifting wasteland, and a force shield that converts attacks into juice for your biggest guns.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Do people drink victory mead in the world of Saros? This is not a question answered by the trailer. Instead, we're treated to a series of agile bangfights with enemies of all shapes and sizes. Some are robotic. Some are skull-themed. Some have more arms than seems strictly necessary. Some are large enough to give Kratos the cold sweats. See that Sony? Did you a cheeky bit of license cross-pollination there.

<p>
As in Returnal - a game that took Housemarque's shmup pedigree and applied it to a third-person roguelike shooter - most of these creatures are partial to spewing the most fantastically patterned fusillades of energy projectiles. It's as though somebody had sneezed while downing their victory mead, and skilfully angled their lips and nostrils to produce a crowd-pleasing firework effect, rather than an excruciating faux pas. If you dislike being sneezed on by cosmic goblins, the game's horizontal dash looks very effective providing you manage its cooldown. 
</p><p>
The trailer blurb recaps the story premise. In Saros you play Arjun Devraj, voiced by Rajul Kohli. He's a Soltari enforcer exploring the lost colony of Carcosa in the face of an eclipse that causes the landscape to shapeshift. I don't find Devraj that compelling as a character so far, but he's got a cool coat so we'll call it even Stevens. There are also some sad holographic people you can query about Carcosa's plight.
</p>
<p>
The key differences I can see over Returnal are 1) that energy shield, which also comes in handy up against laser beam traps and the like, and 2) a Second Chance revive mechanic, which sees Devraj slamming his fist into the ground and resurrecting in sheer petulance at having accidentally taken 400 bullets to the jaw. Housemarque have been keen to emphasise that this is a gentler roguelike than Returnal, with "permanent resources and progression making every death valuable". See also the tagline, "Come back stronger". 
</p>
<p>
All we need now is a PC release date. The thing I'd most like to hear about next is the bestiary. I adored Returnal's lore writing. I thought the 3D bullet hell stuff was bonkers, too, but mostly I'm here for knotty descriptions of exceedingly odd fauna.
</p>
<p>
<em>Disclosure: RPS co-founder Alec Meer wrote for Returnal and is the lead writer on Saros.</em>

            <p>
After four whole years of silence, PlayStation and Insomniac have very graciously offered up a new trailer for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvels-wolverine">Marvel's Wolverine</a>. With gameplay no less! Horrifically gruesome, violent, and bloody gameplay that is so intense you should probably give it 15 minutes or so if you've just had your supper.
</p>
<p>
Right, here's what's important. Combat looks like it'll be borrowing from Spider-Man, which itself borrows from the Arkham series, as in that sort of rhythmic punching kind of thing, albeit with a lot more slicing and dicing. I'm talking claws up the skull, claws cutting off limbs, claws ripping bodies apart. A lot of claw action! Edwin also wanted me to make sure I mention how "sad and tender his eyes look while he's slicing peoples' elbows off," because there was a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBib2xkYfE4">behind the scenes featurette</a> shown after the trailer that more or less pointed out just that.
</p>

</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3pDMUWlA6I" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>


<p>
This featurette also confirmed who'll be playing Insomniac's Wolverine: Liam McIntyre, an Australian actor who is no stranger to superhero stuff (he was in the TV version of The Flash) or video games (he played JD Fenix in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gears-of-war-4">Gears of War 4</a>). I'm sure someone will have some kind of complaint about this portrayal of the character, but he does have the iconic yellow suit at least.
</p><p>
You'll also learn about how there's some dedicated blood tech made for this game, which makes sense considering just how much of the stuff they packed into just two minutes of gameplay. Mr. Wolverine will also be a bit of a jet setter, as the game will take him to both the Canadian wilderness and Japan.
</p>
<p>
There'll be some familiar comic book faces too, as Mystique made an appearance (arguably a more interesting protagonist for a game mechanically, but I digress), as well as Omega Red. Apparently there's some hints for other characters too, you'll have to wait for the "Top 10 Things You Missed In The Wolverine Gameplay Trailer" video that some YouTuber will push out by tomorrow to get a headstart on that SEO.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and there's a release window too! It'll be coming in the northern hemisphere's fall, 2026, but it is worth noting that's just on PS5. A PC release is all but guaranteed given that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-s-spider-man">Marvel's Spider-Man</a> 1 and 2 have both received one, just a good while after their initial releases. There's another look at the game coming in spring too, so for now, just enjoy Wolverine's grunting and screaming and all the mess he makes. Again, seriously, don't eat anything while watching this.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Classic sci-fi immersive sim <em>Deus Ex</em> is returning with a fresh coat of paint and updated features, compliments of Aspyr. The remaster about a futuristic society crumbling beneath the weight of feckless governments and wild conspiracy theories arrives at a hell of a time.</p> <p>“Question Everything. Trust No One,” reads the tagline to a game with many fans, including billionaire Elon Musk. <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1321245225755512832">He called the original “one of the best games ever” in 2020</a>. This new remaster promises visual upgrades and quality-of-life improvements similar to Aspyr’s existing HD remasters of the <em>Tomb Raider</em> games. Hopefully,&nbsp; <em>Deus Ex Remastered</em> will be the definitive way to replay one of the most important games of the century. At least it will make the PC version accessible on console. The PS2 version, <em>Deus Ex: The Conspiracy</em>, joined PS Plus earlier this year.</p>  <p>The irony of Elon Musk’s love for the game has haunted it in recent years. One of the game’s original writers, Austin Grossman, called it the immersive sim’s “worst legacy” <a href="https://kotaku.com/elon-musk-favorite-game-deus-ex-conspiracy-2000624003">in an interview earlier this month</a>.</p>

 <p>“That kind of political weight and social satire is a real common thread between&nbsp;<em>Deus Ex</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Dishonored</em>,” Grossman, who co-wrote the Warren Spector-directed hit with Sheldon Pacotti and Chris Todd, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/deus-exs-influence-on-elon-musk-may-be-its-longest-worst-legacy-says-its-writer/">recently told&nbsp;<em>PC Gamer</em></a>. “It is the thing that Elon Musk likes, creepily. It is creepily in Elon Musk’s worldview. So that may be its longest, worst legacy.”</p> <p>Musk has been a lifelong gamer with a notorious career as an amateur Quake player back in college. Last year, however, <a href="https://kotaku.com/elon-musk-poe2-diablo-4-paid-boosting-fake-controversy-1851743670">he was caught cheating at games like <em>Diablo 4</em> and <em>Path of Exiles 2</em></a> by allegedly paying other people to boost his accounts. Trust no one, indeed.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/state-of-play-playstation-5-sony-stream-youtube-twitch-2000628258</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/everything-we-saw-at-today%E2%80%99s-playstation-state-of-play-showcase.1307811/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>PlayStation and friends put together a thankfully brief State of Play presentation that streamed on the company’s Twitch and YouTube channels. Ahead of the show, we knew we’d be seeing more of <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-state-of-play-date-time-where-to-watch-2000627924">Housemarque’s new Rahul Kohli-led action game <em>S</em><em>aros</em></a>, but we didn’t know what would take up the other 30 minutes of the 35-minute showcase. If you didn’t get a chance to watch live, you can watch the VOD here, or scroll down to get all the highlights.</p>  <h2><em>Saros</em></h2>  <p><em>Saros </em>kicked off the show with a new gameplay trailer showcasing its fast-paced, momentum-driven shooter mechanics. Kohli’s character has a ton of mobility options to jump and zip around the battlefield, shooting and stabbing a wide spread of vicious beasties. There’s some gesturing at the story here, but all I can really gather is that the main character is searching for a woman in this alien hellscape. The game is coming to PS5 on March 20, 2026.</p> <h2><em>Zero Parades for Dead Spies</em></h2>  <p>Next up is <em>Zero Parades, </em>ZA/UM’s follow-up to <em>Disco Elysium</em>. The game was originally announced at Gamescom Opening Night Live, but was only confirmed for PC at the time. So now we know it’s coming to PS5.</p>

 <h2><em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</em></h2>  <p>First thing I had to do was make sure that there wasn’t a&nbsp;<em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2025</em> and that Microsoft wasn’t deliberately giving PlayStation an out-of-date version of its flight sim. That would have been funny in a petty kind of way. <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024&nbsp;</em>is coming to PS5 on December 8.</p>

 <h2><em>Battlefield 6</em></h2>  <p><em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>is just a couple of weeks away from its October 10 release date, so it makes sense Sony and EA would want to get the game in front of people in one more showcase. A lot of the leadup to launch has focused on the multiplayer, so it’s good that we got a quick glimpse of its dramatic campaign here.</p>

 <h2><em>Deus Ex Remastered</em></h2>  <p>One of the first real surprises of the show was&nbsp;<em>Deus Ex Remastered</em>, a revamped version of the beloved RPG. The original <em>Deus Ex&nbsp;</em>is celebrating its 25th anniversary this year, and to celebrate, Eidos Montreal and Aspyr are sprucing up the game for modern platforms. The remaster is coming to PlayStation 5 on February 5.</p>

 <h2><em>Halloween</em></h2>  <p>We also got a new look at the asymmetrical&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight</em>-like&nbsp;<em>Halloween&nbsp;</em>game, though it won’t be out by the holiday. The game is set to launch on PS5 on September 8, 2026.</p>

 <h2><em>Last Epoch</em></h2>  <p>Next up we got confirmation that dungeon-crawling RPG <em>Last Epoch&nbsp;</em>is leaving PC exclusivity behind and coming to PS5. The game’s first expansion, <em>Orobyss</em>, will also launch the same day the game hits the console.</p> <h2><em>The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin</em></h2>  <p><em>The Seven Deadly Sins: Origins&nbsp;</em>is an upcoming open-world game based on the anime of the same name. It’s coming to PS5 on January 28.</p> <h2><em>Sonic Racing: Crossworlds</em></h2>  <p>After leaking ahead of time, Sega announced the <em>Mega Man&nbsp;</em>DLC characters coming to&nbsp;<em>Sonic Racing: Crossworlds</em>. Mega Man and Proto Man will be added to the roster alongside a Dr. Wily’s Castle-themed track next year.</p>

 <h2><em>Nioh 3</em></h2>  <p>Koei Tecmo grabbed the mic for two back-to-back announcements. First, the company showed off a new look at <em>Nioh 3 </em>and announced the action game will come to PS5 on February 6. This was followed by the announcement that a <em>Dynasty Warriors 3 </em>remaster is coming. <em>Dynasty Warriors 3: Complete Edition Remastered </em>will hit PS5 on March 19.</p> <h2><em>Code Vein II</em></h2>  <p>Bandai Namco showed a new trailer for it’s upcoming action RPG <em>Code Vein</em> II, because who doesn’t want another soulslike in their backlog? The game will launch on PS5 on January 30.</p>

 <h2><em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</em></h2> <p>Square Enix showed up to remind you that <em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles&nbsp;</em>is imminent. But who needs a new trailer when you can read <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-review-ivalice-chronicles-2000628040"><em>Kotaku</em>‘s review?</a> The game is coming to PS4 and PS5 on September 30.</p> <h2><em>Let It Die: Inferno</em></h2>  <p>Another fun surprise in the showcase was&nbsp;<em>Let It Die: Inferno</em>, a sequel to the cult classic action game from Grasshopper Manufacture. That’s refreshing given the only follow-up we got previously was a battle royale game back in 2022. <em>Inferno&nbsp;</em>is coming to PS5 on December 3.</p> <h2><em>Chronoscript: The Endless End</em></h2>  <p>Next up is&nbsp;<em>Chronoscript: The Endless End</em>, a sidescrolling action platformer about a man that is trapped within the pages of books. The game will launch on PS5 next year.</p>

 <h2><em>Crimson Desert</em></h2>  <p><em>Crimson Desert</em>, one of the only games to <a href="https://kotaku.com/crimson-desert-preview-summer-game-fest-sgf-action-rpg-1851784440">make me crash out at a preview event</a>, was given a new trailer that included a release date. The action game will come to PS5 on March 19.</p> <h2>Pulse speakers</h2>  <p>If you’re in the market for new home theater speakers, Pulse is releasing PlayStation-branded ones that are compatible with your PS5, PC, Mac, and even your PlayStation Portal. They’ll be available in black or white next year.</p> <h2>PlayStation Plus</h2>  <p>Next we got a brief check-in on the games coming to PlayStation Plus soon. In addition to those mentioned in the trailer above, they will also include <em>The Last of Us Part II Remastered</em> for <em>The Last of Us</em> Day, the annual celebration of Naughty Dog’s post-apocalyptic series, which lands on Friday of this week.</p> <h2><em>Gran Turismo 7</em></h2>  <p>For the racing sim fans in the room, we got a new announcement for&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7</em>. The racing game’s Spec III update is coming in December, and it will include two new tracks, eight vehicles, a data logging feature and “much more.”</p>

 <h2><em>God of War&nbsp;</em>anniversary controller</h2>  <p>Sony announced a limited edition DualSense controller to celebrate&nbsp;<em>God of War</em>‘s 20th anniversary. It is mostly white, but includes the red streak Kratos has on his face on the righthand side.</p> <h2><em>Wolverine</em></h2>  <p>Wrapping up the show was the first <a href="https://kotaku.com/wolverine-ps5-insomniac-games-leak-rhysida-hack-sony-1851111188">officially sanctioned</a> gameplay of&nbsp;<em>Marvel’s Wolverine</em>, the next superhero game from Insomniac, who also developed the acclaimed&nbsp;<em>Spider-Man&nbsp;</em>games on PS4 and PS5. The trailer is action packed, has some cameos from other&nbsp;<em>X-Men&nbsp;</em>characters like the transforming mutant Mystique and some of the mutant-hunting Sentinels, and looks pretty friggin’ dope. <em>Spartacus </em>actor Liam McIntyre will play the titular hero when&nbsp;<em>Wolverine </em>comes&nbsp;to PS5 in 2026.</p>

You’re a brilliant but tormented operant on a desperate assignment. Pick up the pieces of your broken network, untangle a bloody web of intrigue at the End of History, and prove yourself on the big stage or blow it all up—again.</p><p><strong>A Spy Like No Other</strong></p><p>Brilliant, burnt-out, possibly cursed—you play as operant Hershel Wilk, alias CASCADE. Five years ago you led your team into the abyss and have been haunted by your failures ever since. Now you’ve been recalled for a mysterious assignment that may give you a chance to prove yourself again.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Welcome to the End of History</strong></p><p>Find yourself thrown into a three-way struggle for cultural and ideological power, played out across an unforgettable new city. In ZERO PARADES, the world itself is a character with its own secrets, traumas, and miracles for you to discover.</p><p><strong>Trust is a Volatile Plaything</strong></p><p>To get anywhere in this world, you’ll need friends. Unfortunately, you don’t have any. Instead, you’ll go up against international bankers, foreign techno-fascists, psychic doppelgängers, a paranoid TV presenter, a man with a box for a heart, and dozens more. Everyone you meet has their own agendas, beliefs, and secrets for you to uncover and turn to your own ends.</p><p><strong>Make It Up as You Go Along</strong></p><p>In this line of work you’re going to fail *way* more often than you succeed. That much is expected of you. What matters is how you pick yourself back up. As an operant, your dice are in the hand of fate. If they don’t go your way (and they won’t), you’ll have to improvise and hope the consequences are ones you can live with.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Become an Anti-Icon</strong> – Play as Hershel—brilliant, relentless, magnetic… and cursed. A former top operant whose touch turns everything to ash. She is as dangerous to her enemies as she is to her friends.</li><li><strong>Espionage Reinvented</strong> – Descend into a world of bootleg mind-erasure, failed space programmes, and state-sponsored pop stars. This is espionage stripped of glamour—no parades, no happy endings – at least probably not for you.</li><li><strong>Failing Forward</strong> – In the life of an operant, failure is inevitable. Here, it’s another way forward – every misstep opens doors that success would run swiftly by.</li><li><strong>A Story-Rich Espionage RPG</strong> – From the studio which brought you <em>Disco Elysium</em>. Blending the psychological depth of a spy novel with surrealist undertones and richly drawn characters.</li><li><strong>A <a title="Companies > Question [7 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/question">Question</a> of Identity</strong> – Who are you when no one is watching?

                <p dir="ltr">Recently, I attended EA's digital preview event for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield 6</a>'s single-player campaign. This event gave me access to three full campaign missions, which collectively highlighted a wide variety of environments and mission types. From storming the beaches of Gibraltar in tanks to gritty close-quarters fights in New York City, the preview contained everything you'd expect from a Battlefield campaign: iconic weaponry, grounded military-style aesthetics, and no shortage of explosions and destruction.</p><p dir="ltr">Battlefield 6's campaign takes place in 2027 after NATO gets reduced to shambles, and a private military corporation known as Pax Armata has risen to power. This corporation's attempts to further accumulate power threaten to send the world into global conflict. The story follows members of the elite US Marine raiders unit known as Dagger 1-3 as they fight against Pax Armata's forces on a global scale. During this hands-on session, I played missions set in Gibraltar, the United States, and Tajikistan.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> 6 Minutes of Battlefield 6 Single Player Campaign Gameplay</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">I was first introduced to Battlefield 6's third campaign mission, Operation Gladus. This part of the story takes place in the city of Gibraltar, which is a British Overseas Territory located at the southern tip of the Iberian Peninsula. The mission began with our arrival by water to reach the beaches of Gibraltar, as Pax Armata had seized control of the city. The historic rock of Gibraltar was on my left as we reached land, and it was a stunning view despite the low graphics settings my laptop needed to use.</p><p dir="ltr">My role was an engineer inside a tank, and I was tasked with providing covering fire to my fellow soldiers storming the beach. Pax Armata's forces had set up an outpost with trenches and other fortifications, but my tank's artillery fire easily laid waste to their structures. There was a lot of gunfire, explosions, and smoke as I worked to destroy their forces. I had a blast as I flattened everything on that beach, and it was exactly the type of destruction you'd expect while playing Battlefield--perhaps even greater than what we've typically seen in the campaigns.</p><p dir="ltr">Once we cleared the outpost, we fought on foot through the narrow city streets of Gibraltar. I closely followed a friendly tank to help make repairs, because the class roles are still utilized in the campaign and should help new players get acclimated to Battlefield's class-based roles. The tank wasn't going to move and progress the mission if it was too damaged.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4574104-operationgladus.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4574104" data-ratio="0.56234567901235" data-width="1620" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4574104-operationgladus.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4574104"></a><figcaption>The tank's destruction in Operation Gladus</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4574104-operationgladus.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">I was also armed with an RPG and a grenade launcher, so I tried to cause some destruction of my own, but the damage I could inflict was more minimal within the city streets. I could destroy chunks of buildings, but I couldn't level the whole area like I did with the beach outpost. However, I did repair the tank just in time to see it blow a huge building in half, which was satisfying to watch.</p><p dir="ltr">The next mission I played was called No Sleep, and the objective was to locate and breach Pax Armata's Brooklyn Headquarters. This part of the campaign was set in New York at nighttime, so I was equipped with night-vision goggles and a rifle with a thermal scope. This mission had a dark and gritty vibe, as I worked through the streets and apartment buildings of New York City with my squad. Enemy soldiers were waiting for us at every turn, making for tense close-quarters fights.</p><p dir="ltr">This mission also let me wield Battlefield 6's sledgehammer melee weapon, which is a new way to destroy things in the game. You can take out walls, doors, and even floors with the sledgehammer in multiplayer, but the destruction did seem limited in this part of the story campaign. I couldn't bash holes in the floors of the apartment buildings we breached, but I could smash through enemy cover, bust out entire walls, and even completely demolish an entire bathroom. Bashing bathroom fixtures wasn't necessary for the mission, but I still wanted to see if it's possible, and I was pleased to see that it is.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4574112-evenmoredestructioninnosleep.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4574112" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4574112-evenmoredestructioninnosleep.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4574112"></a><figcaption>Demolishing walls in the No Sleep mission</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4574112-evenmoredestructioninnosleep.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4574107-bombdroneinoperationemberstrike.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4574108-destoryingwallsinnosleepmission.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4574109-nosleepmission.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4574110-operationemberstrikehydrodam.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4574111-operationemberstrike.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4574107,1300-4574108,1300-4574109,1300-4574110,1300-4574111" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394540/4574107-bombdroneinoperationemberstrike.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394540/4574108-destoryingwallsinnosleepmission.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394540/4574109-nosleepmission.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394540/4574110-operationemberstrikehydrodam.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394540/4574111-operationemberstrike.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4574107-bombdroneinoperationemberstrike.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4574108-destoryingwallsinnosleepmission.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4574109-nosleepmission.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4574110-operationemberstrikehydrodam.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4574111-operationemberstrike.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Following the raid on the Brooklyn HQ, my squad and I ended up underground and hunting Pax Armata troops. This part of the mission provided a thrilling chase--you seemingly can't have a military shooter campaign without some kind of vehicle-chase segment. We hijacked a vehicle to chase down enemies, who were fleeing on a train inside an old New York subway tunnel. Again, this mission had plenty of intense action-movie-style moments and close-quarters engagements. Despite the short break I took to practice my apartment demolition skills, there was always a sense of tension and urgency during No Sleep, and this was my favorite of the three missions I previewed.</p><p dir="ltr">Lastly, I played Operation Ember Strike. This was the most open and free-roaming mission I experienced, as it took place across a spacious countryside in Tajikistan. I was a soldier in the recon role who was equipped with a sniper rifle and a lethal drone. This drone allowed me to locate and mark nearby enemies as well as drop bombs to clear out vehicles and enemy forces.</p><p dir="ltr">The playable area for Operation Ember Strike was fairly large, and we had three surface-to-air missile sites to destroy. These were spread out across the land, with the freedom to take them out in any order. There were alarms at each site, and they could be disabled to avoid reinforcements, so I assume this was a mission I could've taken slow and stealthy, but I went in guns blazing and bullied my way to each SAM site. Eventually, we destroyed all our targets, and experienced one of the more impressive scenes of the preview, with the destruction of Tajikistan's hydroelectric dam. The dam was destroyed, and a dramatic cutscene ensued to show Pax Armata's forces were getting washed away as they tried to flee.</p><p dir="ltr">From what I played, Battlefield 6 isn't doing anything revolutionary with its single-player campaign. It's the sort of modern military shooter filled with Hollywood-style set pieces you'd expect, but it's so well-executed that I still enjoyed my time. We aren't yet able to comment on the narrative, which could help to better distinguish the campaign. However those details may shake out, it's shaping up to be a campaign filled with tanks, jets, fiery explosions, over-the-top action, and the type of satisfying destruction you tend to only see while playing Battlefield. That's enough to get me excited to play and destroy more when it launches on October 10.</p>

The game takes place in a dark fantasy world where humans coexist among undead, vampiric beings known as Revenants. A mysterious, malevolent force, the Luna Rapacis, is transforming Revenants into rampaging monstrosities. Your custom-created protagonist character teams up with a time-bending young woman named Lou to discover the origin of the Luna Rapacis and stop the world's decay.</p><p>Time-travel and exploration will be important elements of gameplay, as will the series' unique "blood action" combat skills. You'll be able to customize many aspects of your player character, from appearance to skills and weaponry--including two new weapons, Rune Blades and Dual Swords. Also new are the "Forma" skills that generate a variety of powerful effects: thus far, we've seen the Motorcycle Forma and the Absolute Execution Sword, debuting in this trailer.</p>

Those looking to ring in the new year with style will be happy to know the upcoming Soulslike action game is coming on January 30.</p><p>A new trailer was revealed during today's PlayStation State of Play, showing off protagonist Tokugawa Takechiyo, forced from the shogunate throne, who confronts his rebellious brother Tokugawa Kunimatsu in battle. The time-traveling adventure takes players across multiple eras to hunt monsters called Horrors, where players can change the fates of key characters as they slice and dice enemies using the game's unique blood-draining combat system. You can also join forces with various allies who lend unique abilities to the fight.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EkajrffHLVo"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EkajrffHLVo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Code Vein II will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on January 30.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/state-of-play/2025/09/24/new-code-vein-ii-trailer-reveals-its-coming-in-january]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/inside-the-soulframe-scene-where-you-go-inside-a-bear.1307781/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>What is <em>Soulframe</em>, exactly? It’s more than just fantasy <em>Warframe</em>, with an open overworld and more measured combat than the latter’s high-flying space ninja antics. It’s not a <em>Souls</em>-like, either; difficulty is manageable, and the name is more of a coincidence than anything else. During TennoCon earlier this year, I even heard a developer refer to <em>Soulframe </em>as a “secret cozy game.” </p><p>After spending a dozen or so hours with its alpha version, I don’t know if I’d go that far – combat is still your primary means of engaging with the world – but it does focus on stories of redemption, tales that wrap around to being uplifting in their own way. One begins by introducing players to a bear. Then things get weird in a way that might be a first for any game, regardless of genre.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l3AMSDUTI4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The quest</a>, coming to the alpha “Preludes” version of <em>Soulframe </em>later this year, drips with whimsy, weirdness, and toward the end, ursine intestinal fluid. After subduing a bear-shaped forest keeper corrupted by the environment-destroying influence of the game’s primary enemy faction, you send your Floppet – basically a winged rat – inside it to excise the source of the corruption. The moment comes more or less out of nowhere, a reminder that, yep, this is a game from the people who made <em>Warframe</em>.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Soulframe | TennoCon 2025 Preludes Gameplay" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4l3AMSDUTI4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>But how do you model a bear’s esophagus and stomach for exploratory purposes? Where do you even start?</p><p>“I searched online for images of bear throats and any other variant available,” <em>Soulframe </em>lead environment artist Enrico Santi told Aftermath. “It’s tricky because there are not as many images of a bear's throat as one would think. So you have to use what resources are available, like the throats of other creatures: humans, for example, and whatnot. You have to trust your instincts as an artist to make the iterations that feel visually in line with the overall aesthetic.”&nbsp;</p><p>“There is a running gag that I watched over 40 hours of bear colonoscopy videos,” he added. “It was not the case, unfortunately.”</p><p><em>Soulframe</em>’s world is one in which a flying rat can venture inside the oozing body of a fucked-up bear and emerge out the back end unscathed beyond a need to cough up what I can only describe as “fart fumes,” so you will not be surprised to learn that Santi took some creative liberties with the bear’s internal structure.</p><p>"When it comes to making levels for games, you have to 'find the fun' first, so usually we will change things up even if they don't really make sense, as long as it's fun to play and look at,” said Santi. “As for the grossness, yeah, that’s sometimes a part of the fun, believe it or not. The stomach material was some fleshy monstrosity I put together, and then the bumpiness in the stomach was all thanks to [principal environmental artist] Declan Hart, who came in last minute and gave it a real nice facelift."</p><p>While striking, the sequence only lasts a minute or so. Despite this, the <em>Soulframe </em>team refused to phone it in.</p><p>"It was a tricky 'level,' I guess you could call it,” said Santi. “You spend so little time in there, but it still has to be interesting. I think the stomach went through four or five different iterations, while the throat was pretty much good to go at the second version. Everything is one constant big iteration; you rarely ever see a level or piece of content that survives the first draft."</p><p>Looking at pictures of and then spending dozens of hours inside meticulously rendered bear guts, you’d think, would make one’s own guts churn, but Santi is not just any person. His family found themselves caught up in a civil war in Sierra Leone when he was very young, which he says has given him a “unique” perspective.</p><p>"My parents and I survived by pure luck, and I don't fully remember everything that happened, but I do have flashes of some of the things I saw,” Santi said. “The rest were stories I found online or [that] were told to me by my parents. So in a way, I was basically desensitized at a very young age. I think because of that experience, I am less likely to react to more authentic imagery. … Even when I worked on <em>Call of Duty WWII</em>, the character team used pictures of real cadavers from that war for their work, and a lot of them had a hard time creating those assets. But to me, it was just a part of my life from long ago that I have since reconciled with."</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/kiss-or-die-netflix-review-comedy-variety-tv-yakuza-like-a-dragon"><h3>Netflix’s Kiss Or Die Is Yakuza’s Cringiest Eroge Substory Turned Into A Full-Blown Variety Show</h3></a><p>A sketch show with comedians, AV actresses, and a high-budget production that's more insufferable than entertaining</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ea-skate-review-impressions"><h3>No Thank You</h3></a><p>'I would rather lick the paint off my door than see another lootbox screen'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/roblox-charlie-kirk-recreations"><h3>Why Major Events Like Charlie Kirk’s Death End Up On Roblox</h3></a><p>'It’s impossible to know who’s doing it for the lulls and the clicks and who’s doing it because they’re radicalizing'</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/soulframe-bear-stomach-interview-digital-extremes]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Tucked away in the State of Play stream was the confirmation of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PS Plus</a> Monthly Games line up for October 2025, with Sony bringing a fantastic horror game to the table for the spookiest month of the year. Have you seen Alan lately?</p>
<p><span>What are the PS Plus October 2025 Monthly Games?</span></p>


<p>It’s quirky indie month on PS Plus and these games will be available from Tuesday, 7th October</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Alan Wake 2&nbsp;</strong> | PS5</li>
<li><strong>Goat Simulator 3</strong> | PS4, PS5</li>
<li><strong>Cocoon&nbsp;</strong> | PS4, PS5</li>
</ul>
<p><iframe title="PlayStation Plus - Game Catalog for 2025 | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r1X6lPM-0qI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a> is a great headliner for this month’s PS Plus games. After a thirteen year wait, Remedy returned to the setting of one of their most beloved games, but took a distinctly more horror-tinged tone compared to the Xbox 360 original. Still, that totally worked for us. Nick gave it a glowing 10/10, and said:</p>

<p><em>“Just as it gives equal screen time to its two protagonists, Alan Wake 2 is a fine blend of equal parts narrative and survival horror. Both aspects are brought together in brilliant fashion to create a game that is going to mess with your head, scare the hell out of you and make you grin about it as you plunge forward once more, eager to see what’s next.”</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Alan Wake 2 Review –&nbsp;Worth the wait" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qi7NHf15a5I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>How do you top that? Well, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/cocoon">Cocoon</a> is a simply sublime little puzzle adventure with worlds nested in worlds. It’s “a beautiful experience that marries a gorgeous aesthetic with increasingly complex puzzles that really push you to experiment with the game’s mechanics,” Steve said in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/13/cocoon-review/">our review</a>. “Whilst it isn’t a long or excessively challenging game, I would urge you to absorb yourselves in its dimension-hopping delights.”</p>

<p>And then you can go all the way into the left field for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/goat-simulator-3">Goat Simulator 3</a>, the latest entry in the meme-able game series. The game launched back in 2022, with Pilgor the goat going on many an adventure which, through DLC, has included some dimension hopping of its own.</p>
<h2>Can you still get the September 2025 PS Plus games?</h2>
<p>Yes! You’ve got until Monday 6th Ocober September to claim your PS Plus games, which include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Viewfinder&nbsp;</strong> | PS5, PS4</li>

</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/27/septembers-2025-ps-plus-games-include-psychonauts-2/">Head here for the full skinny </a>on that.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Here’s your first look at Marvel’s Wolverine for PS5!]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/24/wolverine-ps5-trailer/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/here%E2%80%99s-your-first-look-at-marvel%E2%80%99s-wolverine-for-ps5.1307769/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>We finally have an official look at Marvel’s Wolverine, and it looks very faithful with a shorter, stocky Wolverine clawing everyone to death with tonnes of visceral violence.&nbsp; That said, he’s still being played by an Australian with Liam McIntyre taking on the roll.</p>
<p>“In this story, he is on the hunt to uncover the secrets of a dark past that keeps eluding him. Unfortunately, in this world, he’ll have to dig his claws deep to pull any shred of information that may lead to answers. Often, that means shredding into a relentless onslaught of enemies who aim to stop him by any means necessary,” say Insomniac.</p>
<p><iframe title="Marvel’s Wolverine - Gameplay Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s3pDMUWlA6I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Insomniac explains that they have put a lot of detail into the game, going so far as to create a new blood system flowing over the pores in Logan’s face. In the trailer you can also see other familiar faces including Mystique and Omega Red,&nbsp; and locations include Canada, Japan, and Madripoor.</p>
<p>More of the game will be revealed in Spring 2026, and it will be out around a year from now in Fall 2026.</p>

<p>Marvel’s Wolverine is being directed by Brian Horton (creative director) and Cameron Christian (game director), who were in charge of Spider-Man: Miles Morales and they have&nbsp;enlisted Walt D. Williams as story lead over at Insomniac Games. For those who don’t recognise the name, Williams worked as narrative director on 2012’s controversial <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/spec-ops-the-line/">Spec Ops: The Line</a>.</p>
<p>Why should gamers be excited for this news? Firstly, it underlines Insomniac’s intent to make Marvel’s Wolverine a game with a darker storyline, the developer having previously stated that it was aiming for a more mature tone compared to Marvel’s Spider-Man.</p>
<p>Aside from being a challenging third-person shooter with some interesting quirks, Spec Ops: The Line went rogue with its brutal, mind-being plot. Taking inspiration from Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness (which also heavily influenced Apocalypse Now) the campaign saw three elite operatives infiltrate a ravaged Dubai to thwart a rogue U.S colonel in the midst of a sandstorm. It’s been almost a decade since the game launched on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC, though we still remember the controversial white phosphorous scene as well as the four potential endings.</p>
