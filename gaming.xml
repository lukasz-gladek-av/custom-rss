<p>Lee Sang-hyeok, more commonly known as ‘Faker’, has received the highest possible merit that athletes can achieve in South Korea. He was recently awarded the Cheongnyong Medal of the Order of Sport Merit, bestowed upon him by the nation’s president, Lee Jae-myung.</p>



<p>This medal recognizes Faker’s decade of contributions to the esports industry, maintaining a name as the most dominant League of Legends player ever to emerge. He’s the first esports competitor in history to secure a spot in the prestigious line-up of medal recipients.</p>







<h2 id="h-faker-recognized-in-new-year-s-ceremony">Faker Recognized in New Year’s Ceremony</h2>



<p>Faker was invited to the State Guest House in Cheong Wa Dae to receive his Cheongnyong Medal, recognizing his dedication and evolution in the esports industry over the last ten years.</p>



<p>For just over a decade, Faker has been dominating the League of Legends space, and has secured more world titles than any ofther competitor in the business. He has secured records in the domestic space in South Korea and has become synonymous with the ongoing success of the esports industry.</p>



<p>Many have dubbed Faker ‘the GOAT’ of esports.</p>



<p>Speaking after the medal ceremony, Faker said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s an enormous personal honor to receive a decoration that represents the Republic of Korea. But I could not be standing here without the teammates and colleagues who have run alongside me up to this point.</p>



<p>This would have been impossible without the support of the fans who are always there giving me strength. I will continue to devote myself with my best effort in every moment, both in and out of competition, so that I can share positive messages and help raise the stature of Korean esports.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In social circles, Faker is seen as an eternal ‘good guy’ who never fails to deliver. He’s a stalwart competitor but also a wholesome, charitable, and polite individual who takes his success in his stride.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Todd Howard Showed No Interest in Fallout 4’s Most Impressive Mod]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/todd-howard-no-interest-fallout-4-mod-london/</link>
            <guid>1396324</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In July 2024, Fallout: London was released after years of development. The game-sized mod represented one of the most ambitious and long-awaited conversion projects in the history of the Fallout franchise, and it was very well received by fans worldwide. Owing to the size and stature of Fallout: London, it garnered quite a cult following over the years.</p>



<p>However, one of the people who perhaps <strong>should </strong>have been interested in it but <strong>wasn’t </strong>was Bethesda Game Studios’ Todd Howard. In a recent interview, Howard revealed that he hasn’t played and never really followed Fallout: London, arguably the biggest Fallout 4 mod ever created and a transformative, mighty project.</p>







<h2 id="h-todd-howard-plays-it-safe-with-fallout-london">Todd Howard Plays it Safe with Fallout: London</h2>



<p>The driving theory behind Todd Howard’s apparent disinterest in Fallout: London is that he was hampered from praising the project by legal conditions. It’s no big secret that mods walk a grey area when it comes to legitimacy and IP infringement, but they’re part and parcel of the Bethesda landscape regardless.</p>



<p>If Todd Howard started gushing over Fallout: London, he’d have netizens taking to social media the world over to declare the mod canon, or something.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fallout4london/comments/1q03rsp/todd_howard_on_fallout_london/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent interview</a> hosted to celebrate the launch of Fallout’s second season, Todd Howard was asked about his interest in the Fallout: London mod, but the recognizable developer played coy:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Only some videos that I’ve seen online; I have not played it.</p>



<p>Only a little bit. I would say we look at a lot of the modding that’s going on, and when you have those total conversions – I just want to say how <em>hard </em>that is.</p>



<p>And so, the fact that it came out, first of all, because most of those never come out, and the fact that it came out… It seems a lot of fans love it.</p>



<p>It’s just – I need to express to everybody out there how difficult and what a journey that is for some of these big mod teams to do stuff like that.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It also doesn’t help that he’s probably so busy he’s lucky ever to scrape a few hours playing <strong>any </strong>Fallout game, modded or otherwise.</p>



<p>Fallout: London represents what’s possible when a team of dozens pours resources, time, money, and effort into creating a passion project and turning it into something tangible and wholly accepted by a community. It’s one of the single-biggest mods in the gaming space, and it takes Fallout 4 and manipulates it into something otherworldly.</p>



<p>Team FOLON, the folks behind the mod, did such a good job that one or two of them were ultimately <strong>hired </strong>by Bethesda Game Studios.</p>



<p>When it launched, it was hosted on GOG and was downloaded a whopping 500,000 times in 24 hours, and in 2025, a <strong>VR version </strong>of the mod surfaced. If that wasn’t enough, more than a year after release, an expansion called Rabbit and Pork dropped, fuelling more interest in the mod.</p>

              <p>Matt Firor founded Zenimax Online in 2007 and helped Bethesda shepherd<em> The Elder Scrolls Online</em> into one of the premier MMORPGs out there. He left abruptly last summer when Microsoft laid off dozens at the studio amid a wider bloodbath at the company and canceled the upcoming online multiplayer game he and others were working on, <a href="https://kotaku.com/blackbird-mmorpg-leaks-gta-dan-houser-eso-free-2000615981">Project Blackbird</a>. He recently broke his silence on the reason for his departure, confirming what fans had long suspected.</p> <p>“Project Blackbird was the game I had waited my entire career to create, and having it canceled led to my resignation,” Firor wrote in a January 1 post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7412202293737046016/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-analytics-id="inline-link" data-url="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7412202293737046016/" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-hawk-tracked="hawklinks" data-mrf-link="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7412202293737046016/">LinkedIn</a>&nbsp;which he later <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:sdsbjnwwyzxwz3b4lqtbtwd5/post/3mbeicw5hgw2f?ref_src=embed&amp;ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.pcgamer.com%252Fgames%252Fmmo%252Fformer-elder-scrolls-online-chief-confirms-microsofts-2025-bloodbath-drove-his-departure-from-zenimax-project-blackbird-was-the-game-i-had-waited-my-entire-career-to-create%252F">shared on Bluesky</a>. “My heart and thoughts are always with the impacted team members, many of whom I had worked 20+ years with, and all of whom were the most dedicated, amazingly talented group of developers in the industry.”</p>   <p>The post never mentions Microsoft directly and doesn’t take aim at the decision makers at Xbox, which acquired Zenimax Online in 2021, but the move clearly left a very bad taste in many veteran developers’ mouths. Some of Firor’s former colleagues went on to form Sackbird Studios to work on their own multiplayer game. “With internal funding and full creative control, the studio is focused on crafting bold, character-driven experiences free from corporate compromises,” they <a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-studios-gta-6-price-fortnite-simpsons-2000633663">wrote last year</a>.</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-layoffs-zenimax-online-blackbird-elder-scrolls-1851785629"><em>Bloomberg</em> reported</a> that Blackbird was an ambitious loot shooter that mixed elements of <em>Destiny</em> and <em>Blade Runner</em> with the structure and questlines of an MMORPG. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer reportedly played a build of the game last March and loved what he saw, making its eventual cancelation even more perplexing. The layoffs and cuts came as Xbox game studios were <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-microsoft-price-hike-game-pass-layoffs-new-console-2000638546">reportedly tasked</a> with achieving a controversial 30-percent profit margin despite being forced to make all of their games playable for free on Game Pass.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ps-plus-jan-2026-free-monthly-games-core-keeper-2000656495</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The first free monthly <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps-plus-december-2025-extra-assassins-creed-jrpg-2000652236">PlayStation Plus games</a> for paying subscribers in 2026 have been revealed and it’s a sleepy month for PS5 and PS4 players. There are also only three additions for this month, compared to last month’s five.</p> <p>On December 31, Sony revealed the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/31/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-january-need-for-speed-unbound-disney-epic-mickey-rebrushed-core-keeper/">first batch of PS Plus Essential games</a> coming this year and while they’re decent games, none of the picks make a big splash. These games will be available to add to your PlayStation library permanently beginning on January 6. Once added, you can install them and play them whenever you want as long as you are an active PS Plus Essential, Extra, or Premium subscriber. Here’s the list of games and what platforms they are available on:</p> <ul> <li> <p><em>Need For Speed Unbound</em> | PS5</p> </li> <li> <p><em>Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed</em> | PS4, PS5</p> </li> <li> <p><em>Core Keeper</em> | PS4, PS5</p> </li> </ul> <p><em>Rebrushed</em> is the 2024 remaster of the 2010 platformer from <em>Deus Ex</em> director Warren Spector. Nice for anyone who didn’t play the original or wants an important lesson in game development history. <em>Unbound</em>, meanwhile, is the 25th installment in the&nbsp;<em>Need for Speed</em> series and features a neat cel-shaded art style. The 2022 release is a fun racer but far from the most memorable in the franchise.</p>

 <p><em>Core Keeper</em> is arguably the best pick-up this month. It’s a top-down pixel art crafting sim that marries <em>Minecraft</em> and <em>Stardew Valley</em>. Like those games it continues to receive meaty free updates, with one coming later this month called Void &amp; Voltage. Not the worst month overall, though not as generous as last month’s <a href="http://PlayStation Plus games">pre-holiday haul</a>.</p>

              <p>2026 is shaping up to be another big year for video games. The next 12 months are set to bring massive sequels like <em>Forza Horizon 6, Resident Evil Requiem,</em> and <em>Gears of War: E-Day.</em> There are also some smaller games we’re excited to get our hands on, like <em>Bubsy 4D, Mouse: P.I. for Hire,</em> and <em>Slay The Spire 2.</em> And of course, there’s<em> Grand Theft Auto 6,</em> which, assuming it doesn’t get delayed again, will close out 2026 with a big, industry-shaking bang.</p> <p>There are so many games to be excited about in 2026 that you might have forgotten about some of them. So we here at <em>Kotaku</em> have created this handy list of 31 games we’re excited to play in the new year. Now, place your bets for how many will actually launch in 2026 and how many will instead be delayed to 2027 or beyond.</p>

 <h2><b><i>Resident Evil Requiem</i></b><b> – Feb. 27</b></h2>  <p><span>I was already excited for a new mainline </span><i><span>Resident Evil</span></i><span> game arriving in early 2026; you didn’t need to add Leon Kennedy. But I’m very grateful. -Zack Zwiezen</span></p>

 <h2><b><i>Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight </i></b><b>– 2026&nbsp;</b></h2>  <p><span>We ain’t getting a new </span><i><span>Arkham </span></i><span>game anytime soon, so this Lego spin on the formula will have to do. Luckily, it looks rad as heck. – Zack Zwiezen</span></p> <h2><b><i>Forza Horizon 6 </i></b><b>– 2026</b></h2>  <p><span>The follow-up to one of the best Xbox games ever made, and it’s set in a gorgeously dense open-world recreation of Japan. Yup. That’s going to be goooood. – Zack Zwiezen</span></p>

 <h2><b><i>Control Resonant </i></b><b>– 2026</b></h2>  <p><span>Remedy’s 2019 </span><i><span>Control </span></i><span>was a wonderful and creepy paranormal shooter. I’ve desperately wanted a sequel, and that’s finally arriving next year. – Zack Zwiezen</span></p>

 <h2><b><i>Mouse: P.I. for Hire </i></b><b>– March 19</b></h2>  <p><span>Mixing a boomer shooter with classic black-and-white cartoons is an odd choice, but the final product seems awesome, and we don’t have to wait long to play. – Zack Zwiezen</span></p>

 <h2><b><i>007 First Light –</i></b><b> March 26</b></h2>  <p><span>IOI, the people behind </span><i><span>Hitman</span></i><span>, seem like the perfect studio to make a James Bond game. Hopefully, it all comes together in the spring. – Zack Zwiezen</span></p> <h2><b><i>Bubsy 4D</i></b><b> – 2026</b></h2>  <p><span>I didn’t have “Excited for a new <em>Bubsy</em> game” on my bingo card for 2026, but here we are. What can I say? <em>Bubsy 4D</em> looks good. – Zack Zwiezen</span></p>

 <h2><b><i>The Duskbloods</i></b><b> – 2026</b></h2>  <p><span>FromSoftware’s upcoming eight-player online action RPG sounds like a great idea </span><i><span>now</span></i><span>, after </span><i><span>Nightreign </span></i><span>proved to be a huge hit and a great game. Hopefully, the Switch 2 is able to handle it. – Zack Zwiezen</span></p> <h2><b><i>Gears of War: E-Day </i></b><b>– 2026</b></h2>  <p><span>I’m sad that <em>Gears 5</em>’s story isn’t moving forward. Still, it should be fun seeing Marcus and Dom back together in this upcoming prequel to the OG Xbox 360 trilogy. – Zack Zwiezen</span></p> <h2><b><i>Star Wars: Galactic Racer</i></b><b> – 2026</b></h2>  <p><span>So many <em>Star Wars</em> games are RPGs, shooters, or action-adventure experiences. That’s fine, but I’m happy to see someone making a racing game set in my favorite sci-fi universe. – Zack Zwiezen</span></p>

 <h2><strong><em>Marathon</em> – March 2026</strong></h2>  <p>The it’s over/we’re so back graph has been all over the place on this one, but with a series of post-alpha test tweaks, including the addition of proximity chat, I’m once again looking forward to seeing Bungie’s take on the extraction shooter, especially if they can weave as much of the background sci-fi lore into a <em>Destiny</em>-style aspirational end-game as I’m hoping they can. <span>– Ethan Gach</span></p> <h2><b><i>Grand Theft Auto 6</i></b><b> – November 19&nbsp;</b></h2>  <p><span>At this point, I feel like I’ve written so many words about the upcoming</span><i><span> GTA 6 </span></i><span>that I’m not sure what else to say. You know what this game is. You are probably excited for it. Let’s hope Rockstar lands this sucker. – Zack Zwiezen</span></p>

 <h2><b><i>Marvel’s Wolverine</i></b><span> –<strong> 2026</strong></span></h2>  <p><span>Insomniac’s </span><i><span>Spider-Man</span></i><span> games have been joyous open-world treats that feel great to play. So people are understandably excited for the studio’s upcoming </span><i><span>Wolverine </span></i><span>game that looks fun and very, very bloody. – Zack Zwiezen</span></p> <h2><strong><em>Saros</em> – April 30</strong></h2>  <p><em>Returnal</em> will always have a special place in my heart, but I’m looking forward to seeing Housemarque branch off into a more forgiving roguelike arcade shooter structure with a robust metagame progression that gives more players more footholds, which will hopefully see more of them hang on and stick it out for the whole ride. <span>– Ethan Gach</span></p> <h2><strong><em>Mina the Hollower</em> – 2026</strong></h2>  <p>Following a brief delay, I can’t wait to see the <em>Shovel Knight</em> team’s take on <em>Castlevania</em> meets <em>The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening</em>. I’m looking forward to a retro homage that pushes the genres it’s playing with to new heights. <span>– Ethan Gach</span></p>

 <h2><strong><em>Replaced</em> – March 12</strong></h2>   <p>This game looks incredible. Looking at it will be enough. Playing it will hopefully feel extra special. <span>– Ethan Gach</span></p> <h2><em>Forbidden Solitaire&nbsp;</em>– Q1 2026</h2>  <p><i><span>Forbidden Solitaire </span></i><span>is ostensibly about you finding and playing a spooky ‘90s CD-ROM solitaire game—think </span><i><span>The 7th Guest </span></i><span>but, y’know, solitaire—and getting way more than you bargained for. I have no idea what that means in gameplay terms, but I can’t wait to find out. – Carolyn Petit</span></p> <h2><strong><em>The Blood of Dawnwalker</em>&nbsp; – 2026</strong></h2>  <p>Ex-<em>Witcher 3</em> devs make a vampire immersive-sim RPG. Enough said. <span>– Ethan Gach</span></p> <h2><strong><em>Danganronpa 2×2</em> – 2026</strong></h2>  <p><em>Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair</em> is getting a fancy remake, but it’s also getting a new “what if” scenario in which different victims and killers manifest in its murder mystery. So hey, even if the new storyline isn’t great, we’ll get to play <em>Danganronpa 2&nbsp;</em>again. – Kenneth Shepard</p>

 <h2><strong><em><i>Pokémon</i> Champions</em> – 2026</strong></h2>  <p><i data-stringify-type="italic">Pokémon Champions&nbsp;</i>is the new competitive platform for the series moving forward, and it’s going to integrate several mechanics, such as Mega Evolution and Z-Moves, into one place, meaning it has the potential to completely transform the competitive space, and free up the main games to no longer be beholden to a particular way of doing things. – Kenneth Shepard</p> <h2><b><i>Mario Tennis Fever</i></b><b> – February 12</b></h2>  <p><span>The world needs more fun tennis games. Thank you, Mario and company, for hearing these calls and showing up so early in 2026 to deliver a game that looks like it’ll be exactly what folks want. – Zack Zwiezen</span></p>

 <h2><b><i>Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis</i></b><b> – 2026</b></h2>  <p><span>Sure, another remake of the first </span><i><span>Tomb Raider game </span></i><span>seems a bit silly. But, hey, it looks great and will hold fans over until 2027’s </span><i><span>Tomb Raider: Catalyst.</span></i><span> – Zack Zwiezen</span></p> <h2><strong><em><i>Pokémon</i> Pokopia</em> – March 5</strong></h2>  <p><em><i>Pokémon</i> Pokopia </em>appears to be Pikachu and friends’ take on an <em>Animal Crossing</em>-style life sim, but it also seems to have a dark, post-apocalyptic setting that might keep it from being as cozy as other games in the genre. Intriguing! – Kenneth Shepard</p>

 <h2><strong><em>Pragmata</em> – April 24</strong></h2>  <p>New AAA franchises are so few and far between, it’s a special treat whenever we get one, especially out of Japan. It’s not 3D <em>Mega Man</em> but it might be the next best thing. <span>– Ethan Gach</span></p> <h2><strong><em>Marvel Tokon Fighting Souls</em> – 2026</strong></h2>  <p>When it comes to anime fighters, you don’t bet against Arc System Works.&nbsp;<em>Marvel Tokon Fighting Souls&nbsp;</em>is a 4v4 fighting game with Earth’s Mightiest Heroes on the roster, and it looks pretty rad. – Kenneth Shepard</p> <h2><strong><em>Scott Pilgrim EX</em> – 2026</strong></h2>  <p>It’s about time we got a new&nbsp;<em>Scott Pilgrim&nbsp;</em>beat em up, and this time, it’s coming with a brand new story by series’ creator Bryan Lee O’Malley set after the events of the <em>Scott Pilgrim Takes Off&nbsp;</em>anime. – Kenneth Shepard</p> <h2><strong><em>Demon Tides</em> – February 19</strong></h2>  <p><em>Demon Tides&nbsp;</em>is a modern-day PS2-style mascot platformer that manages to nail the middle ground between pinpoint precision and free-flowing, fast-paced action that so many others in the genre can’t quite inhabit. – Kenneth Shepard</p>

 <h2><strong><em>Nocturne</em> – June 30</strong></h2>  <p>I had to get at least one rhythm game on this list, and <em>Nocturne</em>, a rhythm RPG inspired by science fantasy games of the ’90s, is basically&nbsp;<em>Guitar Hero</em> meets&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy</em>. – Kenneth Shepard</p> <h2><strong><em>Slay the Spire 2</em>– March 2026</strong></h2>  <p>I slept on the first <em>Slay the Spire</em> when it initially launched. I will not make that mistake again. With most sequels I want a little bit more than just “bigger and better,” but with <em>Slay the Spire 2</em> that will be more than enough. <span>– Ethan Gach</span></p> <h2><b><i>Halo: Campaign Evolved</i></b><b> –</b><strong> 2026</strong></h2>  <p><span>Like </span><i><span>Tomb Raider</span></i><span>, it’s a bit silly that we are getting yet another remake of the first </span><i><span>Halo</span></i><span>, but this one is coming to PlayStation 5, and I wish I could go back in time and tell 12-year-old Zack that fact. It would blow his dumb pre-teen mind. – Zack Zwiezen</span></p> <h2><b><i>Yoshi and the Mysterious Book –</i></b><strong> 2026</strong></h2>  <p><span>This ain’t the Nintendo platformer I was hoping for in 2026, but it looks cute, and for folks who love the </span><i><span>Yoshi </span></i><span>games, well, here’s another one for you. – Zack Zwiezen</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Has Third-Most GOTY Wins In a Single Year with 291 W’s to Push Baldur’s Gate 3 into Fourth]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-has-third-most-goty-wins-in-single-year/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong> was undeniably the defining game of 2025. For all the industry discussion it drove, to its <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">dominating performance at <strong>The Game Awards 2025</strong></a>, it was the one game that came out of nowhere and took over for the year. Not only did it win Game of the Year at The Game Awards, but it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/golden-joysticks-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">the winner at the <strong>Golden Joysticks</strong></a>, and the choice of several media outlets across the globe as they all picked Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 as well. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/2025-video-game-awards-season-tracking-and-discussion-thread.1348411/">ResetEra user Angie keeps an amazingly long and detailed thread of games during each awards season</a>, with several stats for anyone interested to dig through. Now that we're into 2026, the numbers for 2025's awards season have mostly been tallied, with <strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 getting 291 Game of the Year wins in 2025</strong>.</p>



<p>That sets it just above Baldur's Gate 3, which was awarded 288 Game of the Year wins when it arrived in 2023. Ahead of it by a fairly large margin is The Last of Us Part II at 326, and ahead of everything by a country mile is Elden Ring with <strong>435 Game of the Year wins in 2022.</strong></p>



<p>Looking at the list, it'll be quite the event when/if something ever beats The Last of Us Part II and Elden Ring, since The Last of Us Part II is a solid 35 wins ahead of Clair Obscur, and Elden Ring is <strong>109 wins</strong> ahead of The Last of Us Part II. </p>



<p>Here's the full list of the 21 games with over 100 Game of the Year Wins:</p>



<ol>
<li>Elden Ring (FromSoftware) - 435</li>



<li>The Last of Us Part II (Naughty Dog) - 326</li>



<li><strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 (Sandfall Interactive) - 291</strong></li>



<li>Baldur's Gate III (Larian Studios) - 288</li>



<li>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt (CD Projekt Red) - 281</li>



<li>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (Nintendo EPD) - 264</li>



<li>God of War (2018) (Santa Monica Studio) - 263</li>



<li>The Last of Us (Naughty Dog) - 257</li>



<li>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim (Bethesda) - 229</li>



<li>Astro Bot (Team Asobi) - 196</li>



<li>Uncharted 4: A Thief's End (Naughty Dog) - 190</li>



<li>Red Dead Redemption 2 (Rockstar Games) - 178</li>



<li>Grand Theft Auto V (Rockstar Games) - 163</li>



<li>Dragon Age: Inquisition (BioWare) - 139</li>



<li>Death Stranding (Kojima Productions) - 118</li>



<li>God of War Ragnarök (Santa Monica Studio) - 118</li>



<li>Uncharted 2: Among Thieves (Naughty Dog) - 115</li>



<li>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom (Nintendo EPD) - 114</li>



<li>Overwatch (Blizzard Entertainment) - 114</li>



<li>Red Dead Redemption (Rockstar Games) - 111</li>



<li>Mass Effect 2 (BioWare) -102</li>
</ol>



<p>This may not be the most 'official' list in the view of some people, but it is an interesting one to look at as a way to 'take the temperature' of what games media and game critics value and look toward as their picks for what is the best of the best each year. The top five, for example, are all single-player, story-driven experiences, with four out of five being fantasy-based RPGs. The only game in the top ten that's not fantasy-based, isn't largely narrative-driven, doesn't have RPG mechanics, and isn't an open-world game is 2024's Astro Bot with 196 wins.</p>



<p>In the top 21 listed, the only multiplayer-focused game is Overwatch in 19th place. Rockstar, Naughty Dog, BioWare, Santa Monica Studios, and Nintendo all have multiple titles on the list, with Naughty Dog leading the pack at four.</p>



<p>Multiplayer games may be the games people are going to daily, and the ones that sell the most each year, but it's clear that they are not the ones critics are looking to as the best-of-the-best each year.</p>



<p>As for Wccftech's pick of 2025's best, Clair Obscur was indeed <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-games-of-2025-year-of-the-indie-ish/">one of our top ten Best Games for 2025</a>. It also made our list for <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-indie-games-of-2025-the-year-of-the-indie/">Best Indie games</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-role-playing-games-of-2025-another-incredible-year/">Best Role-Playing games</a>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-port-asa-only-doable-ue-5-7-says-ark-dev-studio-trying-to-get-fg-running/</link>
            <guid>1396123</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>I recently had the opportunity to speak for a solid hour with <strong>ARK: Survival Ascended Co-Creative Director and Lead Programmer Jeremy Stieglitz</strong>, and he had a lot to reveal, including the studio's ongoing attempts to bring the game to the <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong> platform.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/ue-5-7-is-close-to-a-magic-bullet-for-performance-says-ark-developer-though-it-wont-fully-eliminate-stutters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In the previous slice of the gargantuan interview</a>, we focused on Stieglitz's confirmation that Unreal Engine 5.7 represents a massive performance boost in their testing. It is so massive, in fact, that the Nintendo Switch 2 port is only possible after the studio completes the engine upgrade to UE 5.7. The twist, however, is that even that alone won't be enough, which led Stieglitz to inform us that they are exploring ways to implement Frame Generation on the platform, utilizing either NVIDIA DLSS or AMD FSR 3.1. </p>



<p><em>Unreal Engine 5.7's performance boost is so extreme, in fact, that one of the reasons we had been working on it is that, on the side, we'd been exploring doing a Nintendo Switch 2 port of ARK: Survival Ascended. We actually have that running internally, and we found that <strong>the Nintendo Switch 2 port was only doable with Unreal Engine 5.7 with those performance upgrades</strong>. It wasn't possible otherwise. It was that significant a performance improvement. So, we're really excited to get that one out.</em></p>



<p><em>I should note that the good news is <strong>the 5.7 improvements, they're not PC specific</strong>. Most of them apply to both consoles as well. So, we're really looking forward to releasing this upgrade for the <strong>Xbox</strong> and <strong>PlayStation</strong> player base who, to this point, aren't still quite at the level of performance we would like them to be at. This is going to put those over the top in terms of getting them to the best possible performance state, which is, by our reckoning, <strong>a solid, unbreakable 60FPS is where we really want to be on those consoles</strong>. So, PlayStation and Xbox users have something to look forward to with that upgrade and not just PC users, but with Nintendo Switch 2 in particular... </em></p>



<p><em>We actually do have a working build of it and frankly, <strong>it was about half off where it needed to be performance-wise</strong>. Memory was actually very good, or I would say good enough. <strong>The Nintendo Switch 2 has, in effect, more addressable memory than the Xbox Series S</strong>, the so-called Lockhart platform, does. And so, since we already had basically scaled ARK: Survival Ascended for Series S, we found that we were in a better memory state than on that console and therefore weren't in a case of running out of memory on the Nintendo Switch 2, even with using more advanced graphics on the Switch 2 than we do on the Series S. But the issue was the GPU primarily being weaker. We were able to use all the primary rendering features. Working on it, we wanted to make sure that it looked essentially like the Xbox Series X version. </em></p>



<p><em><strong>We've downgraded the graphics quite significantly for Series S and we didn't want the Switch 2 experience to be like that</strong>. We needed the game to look approximately like the Series X version or the PlayStation 5 version, even if it would be at a lower resolution. So, the issue was not core rendering features. We would have to do <strong>Lumen</strong>, <strong>Nanite</strong>, and <strong>Virtual Shadow Maps</strong>. All three of those things are important to us on Switch 2. I think we may have dropped the shadows to Cascade Shadows rather than Virtual Shadow Maps, which is kind of a slightly older way of handling shadows, but in practice, most users wouldn't be able to tell the difference on a lower resolution device like the Nintendo Switch 2, which for us would be a 1080p handheld 1440p docked resolution as opposed to 4K in either case. So Cascade shadows are good enough, but Lumen and Nanite, Nanite in particular with the large open world foliage scenes, were just hammering it very badly, and we were basically about half off of where we needed to be on the Nintendo Switch 2. </em></p>



<p><em>What does the Switch 2 version need? I mean, let's be clear, <strong>it's not going to be a 60 FPS experience</strong>. It's just not in the cards for Switch 2 with ARK: Survival Ascended. But the bottom line is, <strong>it needs to be a solid 30 FPS experience</strong>, and we were about half off where we needed to be to get to that. That was prior to the Unreal Engine 5.7 test. We have found gains of about <strong>33 to 40% overall frame rate</strong>. It was completely GPU-bound, and it gains us about 33 to 40% off the GPU in those scenes. That was very, very good</em>, <em>but <strong>still not<br>where we need to be</strong> to get to a 30 FPS perceived frame rate solidly. </em></p>



<p><em>So, even the Unreal Engine 5.7 upgrade alone was not enough. There's one last thing we're exploring right now. It's still an open question, which is why I can't say precisely when the game would come out on the Nintendo Switch 2, because it really requires getting to that solid core 30 FPS frame rate. Right now, just to be quite frank, it's around 20 or so FPS on UE 5.7. So, how do we get to a 30-plus FPS frame rate? <strong>We're about to try experimenting with Frame Generation</strong>, but the truth is, I honestly don't know the results on that yet because it's not inherently something we can just turn on. It's not yet supported by either <strong>NVIDIA</strong>, who makes the Switch 2 GPU, or <strong>AMD</strong>. AMD has an open API for frame interpolation that theoretically can operate on the Switch 2, but they don't have a Switch 2-ready port of it. So, we would have to port it ourselves, or work with them to do so. We've been just starting the process of experimenting with whether NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation is possible on the Switch 2, or if AMD's frame interpolation shader set is doable. We don't know the answer. One of those I have to presume will be doable, hopefully. I mean, it's technology that should in theory work, especially AMD's, which is not hardware specific. That should be doable, but we would have to explore more of the ports. Until we get more results on frame interpolation, we're still not quite where we need to be on the Nintendo Switch 2 version of ARK: Survival Ascended. </em></p>



<p><em>Let me be frank, <strong>I'd rather have a 30 FPS frame rate without frame interpolation</strong>. But if I can get to 20 to 25 without frame interpolation, then use frame interpolation to push it over 30 solidly, I think that'll feel good enough. I don't think it'll look too smeary or too laggy if we're close to 30 without it. The reality is we're getting there. It's looking good and it's progressing, so I hope it's going to happen and be released this year and is impressive. </em></p>



<p>I then asked if the game would utilize NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution, which the Nintendo Switch 2 definitely supports (although not every game takes advantage of it). Stieglitz said yes, while also adding that <strong>NVIDIA has been 'vague' about whether the hybrid console can support DLSS Frame Generation</strong>.</p>



<p><em>Yeah, DLSS works fine and is quite impressive. It helps quite a bit with the up-resing and image sharpening and clarity, but they separate the DLSS upscaling algorithm from the Frame Generation algorithm. What we've heard from NVIDIA is that they don't currently support Frame Generation on the Switch 2, but they've been a little vague about whether it can be supported. So, <strong>we have to poke them a little harder and try and get an answer on that in the new year</strong>.</em></p>



<p>To our knowledge, the platform does not support it; however, it's interesting to hear that Studio Wildcard did not receive a conclusive 'no' from NVIDIA. Needless to say, it could be a big deal for future game releases if the Nintendo Switch 2 supported some form of Frame Generation. We'll remain vigilant on the subject.</p>



<p>Lastly for the Nintendo Switch 2 portion of our ARK: Survival Ascended interview, Stieglitz confirmed that if it does come out on the console, it will join the same community of PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, unlike the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ark-survival-evolved-nintendo-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ill-fated Nintendo Switch port of ARK: Survival Evolved</a>.</p>



<p><em>If ARK: Survival Ascended does come out on the Nintendo Switch 2 (fingers crossed, and we are working on it), <strong>it would be a cross-platform, cross-multiplayer version of the game</strong>. It would not be a segmented, diluted, isolated version of the game. The original Switch 1 version of ARK: Survival Evolved was unfortunately a slightly watered-down and segmented version of the product, which made it difficult to maintain, and I also think led to it not being as successful as it otherwise would have been by not connecting with the wider player base and not getting all the same content. We wouldn't be making that mistake again for the new version if it comes to pass.</em></p>



<p>Stay tuned for the rest of our chat with Jeremy Stieglitz on ARK: Survival Ascended's recently launched premium DLC, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ark-survival-ascended-lost-colony-dlc-expansion-out-now-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lost Colony</a></strong>, and what's next for the popular survival game.</p>

This isn’t unheard of, as earlier jailbreak methods have required a Blu-ray disc to access the proper exploit, and the </span><i><span>Racer Revenge</span></i><span> port has an issue that allows users to “inject code into the system” and that has gone unpatched since the original 2002 release on PS2.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/microsoft-ai-slop-satya-nadella-2000656473</link>
            <guid>1396096</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Gen AI isn’t going anywhere. In fact, it’s just getting started. That’s what Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella believes. He’d also like you to stop calling everything generated by LLM AI “slop.” People need to “get beyond” that in 2026, the executive who <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/satya-nadella-microsoft-xbox-pay">earned $79 million</a> in compensation recently announced.</p> <p>These and other musings were shared on his personal “sn scratchpad” blog in a December 29 post titled “<a href="https://snscratchpad.com/posts/looking-ahead-2026/?v=1">Looking ahead to 2026</a>.” It acknowledges the challenges of people figuring out how to actually use gen AI to do things that are useful, but remains bullish on the underlying technology itself to continue improving at a rate worth investing $100 billion in. Here’s the part that caught everyone’s’ attention, though:</p>

 <blockquote><p>We need to get beyond the arguments of slop vs sophistication and develop a new equilibrium in terms of our ‘theory of the mind’ that accounts for humans being equipped with these new cognitive amplifier tools as we relate to each other. This is the product design question we need to debate and answer.</p></blockquote> <p>I’m not sure what exactly Nadella means by “a new equilibrium in terms of our ‘theory of the mind,'” and perhaps he doesn’t either. Given the executive’s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-05-15/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-on-his-ai-efforts-and-openai-partnership">penchant for folding AI use into every facet of his work life</a>, it’s not only possible but actually very likely that some version of Copilot, perhaps even a “rich” multi-agent “scaffold,” was the “bicycle for the mind” that helped him conjure this blog post in the first place. If true, that would be as good a reason as any not to move so quickly beyond the “slop vs. sophistication” distinction.</p>

 <p>But there’s no doubt a deeper philosophical schism that separates people who deploy the term “slop” against AI from those whose future is inextricably bound up in gen AI services becoming widely and eagerly adopted. For Nadella, the difference is one of apparent quality. Like the Turing test which ascribes human-like intelligence to anything that can convincingly manipulate language well enough to trick humans, some think it’s only slop if the slop can’t convince them otherwise. For others, it’s slop, no matter how sophisticated it may be, the second human creativity is interrupted, or even supplemented, by a plagiarism machine.</p>

 <p>In the world of cloud computing and stock prices, where everything is interchangeable and fungible, such distinctions are meaningless, or at the very least, don’t drive quarterly profit growth. But in the world of people, slop in is slop out. Being content to eat from the trough does not transform it into a Michelin Star meal.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Epic Games Store Saved You Over $550 With Its 2025 Holiday Daily Free Games]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-free-game-saved-you-over-550/</link>
            <guid>1396084</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The Epic Game Store's annual holiday daily giveaways have come to an end, and if you redeemed each of the games that were made free for 24 hours between December 18 and January 1 (including <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-free-add-your-epic-games-store-library-through-december-18/">Hogwarts Legacy on December 11</a>), you just saved over $550 by not having to buy those games.</p>



<p>The giveaway ended with Epic giving away two games on January 1, 2026, instead of one: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wildgate-out-now-ps5-xbox-series-pc/"><strong>Wildgate</strong>, the PvP shooter from Dreamhaven that was released in 2025</a>, and <strong>Total War: Three Kingdoms</strong>. With those two games, and the fact that the Trine Collection was technically four games in one single day, the Epic Games Store gave away <strong>20 games this past holiday season.</strong></p>



<p>Totalling up the cost of the games at their non-discounted prices, you would have paid $567 USD to buy all of those games, including buying the four Trine games in a bundle as the Trine Collection. If you bought the Trine games individually, then the total goes up to $604.</p>



<p>That is not an insignificant amount of money saved if you're the kind of person who would have bought all of the games given away, which range in price and genre, from more narrative-driven and some smaller experiences that cost anywhere between $13-$30, to popular indies and even some triple-A titles costing between $40-$60. </p>



<p>Wildgate and Total War: Three Kingdoms will remain free for players to grab on the Epic Games Store until January 8, 2026, at which point the regular pace of one free game a week resumes, starting with Bloons TD 6.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of games that were given away by Epic, starting on December 11, and then starting daily from December 18 through to January 1:</p>



<ul>
<li>Hogwarts Legacy (Dec. 11-18)</li>



<li>Jotunnslayer: Hordes of Hel (Dec. 18)</li>



<li>Eternights (Dec. 19)</li>



<li>Blood West (Dec. 20)</li>



<li>Sorry We're Closed (Dec. 21)</li>



<li>Paradise Killer (Dec. 22)</li>



<li>Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night (Dec. 23)</li>



<li>The Callisto Protocol (Dec. 24)</li>



<li>Disco Elysium: The Final Cut (Dec. 25)</li>



<li>We Were Here Together (Dec. 26)</li>



<li>Cassette Beasts (Dec. 27)</li>



<li>SKALD Against the Black Priory (Dec. 28)</li>



<li>Viewfinder (Dec. 29)</li>



<li>Trine Collection (Dec. 30)</li>



<li>Chivalry 2 (Dec. 31)</li>



<li>Wildgate (Jan. 1)</li>



<li>Total War: Three Kingdoms (Jan. 1)</li>
</ul>



<p>It's all together, not a bad list of games. It's not the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1plsdrt/epic_games_christmas_free_game_giveaways_leaked/">fake list that appeared on Reddit</a> that seemed to gain traction based on how people would've genuinely loved it to be real. But it's not a terrible bunch of 20 games.</p>



<p>That said, what is unfortunate is that several of the titles, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-callisto-protocol-free-on-epic-games-store/">including The Callisto Protocol</a> and Chivalry 2, were games that you might've already grabbed for free as a previous Epic Games Store giveaway. So you're not always getting something new to add to your library if you use the Epic Games Store.</p>

			<p>Based on <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-worthy-of-the-greater-wills-blessing/">Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree alone</a>, 2025 did not reach the same bar<a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-dlc-expansion-of-2024-give-us-more/"> that 2024 did with regard to the DLC and expansions</a> released this past year. It wasn't a bad year, but it just didn't match up. Thankfully, there's at least one upcoming expansion that could be 2026's Shadow of the Erdtree moment, and a few more on their way that'll help round things out.</p>



<p>Here are our picks for our Most Anticipated DLC/Expansion releases set to come in 2026.</p>



<p><em>Other Wccftech's Most Anticipated 2026 Games per category:</em> <em><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-role-playing-games-of-2026-legends-and-legacies/">Role-Playing Games</a></strong></em>, <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-indie-games-of-2026/">Indie Games</a></em></strong>, <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-platformers-of-2026-new-adventures-in-familiar-worlds/">Platformers</a></em></strong></p>



<h2 id="h-hollow-knight-silksong-sea-of-sorrow-tbc-2026-pc-ps5-ps4-xbox-series-x-s-xbox-one-nintendo-switch-nintendo-switch-2">Hollow Knight Silksong: Sea of Sorrow (TBC 2026 - PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Hollow-Knight-Silksong-Sea-of-Sorrow-1.png"></a><figcaption><em>Hollow Knight Silksong: Sea of Sorrow. Image credit: Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Considering the fact that we went so long without any sign of Hollow Knight Silksong, it almost didn't feel real when its first expansion, Sea of Sorrow, was announced halfway through December 2025. Even more unbelievable (and exciting) was its 2026 release window.</p>



<p>We've gone from no Silksong to a lot of Silksong, and it is by no means a bad thing. The long-awaited sequel to Team Cherry's stunning 2D platformer Hollow Knight, Silksong was one of the defining games of 2025 and <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-games-of-2025-year-of-the-indie-ish/">one of the year's best, hands-down</a>. We don't know a lot about Sea of Sorrow save from this description Team Cherry gave: "<em></em><em>Voyage across and beneath the salt-stricken seas in this thrilling expansion, free for all players</em>."</p>



<p>Sea of Sorrow is sure to be one of the best expansions of the year, and is arguably the one expansion that could be 2026's Shadow of the Erdtree moment.</p>



<h2 id="h-super-mario-bros-wonder-meetup-in-bellabel-park-spring-2026-nintendo-switch-2">Super Mario Bros. Wonder + Meetup in Bellabel Park (Spring 2026 - Nintendo Switch 2)</h2>

<p>With the release of the Nintendo Switch 2 last year, we got several upgraded versions of first-party Nintendo titles that didn't just arrive with visual overhauls, but with some small and some fairly-sized expansions along with them. It'll be Super Mario Bros. Wonder's turn to get the same treatment this coming Spring 2026, with the release of the Switch 2 edition and its expansion, Meet Up in Bellabel Park.</p>



<p>Meet Up in Bellabel Park doesn't exactly seem to be a new batch of 2D platforming levels, but something more along the lines of new challenges and mini-games that seem to really expand the co-op capabilities of the game. The whole of it could very well be greater than the sum of its parts. That was definitely the case with some of the Switch 2 versions of games already released.</p>



<h2 id="h-ninja-gaiden-4-the-two-masters-early-2026-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x-s">Ninja Gaiden 4: The Two Masters (Early 2026 - PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Ninja-Gaiden-4-Two-Masters-DLC.png"></a><figcaption><em>Ninja Gaiden 4: The Two Masters. Image credit: Koei Tecmo</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Koei Tecmo and Platinum Games' Ninja Gaiden 4 was one of the best action games of 2025. Not only did it make <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-action-games-of-2025-a-relentless-year/">Wccftech's list for the Best Action games</a>, but it was also <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">nominated for Best Action game at The Game Awards 2025</a>. Now, at some point in early 2026, it'll get even better with the release of its first DLC, The Two Masters.</p>



<p>The coming DLC <a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-get-two-masters-dlc-early-2026/">was revealed before the game's release in October 2025</a>, and while it is currently set for early 2026, we don't yet have a specific release date. When it does arrive, it'll add two new weapons for Ryu and Yakumo, along with new story content for players to dig into and most post-game challenges for those players who really want to test their ninja skills even further than the base game already does.</p>



<p>Hopefully, the new story content, weapons, and challenges come together for a solid DLC addition to what was already a stunning action game. </p>

<p>If you're a fan of GSC Game World's intense survival shooter STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl, then at the time of this writing, you might still be going through the game's <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-gets-new-free-content-on-december-16/">recently released free content update, Stories Untold</a>. While that update added eight new quests, seven new locations, six new characters, a new weapon and a new hub to dig into, it's not the first major DLC for STALKER 2.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-first-dlc-in-2026-no-news-multiplayer-cross-platform-mods/">That expansion is still to come</a>, which is what GSC Game World told <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-anniversary-ps5-debut-qa-ps5-pro-leans-toward-pc-high-settings/">Wccftech back in November 2025 in an interview with communications director Zakhar Bocharov and technical director Ievgen Kulyk</a>. We don't know a lot about this expansion, though having confirmation from GSC Game World on its 2026 arrival is what helps it make the list of our main picks over one of our picks for honourable mentions.</p>



<h2 id="h-world-of-warcraft-midnight-march-2-2026-pc">World of Warcraft: Midnight (March 2, 2026 - PC)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/World-of-Warcraft-Midnight.png"></a><figcaption><em>World of Warcraft: Midnight. Image credit: Blizzard</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Last but certainly not least, the final pick on our main list goes to World of Warcraft: Midnight, the eleventh expansion pack for the long-running MMORPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-officially-launching-march-2-2026/">that is arriving on March 2, 2026</a>. Midnight introduces a few significant features, including player housing, a new opt-in Prey bounty hunting system, a new race, and a new Demon Hunter specialization. Four new zones, eight dungeons, three raids, eleven delves, and a new campaign to follow.</p>



<p>It's a whole bunch more World of Warcraft for players to dig into, and based on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-qa-housing-long-term/">conversation that Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo had with the team back at Gamescom 2025,</a> it'll be one of the more significant expansions in the game's history. </p>

<h2 id="h-honorable-mentions">Honorable Mentions</h2>



<p>We can't include every upcoming DLC and expansion in our main picks, but the following honourable mentions still deserve your attention.</p>



<p>A note on our honourable mentions first. The first honourable mention is the Unannounced Witcher 3 DLC. While it seems likely that The Witcher 3 will get one additional expansion after all this time, we don't yet have the confirmation from CD Projekt RED that would make us confident to include it in our main picks. GSC Game World, however, has confirmed that STALKER 2 is getting its first proper DLC in 2026, which is what helps it make the list instead of The Witcher 3 potentially getting an expansion. </p>



<p>If CD Projekt RED were to confirm The Witcher 3 DLC, a return to The Continent would absolutely be one of our most anticipated expansions for the year. But since we don't even know if it's happening, we can only hope it does and represent that hope with the honourable mention below.</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/ready-to-return-to-the-continent-analysts-expect-a-big-the-witcher-3-dlc-expansion-to-drop-next-year/">Unannounced Witcher 3 DLC</a> (We hope)</li>



<li>The Outer Worlds 2 DLC</li>



<li>Age of Empires IV DLC</li>



<li>DOOM: The Dark Ages DLC</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">2025 was somewhat of a quiet year for PlayStation. Yes, we got the Game of the Year-nominated Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, and Sucker Punch’s exciting sequel to Ghost of Tsushima, Ghost of Yotei. But aside from that, there wasn’t really a lot of activity from Sony’s first-party studios. Instead, you had to look to developers outside of Sony’s stables, who thankfully kept the PS5 ticking over with an array of interesting games. Right at the back end of 2024, Infold launched the console-exclusive Infinity Nikki and has been delighting stylists around the globe over the past 12 months, and smaller projects such as Sword of the Sea, Dispatch, and Baby Steps have all been enjoyed on PlayStation 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, the fact that there were not many console <em>exclusives</em> didn't mean there weren't a whole host of great games to play on our PS5s last year. Quite the opposite, in fact. Awards-sweeper Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, the long-awaited Hollow Knight: Silksong, and acclaimed RPG Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 led the third-party offerings. Plus, 2025 really was the year of Xbox going fully multiplatform with its library, as Forza Horizon 5, Gears of War Reloaded, and The Outer Worlds 2, to name just a few, all made their way to PlayStation. And that’s showing no signs of slowing down in the coming year, either, with a certain Master Chief set to grace a Sony console for the first time.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best PlayStation Game of 2025</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The truth is, Sony has just been pretty quiet when it comes to exclusives of its own, with little new to shout about from a hardware perspective, either. And that’s before we even get into the problems Bungie (now a PlayStation Studio, remember) has faced with Marathon. So, are things looking more exciting in 2026? Well, Marathon will certainly be hoping so as it aims to combat PlayStation’s recent live-service travails. Let’s dig into it, as well as everything else to expect from Sony this year.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>First-Party and Exclusives </strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Heading into 2026, all eyes are on Logan, as Insomniac aims to bolster its long winning streak of Ratchet and Clank and Spider-Man games by taking on another comic book hero. Marvel’s Wolverine is currently pencilled in for a “late 2026” launch, although we’ll see if those plans change at all due to a certain Rockstar game moving to a similar timeframe. Whenever it does release, though, we look to be in for a treat if our first look at gameplay during September’s State of Play is any indication.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While much is still yet to be revealed about its story, we’re eager to learn more and see just who else from the X-Men and the wider Marvel Universe will be popping into Logan’s world. Mystique and Omega Red have already been confirmed, but surely Sabretooth is a must, as well as a cameo at the very least from either of Insomniac’s Spideys, Peter Parker or Miles Morales. Which of the X-Men do you want to see most? </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for PS5 exclusives that actually have release dates confirmed, there’s only Saros, Nioh 3, and Phantom Blade Zero. The former is Housemarque’s follow-up to the acclaimed Returnal, and looks to be sitting in a similar mould of colourful, particle-filled, challenging shooter within an alien planet shell. Now arriving on April 30 after a slight delay, it will take players on an expedition to a lost colony as we step into the shoes of Rahul Kohli’s Arjun Devraj and kill and die our way to uncovering its mysteries through its repeating, roguelike structure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nioh 3 is a console exclusive for PlayStation, as it's also arriving on PC when it launches on February 6. A chronological sequel to the events of the series’ first game, Team Ninja is back with a fresh dose of its own brand of punishing soulslike action in feudal Japan. Things are being shaken up this time, though, thanks to the introduction of a “ninja playstyle” which promises to control completely differently from the traditional samurai option. Trust a studio called Team Ninja, which is also responsible for the Ninja Gaiden series, to want to add ninjas to Nioh. That's enough ninjas for one sentence, I think. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Phantom Blade Zero is a hotly anticipated wuxia action RPG coming from Chinese developer S-Game. The lead character is called Soul, so you can probably guess what genre this project also borrows heavily from, too. I can confirm this myself – after briefly going hands-on with it at gamescom 2025, I found that there is indeed a punishing combat system with a complex skillset to master. But there are other action game influences, too, so the combat tempo is much higher than in your typical Soulslike. Up for some punishment? Well, you’ll have to hold on a little longer yet, as Phantom Blade Zero will be released on September 9.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now onto the stuff we’re led to believe will be coming in 2026, we just don’t know when yet. First up is Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls, the new superhero fighting game from Guilty Gear developer Arc System Works. A uniquely stylised interpretation of the Marvel universe, it looks set to be a real contender in the fighting game community if its recent closed betas are anything to go by.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Freshly revealed at The Game Awards, 4:Loop is a new co-op shooter from Left 4 Dead creator Mike Booth and Bad Robot Games, the video game wing of film director J.J. Abrams' production company. A PS5 and PC exclusive, it seems to infuse some roguelike elements with a sprinkling of Helldivers and Left 4 Dead. No release date has been given yet, but playtesting will start soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then we have Marathon, the new extraction shooter from Destiny developer Bungie, which was initially meant to arrive in 2025, but had a rough year to say the least. Delayed into this year and now coming out in March, the studio will be hoping for a big comeback story this year and buck the trend of recently failed Sony live-service shooter offerings such as Concord. Instead, it’ll be looking to the likes of the wildly successful Arc Raiders and PlayStation’s very own Helldivers 2 for a template to follow. Shooter pedigree doesn’t come much stronger than Bungie, so fingers crossed that it can turn around those initial impressions. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of live-service shooters, Fairgames is reportedly still in development at Haven Studios despite the departure of its founder, Jade Raymond, in May of 2025, and even more recently, the game’s creative director, Daniel Drapeau, leaving in September. With still no gameplay to be seen and no sign of a release date for this “competitive heist shooter”, serious questions now have to be raised about whether it will ever see the light of day.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Laser swords more your cup of tea? Well, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet might be the one for you. We’re very much dreaming if we think this is coming any earlier than 2027, but hopefully, we get a good look at gameplay for Naughty Dog’s new sci-fi game over the next 12 months. Expectations are high from one of Sony’s most beloved developers, though, with creator Neil Druckmann calling it the “most ambitious game” they’ve ever made.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But what about all of those other PlayStation studios cooking up exclusives? Well, Guerrilla may not be developing the recently revealed mobile MMORPG Horizon: Steel Frontiers itself, but has been recruiting for its own multiplayer entry into Aloy’s universe. Could we see that in 2026? What about Santa Monica’s next project? Is it finally time to see what Cory Barlog’s mystery game is, if a new God of War isn’t imminent? All good questions. None of which I have the answers for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I could run through each of the remaining Sony studios here, but, truthfully, I did that back in August, and very little has changed since. So, you can read that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-state-of-every-playstation-studio-summer-2025-update"><u>here</u></a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Third-Party and Multiplatform</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Another look forward to the year ahead in games, and another opportunity for me to say how excited I am for GTA 6. <em>Surely, </em>after its most recent delay to November, 2026 is the year we finally get our hands on the latest Grand Theft Auto. Please, Rockstar, don’t do it to us again.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">99 Details in the GTA 6 Trailer - Slideshow</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Our loss is a bunch of games’ gain, though, with Spring opening up wide for a fair few to fill that GTA-shaped void. These include Capcom’s latest entry into its legendary horror series, Resident Evil Requiem and IO Interactive’s first non-Hitman project in a long time, James Bond adventure, 007 First Light. Plus, Pearl Abyss’ expansive open-world action of Crimson Desert will be soaring onto consoles and PC in March as well. Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight is looking to pick up where Rocksteady’s Arkham trilogy left off and infuse its satisfying melee combat with that indelible minifig charm when it launches on May 29. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But so much of 2026 remains uncertain — likely largely due to GTA shifting around more than James Brown did on stage in the ‘70s. Let’s start with some multiplatform games we are pretty confident are coming this year, before moving on to ones that will likely remain rooted in our dreams.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, Master Chief will soon be controlled by a DualSense. Halo: Campaign Evolved is heading to the PS5 in 2026 as Microsoft continues to unleash its library onto other platforms. This Unreal Engine 5 remake of the 2001 Xbox classic could prove the spectre at the feast for Bungie, the original developers of Halo: Combat Evolved, if its own Marathon launch doesn’t go as planned.  At least it won’t be competing in the multiplayer market, as this new edition of Halo only includes the story campaign.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra recently shifted out of its original window of early 2026 to “beyond early 2026”, so your guess is as good as mine as to when we’ll be playing Amy Hennig’s Captain America and Black Panther in World War 2 story. Legendary PlayStation hero Lara Croft will be returning in a “reimagining” of her original game, titled Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis, and Finnish developer Remedy is back with another entry in its connected universe, Control: Resonant. Also announced at The Game Awards was the pleasantly surprising Star Wars: Galactic Racer from the makers of Burnout and Need For Speed that is scheduled to drop in 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom is also set for a big year outside of Resident Evil, with Onimusha: Way of the Sword and Pragmata both set to hit. As was the way in 2025, 2026 also looks set to keep you happy if you’re a fan of katanas and unnerving robots. As it will for vampire fans too, with The Blood of Dawnwalker looking really promising thanks to a non-linear narrative and sandbox-like structure, crafted by a team led by former Witcher 3 devs. Then there’s Mixtape, a game I’ve added to this list as one of my personally most anticipated of 2026. The sophomore project from The Artful Escape studio Beethoven &amp; Dinosaur, this 80s-inspired coming-of-age adventure is definitely one to keep on your radar.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Is 2026 finally the year we get to play a new Ken Levine game? The Bioshock creator hasn’t given us one since 2013’s Infinite, and Judas has been in development for a <em>long </em>time now. Let’s hope this is the year, because it’s something I need in my life. As is The Witcher 4, but even I’m not foolish enough to believe that CD Projekt Red’s Ciri-led RPG is coming anytime soon. But feel free to surprise me. I’d love that. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Hardware and Tech</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">We’re not necessarily expecting any big hardware splashes this year, with the next console generations theoretically not due until late 2027 at the earliest. Sony tech wizard — and most importantly, creator of Knack — Mark Cerny did recently discuss new graphics capabilities in a conversation with AMD, which sparked PlayStation 6 speculation into overdrive, but it's still likely a couple of years away at least.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rumours are also abound of a new PlayStation handheld, after suggestions were made over the past summer that Sony could even be following Nintendo’s blueprint for the Switch, and turning the PS6 into a hybrid home and portable console. Of course, this is all just wild speculation, but with powerful hardware only reducing in size and cloud capabilities ever-growing, it doesn’t feel like too much of a stretch to imagine. As I said, though, we’re still quite a way off hearing anything concrete in regards to the future of PlayStation hardware.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And that’s everything we know, along with a few guesses thrown in, about what to expect from PlayStation in 2026.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Yennefer you want.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a> maker CD Projekt has a secret new expansion for its beloved role-playing game in the works, various reports have suggested. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Word that the studio was planning more content for its 2015 blockbuster originally dates back to a report published online last summer, in which Polish games industry insider Borys Nieśpielak first spilled details of the supposed project. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time, Nieśpielak claimed that development was being handled by Fool's Theory — the studio that CD Projekt has also tasked with remaking The Witcher 1. Today, in a report by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-there-really-going-to-be-a-2026-witcher-3-expansion" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eurogamer</a>, Nieśpielak doubled down on his initial claim and pointed to a recent hint by CD Projekt itself that the content was quietly in the works.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Given our current progress, there is a chance that new content hinted upon in recent calls and reports may see release in the coming year," CD Projekt chief financial officer Piotr Nielubowicz said in the company's latest <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2025/11/transcript-q3-2025-earnings-3.pdf" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">financial report</a>, published in November 2025. Without naming the content, Nielubowicz went on to suggest that it could have "an impact" on the company's upcoming results — potentially suggesting it would arrive relatively soon, and be relatively meaninful in scope.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This isn't the only official mention of an unnamed project, either. In a follow-up investor call following the aforementioned results, joint studio CEO Michał Nowakowski also made mention of an "other project" that Fool's Theory was working on, in the same breath as mentioning its The Witcher 1 remake and support for the upcoming The Witcher 4. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yet another whisper of the project came just before the end of last year from Polish analyst Mateusz Chrzanowski, who <a href="https://strefainwestorow.pl/analizy/noblesecurities-cdprojekt-wiedzmin-dlc-orion-cyberpunk" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> he expected "the next paid add-on (DLC) for The Witcher 3 to be released in May 2026." All of this points to CD Projekt, via Fool's Theory, having something new for The Witcher 3 fans in just a few months' time — an exciting prospect, and one that would make some sense. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As "full production" on The Witcher 4 continues, CD Projekt has cautioned fans not to expect its launch in 2026, as the company <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cd-projekt-still-plans-to-launch-all-3-games-in-the-new-ciri-fronted-the-witcher-trilogy-within-a-6-year-period">plans an ambitious six-year roadmap in which it will also launch The Witcher 5 and The Witcher 6</a>. Before all of that, there's a window this year for even more Witcher, and a fresh slice of content that could potentially help bridge the gap.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A new DLC feels like a smart idea to reawaken lapsed interest ahead of the series' next chapter, via extra content sold to The Witcher 3's existing audience of more than 60 million players.

              <p>When I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cave-time-feeling-safe-in-minecraft">first began playing&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em> in 2010</a>, I instantly fell in love. In its early, simple form, it was essentially a Lego kit, but one where monsters came out at night. That combination of a freedom to build whatever I wanted, but also the need to find somewhere safe and secure to hide in the dark, was all-consuming for me, and for a while there I wanted to play nothing else. Of course, I drifted away, and over time it’s felt like it’s become someone else’s game, perhaps even the rest of the world’s game. Even as my son has gone through multiple phases of playing, I’ve not found myself motivated to reconnect. That is, until this winter holiday, when he insisted I join him in playing on the <a href="https://store.donutsmp.net/">Donut SMP</a>. And in doing so, I’ve discovered that original love all over again.</p> <p>At some point, for me <em>Minecraft</em> became about something other than digging for ores and building a lovely home. In those very early days (the game wasn’t officially released until November 2011), it was uncomplicated. The scope was infinite, but the approach was basic—again, think Lego. I spent an inordinate amount of time playing it, such that when I started dating my now-wife she was quickly introduced to the obsessive nature of the games player, bemused to learn I’d regularly stay up until 2 or 3 a.m. just to dig for diamonds and then attempt to escape from a cave of spiders. Then, I suppose a combination of burnout and the political misery in which the game became embroiled saw me move on.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000656451" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656451"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656451">© John Walker / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>Taking things down a Notch</h2> <p>Before that, however, things became even more complicated for me as I got to know its creator, Markus “Notch” Persson. I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/markus-notch-persson-talks-minecraft">first interviewed Persson in November 2010</a>, when&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em> had became a hot property through word-of-mouth and downloaded java files. Then, in March 2011 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-day-in-the-life-of-minecraft-creator-mojang">I sort of invited myself over to visit Mojang</a>, the fledgling developer Persson had created to continue the development of the game. A sweet Swedish guy who’d only just moved his business operations out of his mom’s basement, he’d made his first $10 million at this point, and the small team were literally moving into their first office when I arrived. The only exterior sign on the building was a torn sheet of file paper with “MojangAB” scrawled on it in green pen, taped to the inside of the door. Business developer Daniel Kaplan showed me around, at one point announcing, “This is the conference room,” as we entered a completely bare room but for an upturned cardboard box in one corner. “It still needs some work,” he added.</p>

 <p>While there, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/interview-notch-on-the-future-of-minecraft">I again interviewed Persson</a>, and again spoke to a very modest, very bemused man, who rather sweetly believed that the game had already sold more copies than it would after going gold later that year (it had sold about one million at that point, it’s now at well over 350 million). We got on well. It was a good time. I would go on to be one of Persson’s regular targets of online harassment when everything went bad.</p>

 <p>And it was not long after, in fact, that things started to sour. It’s tempting to pinpoint this to when Microsoft bought <em>Minecraft</em> for an astonishing $2.5 billion, with at least $2 billion of that going directly to Persson, in 2014. But Persson had been through a lot of personal tragedy from the end of 2011 onward, and his online behavior had already begun to shift. By 2014 GamerGate had started, and while Persson began as a decent voice against that movement, it didn’t last. Given that I repeatedly had Notch’s over one million Twitter followers sicced upon me, I felt the shift very personally. <em>Minecraft</em> began to stink of that, of Persson’s revolting comments against feminism and LGBTQ rights, and then his complete collapse into QAnon. By 2019 I kinda hated the game.</p>

 <p>I have this cursed object in my house, a totem of all this: a cardboard Steve head signed by Persson in early 2011. God knows if it’s valuable—it precedes any official Mojang merch having been made, instead created by some local Swedish company Persson had commissioned. It sits in the cupboard above the water tank, covered in dust, this peculiar emblem of that incredible time of optimistic joy for indie gaming.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000656452" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656452"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656452">© Microsoft / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>Doing Donuts</h2> <p>Donut SMP is one of the most popular public “Survival MultiPlayer” servers <em>Minecraft </em>players can join, seeing a peak of nearly 46,000 players in the last 24 hours, where anyone can log in for free and start exploring its enormous world. It’s the creation of high-profile <em>Minecraft</em> YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/DrDonutt">DrDonut</a> (known to his mom as Nate Filson), and offers players a space to build, craft, raid and, perhaps more than anything else, generate in-game income. An intricate in-game market where anyone can buy and sell resources and crafted items (and again, I stress, for free) encourages new players to start making money by selling the basic resources needed by the long-term super-rich players who can’t be bothered to mine them for themselves. Quickly, enterprising kids can start raking in cash, allowing them to buy coveted powerful tools in order to craft impressive bases, or more likely, start running their own farms to profit even further.</p>

 <p>Before the Christmas break, my 11-year-old son asked about getting a&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>Realm. These are essentially rented spaces on a server that allow up to 10 people to simultaneously play in the same&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em> world. It’s pretty cheap, so I said sure, and the boy began inviting his classmates to join him. And it was, for maybe three weeks, glorious! It was incredible to see these kids come together, building wonderful bases, designing amazing XP farms, and then cooperating on adventures for resources. Then, factions developed, people made “alliances” that were rapidly broken, betrayal was felt, and revenge was sought. Those wonderful bases would be sabotaged, even blown up by one child who felt aggrieved with the rest. One kid started killing the others indiscriminately and stealing their prized items. In-game anger became real-world anger, friendships were harmed at school, and eventually my son didn’t want to go back. It was too sad in there now. But, instead, he asked if it might be possible to join the server he had spent countless hours watching others play in on YouTube.</p> <p>It turns out, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPbVIS5wL6A&amp;t=8s">joining servers on a Nintendo Switch</a> is no easy task. It involves editing DNS settings, then spoofing server access to force the console build of the game to let you enter server addresses, and the whole thing is fraught with crashing and errors. But, once figured out, the boy got in and immediately knew what he was doing. And given it was the holidays and I wasn’t chained to my desk, he asked if I would join him too.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000656450" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656450"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656450">© Microsoft / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>Farming joy</h2> <p>I was reluctant because, as I say, my relationship with <em>Minecraft</em> had become fraught. I’ve played with him in local multiplayer a bunch over the years, but it’s never really clicked for us; all I ever want to do is dig down and find diamonds, while he wants to do far more interesting and complicated things like farm skeletons or investigate other arcane mysteries. But here, in DonutSMP, our desires matched perfectly! To get started, we needed to make money, and to make money we needed someone to dig stupid amounts of resources, and someone who knew how to craft them into something worthwhile. Together we’re the perfect team!</p>

 <p>We now have the most extraordinary secret base, in which my son has figured out how to use redstone to build contraptions that automatically harvest sugarcane and cacti, then push them into channels of water that sort them into chests. And I really mean he figured it out—rather than following a guide, or copying a YouTuber, he somehow intuited the method of observers and pistons needed to automate all this. He informs me that he’s equally surprised at his own discovered skills. I randomly teleport away to try to gather some rails or cobwebs, while he deftly battles mobs that spawn above us and designs increasingly clever new machines. Then it’s his turn to explore great distances away where he inevitably finds something incredible like an ancient underground city, or the half-looted remains of another player’s base.</p> <p>Oh, and that’s the constant threat. DonutSMP is, ultimately, a hostile place. Funnily enough, in many ways it’s like&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders</em> in the sense of a PvE world that contains the constant threat of unexpected PvP. The 40,000 people playing are spread across so much space that it’s very unlikely to see someone else at any point—I never have—but you’ll see <em>signs</em> of other players&nbsp;<em>everywhere</em>. The ground often bears the scars of battles, or peculiar towers of blocks stretching impossibly into the sky, giving this sense of an abandoned world in which you’re scraping to survive, yet one constantly belied by the menu-based market in which other players greedily buy your stacks of iron bars or enchanted shears. (Seriously, no one copy me, but I’ve made a <em>fortune</em> selling Unbreaking III shears for ridiculous prices!) But all the time, we’re surrounded by the existential fear that another player might stumble upon our underground realm, most likely when we’re not playing, and take everything from us. Or perhaps even just wantonly vandalize our hours of labor. (Hence our location being blurred out in all the screenshots!)</p>

  <p>Those markets have also been the most extraordinary introduction to the perils and cruel machinations of capitalism for the boy. Seriously, this should be used in schools to explain the concept of supply and demand. There we are, bringing in $50,000 a stack for our piles of crafted rails, when some bastard gets on and starts listing the same for $15,000. What to do? Reduce our prices to compete? Wait until those bargain tracks are gone and hope the market recovers? Or, as I cannot resist, buying up everything the twerp is selling, then relisting it on the store at a sensible price. The speed with which it mimics (satirizes, even) the stock markets is chilling and hilarious.</p> <p>And through all of this, I’ve realized I’ve rediscovered that first love. Once again, there’s a purpose and a reason for me to dig down for diamonds, just now with the bonus ending of crafting pickaxes we can then enchant and sell for $150,000 to someone who can’t be bothered to make them for themselves. Between us, me and the boy have made <em>millions</em>, and perhaps far more importantly, we’ve had a brilliant time together in this equalizing environment during cold wintry mornings.</p> <p>Everything I loved about&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em> is relevant here, with that infinite possibility given a deeper, more resonant meaning through both the vulnerability and the sense of a shared space with the person I love most in the world. I can forget all that grimness of the mid-2010s and return to this splendid game in a way that feels meaningful, and rather more importantly, enormously fun. That weird Steve head sits sadly in the cupboard, this adumbration of a lost time, but it can be forgotten. I’ve got shears to enchant.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>It can be tempting, in an era where there are simply <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-09-26/the-video-game-industry-has-a-problem-there-are-too-many-games">way too many great games</a> coming out every month, to give into list inflation. Top 10s become top 25s. Top 25s become top 50s. By 2030, we might even see our first top 100 GOTY list. <em>Kotaku</em> has not been immune to the ebb and flow of year-end trends. <a href="https://kotaku.com/goty-best-games-2022-elden-ring-god-war-ragnarok-marvel-1849934499">In 2022</a>, we slimmed our best game picks down to 10. <a href="https://kotaku.com/goty-best-games-2024-astro-bot-dragon-age-star-wars-1851726357">In 2024</a>, we went all the way up to 15. Each list was correct in its own way, but sometimes annual rituals draw their strength from embracing tradition rather than changing with the times.</p> <p>To that end, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s top games of 2025 list this year will go back to straddling the Goldilocks GOTY middle ground <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-12-best-video-games-of-2015-1750944200">of 12 best games</a>. We are still ranking them and describing why each made the cut, but we have gone out of our way to limit ourselves to promoting what we feel are the best of the best. Lists are defined as much by what gets left off of them as anything else. Those painful sacrifices at the bottom of the cut-off are not in vain. They give the rest of the list its juice. So without further ado, here are<em> Kotaku</em>‘s best games of 2025.</p>

 <hr> <h2>12. <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000656427" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656427"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656427">Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <p>Games are partly defined by the actions they allow. Hand the controller to someone who rarely plays games and you’ll quickly see reasonable assumptions about exploration and play collide with the idiosyncratic limitations of games many of us take for granted. “Why can’t I go there? Why can’t I do this?” For decades, platformers have been oriented around moving through carefully calibrated environments. Fancy Rube Goldberg machines that nevertheless remains static under the hood.</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-destructible-environments-ocd-1851786630"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></a> turns everything on its head with one simple transgression that has huge consequences: what if you could break stuff? It’s a question so bold, the game comes with a level reset button baked in because the possibilities are so chaotic you could very well wreck your playthrough. The results are endlessly rewarding though, letting you dig tunnels, stack bridges, and continually uncover secrets where most games are, by design, hellbent on never letting you go. The arsenal of power-ups Donkey Kong unlocks, combined with sprawling, freeform environments, leads to an uneven but irresistible sandbox that not only reinvigorates the franchise but breaks new ground in one of gaming’s oldest, most well-worn genres. <span>—</span>&nbsp;Ethan Gach</p>

 <hr> <h2>11. <em>Pokémon Legends Z-A</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000656177" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656177"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656177">Game Freak</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Admittedly, I went into </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>’s Game of the Year discussions fully ready to let </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a> <span>fall off the list. But when we actually sat down, I was surprised that an actual argument for its placement just started flowing out of me.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games are always met with a barrage of criticism, both merited and unmerited, because Game Freak and The Pokémon Company are carrying the world’s biggest sack of cash on their back with the most profitable franchise in the world in their hands and still aren’t releasing games with the same level of scale and polish as other AAA games.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Eventually, after the dust has settled and people look back on them, plenty of games that are met with harsh criticism upon release get a reassessment. So let’s skip to that part: </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>is perhaps the most impressive, holistic reimagining the series has seen in probably all of its nearly 30 years.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Legends Z-A</span></i><span>’s focus on one city means that it lacks the typical “journey” that’s always been synonymous with </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>, but Game Freak uses that smaller stage to home in on everything it’s done well in the Switch era. Its real-time battle system is one of the most transformative changes Game Freak has ever brought to these games, and while yes, there will always be a place for the series’ classic turn-based combat, I would love to see this approach become a foundation for not only </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-leak-generation-10-wind-wave-galar-legends-mmo-2000635337"><span>future </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games</span></a><span>, but also for a competitive scene that mixes timing, parrying, dodging, and more into its battles.</span></p> <p><span>Beyond the battles, </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>doubles down on Game Freak’s recent dedication to narrative and character work, bringing together one of its most memorable casts of weirdos yet and letting you stick with them through the game’s entire run</span><span>. It’s a rich space for </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>to get contemplative, examining everything it’s ever done in the name of catching ‘em all.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>is the result of a team let off the leash and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-leak-video-old-build-teraleak-window-2000655988"><span>looking to do something more than it’s been allowed</span></a><span> to do for decades. Like the game’s Urban Redevelopment plan meant to bring people and Pokémon together in harmony, it may just be another experiment in Game Freak’s journey to figuring out what the future of the franchise looks like, but I hope </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>turns out to be a more foundational moment for the next 30 years. Or at least a sign that more big swings like it are on the way. — Kenneth Shepard</span></p>

The obvious tells such work used to contain became increasingly rare, and so we sometimes had to squint harder, had to do more research, to be sure that clip circulating on Bluesky of someone telling off ICE agents in a particularly satisfying way or tearfully reuniting with their dog was real, and not just footage fabricated purely to manipulate our emotions.</p> <p><i data-stringify-type="italic">Blippo+&nbsp;</i>would have been an extraordinary game in any year, but it felt particularly resonant in this one because it’s just so exuberantly, unabashedly, undeniably human, a collaborative work made by very creative people. It’s lively and weird and smart and queer and hopeful. It’s also an innovative and exciting exercise in storytelling and worldbuilding. In&nbsp;<i data-stringify-type="italic">Blippo+</i>, you watch the TV broadcasts of an alien planet whose slate of programming includes game shows, talk shows, science shows, sci-fi sitcoms, news programming, cooking shows, celebrity gossip shows, and so on. Through them, you experience a gradual process of discovery, learning more about this planet that’s both very similar to and very different from our own, and getting attached to the personalities who speak to you from beyond the galactic bend.</p>

 <p>As time passes, a story unfolds of an event that shakes Blippian culture to its core. The game has plenty to say about possibilities for change in our culture, too, and how technology and media can be tools of the status quo, or mechanisms for disruption and progress. It’s timely, unique, and terrifically entertaining. And I’m still sad that I don’t have any more episodes of&nbsp;<i data-stringify-type="italic">Werf’s Tavern&nbsp;</i>to watch. <span>—</span> Carolyn Petit</p> <hr> <h2>8. <em>Avowed</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000656169" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656169"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656169">Obsidian Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p>It might not be the biggest open-world RPG ever made, but&nbsp;<i data-stringify-type="italic">Avowed&nbsp;</i>is one of the best precisely because it excises so much of the usual fluff and gunk so often featured in these kinds of games and focuses on snappy action, fantastic writing, memorable companions, and excellent world-building. <span>— </span>Zack Zwiezen</p> <h2>7. <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000656428" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656428"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656428">FromSoftware</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The premise of <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em> sounds like a bizarre fan mod but in practice it’s one of the most satisfying, challenging, and inventive multiplayer action games around.

A less bold developer could have played it safe and tried to create something simple and palatable for a wide audience, but </span><i><span>The Hundred Line </span></i><span>is an incredibly bold Hail Mary that leaves it all on the line, and it’s one of the most impressive games of 2025 and of the visual novel genre because of it.</span></p> <p><i><span>The Hundred Line </span></i><span>is a dense tribute to the genre, with 100 endings and dozens of routes that cover multiple visual novel staples, from zombie horror to a more tongue-in-cheek harem story, all within the confines of the war one group of high school students must fight with an incoming alien invasion. Though routes varies in quality, they are all, at least, baseline good and riff in some profound ways on the game’s core premise.

 <p><span>All of these threads and timelines are held together by tactical battles that may not reach the same tour-de-force level as the game’s branching storylines, but do employ a rock solid puzzle-like system that uses its large cast of freaks and weirdos to great effect, giving them each singular battle styles that reveal just as much about these high schoolers locked in war as any branching timeline might.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Though it’s a dense tome of hope, despair, absurdity, and mystery that can be hard to recommend to the average person, the developers’</span><span> ambition of creating one of the largest visual novels ever, with dozens of routes spanning multiple genres all while funneling into the core mystery, is so bold it demands respect. But perhaps the most admirable part about it is that Too Kyo Games actually pulled it off. Having a bold idea that you even attempt to put on a Switch cartridge can get you pretty far, but </span><i><span>The Hundred Line </span></i><span>didn’t just try to become one of the most ambitious games of its genre.

It’s a turn-based RPG that marries </span><i><span>Final Fantasy</span></i><span>’s grandiose storytelling and magical battle systems with </span><i><span>Paper Mario</span></i><span>’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscure-parry-sakapetate-chromatic-troubadour-1851781507"><span>timing-based mechanics</span></a><span> to make something that is both strategic and engaging enough to make even the classic RPG grind </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscure-expedition-33-stendahl-maelle-build-nerf-1851779728"><span>entertaining and rewarding</span></a><span>.

The game’s cast of sad boys and girls walking into what is ostensibly a suicide mission have endeared themselves to fans of a genre that will carry their flags for years to come in art, cosplay, and other fan creations.</span></p>

 <p><span>All of these lovingly crafted systems and stories are coming from a debut game by a new studio full of industry talent that had become dissatisfied at the big studios where they previously worked, and it’s already being mentioned in conversations alongside genre staples like </span><i><span>Persona </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Final Fantasy</span></i><span>, and…oops. Maybe I’m susceptible to The Narrative, too. It is a juicy one. A team of talented developers, writers, and artists who left big publishers like Ubisoft to do their own thing, making games that look like the big-budget efforts people still want but without the meddling of a publisher trying to inject some live-service grind into them, and being rewarded with success and acclaim does feel like the antidote to problems plaguing the industry. If nothing else, perhaps it’s a sign that more games like it are possible, and if we do get more such games, then perhaps this one will become less of a golden idol for a community looking for proof that the industry’s future isn’t as bleak as it once felt, and it can finally be appreciated solely based on what a stunning debut it is. — Kenneth Shepard</span></p>      </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/the-12-best-video-games-of-2025-2000656161]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>2025 has seen AI dominate various forms of media, leading to a significant impact across the entire spectrum of the world, including the gaming industry. However, this is merely the tip of the iceberg, and the impact is likely to intensify in 2026.</p>



<p>The past 12 months have seen AI become increasingly prominent in gaming, ranging from additions like an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-faces-unfair-labor-practice-charge-for-use-of-ai-darth-vader-voice/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI-voiced Darth Vader in For</a>tnite to a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ai-game-playable-demo-codex-mortis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fully AI-generated game</a>, with a smattering of other controversies in between.</p>



<p>While these incidents have sparked discussions at various points of the year, 2025 is set to be only a drop in the ocean for AI in video games, and a huge crossroads lurks ahead.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-major-turning-point">A Major Turning Point</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Controversial. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s important to remember that AI in video games isn’t anything new, and the fact of the matter is, games would simply not be able to run without some AI. All of the enemy soldiers you defeat in a Call of Duty campaign, the opponents you come up against in single-player in EA FC 26, and the NPCs you meet across the vast worlds require AI, in some capacity, to work.</p>



<p>The turning point, however, has been how AI is being used. Rather than using AI to support human-created elements, that step is being skipped in many cases to reduce the workload and have AI do the creation, where it’s artwork to coding. While it’s a crucial tool that can help prevent crunch at studios, controversy remains about its use and whether it will ultimately cost people their jobs.</p>



<p>Using AI as a replacement for human work has been problematic, and gamers have a keen eye to spot where AI has been used, particularly in artwork, with accusations cast towards a slew of major games for certain aspects of work published in 2025.</p>



<p>The discovery of AI use in 2025 has led to backlash, including the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indie-game-awards-disqualifies-clair-obscur-expedition-33-gen-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indie Game Awards disqualifying Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> for generative AI usage and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-under-fire-suspected-ai-art/">Battlefield 6 coming und</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-under-fire-suspected-ai-art/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">er</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-under-fire-suspected-ai-art/"> fire</a> for suspected use of AI in cosmetic items, and the big question now is how long that furore will last.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-the-backlash-ease">Will The Backlash Ease?</h2>



<p>Heading into 2026, using AI, particularly generative AI, is somewhat of a death note, as it’s certain to cause backlash among gamers, and there’s no hiding any usage, as players don their detective gear to uncover the truth of whether AI has been used in assets. Essentially, it’s a PR nightmare.</p>



<p>What’s unclear is whether that backlash will remain, as the growing use of AI may eventually be the norm, rightly or wrongly. When used in the right way to support developers and ease tasks, AI is a handy tool, but it’s hard to look across the wealth of layoffs in the industry in recent years and see higher-ups not viewing AI as a handy cost-cutting measure.</p>



<p>This isn’t restricted to gaming, as the use of AI has attracted huge criticism in all forms of media, while it also has both environmental and political impacts. For now, the general view of AI is a negative one, but don’t be surprised if millions upon millions is splashed to try and alter public opinion.</p>



<p>AI use is not a problem unique to gaming, but the future does look bleak, particularly for those employed in a creative industry. Unfortunately, there are no signs of the problem going away, and 2026 could be the stage for a major shift.</p>

<p>"Dare to peek into the darkness"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="9fc5b88a3b048"><a title="Cronos: The New Dawn" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9fc5b88a3b048/cronos-the-new-dawn.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Bloober Team</em></figcaption></figure><p>Bloober Team has become really bloomin' prolific in recent years, having released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> and a Switch 2 port of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/layers-of-fear-the-final-masterpiece-edition">Layers of Fear</a> in 2025, with none other than <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill_2">Silent Hill 2</a> the year prior. It's currently hard at work on a remake of the original <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill">Silent Hill</a> with Konami alongside an original title simply called '<strong>Project M</strong>' for the time being for the Switch and Switch 2.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, it's entirely possible that Project M is the focus of a new tease from Bloober Team, with the studio launching a new website featuring a countdown timer. The timer runs out on <strong>15th February</strong> and, according to our pals over at <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2026/01/industrious-horror-dev-bloober-team-teases-potential-new-project">Push Square</a>, there are no hints towards anything Konami-related in the website's source code (and yes, we double-checked ourselves too, <em>just to be safe</em>).</p>
<p>The website itself is titled <a href="https://remosdneulserorehsoovamceyerd.com/">RemosdNeulSerorehsoOvamCeyerd.com</a>, which means... something..? It's all rather vague at the moment – deliberately so, no doubt. A social media post linking to the site also states "Dare to peek into the darkness.." So at the very least, it seems to be leaning heavily on Bloober's penchant for horror.</p>

<p>If this is indeed related to Project M, which is being published by Bloober's own subsidiary Broken Mirror Games, then there should be plenty to get excited about. The studio's CEO Piotr Babieno <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/horror-dev-bloober-team-on-its-new-exclusive-this-is-a-vision-that-could-only-exist-on-nintendo-hardware">recently stated</a> that the project is particularly geared toward "fans of <strong>Resident Evil</strong>, <strong>Silent Hill</strong>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/limbo">Limbo</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/eternal_darkness_sanitys_requiem">Eternal Darkness</a>", while being a vision that could "only exist on Nintendo hardware".</p>
<p>Curious, indeed. We'll be keeping a close eye on this as we inch toward 15th February, and we'll let you know if we hear anything new as soon as possible.</p>

              <p><span>Reader, do you know what frotting is? Don’t Google it if you’re on a work computer because the image results might get you in trouble, but </span><i><span>Heated Rivalry</span></i><span>, HBO Max’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/heated-rivalry-show-book-watch-cast-hockey-2000649249"><span>gay hockey romance</span></a><span>, revealed to me that a lot of people don’t know what that word means, and it was only when the hockey-playing twinks performed this sexual act on an episode of the show that some people were made aware that there was an actual word for two men rubbing their dicks together that wasn’t some joke like “sword fighting.”&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>As a gay man who has a lot of straight friends, a not-insignificant part of my longest friendships has been basically acting as a sex ed teacher for men who don’t know what sex looks like when the people involved have the same hardware. Now </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/heated-rivalry-show-episodes-book-gq-ratings-2000655368"><i><span>Heated Rivalry </span></i><span>has become such a cultural phenomenon</span></a><span> that it’s bridging the gap, especially for those who are mostly interested in the hockey side of it.</span></p> <p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/shepardcdr.bsky.social/post/3mba5dhe2bc2h"><i><span>Empty Netters</span></i></a><span> is a hockey podcast, and naturally when one of the biggest shows on streaming is about hockey players who also are knocking around sticks of a different kind, the hosts have gotta take advantage of the moment and cover the show. Hearing a group of straight men unpack the logistics of gay sex, such as roles like top, bottom, and versatile, and just being genuinely fascinated and non-judgmental, is easily a best-case scenario from fans of a sport that has </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/11/opinions/nhl-pride-tape-ban-coming-out-day-de-la-cretaz"><span>its history of homophobia</span></a><span>. Shoutout to these guys for the idea of making a custom coin for picking who’s going to do what in a verse couple. And they say imagination is dead.</span></p>   <p><span>A big part of </span><i><span>Heated Rivalry </span></i><span>is watching its leads in a constant, years-long push and pull as their paths infrequently cross due to hockey careers that have them traveling all over. Eventually, however, they end up in the same city, and then they have at it. It’s all presented with so much tension and drama that everyone watching the show, even straight men, are rooting for them to get it together and be more than a secret romance. There’s also a second couple with a similar struggle that gets its own dedicated episode, and seeing them finally reconcile is one of the few moments of unabashed catharsis the show, whose central couple is trapped in a will they/won’t they dynamic, has delivered. And it’s got straight men crying! Me too, brother.</span></p>         <p><span>Unfortunately, it’s not all positivity. If you search anywhere long enough, you’ll find homophobia directed at the show, and even on the queer side of things, some fans are questioning whether or not the actors playing the main roles are </span><a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/heated-rivalry-actors-gay-creator-shuts-down-question-1236596915/"><span>actually queer themselves</span></a><span>. Neither of these things are new for queer media, but you would think after </span><i><span>Heartstopper </span></i><span>fans essentially </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221031234200/https://twitter.com/kit_connor/status/1587218539236188160"><span>dragged one of its stars out of the closet</span></a><span>, these people would know better. As for me, I’ll enjoy the show on its own merits without having to interrogate strangers on their personal lives.</span></p> <p><i><span>Heated Rivalry </span></i><span>has been renewed for a second season, but if you want a glimpse into what comes next, the series is based on the </span><i><span>Game Changers</span></i><span> books by Rachel Reid.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[We’re Already Getting Our First Gaming Price Hike Of 2026]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/asus-rog-ally-price-increase-nvidia-amd-ai-ps6-delay-2000656448</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Asus has cracked the seal on price hikes just ahead of CES 2026. The electronics maker, which is responsible for a range of PC gaming hardware including the already $1,000 <a href="https://kotaku.com/rog-xbox-ally-x-review-performance-issues-steam-deck-switch-2-2000635652">ROG Xbox Ally X</a>, warned partners of “strategic price adjustments” for certain products starting January 5.</p> <p>The company didn’t specify which products would get more expensive or by how much, but it did blame the current AI arms race for the upwards pressure on pricing. “These changes reflect shifts in capacity allocation by upstream suppliers, higher investment costs for advanced manufacturing processes, and structural supply gaps created by rising AI compute demand,” executive Liao Yi-Xiang wrote in a December 30 letter that was <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/asus-officially-announces-price-hikes-from-january-5-right-before-ces-2026">translated by <em>Videocardz</em></a>.</p>

 <p>The company directly points to DRAM, NAND, and SSD component shortages as part of the issue. The announcement comes just days ahead of the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas where Asus and other hardware manufacturers will be revealing new hardware updates and other tech products.</p>

 <h2>Gaming shortages, price hikes, and next-gen console delays</h2> <p>Asus’ warning is the first hard evidence that 2026 will continue to see gaming get more expensive across the spectrum as major tech firms pivot to supplying ever-increasing demands for generative AI compute capacity. There were rumors throughout the end of 2025 that AMD and other companies were going to face shortages, with <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-prices-dram-amd-ai-shortage-2000646851">s</a><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-prices-dram-amd-ai-shortage-2000646851">ome hardware insiders</a> claiming that Microsoft’s Xbox would be among the hardest hit due to poor inventory management.</p>

 <p>According to<em> Insider Gaming</em>, the problem has gotten so bad that some hardware manufacturers are already discussing potential delays to next-gen hardware launches like the PlayStation 6 and new Xbox. “The situation has led console manufacturers to debate whether the next generation of consoles should be delayed from their intended 2027-2028 release window, with the hope that RAM manufacturers will be able to build out their infrastructure to produce more RAM, thereby allowing prices to drop,” it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ram-prices-next-gen/">reported last month</a>.</p>

 <p>More recently, <a href="https://mobile.newsis.com/view/NISX20251229_0003458273#_endPass">South Korea outlet <em>Newsis</em> reported</a> that Nvidia and AMD are already looking at significantly increasing GPU prices in 2026. The most eye-popping claim was that graphics cards like the $2,000 RTX 5090 could more than double in price to $5,000 by the end of the year. But even much smaller price increases of just a few hundred dollars would make PC gaming’s current affordability crisis continue to spiral out of control.</p>

 <p>Whatever the short-term impact on pricing for gaming components, the AI race has already remade companies like Microsoft and Nvidia, to the point where their non-AI business appears as a relative rounding error on the larger enterprise’s P&amp;L. Without a complete implosion of the gen AI market (never say never), <a href="https://kotaku.com/nvidia-nvda-ai-graphics-card-microsoft-stock-record-1851610332">it’s hard to see that changing any time soon</a>.</p>
