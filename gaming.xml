            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-ghosts-n-goblins-nes-arcade-error-2000649178"><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i></a><span> is nearly over, with its finale set to premiere on </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-warner-bros-acquisition-batman-hbo-2000651036"><span>Netflix</span></a><span> and in theaters on Wednesday, December 31. Its penultimate episode, “Chapter Seven: The Bridge,” included a scene that was a long time coming: Will (Noah Schnapp) finally coming out to his friends as gay after crushing hard on Mike (Finn Wolfhard). It turns out Will’s identity isn’t merely a footnote on his character sheet, but actually ends up playing a pretty major part in the show’s supernatural horror elements. Now, after years of keeping the truth to himself, Will has finally told all his friends and a few acquaintances who were just kinda around that he is a card-carrying boy liker, and the final scene has received a pretty…mixed response.</span></p> <p><span>So let’s break it down. Will, who has a psychic connection with series big bad Vecna, is in his feelings after finding out the monster has been using him as a spy since he returned from the&nbsp; Upside Down in </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span>’ first season. He also learns that his connection to this other world created the Upside Down tunnel system that formed underneath Hawkins National Laboratory in season 2, which “infected” the real world and led to the deaths of many innocent people.</span></p>

 <p><span>Later in the episode, he tells his mother about Vecna’s hostile takeover of his mind, and says that the villain sees “everything,” knowing his secrets and preying on his fears. So in order to beat Vecna, Will says he needs to give him one less secret to wield, and wants his friends and family to know the truth.</span></p>

 <p><span>Will sits down with a dozen people of varying importance to him and gives, well, a pretty straightforward coming-out confession of the sort that you’d expect from just about any well-meaning show from the early 2000s. He goes on about how he and all his friends are still the same except for one little detail: “I don’t like girls.” He says that he had a crush on someone he knew wouldn’t like him back, and that Vecna showed him a manufactured future in which this came between him and his friends, not because of bigotry, but because their overbearing worry for him makes him feel othered to the point of pushing them away.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>As Will starts to cry, his mother and friends, one by one, promise that they’re not going anywhere and then give him a big group hug. It’s sweet, but maybe a bit overwrought for modern sensibilities? There’s a lot to unpack about this moment and how it may or may not land.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is so fucking absurd I can’t <a href="https://t.co/XkOJQEhjkL">pic.twitter.com/XkOJQEhjkL</a></p> <p>— َ (@janehopz) <a href="https://twitter.com/janehopz/status/2004430176176984386?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>For some, there’s just some absurdity to seeing most of the cast of </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>lined up to listen to Will tell everyone he has a crush on another friend in the room, and it also doesn’t help that much of the cast is just not reacting much at all to the revelation. But I don’t think that the silliness of the scene is the only issue.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>By 2025, it feels like some queer people may have become a bit jaded toward the traditional coming-out story. It’s certainly still a universal part of queer experience, but when it’s often the only lens through which mainstream media views the queer experience, a young twink tearfully telling his bros he’s “still the same” as he always was probably isn’t going to land with queer viewers the way it once would have. On the contrary, some queer people don’t find comfort in stories where a gay character only finds solidarity if they focus on how they are the “same” as their cishet friends. I’d rather see stories about that support not being given under the condition of what makes me similar to others, when it should be offered regardless.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>In the case of </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span>, I think I’m willing to offer it some grace because it is ultimately an ‘80s period piece, and even though the Stonewall Riots happened nearly 20 years prior, there was still a lot of work to be done in 1987. So if 16-year-old Will has no other framework to communicate his truth to his friends in the late ‘80s, fair enough. Especially if there are still young people living in small towns like Hawkins who are watching shows like </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span> and still at that stage in their lives.</span></p> <p><span>That said, the ‘80s setting does have some fans wondering where the hell this universal acceptance is coming from. Yeah, you could argue the </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>gang has been through so much that they don’t have time for homophobia, but when has an apocalypse ever been enough to make a bigot admit to the error of their ways? I don’t know, it’s an awkward line to walk when you’re including queer characters in your story. If you show a completely accepting universe, you run the risk of coming off as inauthentic, but if you portray the reality of the queer experience, you will inevitably have the most online armchair consultant calling your work a moral failing to the gays you hope to represent. Everyone’s got their preferences, but as hokey as the scene might be, I have a hard time viewing it as anything other than well-meaning.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">the concept of having like 10 people in a room in the 1980’s, coming out to them, and not a singular one is homophobic 😭 </p> <p>no shade is that why erica wasn’t in the scene 😭😭 <a href="https://t.co/qNfAzccG1f">https://t.co/qNfAzccG1f</a></p> <p>— Base (@outsoldnation) <a href="https://twitter.com/outsoldnation/status/2004580048809123856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>The bigger problem I have with the scene is one many people are having with </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span>’ final season, which is that the writing is so straightforward and inelegant that you have to wonder if Netflix is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-5-bad-dialogue-clips-video-will-mike-2000651378"><span>actually telling writers to dumb down their work</span></a><span> for the people who are always on their damn phones. </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>has reasonably complex mythology and lore, so I don’t think anyone who’s still invested after five seasons needs to have dialogue mashed up and spoonfed to them like they’re a baby, but that proclivity feels pretty apparent in this scene. At the very least, the polarizing moment has got the shitpost pipeline flowing.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[BetterVR Mod Lets You Experience Breath of the Wild in VR, And You Should Grab It Before Nintendo Tries to Kill It]]></title>

            <guid>1393858</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Five years ago, in the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, a developer known as Crementif started to work on a VR mod so they could cut down trees in the <strong>Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</strong>. After they figured out how to cut down trees in VR in Breath of the Wild, they kept working on it, and that initial idea became <strong>BetterVR</strong>, a full VR mod for Breath of the Wild that will let you experience the expansive world of Hyrule for the first time all over again. Until Nintendo tries to kill it, that is.</p>



<p>A trailer for the mod was released by Crementif and Flat2VR Studios just two days prior to its release today, announcing the mod and showcasing just how impressive it is - and it is incredibly impressive. The mod <a href="https://github.com/Crementif/BotW-BetterVR">is currently available to download</a>, and it works with a copy of Breath of the Wild for the Wii U that has been emulated and can run on your PC through Cemu version 2.6.</p>



<p>Though, as comments on the trailer and everywhere else Crementif's story has been shared point out, you'll want to get your hands on this mod and get it set up before Nintendo tries to kill it with their legal team. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Zelda BOTW VR Mod Trailer - Releasing In 2 Days!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XDuxoo0kNsc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Nintendo's litigious history is well known, whether <a href="https://wccftech.com/ryujinx-switch-emulator-is-dead-too-taken-down-by-nintendo-like-yuzu/">it is striking down entire emulators</a>, mods <a href="https://wccftech.com/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-multiplayer-mod-creators-attacked-by-nintendo-through-copyright-strikes/">for games like Breath of the Wild</a>, or trying to <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-patent-on-summoning-and-battling-characters-re-examination-by-us-patent-office/">stretch the meaning of a patent to take out major competitors in the industry</a>. It wouldn't be a surprise if Flat2VR Studios and Crementif were contacted by Nintendo soon, if they haven't already.</p>



<p>Of course, Nintendo will not necessarily go after this mod over the scores of mods available for Breath of the Wild - <a href="https://wccftech.com/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-modded-ray-tracing/">like this one that adds ray tracing and makes the eight-year-old game look brand new</a> -  it's just something that's always a concern when projects like this pop up. So, in the meantime, if you have the necessary hardware and know-how to set this mod up for yourself, you'd do well to get it downloaded and ready, just in case something happens to it.</p>

<figcaption>GOG is being acquired by one of its co-founders.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In an accompanying FAQ, the GOG team says Kiciński wants to "preserve and grow the original philosophy behind GOG", namely to "preserve the classics of the past, celebrate standout games of today, and help shape the classics of tomorrow".</p><p>The team says that nothing about your GOG account or library will change, and that games released on the platform will remain free of DRM. Not only that, but your tips and GOG Patron contributions won't be shared with Kiciński or "any other party".</p><p>Contrary to what you might think this means, GOG says it isn't "financially unstable"; quite the contrary, in fact. The team says it's "had a really encouraging year" and that gamers have shown "more enthusiasm" towards its preservation mission than ever before.</p><p>In short, then, it sounds like nothing about the material GOG experience will change for you, but that ownership has shifted from <em>Cyberpunk </em>and <em>The Witcher </em>parent company CD Projekt to a single individual.</p>

              <p>After nearly 20 years of operation, digital video game storefront GOG is no longer a part of <em>Witcher 3 </em>and <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> developer CD Projekt Red. It is now fully owned by one of CDPR’s co-founders who also helped launch GOG.</p> <p>On December 29, <a href="https://www.gog.com/pressroom/cd-projekt-co-founder-michal-kicinski-acquires-gog-from-cd-projekt/">CDPR announced via a press release</a> that its Steam-like storefront, GOG, has been fully acquired by CDPR co-founder Michał Kiciński. As part of the deal, Kiciński now owns 100 percent of GOG’s shares after purchasing them for 90 million PLN or about 25 million USD. The deal didn’t involve the co-founder selling any of his shares in CDPR.</p> <p>“GOG and Michał Kiciński are aligned by a shared belief that games should live forever,”&nbsp;said GOG managing director Maciej Gołębiewski.&nbsp;“In a market that’s getting more crowded, more locked-in, and forgets classic games at an increasing pace, we’re doubling down on what only GOG does: reviving classics, keeping them playable on modern PCs, and helping great games find their audience over time.”</p>

 <p>Launched in October 2008, GOG (originally known as Good Old Games) was started as a place for retro games to be sold by various publishers and developers. The store offers titles with no DRM and has since expanded greatly, selling new and old games while also <a href="https://kotaku.com/gog-games-preservation-program-drm-1851696363">starting an ambitious preservation program</a> to help keep dated games running on modern hardware without publisher support.</p>

 <p>As to why CDPR is selling GOG now, joint CEO Michał Nowakowski says the company has an “<em>ambitious development roadmap”</em> and plans to expand the studio’s franchises, so it made sense to split GOG off and let CDRP focus on its own projects.</p>

 <p>“For a long time now, GOG has been operating independently. Now it’s going into very good hands — we are convinced that with the support of Michał Kiciński, one of GOG’s co-founders, its future will be full of great projects and successes,<em>“</em> said Nowakowski.</p>

 <p>While CDPR will no longer own GOG, it confirmed plans to continue to release its new games on the digital storefront. So, at least for now, it seems like nothing will be changing for players as GOG goes fully independent.</p>

              <p data-start="0" data-end="546">The trend of most software companies in the last decade has been to switch operations over to a subscription-based model, where you pay monthly for access to the latest features and updates. Microsoft, for example, offers its Office suite through Microsoft 365, which requires an ongoing monthly payment. While this model keeps you up to date with the newest software and app updates, it also means you’re committing to paying for it forever. There’s something much more appealing to just paying for a thing once and then owning it, which is why this Microsoft Office deal is very exciting. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6602/">For a limited time, StackSocial is offering Microsoft Office 2024 Home for both Windows and Mac at a significant discount—up to 40% off.</a></p>
<p data-start="0" data-end="546">The offer includes doesn’t include the full Microsoft Office suite, just the big three. That’s Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. You can get the 2024 versions of this software for just $120 for a limited time. That’s down 20% from $150, saving your $30. If you really need Outlook as well, perhaps operating a small business out of home and are looking for alternatives to Gmail, then you can get the Home &amp; Business bundle which adds on Outlook to the other three. That package is 40% off which brings it from $250 to just $150.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6602/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at StackSocial</a></p>

<h2 data-start="548" data-end="585"><strong data-start="548" data-end="585">One-Time Payment, Lifetime Access</strong></h2>
<p data-start="1500" data-end="1745">This is the 2024 suite for Microsoft Office applications. They come with a lot of helpful features unique to 2024 and later versions. PowerPoint for instance now lets user record presentations from within the app. You can record voice, video, and closed captions. This is wonderful for teachers uploading courses for online classes as well as really any business presentation that’d be helpful to be able to reference back to later again and again.</p>


<p data-start="1747" data-end="2244">Once you purchase the software, you can immediately download and install it. After completing your order, you will receive an email with your software license keys and download links. The license is tied to your Microsoft Account—not your actual device—and is a one-time use code. Be sure to redeem your software within seven days of purchase, as all sales are final once the license is activated. Unredeemed licenses can be returned within seven days for a refund.</p>
<p data-start="2246" data-end="2621">If you’re setting up a new laptop or desktop and want to avoid the hassle of monthly fees, this is what you want over Microsoft 365. For just $120, you can get lifetime access to the 2024 versions of Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. You can add in Outlook for just $30 more. The deal is available to both Windows and Mac users.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you really liked the recent <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake and <a href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-f-review-horror-konami-hinako-ryukishi07-2000627505">this year’s <em>Silent Hill f</em></a> and are still craving more foggy survival horror, well, I’ve got some good news for you. Konami has no plans to slow down now and wants to release at least one game a year in the series moving forward. Nothing bad ever happens when a franchise becomes annual, right?</p> <p>In a recent interview with <em><a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202512/61923">Famitsu</a>,</em> <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/japanese-game-creators-discuss-2026-ambitions">as translated by <em>Gematsu</em></a>, Silent Hill series producer Motoi Okamoto talked about the franchise’s current state and claimed that after releasing two critically acclaimed best-selling <em>Silent Hill</em> games in the last two years, the franchise is “back on track.” And it now sounds like we’ll be returning to the foggy streets of Silent Hill about once a year, assuming everything goes to plan.</p>

 <p>“Including both announced and unannounced [<em>Silent Hill</em> games], we’re aiming for a release pace of about one title per year,” Okamoto told <em>Famitsu</em> in its end-of-the-year issue. “I’m not sure how much of that we’ll be able to realize, but I’ll continue to do my best as producer of the <em>Silent Hill</em> series. Ideally, we’d like to keep excitement around the <em>Silent Hill</em> series going at all times. We’re working hard to share new updates, so I’d appreciate it if you could wait just a little longer.”</p>

  <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-2-remake-bloober-review-ps5-pc-horror-2024-1851665482">Before the excellent <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake in October 2024</a>, the survival horror franchise had fallen into disrepair, with very few new entries, and the few games that did arrive were generally disappointing. Remember 2023’s <em>Silent Hill Accession</em>, that interactive livestream…thing? Bleh. And before that, the last real <em>Silent Hill</em> game we got was <a href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-downpour-made-you-the-monster-1832640116">2012’s <em>Downpour</em></a>, a forgettable and bland horror game that basically put the series on ice for a decade.</p>

 <p>Now, in 2025 and after two great games,<em> Silent Hill</em> is in a great place, and while I’m nervous about it becoming an annual franchise, I think <em>Silent Hill 2</em> and <em>f</em> show a path forward that could make this work. If different studios are brought in and allowed to play around with the franchise’s past as well as take it in new directions, we might be in for a golden age of <em>Silent Hill</em> games. And that seems to be Konami’s plan, <a href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-remake-2-f-bloober-team-cronos-2000630590">with a <em>Silent Hill 1</em> remake</a> in development as well as <a href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-ps5-townfall-ascension-konami-bloober-1849679202">a mysterious project, <em>Townfall.</em></a> Or maybe the franchise is about to fly off the rails again.</p>

Even the camera perspective and the way the camera moves during battle rekindles memories of Sandfall Interactive’s hugely popular RPG.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Sword and Fairy 4 Remake - Official Trailer “Unpredictable Divine Will” is here!

The first game launched in 1995 for PC and enjoyed critical and commercial success across China. Many sequels and spinoffs have followed in the years since.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Legend of Sword and Fairy 4 is in fact the fifth installment in the mainline video game franchise, and acts as a prequel to the third game. The latest game, The Legend of Sword and Fairy 7, came out in 2021 as the ninth mainline entry on PC, with an English version released for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X and S in 2022 under the name Sword and Fairy: Together Forever. It was seen as an alternative to the recent mainline Final Fantasy games, which of course inspired Clair Obscur: Expedition 33’s development.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans are drawing a line from Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 to Sword and Fairy 4 Remake, and some are accusing its developer of copying Sandfall’s game. “Totally not copy and paste combat, style, parry, from Clair Obscur Expedition 33,” said one commenter. "Is this DLC of Expedition 33?" said another. "We got Expedition-like genre now," added another fan. Others, however, are saying Sword and Fairy 4 Remake just looks like a modern turn-based RPG in the Persona style, and are pointing to previous entries in the series as evidence of its credentials.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">The first E33-like is already on its way from China and it's through the announcement of the remake of "Legend of Sword and Fairy 4". <a href="https://t.co/jfiVnNn42X" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/jfiVnNn42X</a></p>— Dream's Longest Day (@Dreamboum) <a href="https://twitter.com/Dreamboum/status/2005499063819800626?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 29, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Cube Game has said an English version of the trailer will be revealed in the coming days by a “regional publisher.” We’ll hopefully learn more about Sword and Fairy 4 Remake then.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, meanwhile, is enjoying a new surge of interest off the back of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-storms-the-game-awards-2025-wins-coveted-game-of-the-year">a record-breaking haul from The Game Awards 2025</a>, where it took home the coveted Game of the Year.

            <p>Michał Kiciński, co-founder of CD Projekt, has acquired 100 percent ownership of GOG, the DRM-free digital games store.</p>

<p>"The mission stays the same: Make Games Live Forever," the company said.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>GOG is entering a new chapter.</p><p>Michał Kiciński, co-founder of CD PROJEKT and GOG, has acquired GOG from CD PROJEKT.</p><p>The mission stays the same: Make Games Live Forever.</p><p>Going back to our roots allows us to double down on what we do best: reviving classics, giving you a library…</p></div>— GOG.COM (@GOGcom) <a href="https://twitter.com/GOGcom/status/2005675068295127375?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 29, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>"CD Projekt and GOG share the same roots and values: freedom, independence, and a genuine sense of ownership. I believe that CD Projekt, with its exceptional AAA games, will stand, as always, behind the GOG offering - making GOG the best place on the planet to purchase The Witcher and Cyberpunk games, both existing titles and the new ones we all anticipate so much," Kiciński said.</p><p>"As a mature gamer, I often play classic games myself and deeply admire the creativity behind many of them. I truly believe that well-crafted classics can deliver as much joy as new releases. When it comes to pure playability, timeless games often prove to be really the safe choice, especially in a market flooded with gazillions of low-quality smaller games. Beyond preserving classics, GOG has always sought out new games with a retro spirit. I am personally involved in the development of a few games like that and they will certainly make their strong appearance on GOG in 2026."</p>
<p>Michał Nowakowski, joint CEO of CD Projekt, added: "With our focus now fully on an ambitious development roadmap and expanding our franchises with new high-quality products, we felt this was the right time for this move. For a long time now, GOG has been operating independently. Now it's going into very good hands - we are convinced that with the support of Michał Kiciński, one of GOG's co-founders, its future will be full of great projects and successes."</p>
<p>As part of the deal, GOG has signed a distribution agreement with CD Projekt, including a plan to release all CD Projekt Red's upcoming games on GOG.</p>
<p>GOG is, of course, one of few digital distributors that permitted Santa Ragione's controversial horror, Horses, to go on sale. Following Valve and Epic Game Stores' decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-responds-with-additional-context-following-horses-steam-ban-controversy">ban developer Santa Ragione's narrative horror game Horses</a>, rival storefront GOG weighed in, saying it wanted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/players-should-be-able-to-choose-the-experiences-that-speak-to-them-steam-rival-gog-weighs-in-amid-horses-ban-controversy">"to give players the freedom to choose what they play, and [give creators] the space to bring their artistic work to them</a>."</p><p>GOG also fights to preserve games. Announcing its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-announces-preservation-program-aims-to-maintain-game-compatibility-with-modern-and-future-systems">Preservation Program</a> in November last year, the company said it wants to maintain the compatibility of games with modern and future systems. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-joins-europes-largest-organisation-dedicated-to-game-preservation">GOG also joined the European Federation of Game Archives, Museums and Preservation Projects</a> (EFGAMP) as it continues to push for game preservation.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Hopefully, many of you are enjoying an end-of-year break over the holidays, but even if you're back at the coalface before the new year arrives, we recommend making time to check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJvpRGibFhg">this fascinating new overview documentary</a> of the NES' US launch from Frank Cifaldi and the folks over at the Video Game History Foundation.</p>
<p>Building on his years of research, and following on from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2WDfsiLiRA">the excellent panel</a> at the Portland Retro Gaming Expo back in October (featuring NOA veterans Gail Tilden, Lance Barr, and Bruce Lowry - we'll embed the archived video at the bottom of the page), this new 45-minute video went live on Christmas Day and explores the ins and outs of the Famicom's journey to the US, its transformation into the Nintendo Entertainment System, and how its New York test market launch set the system up for monster success in the second half of the 1980s.</p>
<p>Cifaldi presents a condensed timeline of events, bringing together materials from the VGHF's archive with other sources for a brilliant, fresh look at a story you may think you know well. Starting when an initial deal with Atari fell through, which led to Minoru Arakawa and his Nintendo of America team wondering if they themselves had the means and wherewithal to bring the system to the US, Cifaldi highlights discouraging feedback from various rounds of focus group testing and advice, which NOA thankfully ignored.</p>
<p>Nintendo fans may believe there's nothing new to say about this much-told story, but the VGHF team does a great job of working in new tidbits and putting the record straight on points you <em>think</em> you know.</p>
<figure data-uuid="d2cf678c1256a"><a title="NES" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d2cf678c1256a/nes.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>For instance, yes, Lance Barr headed the industrial design for the Westernised Famicom hardware (using Bang &amp; Olufsen's sleek hi-fi gear as inspiration for the shell), but did you know that the thick 'brick' we all know and love — well, we all know it, at least — was actually the work of NCL's engineers riffing on Barr's efforts?</p>
<p>The team at Nintendo's Japanese parent company, worried about dust getting into the slot of a top-loading console, took Barr's sexier, B&amp;O-inspired design (known as the AVS before it became the NES) and bulked it out massively to include the front-loading cart mechanism. Barr himself was disappointed with the resulting 'lunchbox' when it appeared.</p>
<p>Even if you <em>did</em> know that already, you're guaranteed to find new info in the essay. The 45 minutes fly by, it ties up the opening Atari thread beautifully at the end, and we highly recommend settling down with it between now and the new year.</p>
<p>And if you're so inclined, head over to <a href="https://gamehistory.org/donate/">gamehistory.org/donate</a> to find the VGHF's Winter Fundraiser and support Frank and the team's excellent work.</p>

<p>It's time to say goodbye.</p>
<p>Well, not really. The massively popular Switch will live on in a way few other Nintendo consoles have done thanks to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible-guide-what-switch-games-cant-be-played">backwards compatibility</a>, a host of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/all-nintendo-switch-2-edition-games-upgrade-packs-and-free-performance-updates">free upgrades to existing games</a>, and a Switch 2 form factor that keeps everything about the previous console.

<p>However, assuming the games play as advertised and the upscaling doesn't bork 720p games on Switch 2's 1080p screen, then a great many of us will be retiring our trusty console - or donating it to someone else.</p>
<p>After eight long years, it's an emotional time, so we thought we'd take a look back at the system — or <em>systems</em> (the replacements, the Lites, the OLEDs we've added to the family) — that kept us going since 2017, though good and bad, sickness and health, 'til Switch 2 us part.</p>
<p>Let's take one last look at the Switches Nintendo Lifers will be packing away very soon...</p>
<h2>A life Switch-up (Alana Hagues, deputy editor)</h2>
<figure data-uuid="4c77861eeb56e"><a title="Nintendo Switch 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4c77861eeb56e/nintendo-switch-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>My floor isn't always this messy... — <em><span></span> Image: Alana Hagues / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's weird to think that I almost didn't get a Switch straight away. I felt burned by the Wii U's launch, so I was tentative about picking up another launch-day console. Then I got home from work on 3rd March 2017 and there was my mum, with a shiny new boxed Nintendo Switch and a copy of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Breath of the Wild</a>. The Switch was my very first 'adult' console — as in, it was the first new console I owned as an adult. And in the eight years since, I've had two OG models, a Lite, and three different OLEDs.</p>
<p>Those Switches have been my rock. I took my OG to two separate E3s. It was my companion for many plane and train rides. The Switch was there through a break-up, buying my first apartment, through the-year-we-don't-talk-about, waiting for me post-therapy. Importantly, my OLED was there for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_party_superstars">Mario Party</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Smash Bros.</a> sessions during my long-distance relationship, and it's here now after my move to America to live with my partner.</p>
<p>We have two OLEDs between us, so while one will probably be tucked away, the other will stay out for now. I can't quite say goodbye to the console just yet. I may reserve a lot of love for older systems, but the Switch is one of my favourites. I'm not sure I would be doing what I do now at Nintendo Life without the Switch. So, thank you, you lovely little tablet, you.</p>
<h2>Man's second-best friend (Ollie Reynolds, staff writer)</h2>
<figure data-uuid="6354d090c70ca"><a title="TEDDY" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6354d090c70ca/teddy.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>"What you doing, Dad?" — <em><span></span> Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I don't think I've gone through quite as many milestones in life as I have during the Switch's lifespan. Okay, granted, not many console generations have lasted as long as the Switch, but whatever.</p>
<p>Soon after March 2017, I moved into my first house with my then-girlfriend, who became my wife a few years later. We got a dog (Teddy, who some of you will have met in a few Nintendo Direct liveblogs), created a brand-new human, moved into a bigger home, and I started working my dream job here at Nintendo Life. Honestly, I owe the Switch a great deal.</p>
<figure data-uuid="036c05beb3449"><a title="Switch Lite" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/036c05beb3449/switch-lite.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unlike the 3DS, which wooed me with its excellent custom designs, I've stuck to owning just one of each Switch variant: the OG, the Lite, and the OLED. The original has, until now, festered in the garage after I haphazardly threw it in a box whilst moving house, and unfortunately it no longer charges. A regrettable action on my part.</p>
<p>My Lite has pretty much already gone to my daughter, and while she's still not quite old enough to understand how it all works, it'll be there for her in the coming months and years. As for the OLED, I dunno... I suspect I'll keep it as a kind of backup; something to potentially test out GameShare features in the future, or something. I'm hesitant to let it go.</p>
<p>All that's left to say is... thank you, Switch. Nostalgia keeps the GameCube pretty high up on my list of favourite consoles, but there's no denying that the Switch is probably Nintendo's greatest achievement.</p>
<h2>So long, partner (Jim Norman, staff writer)</h2>
<figure data-uuid="9880cdf03ad8f"><a title="Nintendo Switch 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9880cdf03ad8f/nintendo-switch-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Yes, that's how shocked I am that it's almost over — <em><span></span> Image: Jim Norman / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It comes as a shock to almost everyone that I tell, but I didn't get my first Switch until Christmas 2017. I was in my first year of uni at the time and, unsurprisingly, I didn't have a lot of spare money lying around to be splashing on the latest Zelda machine. And so, I patiently waited until ol' Saint Nick came a-calling, while the lineup grew and grew.</p>
<p>Over the next three years of studying, the console brought some of my happiest memories: Wrapping up Breath of the Wild in my gross student bedroom rather than dwelling on homesickness; pulling an all-nighter with my housemates to finish a collaborative runthrough of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/shaq-fu_a_legend_reborn">Shaq-Fu</a> (of all the games); sweating buckets with pals after a post-exams <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/just_dance_2021">Just Dance</a> party. The Wii was all about giving <em>everyone</em> the chance to play, and the Switch felt like it did it all over again.</p>
<p>That OG model, with its drifting Joy-Con and mysterious scratch on the back, got cashed in shortly after I started here at Nintendo Life and thought it only right to pick up a shiny new OLED to mark the occasion. I've kept this replacement in tip-top condition since, naturally, and will continue to do so long after my Switch 2 arrives.</p>
<p>It's only the threat of recency bias that keeps this wonderful hybrid from the top of my all-time favourite console list (where the DS currently sits), but I can see it sitting in pole position a few years down the line. So long, partner. You've been fantastic.</p>
<h2>An on, off, then fully-back-on-for-the-long-haul relationship (PJ O'Reilly, staff writer)</h2>
<figure data-uuid="f73b9ff24354c"><a title="OG Switch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f73b9ff24354c/og-switch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: PJ O'Reilly / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ah, my old mucker, which I haven't cleaned the dust off here for maximum effect. An ancient relic, this piece of early human history is actually my first Nintendo Switch (flanked by its siblings) and it still works. Probably. I'm not going to try it, just in case I release a curse and we have to get Brendan Fraser in (he's expensive since the Oscar).</p>
<p>Back in 2017, my mate got himself a Nintendo Switch and, for one of the first times ever, I decided to hold off a little on a new console launch, playing Breath of the Wild on my trusty Wii U, before finally realising I couldn't deal with the FOMO and capitulating. I then got very bored, very quickly. I'm not quite sure why — hard to remember anything that happened before COVID, innit — but I felt like the Switch wasn't going to be able to pull me away from shinier games on more powerful hardware. What a fool.</p>
<p>Fast forward a bunch of years and Switch, besides having given me a route — through freelance reviews — into my current full-time job at this lovely place, has easily become my favourite console of all time. So many great games, so many cherished family memories (my sons have grown up on Mario Kart 8 and Zelda, which I think we can all agree is the best start in life), it's been the final proof needed for me, as a (pro) gamer, that graphics, raw horsepower, and all that fancy stuff isn't what makes this medium really tick.</p>
<p>So, having said all of those very nice things, you'd think I'd <em>at least</em> be nice enough to dust it, after everything it's done for me. Why am I such a pig? A question for another time, perhaps.</p>
<h2>Gone with the drift (Gavin Lane, editor)</h2>
<figure data-uuid="c5b492959b006"><a title="Nintendo Switch 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c5b492959b006/nintendo-switch-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Not sure where the biro across the Capture button on that blue Joy-Con came from — <em><span></span> Image: Gavin Lane / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I've gone through three Switches in eight years. The first, a launch-day department store pickup, was donated to another family member when the better-battery version came out and I couldn't resist the tiniest of upgrades.</p>
<p>Then, when the OLED launched, I ended up swapping the better-battery one for my <em>original</em> launch-day Switch — the one I'd broken in with BOTW across four glorious weekend coach journeys throughout March '17 — which I've still got in the drawer. It's seen better days, and the rails don't hold the Joy-Con very well anymore (the same goes for my OLED), but it's still going.</p>
<p>I can't say what the future holds for them. It would be a shame for that OLED screen to go unused, but until my kids are older, these will probably stay in the drawer. One thing I <em>won't</em> be sad to see the back of is my drifting Joy-Con. I love the multicoloured lineup, but only two of the six pictured above function properly. Hmph.</p>
<p>But let's not let dodgy Joy-Con colour the memory of a little console that's become a part of the family. As with all family members, there's some crunchy with the smooth, but you wouldn't be without them. Goodnight, sweet Switch.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>And there we are. We salute these Switches as we commit their tablets to the cupboard.</em></p>
<p><em>Will you be hanging up your S1 Joy-Con completely in a few days? Are you getting a little emotional about bidding this console farewell and getting involved with the new, shiny model? We'd love to hear your journeys with your personal Switches below.</em></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2-release-date-cd-projekt-red-2030-polish-firm-predicts/</link>
            <guid>1393786</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>We know that the next game we'll see from <strong>CD Projekt RED</strong> is <strong>The Witcher 4</strong>, one of the most anticipated games <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-will-not-appear-at-the-game-awards-2025/">not at The Game Awards 2025</a>, and a game <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-wont-launch-until-2027-says-cd-projekt-red/">that we probably won't see until 2027</a>. After that, however, is a game that more recent CDPR fans are arguably looking forward to more: Project Orion. Otherwise known as the sequel to Cyberpunk 2077, and for now, also known as <strong>Cyberpunk 2</strong>.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/memory-crisis/">With the way RAM prices are going</a>, if your PC build is already behind on current releases, then you'll want to upgrade as soon as you can to ensure you're ready for The Witcher 4. With more than a year to prepare, that should be enough time to accumulate the parts you need and find a way to pay for them without having to mortgage your house. In the case of Cyberpunk 2? You'll have until 2030, according to Polish analyst firm Noble Securities.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/109480/cyberpunk-2-has-a-dollars400-million-budget-and-will-release-in-2030-polish-analyst-firm-predicts/index.html">TweakTown</a>, that's when the firm believes the game will release, with the firm specifically predicting a late 2030 release window. The firm also adds that the game will cost CD Projekt RED a whopping $419 million to make, and that it'll include a multiplayer mode. We've had <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-might-include-multiplayer/">previous reports that Cyberpunk 2 includes a multiplayer mode</a>, though to see it again here adds even more flame to that fire.</p>



<p>"<em>The desire to integrate multiplayer into production prompted us to extend our production time beyond the progress of work on the benchmark W4</em>," said <strong>Noble Securities analyst Mateusz Chrzanowski</strong> in an investor's note. "<em>As a result, the budget has increased to PLN 1.5 billion, and we expect the release in Q4 2030 (the 10th anniversary of CP277)."</em></p>



<p>For the sequel to arrive a decade later (and to have the release of The Witcher IV happen in between) would be quite the Cinderella story for CD Projekt RED. Not that the studio was down in the doldrums before Cyberpunk 2077 came out, but for Cyberpunk 2077 to have the release it did, and be fixed over the course of the next three years and have a complete redemption arc. Followed by what is hopefully a well-received release of The Witcher VI, and then the release of the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel would be a hell of a way to close out the decade since Cyberpunk 2077's launch.</p>



<p>Who knows if that's how the story will go, of course. There are also plenty of questions remaining around how multiplayer will be implemented and what exactly that will look like for a game that players would reasonably expect to be focused on a single-player campaign. We'll have to wait and see, but for now, a 2030 release is not at all a bad prediction, considering what we know about where CD Projekt RED's focus is currently being placed and <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-eclipses-35-million-copies-sold-cyberpunk-2077-sequel-scales-up/">the fact that work on the sequel is ramping up</a>. </p>

			<p>Other years, it's a quiet period for Strategy and Simulation games, making it difficult to even put together a selection of the best games from the genre. Thankfully, that's not the case with 2025, as there were some excellent strategy and simulation games released this year.</p>



<p>Some of those releases even came from the most popular franchises in the strategy and simulation gaming genre. With that said, here are our picks for the Best Strategy and Simulation Games in 2025. Also, make sure to vote for your pick at the end of the article.</p>

<h2 id="h-two-point-museum-10-10">Two Point Museum (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/two-point-museum-two-point-at-its-best/">10/10</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/tpm_tp-website_bg-image_3840x2160.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Two Point Museum. Image credit: SEGA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The Two Point series of simulation and management games has always been about creating fun and engaging environments for players to enjoy. It's not about testing your management skills to the brink or making you stress over how your colony (or in this case, museum) is operating. It's about leaning into chaos and comedic moments that make these games enjoyable.</p>



<p>Two Point Museum is a masterclass of a Two Point game, as it strikes all of those points perfectly without missing a beat. It is a bright, accessible management game that will keep you engaged all through its campaign and even further beyond that with its sandbox mode. It's a wonderful accomplishment and easily one of the year's best strategy and simulation games.</p>



<p>As Wccftech's review puts it, "<em>There were no frame issues, the game was incredibly accessible and easy to dive into, and didn't have that overwhelming factor that a lot of new sandbox games do. It brings in moments of comedy to break up tense moments, and the campaign helps ease you in to the mechanics little by little.</em>"</p>



<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-9-5-10">Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-classic-strategy-modern-upgrades/">9.5/10</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Final-Fantasy-Tactics-the-Ivalice-Chronicles.png"></a><figcaption><em>Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles. Image credit: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles is a return of a classic strategy game that fans have been dying for, and it absolutely did not disappoint when it arrived this past September. With the original Final Fantasy Tactics being known as one of the best Final Fantasy games in the series, and one of the best strategic role-playing games ever made, there was a lot of nostalgic weight on its shoulders <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-launches-on-september-20th/">when it was finally announced</a>.</p>



<p>It kept the story that players loved and gave it a boost with the Enhanced version, adding some solid voice acting with only a few minor changes to the script, though if it's not to your liking, you can always jump back to Classic mode to play nearly the exact same game you would have played back in 1998. Of course, you miss out on the quality of life improvements made in the Enhanced version, but it's the fact that you have the option for both that really matters when it comes to a game so beloved as this.</p>



<p>The Ivalice Chronicles doesn't try to fix what isn't broken with the game's already excellent gameplay and Job system, and on the Enhanced version, lets you dive even deeper than was previously possible, with a bit of added difficulty, while still staying true to a core feature of the original: you can still break the game wide open if you can figure out how.</p>



<p>As Wccftech's Francesco De Meo put it in his review, "<em>Decades after its original release, FINAL FANTASY TACTICS - The Ivalice Chronicles remains the golden standard for tactical role-playing games. Refined with excellent quality-of-life improvements that enhance its already deep gameplay and superb voice acting, the War of the Lions’ story and battles have never felt more engaging. While the modest visual overhaul and missing War of the Lions content may disappoint those seeking a true definitive edition, they are minor issues in an otherwise excellent reimagining.</em>"</p>



<h2 id="h-sid-meier-s-civilization-vii-8-10">Sid Meier's Civilization VII (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/civilization-vii-one-more-turn/">8/10</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Civilization-VII-Review-01-Header-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Civilization VII. Image credit: 2K</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Like Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles, the arrival of Civilization VII has been a long time coming. Not as long, of course, seeing as how the last Civilization game arrived in 2016, but nearly a decade between releases is still a long time to wait, especially if you weren't enamoured with the DLCs that came after the full release.</p>



<p>Which is what made the arrival of Civilization VII such an event, and such a divisive one at that. Not everyone has loved the changes made in the latest entry in what is arguably the most popular (or at least well-known) 4X strategy game in the industry. At the time of this writing, it still has a "Mixed" rating for user reviews on Steam. That said, it doesn't fall so far that it's not a good Civilization game, and to still be a good game in a series of filled with excellent games means Civilization is an easy entry in our best strategy and simulation games of the year.</p>



<p>As Wccftech's Chris Wray put it in his review, "<em>Civilization VII is a great game, that's the simple answer. With an improved city-building system, terrain features, and diplomacy, there is much to like in the new release of the three-and-a-half decade old franchise. However, long-time fans of the series will find some of the omissions, such as the ability to turn off victory conditions other than domination, limiting. This, and the rapid nature of the ages, will also leave some feeling that the epic nature of some longer games is altogether missing. Still, even with the games feeling a little rushed, the one-more-turn that makes Civilization one of the best series ever remains there.</em>"</p>



<h2 id="h-tempest-rising">Tempest Rising</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Tempest-Rising.png"></a><figcaption><em>Tempest Rising. Image credit: Slipgate Ironworks</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Tempest Rising might just be Command &amp; Conquer with a bit of different paint, but that's not really something worth complaining about when Command &amp; Conquer is nowhere to be seen. Developer Slipgate Ironworks saw a gap in the RTS world, and while it didn't fill it entirely with everything Tempest Rising does, it went far enough to scratch the itch for C&amp;C fans that hasn't been scratched for a long time.</p>



<p>Though its multiplayer didn't launch with a lot of fanfare, and its story mode isn't able to reach some of the C&amp;C iconic highs of the series, Tempest Rising doesn't try to fix a system that isn't broken and still delivers the fast-paced RTS gameplay that kept C&amp;C fans engaged for over three decades. </p>



<p>It's more than a good time for RTS fans and a can-not-miss game for anyone still waiting for a new C&amp;C.</p>







<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Mount-and-Blade-II-Bannerlord-War-Sails-Interview-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord - War Sails. Image credit: TaleWorlds Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord had already established itself as one of the premier cinematic options for medieval gameplay and warfare simulation and strategy, with a solid campaign and a wonderfully built world since its 1.0 release in 2022. Now, five years after its initial release, TaleWorlds Entertainment has expanded on the game with its largest and most significant update yet, a naval expansion.</p>



<p>It's not an exaggeration to say that the addition of War Sails changed the game for Mount &amp; Blade II. On top of changes to the map and to the layout of Caladria, adding a new battlefield that also adds new trade routes and ways for players to expand their empire has made an already strong game an even more complete offering.</p>



<p>As I said in my impressions of the expansion and the game when it arrived, "<em>War Sails is a more than solid expansion for Mount and Blade, laying an excellent foundation for future evolutions that I feel is particularly strong because of how welcoming it is to strategy-game newcomers.</em>"</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sony-is-offloading-its-soundbar-with-a-bass-reflex-speaker-at-its-lowest-price-as-clearance-extends-beyond-headphones-2000655858</link>
            <guid>1393774</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Sony S100F 2.0ch Soundbar with Bass Reflex Speaker is a low-profile bar-style soundbar intended to enhance TV audio by adding clarity and punch without taking up too much space on your media stand. This compact unit features a 2.0-channel system with a built-in tweeter and Bass Reflex design, which helps voices sound clearer and adds weight to sound effects, unlike the thin speakers most televisions are equipped with.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5987/">Get the Sony S100F 2.0ch Soundbar with Bass Reflex Speaker for a discounted price of just $99, down from $160, saving you $62 and 38% off.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5987/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A minimalistic way to add booming bass to your favorite content</h2>
<p>The sound characteristics of the S100F are optimized for better clarity of dialogue and more immersive TV experience. The 2.0 channel configuration, along with the built-in tweeter, provides crispness to high frequencies, while the Bass Reflex speaker provides more presence to lower-frequency sounds such as crowd noise, low rumbles, and music. Additionally, Sony’s S-Force Pro Front Surround processing attempts to create a wider sound area than the actual width of the bar itself, creating a more immersive experience for movies and television shows using only a single piece of equipment. There is also a voice enhancement feature that can increase dialogue levels during quiet scenes or loud soundtracks, making it easier to follow conversations without constantly adjusting the volume.</p>
<p>Physically, the S100F was designed to be placed in tight spaces. The soundbar sits relatively low, allowing it to be mounted below the bottom of many TV screens. If you prefer a clean appearance, the soundbar is wall-mountable. It comes with a template in the box that lets you accurately measure and mount the soundbar under a wall-mounted television with less trial-and-error.</p>



<p>The S100F includes simple-to-set-up connections. For example, HDMI ARC allows you to send audio from compatible televisions and also enables you to perform basic control functions via your television remote. Optical input allows you to connect older televisions to the S100F, and USB playback lets you insert a music-filled drive into the soundbar. Finally, there is Bluetooth support that converts the soundbar into a wireless speaker for your phone, tablet, or laptop when the screen is off.</p>
<p>The accessories and other small details included with the product make it seem ready to go right out of the box. In addition to the soundbar itself, you will receive a remote controller with batteries, an optical cable, an AC power cord, a wall-mount template, and installation guides and warranty documentation.</p>
<p>So, if you need a compact soundbar that improves dialogue clarity, adds a deeper bass response due to the Bass Reflex design, and includes both HDMI ARC and Bluetooth connectivity,<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5987/"> the Sony S100F 2.0ch Soundbar with Bass Reflex Speaker available for purchase today at a reduced price of $99 versus the original MSRP of $160, is an obvious choice over standard TV audio.</a></p>

              <p>Honestly, at this point, it’s almost expected for any given MrBeast-based event to generate controversy, misery, and bullying. So perhaps it’s not surprising that the creator’s latest video, a <em>Minecraft</em>-based contest in which 500 men were pitted against 500 women, has resulted in accusations of cheating, sabotage, and transphobia.</p> <p>The video, which has already seen nearly 13 million views on Jimmy Donaldson’s MrBeast Gaming channel, was poorly organized from the start. Rather than recruiting players deliberately, the event accepted the first 500 men and 500 women who tried to join a server when it went live, naturally resulting in a chaotic selection. It also, according to <a href="https://x.com/ZavvyGamer/status/2005056800639394160">one person who claimed to have taken part</a>&nbsp;(thanks <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/mrbeast-minecraft-boy-girl-competition-scandal/"><em>TheGamer</em></a>), meant many of the women players were very obviously “Russian guys [using] AI images/deepfakes.”</p>

  <p>The purpose of the event, which was recorded over a week of three- to six-hour daily sessions, was to see which team would prevail in what the video claimed to be a simulation of “civilization.” You know, that type of civilization in which men and women live entirely separately, and are pitched against one another based on…their…um…for fuck’s sake.</p>

 <p>Of course, this being a MrBeast event, the whole thing was structured around requiring players to inevitably turn on each other. The side with the most players left after the week would share $50,000 between them, so it created the sophomoric dilemma of wanting to eliminate as many people on your team as you can, while still having more than the other side, and enough to win a war that was due to happen toward the end of the event.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000655930" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655930"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655930">© MrBeast Gaming / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>In case there were any pretense at this being anything other than a retrograde endeavor, the whole thing was presented with every cliche in place. The video’s title card shows men in blue diamond armor, and <del>women</del> a woman in a pink dress, with the word “PEACE” above the pink lady side, and “WAR” over the legion of armed men. (Oh, and dividing the two is the <a href="https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/gurning">gurning</a> face of James “MrBeast” Donaldson himself, despite this being a co-production with YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCF3KMM3QLVEfnFPI8AbLUJA">ish</a>.) Men are then presented as battling one another, fighting for dominance, while women are “making sure” others don’t get more attention, and “turning on each other.”</p>

 <p>“<span dir="auto"><span dir="auto">We had thousands of players try to join our first large scale, multi day, competition civilization event in a first come first serve basis,” says the video’s introduction without a single hyphen, and without ever going on to state what was intended to happen as a result. Instead, the bulk of the description is devoted to mitigating the enormous amount of cheating and bad play that took part, reading,</span></span></p>

 <blockquote><p>“<span dir="auto"><span dir="auto">If a player broke the rules they agreed to in any way or lied on their application about any information to try and sabotage other players, they were banned by the staff who were monitoring 24/7 after an investigation, their actions were reversed and players they killed were revived, and they were replaced with the next boy or girl in line who had tried to join the server earlier in chronological order.”</span></span></p></blockquote> <p>Zavvy, <a href="https://x.com/ZavvyGamer/status/2005056800639394160">who claims on X</a> to have been one of the participants, gave a damning report of the week-long event. Their first accusation is that Russian men were infiltrating the women’s team, then “mass murdering every girl they could see. This went on for irl DAYS.” They claim the same players also left signs around the map with sexist messages and images of swastikas.</p>

 <p>Despite the protestations in the video description, Zavvy claims that another player on the women’s team identified who many of these infiltrating players were, but was then unable to do anything about it until pressuring staff into adding a way to report them on the event’s Discord.</p> <p>The women’s team, naturally, featured trans women players, but after word got about about the trolling male players, Zavvy says that “a lot of girls began reporting/targeting our trans girlies as infiltrators just because of the pitches of their voices and it started this huge fight on the girls’ side about transphobia and such.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I was in this event. Please keep in mind that we only had like 3-6 hours of server time each day.</p> <p>"The girls' side fell apart for SOME REASON"</p> <p>1. We unironically had Russian guys use AI images/deepfakes to cheat their way onto the girls' side and then just start mass murdering… <a href="https://t.co/fxFKZHkEbA">https://t.co/fxFKZHkEbA</a></p> <p>— Zavvy 💜🎮 (@ZavvyGamer) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZavvyGamer/status/2005056800639394160?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 27, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Despite ostensibly being an event about building “civilizations,” it soon became far more of a PvP event. I was unfortunate enough to overhear an awful lot of the 52-minute video as my son watched it, and the narration from both Donaldson and ish feigned bemusement at why the women were “turning on each other,” when it seems the reasons were widely reported and known. Zavvy also claims that the event had so much trouble filling the women’s team (and no wonder, good grief) that the Discord link was spread far and wide to try to reach the 500-player target. This resulted in many players who Zavvy says “didn’t even know how to make a crafting table.” The player then posted what they say are screenshots of signs and chat from the event in which abusive messages were posted in Russian.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000655927" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655927"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655927">© Zavvy / X</figcaption></figure> <p>Another person who says they were at the event, Code Mercy, corroborated Zavvy’s claims. As well as agreeing with all the previous claims, they add that players had been told “it was a social experiment to see how boys and girls would survive and thrive,” and given no idea there was to be any PvP.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">As someone who was in this event it was so poorly planned. Everything said above is correct. </p> <p>The story told obviously didn’t mention any of this going on. Heck some of the story was wrong anyways. Wrong leaders on girl side. Timing all wrong as I died and things that happened…</p> <p>— Code Mercy (@realcsgomercy) <a href="https://twitter.com/realcsgomercy/status/2005117682991988781?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 28, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Still more <a href="https://x.com/XxMakio/status/2005122741523878265">players chimed in</a> to <a href="https://x.com/GGoobere/status/2005106728699134417">back up all the same claims</a>, contradicting the narrative presented in the video. The video, instead, included scripted, tiresomely obvious tropes of a stunningly organized women’s side, and a disloyal, fractured men’s side, all so this could be stunningly reversed later in the event.</p>

 <p><span>Of course, any video of this nature is—like reality TV—going to carve storylines from dozens of hours of footage across hundreds of different situations that don’t accurately reflect events. It’s inevitable, justified by the excuse that it makes for a better viewing experience. The issue is that it’s not a depiction of what actually happened, and when you’re a participant who is aware how poorly events are represented, and the genuinely serious issues that are written out of existence, speaking up is often the only way the truth gets heard.</span></p> <p><span>Given</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ava-kris-tyson-mr-beast-grooming-allegations-1851606782"> <span>MrBeast’s own history with issues relating to transphobia</span></a><span>, it’s perhaps no surprise that the video didn’t want to portray the awful situation of trans women being hounded out of the game and the infiltration of bad actors that preceded it, despite its being so core to </span><i><span>why</span></i><span> what happened, happened. Far more fun to say, “Wow, those girls seemed so organized, but then it all turned to in-fighting!!!” right?</span></p> <p>Can we maybe all just move beyond “boys vs girls” as a concept? That’d be good.</p>

Players also get access to paid DLC for some games, like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Animal Crossing.&nbsp;</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Witcher 3 DLC Would Make The Wait For Witcher 4 Slightly More Bearable]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/witcher-3-dlc-ciri-geralt-sequel-cdpr-2000655922</link>
            <guid>1393750</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Leaks and analyst forecasts have fans buzzing about the possible hope for one last unexpected content update to <em>The Witcher 3</em>. <em>Helldivers 2</em> will continue to evolve in wild ways. And an older mobile JRPG that spawned two great console spin-offs is finally coming to PC in the West next year. It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture.</p> <p>There’s only a few days left to go in 2025 and I will be spending at least one of those cleaning my PS5. It shut off from overheating three times during my <em>Nightreign</em> run last night. The Everdark Balancers had nothing on the giant dust bunnies roaming around inside my console.</p>

 <h2>Rumors keep swirling about new <em>Witcher 3</em> DLC</h2> <p>Polish leaker Borys Nieśpielak first claimed back <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/dlc-game-awards">over the summer</a> that the decade-old game would get more content, adding earlier this month that he expected some sort of tease at the Game Awards. We didn’t get one, but that hasn’t put the rumors to bed. Now Polish Noble Securities analyst Mateusz Chrzanowski is forecasting a new DLC as well.</p>

 <p>“We expect another paid add-on (DLC) for <em>The Witcher 3</em> to be released in May 2026. We anticipate sales of 11 million copies at USD 30 each next year. We estimate the production budget at PLN 52 million,” he <a href="https://strefainwestorow.pl/analizy/noblesecurities-cdprojekt-wiedzmin-dlc-orion-cyberpunk">wrote in a memo</a> earlier this month according to a Google translation (via <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/new-witcher-3-dlc-expected-in-early-2026-to-set-up-the-witcher-4-3297731/"><em>Dexerto</em></a>). “The release should kick off the actual marketing campaign for <em>The Witcher 4</em>.”</p>

 <p>That seems both hard to believe and not completely unthinkable. The only known update CD Projekt Red is currently working on for the 2015 open-world RPG is mod support for the console version. A new content add-on, however small, would no doubt <a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2-sales-witcher-4-cdpr-2000647747">help boost sales</a> of the current-gen version as the studio works on getting <em>The Witcher 4</em> done. The sequel still sounds so far out <a href="https://kotaku.com/witcher-4-2027-release-window-investor-call-ps6-cdpr-1851772310">it might be a PS6 game</a>.</p>

 <h2>The original <em>Granblue Fantasy</em> is finally coming to Steam over a decade later</h2>  <p>The 2014 mobile RPG behind spin-offs <em>Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising</em> and <em>Granblue Fantasy: Relink</em> will be available for the first time in the West on PC starting March 10, 2026. It’s a turn-based game with summons, classes, and multiplayer raids that includes contributions from ex-<em>Final Fantasy</em> composer&nbsp;Nobuo Uematsu&nbsp;and&nbsp;art director Hideo Minaba.</p>

 <h2>Nvidia’s GeForce Now streaming program expands its monthly caps</h2> <p>A 100-hour monthly limit used to only apply to new subscribers. Now it will apply to everyone, <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/nvidia-geforce-nows-time-limit-will-stop-gamers-after-100-hours-each-month"><em>PCMag</em> reports</a>. GeForce Now users will have to pay an extra fee each month to continue streaming games beyond that. The price will be $3 for 15 more hours on the performance plan ($10 a month) and $6 for 15 more hours on the Ultimate plan ($20 a month). The move suggests Nvidia will continue looking to crack down on costs as the program grows.</p>

 <h2><em>Helldivers 2</em> could get “sequel-level” features like eight-player missions</h2> <p>“There’s quite a lot of [new features] actually and I think the community is pretty good at picking up where they sort of want the game to head when you consider sort of the sequel-esque approach to it,” creative director Johan Pilestedt said on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QokA_oAk4ig">recent Arrow Game Studios livestream</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/helldivers-2-cco-would-rather-add-sequel-level-features-like-8-player-missions-and-bigger-open-world-maps-than-outright-make-helldivers-3/"><em>Gamesradar</em></a>).&nbsp;“Eight-player missions would be one of those,” he continued. “Larger open-world maps where you maybe come across other Helldiver teams to then take on bigger challenges together. Operations that affect other teams, as well, would be those kind of level of features.”</p> <div> <h2>Will we see Arkane’s<em> Blade</em> game in 2026?</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The team is hard at work, everyone is super proud and out doing themselves.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publishers MangaGamer and Kagura Games have announced that they've teamed up with developer AliceSoft to bring the legendary eroge series <em>Rance </em>to Steam.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.kaguragames.com/rance-is-finally-coming-to-steam/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">news post</a> on the Kagura Games website, the studio confirms that it'll be releasing a number of <em>Rance </em>games on Steam, although there seems to be a bit of a question mark hanging over exactly which <em>Rance </em>titles will be available on Valve's platform.</p><p>Kagura says it's bringing the following <em>Rance </em>games to Steam: <em>Rance 01 + 02 </em>(as a package), <em>Rance 03</em>, <em>Rance IX</em>, <em>Rance X</em>, <em>Rance Quest Magnum</em>, <em>Rance IV</em>, and <em>Sengoku Rance</em>. The presence of <em>Rance IV </em>on this list is a little strange, however, given that the game doesn't appear to be available anywhere else in an official English translation.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>The <em>Rance </em>games are coming to Steam.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It's possible that <em>Rance IV</em>'s inclusion is a typo; after all, a quick <em>Rance </em><a href="https://www.kaguragames.com/?s=rance+&amp;post_type=product" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">search</a> on the official Kagura Games website turns up a listing for <em>Rance VI + 5D</em>, and MangaGamer's <a href="https://www.mangagamer.com/r18/product_list.php?opt=search&amp;page=1&amp;goods_type=1&amp;keyword=Rance" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">site</a> also lists <em>VI + 5D </em>for sale. What's more, the new trailer advertising the series' Steam release shows clips from <em>Rance VI + 5D</em> rather than <em>IV</em>.</p><p>However, the head of the AliceSoft Discord channel insists that the listing isn't a typo, so it's also possible that <em>Rance IV </em>will be getting its first official localization as part of this swathe of re-releases. Either way, <em>Rance </em>fans are eating pretty well right now, it seems.</p><p>Given Valve's eagerness to remove adult-oriented content from Steam, even when said content's themes seemingly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/horses-steam-ban-indie-horror" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a4a11cd5-8771-4a5c-86ba-ff196e272f59" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">directly explore adult subjects</a> in an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vile-exhumed-steam-removed-sexual-content" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3d619c44-1572-4d4c-9fdf-64af4c3b37db" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">artistic rather than exploitative way</a>, it seems strange that the <em>Rance </em>series' re-release has made it through the company's approval process.</p><p>In the past, however, Kagura has released other AliceSoft eroge titles with a patch to remove censorship available through the publisher's official website, so it's possible that this is how the <em>Rance </em>series will work as well.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see exactly what Kagura and MangaGamer have in store for <em>Rance</em>. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-goes-no-margin-on-16-1%e2%80%b3-portable-gaming-monitor-to-offload-best-selling-stock-2000655767</link>
            <guid>1393732</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>How can you improve your productivity when you’re on the go? A second monitor can do the trick. But don’t just go plunk down cash on the first thing you see out there. Not when you can save some money instead.</p>
<p>If you want to bring home a portable monitor that combines portability with use as a gaming, streaming and/or multi-tasking device, the ARZOPA 16.1″ 144Hz Portable Gaming Monitor is the answer. And right now, it’s on sale for what you might think is a pretty reasonable price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6601/">You can order the ARZOPA 16.1″ 144Hz Portable Gaming Monitor on Amazon for just $96.99, which is $33 less than its original list price of $129.99.</a> That’s a 25% discount.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6601/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A portable monitor perfect for gaming and productivity</h2>
<p>Though this is a somewhat budget-priced screen, the screen is still quite sharp and vivid. It has a rapid 144Hz refresh rate so movement in video games and movies appears more smoothly than you might get with traditional 60Hz screens.</p>
<p>The increased smoothness can give you a competitive advantage in certain gaming genres like racing games, first person shooters, and other fast-paced titles. In addition, the monitor’s heightened response rate can let you scroll through pages online and take care of most of your daily tasks even faster than usual.</p>
<p>In terms of keeping busiy on the go, this portable monitor was created to be taken with you when you travel. It’s super light so you can easily carry it to another location, and it’s designed to be used in many different types of environments like as a friend’s house, travel, or a coffee shop where you’d like to set up a second monitor. It connects to devices like your laptop, Nintendo Switch, handheld gaming consoles, and other phones that are capable of displaying images on an external monitor. All you have to do is connect a cable without extensive setup. And you’re good to go.</p>



<p>The build quality of the ARZOPA portable gaming monitor is pretty sturdy for the price, too. The included stand folds out so you can place it at a viewing angle that fits comfortably on your desk or tabletop. Therefore, you can adjust the viewing position of the screen to fit the way your desk is configured, rather than having to awkwardly tilt your laptop screen or stack books underneath it. The thin design of the monitor will help reduce clutter on your desk when it is not being used.</p>
<p>Overall, the high refresh rate, portability, and ease of setup of the ARZOPA 16.1″ 144Hz Portable Gaming Monitor make it an excellent companion for gaming and productivity. If you don’t want to drag around a second full-size monitor but need more screen real estate than a phone or tablet can provide, this is a great and affordable pick that’ll get you together.</p>

              <p><i><span>Avengers: Doomsday </span></i><span>seems to be largely playing the hits, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/avengers-doomsday-chris-evans-steve-rogers-captain-america-2000653491"><span>bringing back Chris Evans as the should’ve-been-retired Steve Rogers</span></a><span>, casting Iron Man actor Robert Downey Jr. as Doctor Doom after he’d seemingly retired from the Marvel Cinematic Universe with </span><i><span>Avengers: Endgame</span></i><span>, and wrangling a slew of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/x-men-movies-best-worst-ranked-deadpool-logan-wolverine-1851595435"><span>X-Men from the Fox movies</span></a><span>. Those characters, such as Patrick Stewart’s Professor X and Ian McKellen’s Magneto, are the subject of the latest theater-exclusive </span><i><span>Doomsday </span></i><span>trailers </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/avengers-doomsday-avatar-fire-ash-teasers-steve-doom-2000654609"><span>playing in front of </span><i><span>Avatar: Fire and Ash</span></i></a><span>, and while it doesn’t beat the “fanservice nostalgia slop” allegations, it is a reminder that I am a mark first and a hater second because those are my superhero peepaws.</span></p> <p><span>Shaky camera recordings from inside theaters have been uploaded on social media and taken down by Marvel almost immediately after.

But the gist of it is that we see some shots of a desecrated Xavier Institute, with Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr doing what they always do when they’re not locked in a battle of ideals: playing chess amidst the destruction.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The two hold hands with the passion and tenderness of decades-long friends-to-enemies-to-lovers as Magneto talks about the inevitability of death, but then this moment of homoeroticism is interrupted by two shots of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-3-review-shadow-keanu-reeves-jim-carrey-1851726797"><span>Donut Lord himself</span></a><span> James Marsden finally returning to the role of Cyclops for the first time since his brief cameo in 2014’s </span><i><span>X-Men: Days of Future Past</span></i><span>. He appears to be in a comic-accurate blue-and-yellow suit, which means that Hugh Jackman’s Wolverine isn’t the only X-Man </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/deadpool-and-wolverine-credits-fox-marvel-goodbye-1851611168"><span>getting some color in their wardrobe</span></a><span> after mostly wearing the jet-black suits in the original Fox films.</span></p>

<figure data-uuid="1e704260b7671"><a title="2026 Predictions 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1e704260b7671/2026-predictions-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Well, folks, it seems like only yesterday we were looking ahead at Nintendo's 2025 with a sense of unwavering optimism, and now here we are – it's certainly been a year. The Switch 2 finally arrived, bringing with it a plethora of goodwill and controversy alike, ushering in a new generation that, if initial sales are anything to go by, might be one of Nintendo's most successful yet.</p>
<p>It's still early days, mind you, but we've no doubt that 2026 is going to be an equally busy year for Nintendo (and for us, too), so it's time we look ahead at the upcoming 12 months and see what might be in store.</p>
<p>Naturally, now that the big hardware release is out of the way, we're going to be focusing mainly on the <em>games</em> here, but we'll also throw a bone to Nintendo's non-gaming business, which seems to be ramping up more and more with each passing year.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:181925 @ 1767029536 -->
<p>So without further ado, let's live right in with a look at first-party Nintendo games...</p>
<h2>Switch 2 First-Party Games</h2>
<figure data-uuid="e203fb172b109"><a title="2026 Predictions 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e203fb172b109/2026-predictions-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Ollie:</strong> I think it's about time we see <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-where-should-luigis-mansion-4-take-place">Luigi's Mansion 4</a></strong>, wouldn't you agree? It's been over six years since the third game, and given that it's sold nearly 15 million copies at this point, I think a new entry would be an easy win for Nintendo.</p>
<p>Then again, if Luigi's gets the spotlight, does that mean we go <em>another</em> year without a new 3D Mario? I'm not sure how I'd feel about that. I'm confident that Nintendo will reveal at least one of these in the coming months. I'd be equally thrilled with either, to be honest.</p>
<p><strong>Alana:</strong> Gosh, despite a new console launching just six months ago, my expectations are relatively low. It'll be busy for third parties, but I think Nintendo will be skipping over its big anniversaries this year (Metroid, Zelda) with little more than a trailer or a remaster.</p>
<p>I <em>do</em> think we might see something <strong>Xenoblade Chronicles</strong> related in 2026, whether that's a Nintendo Switch 2 Edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_2">2</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_3">3</a>, or heck, even that patch for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_x_definitive_edition">X</a>! And a teaser for a new game would be lovely, too. <strong>Pokémon Gen X</strong> <em>may</em> be on the cards, but with its usual release window hogged by <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/grand_theft_auto_6">GTA VI</a>... I mean, the kids can play the 'mon while the parents have a new Rockstar game to get through</p>
<p><strong>Jim</strong><strong>:</strong> Okay, let's get this one out right from the jump: we're not getting a Zelda in 2026, 40th anniversary be damned! Hmm, perhaps more accurately, I don't think we're getting a <em>new</em> Zelda in 2026. The next big 2D or 3D joint feels a couple of years away, <em>minimum</em>, so it's remake season, baby! I've given up holding out for that fabled <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker_hd">Wind Waker</a> / <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/legend_of_zelda_twilight_princess_hd">Twilight Princess HD</a> port, so let's go for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/legend_of_zelda_oracle_of_ages">Oracle</a> games instead. Just don't touch my beloved Minish Cap.</p>
<p>Otherwise: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> DLC, a new <strong>Pikmin</strong>, and '<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nintendo_switch_sports">Nintendo Switch Sports</a> 2'.</p>
<p><strong>PJ:</strong> I'm gonna go ahead and suggest we could (or should) be looking at some new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon</a> action in 2026. And I mean the full smorgasboard of paint-flinging multiplayer mayhem, not just <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/splatoon-raiders">Splatoon Raiders'</a> solo spin-off. It's been long enough since the superb third entry, and I'd love to see what the new graphical and CPU grunt of S2 could add to the equation.</p>
<p>I also wouldn't be surprised to see something from the vaults, like a new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/kid_icarus_uprising">Kid Icarus</a> (one that people universally enjoy controlling) - yeah, that would have me foaming at the mouth, not gonna lie, but there's also plenty of scope for dream level stuff, too. Like a super-charged and graphically glorious return to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/f-zero">F-Zero</a>, now that Nintendo can go big on the graphics and maybe even deliver slick online options. <em>[Ha! - Ed.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> I imagine we'll see whatever the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/nintendo_switch_online_playtest_program">Playtest</a> turns out to be, but I'm hoping for that new 3D Mario to properly get the pulse racing. And for Zelda's 40th, it's the one we've all been waiting for:, the most ludicrous of NS2 Ed. titles, <strong>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Tingle's Toetown Hoedown</strong>.</p>
<p>Followed by <strong>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Fighters Pass Vol 3+4 <strong>+ Subspace Warpdash</strong> for the holidays. Yes, expanding titulature is a pillar of the Switch 2 generation.</strong></p>
<h2>Switch 2 Third-Party Games</h2>
<figure data-uuid="f21258eeb1218"><a title="2026 Predictions 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f21258eeb1218/2026-predictions-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>PJ:</strong> I'm sure <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> is on everyone's card here, as it should be, and I would also love to see <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/blue_prince">Blue Prince</a> make the jump. Otherwise, I'm gonna go ahead and predict that we'll see <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/baldurs_gate_3">Baldur's Gate 3</a> arrive in a solid port that gets grief for being 30fps in handheld. I'd also suggest third-party racing games and sports games will make a much bigger impact now that a Switch console is capable of running them, so I wouldn't be surprised to see something like <strong>Forza</strong> (the next one <em>is</em> set in Japan).</p>
<p>Heck, maybe we might even have a sniff of something like <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/star_wars_galactic_racer">Star Wars: Galactic Racer</a>, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/wreckfest_2">Wreckfest 2</a> (or a bundle of some sort), or even the next entry in the <strong>F1</strong> series. Much to think about.</p>
<p><strong>Jim:</strong> I want ports-galore! Clair Obscur feels like the most open of open goals right now, and I wouldn't be at all surprised to see some smaller 2025 hits like Blue Prince and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527290/PEAK/">PEAK</a> make the jump — the latter with Mouse Mode climbing <em>and</em> GameChat? <em>Oof</em>. Let's throw <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/metaphor_refantazio">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> in there, too.</p>
<p><strong>Alana:</strong> Starting off safe, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> will release around six months after <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Remake</a>, <em>and</em> we'll also see the third part of the trilogy. Maybe not day one Switch 2, but we'll see. Sticking with Square Enix, 2026 marks Dragon Quest's 40th anniversary. Can we really go <em>another</em> year without seeing <strong>Dragon Quest XII</strong>? I'm not sure, but I think this is the year to reintroduce it to the world.</p>
<p>Going a little leftfield, I really want to see <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/denshattack">Denshattack!</a> on Switch 2, and when <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2142790/Fields_of_Mistria/"><strong>Fields of Mistria</strong></a> leaves Early Access, I <em>need</em> a port asap. And with the Yakuza train just continuing to roll, can we please have <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/yakuza_like_a_dragon">Like a Dragon</a>? I think it'll happen.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> I love a good port as much as the next sailor, but I'd really like something I <em>haven't</em> already seen at a higher resolution and frame rate elsewhere. But that isn't very useful for a predictions piece, is it?...</p>
<p>Oh, let's say <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/immortality">Immortality</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/rez_infinite">Rez</a>. That's the stuff. And <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/phone/super_hexagon">Super Hexagon</a> at 4K, and with Switch 2's snazzy handheld audio, pulsing, pulsing..., yeah, that's it. C-mon, Tel, don't make me beg. Again.</p>
<p><strong>Ollie:</strong> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/007-first-light">007 First Light</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> represent a clear indication that the Switch 2 is a viable console for so-called 'AAA' third-party games, so as much as I want to see a few ports (yes, Baldur's Gate 3), I'm keen to see completely new games. Neither <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/persona_4_revival">Persona 4 Revival</a> nor <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/bloodstained_the_scarlet_engagement">Bloodstained: The Scarlet Engagement</a> are confirmed for Switch 2 yet, but I'd be very surprised if they skipped Nintendo's console altogether.</p>
<p>Similarly, Capcom seems to be all-in with Nintendo, so it's possible that <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/onimusha_way_of_the_sword">Onimusha: Way of the Sword</a> also gets a surprise confirmation at some point. Speaking of Capcom, the new <strong>Okami</strong> won't make 2026, but we'll see the first proper trailer and it'll be confirmed for Switch 2.</p>
<h2>Switch Online Additions</h2>
<figure data-uuid="7f3fe5ef02e44"><a title="2026 Predictions 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7f3fe5ef02e44/2026-predictions-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Sega</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Alana:</strong> I've been very happy with the GameCube additions to Switch Online so far — a mix of big hitters a weirdo releases. But the biggest one, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_smash_bros_melee">Super Smash Bros. Melee</a>, is weirdly absent. It <em>has</em> to happen in 2025, surely? With online functionality, 25 years after its release? What a way to push the Expansion Pack. Otherwise, I'll continue to beg for Pokémon games as long as my life depends on it.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> I can see <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/legend_of_zelda_four_swords_adventures">Zelda: Four Swords Adventure</a> coming to a Switch 2 near you, and Mouse Mode feels like a great fit for DS games.</p>
<p><strong>PJ:</strong> I've got a fancy new GameCube controller for my fancy almost-new Switch 2, and I'd bloody well like to use it, Nintendo. Specifically, I think we'd all have a great time if <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/baten_kaitos_eternal_wings_and_the_lost_ocean">Baten Kaitos: Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean</a> showed up for NSO. Failing that, I'll take <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/billy_hatcher_and_the_giant_egg">Billy Hatcher.</a></p>
<p><strong>Ollie:</strong> Honestly, I'd be happy to just see <em>more</em> GameCube titles in 2026. Not just first-party games; let's get a few surprises in there. I'm thinking a Silicon Knights double-whammy with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/eternal_darkness_sanitys_requiem">Eternal Darkness</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metal_gear_solid_the_twin_snakes">Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes</a>, but I think it's also notable that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/sonic_adventure_2_battle">Sonic Adventure 2: Battle</a> has yet to see a release on the Switch or Switch 2. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/viewtiful_joe">Viewtiful Joe</a> would be delightful, too.</p>
<p><strong>Jim:</strong> There's a part of me that's convinced Nintendo is working on a second-screen peripheral for that top USB-C port so we can get DS, 3DS and Wii U libraries on Switch 2. It feels like a long shot for 2026 — especially since the Virtual Boy is right around the corner — so I'll throw out my yearly wish for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/star_wars_rogue_squadron">Rogue Squadron</a> games on N64 and GameCube, too.</p>
<h2>What about Switch 1?</h2>
<figure data-uuid="d6fe313ad14a3"><a title="2026 Predictions 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d6fe313ad14a3/2026-predictions-5.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Ollie:</strong> The original Switch will get a couple of new announcements beyond <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tomodachi_life_living_the_dream">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rhythm_heaven_groove">Rhythm Heaven Groove</a>. I'll keep bringing up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime_2_echoes">Metroid Prime 2</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/metroid_prime_3_corruption">3</a> until it actually happens, and I think Nintendo would put them on Switch 1, too.</p>
<p><strong>PJ:</strong> I agree with Ollie here, in that Metroid Prime 2 and 3 could work out really well on S1, and what a send-off that would be, especially if they could pad it out with a few new drops. I'll go ahead and suggest a new Pikmin could hit <em>both</em> Switches, alongside any new Mario.</p>
<p><strong>Alana:</strong> There's still life in the Switch 1, what with over 150 million units out there, and I think we'll continue to get games on the console over the next year. Largely, it'll be in the form of updates and patches that cater to both consoles, but we'll see.</p>
<p>Most importantly, I think we'll see more uses of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-gameshare-guide-how-to-share-games-locally-and-online">GameShare</a> from Nintendo. They may go back and add that functionality to a couple of games that are missing it, so families that have both consoles can play together. I think that'd be lovely!</p>
<p><strong>Jim:</strong> Honestly? The upcoming titles that we already know about might be the last of the <em>new</em> S1 releases. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tomodachi_life_living_the_dream">Tomodachi Life</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rhythm_heaven_groove">Rhythm Heaven</a> feel like a particularly cosy note to end on, and I can't see any mega-busters heading to the old hardware now that Switch 2's in full swing.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> The new Rhythm Heaven is legitimately the most exciting thing Nintendo has announced so far for 2026. Is there any point in releasing anything else first-party when you've got GOTY 2026 wrapped and bagged?</p>
<p>I <em>would</em> predict that I'll be picking up a bargain-priced Switch Lite for my collection when stores start selling off inventory cheap. But it seems that prices have skipped the end-of-gen dive and just keep going up. Therefore, the pile of unused hardware in the Billy bookcase won't be getting bigger anytime soon. Probably for the best.</p>

<p><strong>Jim:</strong> The <strong>Mario Galaxy</strong> movie will follow in its predecessor's steps and cross the $1 billion mark at the global box office, Nintendo Pictures has at least one more <strong>Pikmin</strong> short up its sleeve, and we'll get confirmation of a <strong>Donkey Kong</strong> TV series. We'll also see at least three new Nintendo mobile apps with near-identical red and white logos.</p>
<p><strong>Alana:</strong> A <strong>Zelda</strong> movie trailer is a given, right? As we've mentioned above, it's the 40th anniversary. That would be a big enough deal for Nintendo, and it's what the company did for Mario's big bash.</p>
<p>One thing I <em>think</em> is weird, given Ninty's big expansion into multimedia, is that we have no big TV show yet. So I think we're going to get one next year. Kirby? Animal Crossing? <em>A Kid Icarus show?</em> I don't know. But have your remotes ready.</p>
<p><strong>Ollie:</strong> At this point, I genuinely wouldn't be surprised if Nintendo announces another theme park, or maybe a smattering of new retail stores. The company appears to be really ramping up its visibility to the point of becoming the new Disney, and I'm all for it.</p>
<p>We'll also get <strong>New Nintendo Sound Clock: Alarmo XL</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>PJ:</strong> I really didn't like the recent Mario movie, but I accept that it's probably not really aimed squarely at me. So, yeah, I guess that's gonna be the big obvious thing next year for Nintendo, another Jack Black video game movie (groan).</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> Animal Crossing expansion for one of the theme parks, and an increase in quality merch like the stuff currently hitting My Nintendo Stores. I do like the look of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/nintendo-reveals-new-line-of-metroid-merch-and-we-want-it-all">those Metroid ice trays</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2016/06/hardware_classics_pokemon_mini">Pokémon Mini</a> comes to NSO.</p>
<p><strong>PJ:</strong> As images and scientific data related to the interstellar object 3i/Atlas are studied in early 2026, it's discovered that the anomaly, only the third of its kind ever to pass through our galactic neighbourhood, is actually Starship Mario. It's all real.</p>
<p><strong>Alana:</strong> So, let's go back to my slight Metroid 40th anniversary dismissal and propose a remake — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_metroid">Super Metroid</a>. I don't know if I want it, but by goodness, what a way to get people scrambling for joy. And shock. And maybe disappointment?</p>
<p><strong>Jim:</strong> <strong>Star Fox</strong>. Yeah, I said it. The dream is a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/star_fox_64">64</a> remake, natch, but if Nintendo wants to grace us with an all-new entry on a system where people will actually play it, you'll hear no complaints from me. 2026 is the year, I'm telling you!</p>
<p><strong>Ollie:</strong> It'll be <strong>Zelda</strong>'s 40th Anniversary in 2026, so Nintendo might surprise us with something special. How about a remake of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/legend_of_zelda">original NES game</a>? Nothing groundbreaking, but maybe something akin to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/metroid_zero_mission">Metroid: Zero Mission</a> on the GBA. Keep it top-down with pixel art visuals, streamline it appropriately, and I'd buy it in an instant.</p>

              <p>Over the weekend, Ubisoft’s&nbsp;<em>Rainbow 6 Siege </em>suffered a major hack that saw players flooded with billions of dollars worth of in-game credits. As a result, Ubisoft pulled the game and its marketplace offline. Only in the last few hours has it begun allowing players back in.</p> <p>Ubisoft posted to <a href="https://x.com/Rainbow6Game/status/2004917731829948808"><em>Rainbow 6</em>‘s official X account</a> on December 27 that it was “aware of an incident” and “working on a resolution.” A couple of hours later another update added, “<span>Siege and the Marketplace have been intentionally shut down while the team focuses on resolving the issue.”</span></p>

 <p>The incident was an apparent attack on <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/rainbow-six/siege/status">the&nbsp;<em>R6</em> servers</a> that saw not only billions of in-game money distributed among players, but also super-rare weapon skins landing in some people’s lockers, Renown being handed out like candy, and Alpha Packs showing up in inventories as well. At the same time, some players reported having their in-game finances entirely wiped out.</p>

 <p>Unfortunately, there followed an ominous five hours of silence from the Ubisoft team, during which all manner of rumors spread among the game’s community, including that the attack was a cover for stealing all of Ubisoft’s source code (there is no evidence for this), and that anyone who spent the vast amounts of new money they now found in their account would be banned.</p>

 <p>The latter rumor became extremely prevalent across social media and Reddit largely because before the shutdown, an in-game ban ticker had been spamming announcements across players’ screens for huge numbers of bans! When Ubisoft finally updated its X account, it was to make clear this was not true.</p>

 <p>“Nobody will be banned for spending credits received,” said the post, noting “any messages seen were not triggered by us.” But for those thinking Christmas had happened all over again added, “a rollback of all transactions that occurred since 11 AM (UTC time) is underway.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">➡️ Nobody will be banned for spending credits received. A rollback of all transactions that occurred since 11 AM (UTC time) is underway.</p> <p>➡️ The ban ticker was turned off in a past update. Any messages seen were not triggered by us.</p> <p>➡️ An official R6 ShieldGuard ban wave did… <a href="https://t.co/zbPYDJQa3O">https://t.co/zbPYDJQa3O</a></p> <p>— Rainbow Six Siege X (@Rainbow6Game) <a href="https://twitter.com/Rainbow6Game/status/2005018314431447283?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 27, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>With the game offline, Ubisoft again went very quiet, this time for 21 hours. (Social media teams: please don’t do this! Even if you have no news, post to say so! Reassure people it’s being worked on. Yes, you’re all in a crazed panic, but someone can write a sentence on X and stave off a <em>vast</em> amount of misinformation and player distress. Have you never had a flight delayed?) Sunday at lunchtime, <a href="https://x.com/Rainbow6Game/status/2005329908105359712">a post appeared</a> explaining that<em> Rainbow Six Siege</em> was being rolled back to its pre-hack state followed by “extensive quality control tests” to ensure “the integrity of accounts and effectiveness of changes.” The update continued, seemingly addressing nearly a day’s panic from the <em>R6</em> community,</p>

 <blockquote><p>“<span>The team is focused on getting players back into the game as quickly as possible. Please know that this matter is being handled with extreme care and therefore, timing cannot be guaranteed. We will provide another update as soon as we know more. Thank you all for your patience and understanding as we continue to tackle this.”</span></p></blockquote> <p>Seven hours later, the tests were complete, and a soft launch began, allowing a few players back in to see if anything exploded. Then by last night, <em>Rainbow 6 </em>was re-opened to everyone, with the game’s state rolled back to early Saturday morning. All purchases made, whether legitimate or with the unexpected pirate bounty, were undone, and freebies handed out were removed from accounts. It was also noted that “<span>A small percentage of players may temporarily lose access to some owned items. Investigations and corrections will continue over the next two weeks.”</span></p>   <p>The Marketplace, however, remains offline “as further investigations continue.”</p> <p>This isn’t the first time&nbsp;<em>Rainbow 6 Siege</em> has taken a big hit in 2025. Back in June, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/earnings/ubisoft-sales-miss-forecasts-as-rainbow-six-siege-glitch-takes-toll-fd2a6519">another glitch involving prepaid cards</a> that saw in-game money inflated cost Ubisoft significant losses, and this holiday attack could do much the same.</p>

 <p>It was, given the scale of the attack, an impressively swift repair, all done and dusted within 48 hours. The only issue, as appears to always be the case in such incidents, was a lack of regular communication with players to quash rumors and disinformation. It does, of course, raise significant questions over the security surrounding&nbsp;<em>R6 Siege X</em>, given that this was possible in the first place. There has been no announcement either way about whether player account information was seen or stolen, but people with accounts might want to change their passwords just in case. There has also been no information about what actually allowed the attack, and whether it can happen again.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[RAM Price Increases Could See Next-Generation Console Releases Delayed]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ram-prices-next-gen/</link>
            <guid>1393681</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Insider Gaming has learned that the ongoing price increases in RAM due to the rise in AI could delay the next generation of console releases.</p>







<p>We first mentioned the rumor during our Insider Gaming Weekly episode on December 19th, where we mentioned that we had heard that there are already ongoing talks at the high levels on what the RAM availability could mean for the next generation.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="No One Is Buying Video Game Consoles - Insider Gaming Weekly" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1nCctuh3N2g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>From what we’ve heard, the industry as a whole is concerned about RAM availability (as they should be) and what that is going to mean for mass-producing consoles at a competitive price point. Not only for the next generation, but it could also mean that yet more price increases for current generation consoles will hit us in 2026.</p>



<p>RAM modules have increased in price by several hundred percent in the past few months due to the demand for AI, and with the pursuit of AI seemingly not going away anytime soon, RAM availability could continue to be a bottleneck. Or at the very least, the RAM shortage will mean that prices will continue to hike.</p>



<p>It leaves console producers in a very tricky spot moving forward, and while consoles have traditionally been subsidised to a certain extent in the past, it seems like RAM availability and price increases will mean that the next-generation of consoles, which were already believed to be much higher in price than previous generations, could be extortionate.</p>



<p>From what we understand, the situation has led console manufacturers to debate whether the next generation of consoles should be delayed from their intended 2027-2028 release window, with the hope that RAM manufacturers will be able to build out their infrastructure to produce more RAM, therebyallowing prices to drop.</p>







<p>Regardless of what happens, though, it seems that the next couple of years could see the current generation of consoles increase in price further. </p>



<p>What do you think of the ongoing RAM price increases? Let us know on&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

<p>When people look back on 2025, they’ll likely find a year that will go down as one of the best for games of the last decade or more. From surprising success stories like Peak and Blue Prince to major AAA blockbusters like Death Stranding 2: On The Beach and Pokémon Legends: Z-A, there was something for everyone this year. But only one game could claim the title of the Insider Gaming community’s 2025 Game of the Year.</p>



<p>After a two-week voting period in the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord</a>, the readers voted Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 as the Game of the Year.</p>







<p>Released on April 24, 2025, Clair Obscur’s visuals along with the story centered around mortality resonated with players around the world. The game has received near universal acclaim from many, and even walked away with other Game of the Year awards from various events.</p>



<p>The voice acting is some of the best there’s been in years, and even the music can compete with the likes of major motion pictures and games with near billion-dollar budgets. It’s honestly hard to find much to critic about the game, which is why it one with such a large amount of the votes. </p>







<h2 id="h-other-games-received-votes-too">Other Games Received Votes, Too</h2>



<p>While other votes for games like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-insider-gaming-community-best-multiplayer-game-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Multiplayer</a> and Indie Game of the Year were close, Game of the Year was one of the more lopsided. Clair Obscur received 27.8% of the votes while the second-place game, ARC Raiders, earned 14.8%. Rounding out the Top 5 were Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 (13.9%), Death Stranding 2: On the Beach (12.2%), and Ghost of Yotei (8.7%).</p>



<p>Other games receiving votes were Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Dying Light: The Beast, Split Fiction, Donkey Kong Bananza, Pokémon Legends: Z-A and Hollow Knight: Silksong.</p>
