            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/wizkids-baldurs-gate-iii-miniature-review-theres-something-off-about-that-ox<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After the incredible popularity of <em>Baldur's Gate III,</em> and with Wizkids returning to previous <em>D&amp;D 5e</em> expansions, it was only a matter of time until players could get their hands on a set of <em>Baldur's Gate</em> minis focusing on characters from the incredibly popular video game by Larian, as well as the <em>5e</em> adventure <em>Baldur's Gate: Descent Into Avernus.</em></p>

<p>I received the <em>Icons of the Realms: Baldur's Gate III</em> Characters, the iconic party that adventures with your Tav, as well as eight of the Blind Boxes containing a mix of miniatures based on creatures you might see around<em> Baldur's Gate</em>, be part of the Descent into Avernus Adventure, or be important characters from Baldur's Gate III (including a suspicious looking Ox…).</p>

<h2>Icons of the Realms: <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em> Characters</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizkids-dd-baldurs-gate-iii-minis-bg3-party.jpg?itok=M7FEzcWS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizkids-dd-baldurs-gate-iii-minis-bg3-party.jpg?itok=UcsL9NMU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The <em>Baldur's Gate III </em>Characters box comes with seven pre-painted miniatures highlighting the different BG3 party members along with Withers.</p>

<p>Each member of the party is sporting their iconic weapons; the large battle axe Karlach is holding against her body, Lae'zel holds her sword high above her head ready to strike, Shadowheart holding Selune's Spear Of Night out from her, and Astorion holding out one hand as if to invite you towards him while brandishing a dagger in the other.</p>

<p>For fans of Wyll he holds his sword outstretched as if mid-duel and is sporting the horns he can obtain early on for breaking his pact with his patron.</p>

<p>The outfits each character wears aligns with their promotional artwork meaning that even from a distance each is immediately recognizable and whether you want to purchase these minis to display or to throw the <em>BG3 </em>party in for a crossover at your own table you wont be disappointed.</p>

<h2>Adventures From <em>Baldur's Gate</em> Miniatures</h2>

<p>As with all Wizkids miniatures each blindbox has with it three Medium or Smaller miniatures and one Large miniature. There will always be some good multi-purpose stuff, while also ensuring you're going to get an impressive miniature to throw down at your table.</p>

<p>As I go through the different minis that I unboxed I'll break them out into generic <em>Baldur's Gate</em> creatures or those specific to Descent Into Avernus and those that fans of <em>Baldur's Gate III</em> will recognize.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizkids-dd-baldurs-gate-iii-minis-bg-generic-small.jpg?itok=9wUflSGG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizkids-dd-baldurs-gate-iii-minis-bg-generic-small.jpg?itok=NZp3WvAc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h3><em>Baldur's Gate</em> Miniatures</h3>

<p>For the more generic <em>Baldur's Gate</em> miniatures in the Small and Medium variety I opened:</p>

<ul><li aria-level="1">Imp</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Intellect Devourer</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Goblin Novice and Goblin Sharpshooter</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Two Duergar</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Two Bugbear Assassins, and</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Doppelganger</li>
</ul><p>A thing I am always thankful for in the Blind Boxes are that there are a healthy number of standard enemies. Having a high-quality Wizkids miniature of a dragon is great for the few and far between times where that specific dragon will appear but the above listed minis could be used anywhere and everywhere.</p>

<p>The Goblins are of the yellow-skinned variety brandishing a club and a shortbow, allowing for visual differences (even if Novie and Sharpshooter don't exactly have a stat block outside of BG3).</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizkids-dd-baldurs-gate-iii-minis-bg-generic-large.jpg?itok=e921JNbP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizkids-dd-baldurs-gate-iii-minis-bg-generic-large.jpg?itok=TondPapL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The Large generic <em>Baldur's Gate</em> miniatures I opened include:</p>

<ul><li aria-level="1">Gnoll</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Warg</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Bear</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Minotaur</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Spectator, and</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Bulette</li>
</ul><p>Again a fantastic range of miniatures. Bears for a random forest encounter (maybe it's a Druid in disguise), Gnoll once the party has adventured a bit further, and then for some deadlier encounters you can break out the Spectator and Bulette.</p>

<p>The design of the Bulette is completely different from the once previously included in Sand and Stone. Unlike the previous one, which was partially exposing itself from the ground that it's burrowed into, the new Bulette miniature stands totally above ground, showing off it's metal top coat that glistens in the light. Underneath its fleshier stomach is exposed.</p>

<h3><em>Baldur's Gate III </em>Miniatures</h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizkids-dd-baldurs-gate-iii-minis-bg3-medium.jpg?itok=GAFTL6hq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizkids-dd-baldurs-gate-iii-minis-bg3-medium.jpg?itok=fN9IjHHf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Of the miniatures that I got that were explicitly flavors of <em>Baldur's Gate III </em>for the range of Tiny to Medium sized creatures I opened:</p>

<ul><li aria-level="1">Dark Justicar</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Fist of Bane</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Flaming Fist Soldier</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Githyanki</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Halsin</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Hollyphant</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Necromyte of Myrkul</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Omeluum</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Orin the Red</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Priestess Gut</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Reaper of Bhaal</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Sovreign Glut</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Zevlor</li>
</ul><p>For fans of the game there's plenty to be excited for from important named characters like Umeluum, Halsin, and Priestess Gut to the interesting enemies you'd encounter like the Flaming Fist Soldier.</p>

<p>I always enjoy when a character is posed in a way that allows you to understand who they are or what affinities they have. In this way Priestess Gut creating an arch of power over her head make it a really interesting piece for your table.</p>

<p>The Dark Justicar wears contrasting blacks with golden armor brandishing his sword and the Githyanki holds up a crossbow ready to strike. Putting so many of these characters together the theme of 'red' really does seem to show up a lot though.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizkids-dd-baldurs-gate-iii-minis-bg3-large.jpg?itok=kM-uNREE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizkids-dd-baldurs-gate-iii-minis-bg3-large.jpg?itok=0-ykApNz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The large <em>Baldur's Gate III </em>miniatures that I opened include:</p>

<ul><li aria-level="1">Lump The Enlightened</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Shambling Mound</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Slayer of Bhaal</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Strange Ox</li>
</ul><p>I love how much of a strange mix of miniatures this is. Lump is great as an Ogre miniature but manages to also bring a smile as you remember the strange circumstance of an Ogre swallowing a Headband of Intellect. Likewise having the Strange Ox, that for all intents and purposes could be a simple Ox miniature, present in this collection brings back fond memories of strange conversations.</p>

<p>Taking a turn for the terrifying the Shambling Mount miniature here, while described generically has the same blueish light emanating from within like that of the Shadow-Cursed Shambling Mound. For something that is meant to be glowing blue I do wish they used a blue transparent plastic instead of just painting those areas blue.</p>

<p>The last of the giant minis was the Slayer of Bhaal, or simply a Slayer in <em>Baldur's Gate III.</em> This is one of those excellent miniatures that can be used for anything that you want to scare your players with. It looks fast, it can slice and dice, and will be able to easily throw your players around. A very nice and precise touch on close inspection is the almost orange glow from the eyes.</p>

<h2>Wizkids <em>Baldur's Gate III</em> Miniatures Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>While the blind boxes advertise both Adventures From <em>Baldur's Gate</em> and <em>Baldur's Gate III </em>this set is really there for the fans of <em>Baldur's Gate III.</em> Every miniature, even the generic ones, will be more aligned with the models that you'll be more than familiar with if you've played <em>Baldur's Gate III.</em></p>

<p>This sense of knowing is also extra fun when you'll pull these out in games to come and will get to be brought back to&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-marine-2-datavault-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Saber Interactive and Focus Entertainment have released a brand new <i>Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2&nbsp;</i>update, and it's bringing a new area on the Battle Barge, a new PvP map to fight on, and more.</p>

<p>First up, the Datavault is a new area on the Resilient. Completing in-game challenges will give you the chance to earn Research Data, which you can use to unlock information on elements of the game's world, as well as new cosmetics.</p>

<p>A new PvP map, Tomb, has also been introduced. The map is&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>'s smallest, but it utilizes "a different approach" to its brethren when it comes to design, so make sure to give it a look if you want a more unconventional PvP experience.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/space-marine-2-6.0-datavault-update-biovore.jpg?itok=c8fKQgTM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/space-marine-2-6.0-datavault-update-biovore.jpg?itok=siVKkI1w 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Biovore is here to ruin your day in&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>The Tyranids' ranks have grown with a new enemy in this&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>update, too. The Biovore is a new Extremis-class enemy that serves as long-distance artillery, but it can also defend itself by stabbing with its legs.</p>

<p>If you've been looking for ways to communicate with your fellow Ultramarines, but good old-fashioned conversation isn't doing it, then the new Emote system should do the trick. It allows you to perform "a pound to the chest, a battle cry, and even a stoic handshake", plus others.</p>

<p>What's more, if the base challenge of&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>'s PvE modes wasn't enough for you, a new Absolute difficulty mode has been introduced that features "new, more diverse enemy packs" and limited resources to contend with.</p>

There are a ton of balance changes in the update, specifically pertaining to class perks, so make sure to read them all to stay in the know.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/paradox-haemimont-games</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/paradox-to-buy-jagged-alliance-3-and-surviving-mars-dev-haemimont-games.1101897/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/paradox-haemimont-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Cities: Skylines 2&nbsp;</em>publisher Paradox Interactive has announced that it will purchase&nbsp;<em>Jagged Alliance 3&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Surviving Mars&nbsp;</em>studio Haemimont Games.</p>

<p>In its <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/investors/financial-reports/year-end-report-january-december-2024" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">year-end financial report</a>, Paradox reveals it has "entered into an agreement to purchase 100% of the shares" in Haemimont. No change in management was announced, so it seems like Haemimont will continue doing its own thing under Paradox.</p>

<p>This isn't the first time Paradox and Haemimont will have crossed paths, either. The company served as the publisher for colony sim&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/surviving-mars" rel="nofollow">Surviving Mars</a>&nbsp;</em>in 2018, although Haemimont is perhaps better-known for working with THQ Nordic and Kalypso Media on the likes of&nbsp;<em>Tropico&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;</i><em>Grand Ages: Rome</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/paradox-haemimont-games-surviving-mars.jpg?itok=jjJeSDWm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/paradox-haemimont-games-surviving-mars.jpg?itok=m7GcNdml 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Paradox has worked with Haemimont before, on colony sim&nbsp;<em>Surviving Mars</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>As for the financial report itself, Paradox says its revenue has fallen 17% when compared to last year, but that profit has increased by 10%.</p>

<p>As a reminder, major Paradox releases like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-ii-announced" rel="nofollow">Cities: Skylines 2</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/age-of-wonders-4-announced-for-pc-ps5-xbox-with-release-date-details-gameplay" rel="nofollow">Age of Wonders 4</a>&nbsp;</em>took place in the previous financial year, so Paradox didn't really have a major tentpole title to base its finances around in 2024.</p>

<p>Additionally, hotly-anticipated projects like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-yet-again" rel="nofollow">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a>&nbsp;</em>and, er, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-ps5-xbox-release-delayed-again" rel="nofollow">the console release of&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-ps5-xbox-release-delayed-again" rel="nofollow">Cities: Skylines 2</a>&nbsp;</em>are either slated for this year or don't have a release date yet, so the company is in a sort of limbo right now.</p>

<p>Paradox CEO Fredrik Wester says the studio closes its year with "a period of high revenue and good margins" and says that the studio's "persistent work over time" is more important than between-quarter variation.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-paradox.jpg?itok=A33m4Wqm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-paradox.jpg?itok=fpnT516m 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Paradox's future includes big releases like&nbsp;<em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Paradox's yearly financial assessment comes a few months after the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/life-by-you-paradoxs-sims-competitor-has-been-cancelled" rel="nofollow">announced the cancellation</a> of its&nbsp;<em>Sims</em>-style life sim&nbsp;<em>Life by You</em>, which caused its quarter-by-quarter profits to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/paradox-profits-life-by-you-canceled" rel="nofollow">plummet by 90% in July</a>.</p>

<p>According to the studio, however, that fall was factored into its yearly assessment; Paradox says write-downs of around 208 million kronor, or about $19 million, are included in its operating profit report.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what kind of 2025 Paradox has, as well as whether or not its purchase of Haemimont affects that developer's day-to-day operations. Stay tuned for more.</p>

                <p>In the recent video game Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, the role of Indiana Jones was played by Troy Baker, not Harrison Ford. The esteemed and veteran actor has reflected on the game, saying Baker did a "brilliant" job bringing his character to life, and it didn't require AI.</p><p>"You don't need artificial intelligence to steal my soul. You can already do it for nickels and dimes with good ideas and talent," <a href="https://www.wsj.com/style/harrison-ford-shrinking-1923-captain-america-7b1f9b3f" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">he told The Wall Street Journal</a>. "[Baker] did a brilliant job, and it didn't take AI to do it."</p><p>AI was used, however, to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny-de-aging-tech/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">de-age Ford in the movie Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny</a> with striking results. The movie didn't score well with critics, and Ford reflected bluntly, "Shit happens," going on to say he believed the story was worth telling and he was happy he made the movie.</p><p>Going back to the talk of AI, Ford dismissed the idea that his estate could one day cash in on his likeness through some kind of digital recreation of himself.</p><p>"My plan is to keep working behind that face till I don't care what happens anymore. I'm selling that piece by piece while I'm alive," he said. "There won't be any need for me. There's somebody behind me. Doing what I did."</p><p>Bethesda boss Todd Howard originally <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn08epwy152o" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"rolled his eyes" about the idea of Baker playing Indiana Jones in The Great Circle</a>, but eventually came around to the idea. Ford and Baker appeared on stage together at The Game Awards this past December, where <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/harrison-ford-pulled-a-john-travolta-at-the-game-awards/1100-6528440/" data-ref-id="1100-6528440">Ford praised The Great Circle and Baker's performance.</a></p><p>The Great Circle has reached <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-whips-up-4-million-players-before-ps5-debut/1100-6529145/" data-ref-id="1100-6529145">4 million players on Xbox and PC</a>, and the game is slated for release on PS5 this spring.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-delta-release-date-leak-playstation<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta&nbsp;</em>release date appears to have been leaked via the game's PlayStation Store listing, and if the leak is correct, then the hotly-anticipated remake will be launching in summer.</p>

<p>As spotted by ResetEra user <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/metal-gear-solid-delta-releases-august-25th-2025-new-trailer-on-ps-store-snake-vs-monkey-teased.1101735/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">NateDog</a>, a new <a href="https://vulcan.dl.playstation.net/img/rnd/202502/0611/2c429928f5c5b20df3c78f5053ace69c011d4f391782ab47.mp4" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">trailer</a> has appeared on the PlayStation Store's backend that shows off some of the game's content, including various iconic scenes and boss battles from&nbsp;<em>Snake Eater</em>. The release date is then given as August 28th.</p>

<p>Perhaps most excitingly, the trailer also seems to confirm the release of the Snake vs. Monkey gameplay mode, which saw the worlds of&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Ape Escape&nbsp;</em>collide in an unlikely crossover.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metal-gear-solid-delta-release-date-snake.jpg?itok=Aw9T2VUp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metal-gear-solid-delta-release-date-snake.jpg?itok=g0UYVW71 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Metal Gear Solid Delta&nbsp;</em>looks set for an August release.</figcaption></figure><p>If the Snake vs. Monkey minigame is indeed included, it could well mark the<em>&nbsp;Ape Escape</em>&nbsp;series' first appearance outside the PlayStation ecosystem, although there's also every chance that the minigame is PlayStation-exclusive.</p>

<p>A quick look at the current <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10007293/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation Store page</a> for&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta&nbsp;</em>also shows the August 28th release date, so it's likely Konami will soon officially release the trailer and confirm the date.</p>

<p>According to leaker <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1885592410589110653" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">NateTheHate</a>, who accurately predicted the date on which the Nintendo Switch 2 would be revealed, a PlayStation State of Play showcase will air this month. He currently seems to be suggesting that it'll take place <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1885748440132456877" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on Valentine's Day</a>.</p>

<p>If that is indeed the case, then I wouldn't be surprised if the&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta&nbsp;</em>release date trailer aired during that presentation, which would also probably be why the Snake vs. Monkey minigame is shown.</p>




<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater&nbsp;</em>itself, it's a remake of the classic 2004 PS2 stealth-action game&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</em>.</p>

<p>Announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-3-remake-announced-at-state-of-play" rel="nofollow">during a PlayStation showcase in May 2023</a>, the remake will offer completely reworked visuals and gameplay, complete with a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-d-snake-eater-remake-reveals-first-spectacular-gameplay-in-unreal" rel="nofollow">transition to Unreal Engine 5</a>. It will, however, retain the voice audio of the original game and won't recast any actors.</p>

<p>The game is also being developed without the involvement of series creator Hideo Kojima, who's currently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-2-filming-and-recording-completed" rel="nofollow">hard at work on&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-2-filming-and-recording-completed" rel="nofollow">Death Stranding 2</a>&nbsp;</em>(as well as a stealth action game of his own mysteriously codenamed&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideo-kojima-announces-next-generation-espionage-action-game" rel="nofollow"><em>Physint</em></a>).</p>

<p>Assuming this leak is indeed correct,&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater&nbsp;</em>is due to launch for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2417610/METAL_GEAR_SOLID_D_SNAKE_EATER/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10007293/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/metal-gear-solid-d-snake-eater/9pjln214rtkq" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on August 28th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

But it’s keeping its original voice acting, and has rebuilt its original cutscenes in the Unreal Engine, rather than reinterpreting them.</p><p>The store page for the game, presumably also uploaded unintentionally, mentions <em>Snake Eater</em> will be a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-enhanced-support-8k-60fps-update-ff7-1851644737&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-enhanced-support-8k-60fps-update-ff7-1851644737">PS5 Pro Enhanced game</a></span>, so you can start getting excited about all those frames happening in the same second, <em>Zack</em>.

<p>An insider has claimed that Final Fantasy 16’s Xbox release announcement will arrive soon. The game’s release seemingly is planned for the “first half of 2025.” The leaker also revealed details about Final Fantasy 7 Remake and Rebirth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by IdleSlothVGT on <a href="https://x.com/IdleSlothVGT/status/1887250040491745562" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a>, NateTheHate recently spoke about Final Fantasy 16’s release plans for Xbox on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-game-studios-bethesda-abk-ot34-reseteora.1090722/page-103#post-135340638" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ResetEra</a>. According to Nate, the announcement should come shortly, but “not in the near future” if the developers aren’t implementing any “late changes”. Also, Final Fantasy 16 is scheduled to release for Xbox in the first half of 2025, “spring basically”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nate also spoke about Final Fantasy 7 Remake and Rebirth’s release plans on Xbox. The first instalment from Square Enix’s Remake Project is scheduled to arrive for Xbox “later this year,” and Rebirth is planned for 2026. Nate is unsure about the time but speculates that Final Fantasy Remake, Rebirth and FFXVI for Xbox “will be announced at the same time for maximum impact”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>NateTheHate also mentioned Final Fantasy’s plans for Nintendo’s highly anticipated console, the Switch 2. It seems that the developers have decided to prioritise Final Fantasy 7 Remake and Rebirth for the Switch 2 over Final Fantasy 16. Regardless, it is exciting to see Final Fantasy embrace a multi-platform future for the franchise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth broke the franchise’s<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-single-player-record-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> single-player record on Steam</a>. Also, the third part of the Remake Project will be released on a ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-will-release-on-a-wide-range-of-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wide range of platforms</a>’.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a> will finally receive player <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-20-long-years-wow-is-getting-player-housing-in-its-midnight-expansion/1100-6527718/" data-ref-id="1100-6527718">housing alongside its Midnight expansion</a>, and Blizzard has now revealed the first real details on what players can expect from the highly anticipated feature more than 20 years in the making.</p><p dir="ltr">For starters, Blizzard made clear in a <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24176592/building-in-azeroth-a-first-look-at-housing" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> diving into the feature that everyone who wants a house in Azeroth will be able to obtain one. There won't be hefty gold requirements, limited plots of land for which players compete via a lottery system, or taxes to pay. Players who let their subscription lapse or skip an expansion or two won't log on one day to find someone else living in their former home.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQXHFrLX6A4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fQXHFrLX6A4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"As part of our focus on wide adoption, we wanted to ensure that housing is available to everyone," Blizzard said. "If you want a house, you can have a house."</p><p dir="ltr">As for where players will be able to build their homes, at launch it will be in two designated housing zones--one for the Alliance and one for the Horde. The Alliance housing zone will be inspired by early-level questing zones like Elwynn Forest, Duskwood, and Westfall, while the Horde's will be inspired by Durotar and Azshara. Houses will be shared among all the characters in the same <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-the-war-withins-warbands-were-born-out-of-a-desire-to-keep-pushing-for-an-account-wide-future/1100-6525203/" data-ref-id="1100-6525203">Warband</a>, so while an Alliance character can't purchase a Horde house, if a Horde character in the Warband has a home, the Alliance character would be able to use it as if it were their own. There won't be faction restrictions when it comes to visiting the house of a friend on the opposite faction, and all housing rewards will be account-wide and usable by any character regardless of faction.</p><p dir="ltr">Anticipating player questions about why there will only be two housing zones when the feature launches, Blizzard wrote that having too many housing zones would conflict with the team's goal of player housing being a "deeply social" feature. Blizzard wants players to be socializing and meeting new people, and having multiple zones spread out all around the world would hinder that. Crafting new zones is also a ton of work, Blizzard said. It would rather do a great job on a smaller number of housing zones than do a passable one on a larger number. However, Blizzard said that there will be "more possible places to live in the future."</p><p dir="ltr">When it comes to outfitting new homes, Blizzard said it wants the feature to be "player-first" and not "revenue-first." There will be "hundreds and hundreds" of home-customization options found in-game as rewards, though Blizzard said some items for housing will be for sale on the in-game microtransaction shop.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4439669-wowplayerhousingneighborhoodconceptart.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4439669" data-ratio="0.58636865342163" data-width="3624" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4439669-wowplayerhousingneighborhoodconceptart.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4439669"></a><figcaption>Concept art for a Horde player housing neighborhood.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4439669-wowplayerhousingneighborhoodconceptart.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">A newly announced feature coming alongside housing will be neighborhoods. These neighborhoods will consist of 50 homes and be instanced but "persistent," so that "your neighbors can be your neighbors for years to come (or until one of you moves)," Blizzard said. There will be both public neighborhoods and private ones that groups of friends or guilds can create and customize together.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard did not state when exactly players could expect player housing to arrive, but said it will have plenty more details to share in the future. It also emphasized the feature will be an "evergreen addition" to the game, and one that will have its own roadmap and patches reaching into future expansions. As such, Blizzard said housing isn't something players should expect to be finished when it releases, but one that will instead continually be updated with new content and systems for years to come.</p><p dir="ltr">The approach Blizzard is taking for player housing in WoW is already quite different from some other modern MMOs. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-online-a-realm-reborn/" data-ref-id="5000-148228">Final Fantasy 14 Online</a> somewhat infamously had its own <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-14-will-unlike-many-real-world-governments-address-its-housing-shortage/1100-6481177/" data-ref-id="1100-6481177">in-game housing crisis</a> due to houses being in limited supply, with the developers creating a lottery system to determine who would be eligible to acquire a home. Houses that sit unused are reclaimed and put up for sale--something that won't be the case in WoW. In Amazon's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/new-world/" data-ref-id="5000-489582">New World</a>, houses cost a hefty sum of gold. Players must then continually pay taxes on their properties lest they be unable to use them (though those who don't pay their taxes never lose the home permanently).</p><p dir="ltr">WoW's current The War Within expansion is currently in full swing, and its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-the-war-within-next-major-update-is-going-full-goblin-mode/1100-6527723/" data-ref-id="1100-6527723">next update will be going full goblin-mode</a>, taking players to the goblin city of Undermine and handing out keys to customizable goblin hot rods for players to drift through the city streets with. The update is expected to release sometime in February or March, though Blizzard has not officially announced a release date.</p>

Xbox won't switch on? Microsoft has announced you can now head down to high street chain Currys to get your console repaired. 
</p>
<p>
Currys has been named as the UK's first ever Xbox Authorised Service Provider, following the retailer's previous partnership with Microsoft to act as similar for the company's Surface laptops.
</p>
<p>
If you have a broken Xbox Series S or Series X, Currys stores will now host "expert colleagues" who may be able to help, a press release from Microsoft today states.

<p>
Alternatively, Currys can also help get your console booked in to be repaired. Fun fact: this will be within Europe's largest tech repair centre, which is based in Newark, Nottinghamshire. 
</p>
<p>
While consoles out of warranty will presumably not be repaired for free, there is a positive spin to all this which is to encourage people to try and repair goods where possible, rather than simply throwing them away and creating more electronic waste.
</p>
<p>If you're in the US, Microsoft announced a similar partnership last month with uBreakiFix by Asurion, which is now the first Xbox Authorised Service Provider over the pond. It will also seek to repair Xbox consoles, at nearly 700 participating store locations State-side.
</p>
<p>Microsoft's next big gaming launch for Xbox is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/obisidian-confirms-avowed-60fps-mode-on-xbox-series-x-after-previously-saying-you-dont-necessarily-need-it">Avowed, which today was confirmed to feature a 60fps mode</a> if you play on Xbox Series X.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Capcom has announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/reverse">Resident Evil Re:Verse</a>, the pack-in multiplayer game for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/05/05/resident-evil-village-review-ps5-xbox-series-x/">Resident Evil Village</a>, is shutting down this year on 29th June 2025. All DLC for the game will be removed from sale on 3rd March.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.residentevil.com/reverse/us/topic/topic_250206.html">In the announcement</a>, the team writes:</p>


<p>Thank you for playing Resident Evil Re:Verse.</p>
<p>This is to inform you that service will be ending for Resident Evil Re:Verse, which comes packaged with a purchase of Resident Evil Village for PlayStation®5, PlayStation®4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, or Steam. The application and all of its related DLC will no longer be available for download or purchase.</p>
<p>Resident Evil Re:Verse was developed in celebration of the 25th anniversary of the Resident Evil series, and your overwhelming support for the game has far exceeded our expectations since the time of its release. Now that we’ve reached a new turning point for the series, we feel that Resident Evil Re:Verse has served its original, celebratory purpose admirably.</p>

<p>We are incredibly grateful for your warm support for Resident Evil Re:Verse, and we deeply apologize for bringing you this disappointing news.</p>
<p>Resident Evil Re:Verse took the whole Resident Evil franchise, chucked it into a multiplayer game mode blender, and came out with a rather barmy blend of PvP multiplayer combat with Resi monsters in it. There was plenty of head-scratching for what this really added to Village, when Resident Evil 3 had featured an asymmetrical multiplayer mode, and this was a more straight up head-to-head multiplayer game with power-ups to transform you into Resi baddies.</p>
<p>Originally intended to launch right alongside RE Village in mid-2021, it was delayed a couple times until it finally launched in late 2022 <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/10/24/resident-evil-village-winters-expansion-dlc-review/">alongside the Winters’ Expansion.</a> While it was supported with a few content updates through a premium DLC pass, it holds a resounding <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1236300/Resident_Evil_ReVerse/">‘Mostly Negative’ rating on Steam</a>.</p>

<p>Re:Verse and all of its DLC will be removed from online stores on March 3rd at 9pm PST (March 4th at 5am GMT). The servers will go offline on June 29th at 11:59pm PDT (June 30th at 8:59am BST). The game will no longer be playable once the servers are switched off.
</p><p>The multiplayer spin-off is a six-player deathmatch with playable goodies from across the series' long history and potions which turn you temporarily into one of its many baddies. It wasn't well received when it launched in 2022. Releasing a multiplayer spin-off no one wants, no one likes, then closing it down shortly thereafter is all very Capcom, bless 'em.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/feast-for-the-poor-quest-guide-how-to-complete/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/feast-for-the-poor-quest-guide-%E2%80%93-how-to-complete-this-kcd2-side-quest.1101807/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/feast-for-the-poor-quest-guide-how-to-complete/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, you’ll eventually be offered a side quest with an interesting premise. You’ll need to break into a military encampment and steal King Sigismund’s prized sausages reserved exclusively for royalty. However, the camp is heavily guarded and you’ll be challenged whenever you walk towards the gates.</p>



<p>Let’s talk about the solution for Feast for the Poor and figure out how to get the sausages from the camp in the easiest way possible.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-solve-feast-for-the-poor">How to Solve Feast for the Poor</h2>



<p>Feast for the Poor seems like a simple enough quest at first blush, but it’s tricky. Even going into the camp at night spells trouble, as you’re almost guaranteed to be seen by the many guards patrolling the area.</p>



<p>If you want to accept a challenge, you can dress in dark, light clothing and sneak into the camp after distracting a gate guard with a rock. Around the back of the camp (in the blue circle in the image below), you’ll find a barn with a window at the side of it – it’s quite visible.</p>



<p>If you climb up into that window, you’ll find yourself in the loft of a hay barn, and from here, you can get the best access to the camp without being challenged by a guard:</p>



<figure><figcaption>Blue = Entry, Green = Sausage</figcaption></figure>



<p>Instead of picking around the camp looking for the sausages, you can just head to the green circle on my map above. It’s here that you’ll find a painted chest in a circular tent – that’s the box containing the sausages.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, it’s a ‘very hard’ lock, so unless you have a high lockpicking skill, you’ll need to kill and loot a guard <strong>or </strong>pickpocket them for a set of keys. Once you’ve got the keys, you can get the sausages.</p>



<p><em>Remember that the bonus objective is to leave a head of cabbage in the box, but it doesn’t have much of an impact on the outcome if you forget</em>.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>Spoiler Note:</strong></p>



<p>If you wait until you complete the main campaign, the camp will no longer be off-limits, allowing you to walk in unchallenged and find the sausages. You’ll still need to get the keys or pick the lock, but at no point will guards demand you or attack you.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Now that you’ve got the sausages, you can leave and pick up the next part of this quest. You’ll need to head into Kuttenberg and find people begging in the streets, giving them sausages and choosing who you want to name as the responsible donor. </p>



<p>That’s how to complete Feast for the Poor in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 in a nutshell.</p>

<p>A new claim states that Rainbow Six Siege 2 will be revealed at the Six Invitational 2025 (SI 2025), which is scheduled for February 14-16, 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/rainbow-six-siege-2-in-the-works/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Game Post</a>, an X user called <a href="https://x.com/fraxiswinning/status/1887257947043975667" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">fraxiswinning</a> recently posted about Rainbow Six Siege 2 being allegedly revealed this month at the SI 2025 event. The post also claims that the game is internally referred to as Siege X and will feature a complete “engine overhaul” along with a “graphical upgrade in textures and models.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The leaker has alleged that it is “likely” that Rainbow Six Siege 2 will be released around the Year 10 Season 2 update, which is scheduled to arrive in a few months. It is also rumoured that Siege X will not see any old events return but will only host new ones.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rainbow Six Siege 2 is a sequel that players have long waited for. The original game was released in 2015 and has been going strong since then. The title still attracts thousands of players daily, with its latest 24-hour peak at <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/359550/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">over 67,000 players</a> on Steam. The developers also frequently provide new content, and recent updates have added<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-y9s4-patch-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> new operations</a> and features like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-is-finally-getting-full-crossplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full cross-play</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, players are hoping for a change, and it will be exciting to see what sort of graphical and engine improvements Ubisoft can make to an already successful franchise like Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-rules-rainbow-six-siege-cheaters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft is taking strict action</a> against Rainbow Six Siege cheaters, introducing more stringent anti-cheat measures. Also, an internal memo stated that recent layoffs were due to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-layoffs-memo-to-staff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“more efficient operating models.</a>” What are your thoughts on Rainbow Six Siege 2 being revealed at SI 2025?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or on our new&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

            <p>Bandai Namco has reportedly lost over a hundred staff in the last year.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/bandai-namco-studios-staff-silently-reduced-by-over-100-people-japan-pension-service-database-shows/">Automaton</a>, according to the <a href="https://www2.nenkin.go.jp/do/search_section/">online database of Japan's Pension Service</a>, the company's staff headcount dropped from 1294 on 1st April 2024 to 1177 on 4th February 2025 - a decrease of 117 people.</p>
<p>It's unclear which projects these employees were working on, or whether they left the company voluntarily or not.</p>

<p>The news follows a report from Bloomberg last year stating the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bandai-namco-reportedly-cuts-japanese-workforce-but-denies-pressuring-voluntary-leave">company was cutting its Japanese workforce</a> and cancelling a number of projects due to lacklustre demand.</p>
<p>What's more, while staff had not been directly laid off, around 200 employees were sent to what's known as "oidashi beya" - rooms where staff are left without a project to work on, often used instead for job hunting. These rooms are utilised in Japan due to strict labour laws making layoffs difficult to enforce.</p>
<p>At the time, Bandai Namco denied using these rooms. "Our decisions to discontinue games are based on comprehensive assessments of the situation. Some employees may need to wait a certain amount of time before they are assigned their next project, but we do move forward with assignments as new projects emerge," said a representative from Bandai Namco. "There is no organisation like an 'oidashi beya' at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bandai-namco-studios">Bandai Namco Studios</a> designed to pressure people to leave voluntarily."</p>
<p>Eurogamer has once again contacted Bandai Namco to confirm this latest loss of staff, but the company declined to comment.</p>
<p>However, these numbers from Japan's Pension Service do appear to line up with Bloomberg's report.</p>
<p>The Japan-only MMORPG Blue Protocol was cancelled by Bandai Namco in August last year, ahead of its Amazon Games published worldwide release. Mobile game Tales of the Rays was also shut down last year.</p>
<p>Several other projects have reportedly been cancelled or paused, including a project commissioned by Nintendo.</p>
<p>Last month, the Bandai Namco-published <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unknown-9-franchise-cancelled-as-developer-admits-game-didnt-come-near-expectations-series-didnt-warrant-any-further-exploration">Unknown 9 franchise was cancelled</a> as the developer admitted it "didn't come near" expectations.</p>
<p>Next for Bandai Namco will be the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-beta-test-dates-times-register">network test for Elden Ring spin-off Nightreign</a> later this month.</p>
<p>The news also follows the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tekken-boss-says-he-just-wants-to-meet-more-people-as-fans-spot-linkedin-post-looking-for-work">bizarre LinkedIn update from Tekken boss Katsuhiro Harada</a> who, after posting he was looking for new job opportunities, claimed he just wants to "meet more people and expand my horizons in the future".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Former Dragon Age lead developers have reacted to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-suggests-dragon-age-the-veilguard-might-have-sold-better-if-it-was-live-service-so-what-does-this-mean-for-mass-effect-5">suggestion by publisher EA that the series' most recent entry would have sold better as a live-service game</a>. 
</p>
<p>
This week, EA boss Andrew Wilson said players "increasingly seek shared world features and deeper engagement", while the company's chief financial officer bluntly claimed that "<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> underperformed, icing the competitive dynamics of the single-player RPG market".
</p>
<p>
The remarks raised eyebrows among fans, not least because Dragon Age: The Veilguard previously pivoted to being a live-service game mid-way through its development, only for EA to see sense and revert it back after BioWare's actual live-service effort Anthem was a flop.

</figure>
<p>
"Look, I'm not a fancy CEO guy," former Dragon Age creative director <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mikelaidlaw.bsky.social/post/3lhhb477frc2h">Mike Laidlaw wrote</a> on social media, "but if someone said to me 'the key to this successful single-player IP's success is to make it purely a multiplayer game. No, not a spin off: fundamentally change the DNA of what people loved about the core game' to me, I'd probably, like, quit that job or something."
</p>
<p>
Laidlaw worked on the Dragon Age series from its creation, and was set to serve as director on what became Dragon Age: The Veilguard, up until its live-service pivot. It was at this point that Laidlaw did indeed quit BioWare, after more than 15 years, to go elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
"Just thinking out loud, of course," Laidlaw continued. "Who'd be silly enough to demand something like that? ...Twice."
</p>
<p>
Fellow BioWare veteran David Gaider also chipped in, offering his perspective after having served as lead writer on the series up until The Veilguard.
</p>
<p>
"If I really dig into my empathy, I can kinda see the thinking here," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/davidgaider.bsky.social/post/3lhibt3rwk22l">Gaider wrote</a> on social media. "Like, let's say you don't actually know much about games. You're in a big office with a bunch of other execs who also don't know much about games. What are they all saying? 'Live games do big numbers!' 'Action games are hot!'"
</p>
<p>
"My advice to EA (not that they care): you have an IP that a lot of people love. Deeply. At its height, it sold well enough to make you happy, right? Look at what it did best at the point where it sold the most. Follow [<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> studio] Larian's lead and double down on that. The audience is still there. And waiting. ❤️"
</p>
<p>
Laidlaw wound up founding his own indie studio, and has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eternal-strands-review">just released the single-player RPG Eternal Strands</a>. It launched this month on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, including via Game Pass, if you fancy a new role-player that's not a live-service now.

			<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, the remake of the third entry in the popular stealth series, is launching in late August on PC and consoles, according to a new finding.</p>
<p>The game's <a href="https://store.playstation.com/it-it/concept/10007293" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation Store listing</a> was updated today with an August 28th release date which is also confirmed by a<a href="https://vulcan.dl.playstation.net/img/rnd/202502/0611/2c429928f5c5b20df3c78f5053ace69c011d4f391782ab47.mp4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;new trailer</a> that is currently only available on the PlayStation Store. With the trailer now out in the wild, it shouldn't take much longer for it to be released on YouTube and the release date to be officially confirmed. The trailer also teases that the Snake vs Monkey mini game will also make a return.</p>

<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is setting out to be an extremely faithful remake that will allow players to experience the epic Operation Snake Eater. Despite aiming to be a faithful recreation of the original, the remake will still come with some new features over the original, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-gameplay-changes/">a new control scheme</a>, a modernization improvement that was somewhat required by the improved visuals powered by Unreal Engine 5. At the same time, the game features very few changes, as series producer Noriaki Okamura still wants long-time fans to feel nostalgic while playing the game.</p>
<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S on August 28th worldwide.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-too-can-cosplay-poverty-with-this-159-disco-elysium-carrier-bag">a plastic bag blowing in the wind</a> made me question all I knew about the world, but in whatever way the opposite of life-affirming is. Less blowing, actually. More taunting me from my screen maddeningly like a middle finger salute from a man with no hands. It was a baffling piece of licensed merch from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a> studio ZA/UM and Atelier, who I assume are three hyenas in a board room sniffing each other's crotches for eternity.</p>
<p>I couldn't tell you exactly where I first saw the bag - which has actually been on sale for a few months now - but I soon realised why it had likely entered the zeitgeist again: an extensive set of a documentary podcasts by YouTube creator <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@The41stPrecinct">The 41st Precinct</a>, the latest of which interviews writers Dora Klindžić and Argo Tuulik for more time than I have ever spent on anything. Here's a clip on Atelier and <em>that fucking bag</em>.</p>

<p>"I have in the past received threats from management when I had tried to push back against some items, because this is an incredibly successful business for them," says Klindžić. "The darkest thing I ever heard was - I don't remember who it was from that circle - but they told me that it doesn't matter at all what people are saying on Twitter, because you see those same names who say they're never going to buy…they're the ones ordering these expensive items from ZA/UM. That this loud minority doesn't matter because people covet these items more than they care about this."</p><p>If you haven't been following the mess since Disco Elysium's release, it began when setting creator and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disco-elysium-dev-files-lawsuit-against-the-studio-that-allegedly-kicked-him-out">lead ideasman Robert Kurvitz got booted from the studio</a>, with a web of allegations of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disco-elysium-studio-bosses-humiliated-the-cancelled-expansions-lead-writer-for-speaking-to-journalists-claims-report">fraud and misconduct coming from either side</a>. More recently, Tuulik <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-disco-elysium-writer-survive-the-winter">has been fundraising</a> for legal fees for himself and Klindžić to get back the IP, as well as cover living expenses. </p>
<p>Again, this is just one short clip from the writers talking about their experience with the company. The 41st Precinct describes the podcasts as a "huge interview which covers every major event in the timeline of [Klindžić and Tuulik]'s working lives at ZA/UM" in the two year period between "Winter 2021 to their own dismissal in early 2024"</p>
<p>"I messaged Dora just as herself and Argo were considering their options for going public," he tells me. "Although they speak very fondly about the work <a href="https://youtu.be/JGIGA8taN-M">People Make Games</a> had done to expose the inner workings of ZA/UM, they felt that the level of corruption and conspiracy they had experienced was so vast and complicated that they needed to speak on a platform that was raw and allowed for every word of their story to be heard."</p>
<p>"Starting with the dismissal of Kurvitz, Rostov, and Hindpere in 2021 right through to as recently as early 2024 when news of the mass redundancies broke. In between all of that is an organisation which is compared to that of a cult, Argo and Dora talk extensively about how a group of higher ups - Tonis Haavel, Phil Davidson and Ed Tomaszewski - used power and influence to control the flow of information within ZA/UM, ensuring a handful of hand picked 'Lead Writers' were kept happy enough to do their bidding amongst the workers."</p><p>Klindžić, Tuulik and the host cover stories involving "corruption, workplace bullying, outright law breaking, union action, projects being meddled with to the point of suffocation, and a very real guerilla fight back inside ZA/UM from all of the workers who didn’t qualify as a puppet for the executives."</p>
<p>"This is not the only story like this in the industry,"  The 41st Precinct tells me. "people making games are being stamped on regularly in support of millionaire interests. Gaming is becoming another play thing for the super rich". He hopes the videos will play their part in the fight against that.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The release date is also in the new trailer, which shows a fresh look at familiar scenes from the classic stealth action game. The trailer ends with a monkey from Ape Escape slapping its bum, a nod to the Snake vs Monkey minigame in the original release that's presumably been recreated here too.

<p>Last year, a PlayStation blog in January suggested the game would release in 2024, but the <a href="http://eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-still-doesnt-have-a-release-date-despite-its-2024-window">year passed without a firm release date</a>. It's widely expected to be released this year instead, but there's been no official word from Sony or Konami.</p>
<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is a remake of the third <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> game, which is chronologically the first. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-is-being-remade-as-konami-says-younger-generation-now-unfamiliar-with-the-series">remake has been done with future generations in mind</a>, series producer Noriaki Okamura said in an interview last year.</p>
<p>"It was basically our mission, our duty, to kind of continue making sure that the series lives on for future generations," Okamura said. "After all, we leave behind much more than just DNA, as Solid Snake would say - but again, who is Solid Snake?"</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Kunos Simulazioni has released <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/assetto-corsa-evo">Assetto Corsa EVO</a> patch 0.1.5, finally bringing online functionality to the racing game, almost three weeks after its initial launch into Steam Early Access.</p>
<p>Now with the server backend live, elements like the car dealership, game economy, academy, car ownership and personalisation, as well as special events are now enabled. Also included in the update are a number of control and UI changes, there’s some track-specific improvements, and a smattering of other fixes elsewhere.</p>


<p>Up until this update, the game had been in a limited offline-only mode. At launch, as the servers first went offline, that meant players were restricted to just 5 of the Early Access release’s 20 cars, though as Kunos grappled with the situation, they released hotfixes that made all cars available to drive without earning them in-game. Alas, this was a game bitten by the issues that tying solo player progression to online server saves has, even though it’s a very common sight in all manner of other titles.</p>
<p>With this now restored, Kunos should be able to turn their focus to the first content drop, which will add two new cars, Fuji Speedway and more special events, and then the first major content and feature update.</p>
