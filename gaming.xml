			<p>I really enjoy word games. When I was younger I used to devour wordsearch books and other word puzzles. Be it wordle, arrow words, or crosswords, if there is a word puzzle around it is likely I will try and complete it. So when Birdigo came to my attention, it made sense to try it out. Billed as a game inspired by Balatro and Wordle, developers John August and&nbsp; Corey Martin set some high expectations, but does Birdigo meet them?</p>
<p><iframe title="Birdigo - Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-j-Gh1scTRs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Birdigo using bird migration paths as the basis for each run. There are six different runs in total, based on different birds including Swainson’s Hawk, Arctic Tern, Ruff, Northern Wheater, Amur Falcon, and Short-Tailed Shearwater, and then there are daily challenges alongside. Each of the runs is made up of a different number of stops, with each stop having a score target to meet to move on. Fail and your run ends and it is back to the beginning.</p>


<p>When you start a run you can pick a different deck of letters, with many that have to be unlocked by meeting various conditions. The standard deck has no penalties on it, but other decks will have more of one letter and could also reduce the number of words you can play. Letters themselves have different levels from basic up to diamond. The higher a letter rank is the more flaps, aka points, it is worth.</p>


<p>These points are then multiplied by power, with this power set by the length of the word and which feathers you have equipped. Feathers offer bonuses like giving a set power addition or giving certain length words more worth than others. In addition to feathers, there are song cards which you can use to upgrade a letter’s rank, convert letters into other letters, or refill the words you can play. These can only be used once, while feathers remain active until you replace them by buying a different one in store or earning at a stop.</p>
<p>So, Birdigo is not all about submitting the longest word possible as if you’re on an episode of Countdown, but creating words that will maximise points with the higher level letters and powers you have. The power worth of word lengths increases every time you use a certain length five times. For example, if you submit four letter words five times, four letter words will have more power.</p>

<p>Birdigo is a strategy game where you are trying to maximise the worth of a word, so making sure you are following a tactic is paramount. You need to focus on the feathers that will provide the right bonuses to meet the way you want to play, but it is a lot easier said than done and progress is very slow, so much so that is can actually be quite demotivating to continue playing. For instance, the second run is 27 stops and you have to pass that to unlock the other runs. According to my in game stats, after eight hours I have completed just one migration and failed 36 after 794 words played and 265 stops.</p>
<p>There needs to be some rebalancing as Birdigo seems to have the same quite small collection of feathers and songs, meaning you are quite limited in creating a strategy, and putting one of the longest runs second in the order, instead of building up to it seems like an oversight.</p>

<p>Birdigo’s visuals are quite delightful with calm scenes showing birds nodding along as you score, and with more birds fluttering onto the screen as you make progress. The day and night cycle is great too with menu icons lighting up as the sun descends and nighttime comes. The music is very calming alongside this and does take some of the edge off from the tension as you go through a run.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Birdigo has the right foundations in place and there is a a great hook to it, but it needs a couple of improvements to make people stick around. Progression is far too slow and being stuck on one migration run for hours is demotivating. Having more feathers and songs may help to realise the charming potential of this game.	</p></div>

            <p>Obsidian's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grounded-2">Grounded 2</a> has launched into early access, and the developers have one of those old-timey roadmaps explaining how it will change before the 1.0 release, give or take a few teasing redactions. This being a game about miniaturised children fighting insects, of course, the road in question may be only a few metres long. A garden pathmap, perhaps? Let's have a look, then. </p><!--more-->
<p>Coming in a fall 2025 update, we can expect a building grid and quality of life improvements, a hotpouch for buggies, and a new boss called AXL, thought to be a spider. With AXL will come a new boss arena, crafting recipes, armor, weapons and furniture.</p>
<figure>

<p>The next <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grounded">Grounded</a> 2 update in winter 2025 will introduce Steam Deck verification and cross-play features using a Microsoft account, plus support for rival handheld the ROG Ally. There is also talk of a new park area, a scanning tool called PEEP.R 2.0, a special damage type called Sour 2.0, and a new base-levelling stat, Cosiness. There will be new tier three equipment and omni-tool unlocks, together with a new mushroom set for base-building. Wash that down with a bucket of bugs: new species such as crickets and earwigs, and unspecified variations of existing creepy-crawlies.</p>
<p>The third big Grounded 2 update lands in summer 2026, and is all about swimming and ziplines. Also smoothies that grant status effects, watery bases, watery equipment (and some tier 4 gear and omni-tool unlocks), and some watery critters. There's an unnamed new park area on the way that is also likely to be aquatic in nature. Though I think it would be very funny if it turns out to be a large expanse of gravel.</p>
<p>After summer 2026, we enter the mist of Future Plans. These include more park areas, mutations, buggy customisation and progression, creatures, bosses, building options, and, well, just a whole lot of survival game junk, basically.</p>
<p>So far, the game seems to be doing well, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2661300/charts/">amply exceeding the original's launch player count</a> on Steam. We don't have a write-up for the moment, mostly because our team headcount is also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-sunday-papers-769">in the process of being miniaturised</a>, but freelance scribe Matt Reynolds has some guides to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grounded-2-grub-locations">Grounded 2 grub locations</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grounded-2-thistle-needles-where-to-find">where to find thistle needles</a>, among other challenges.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grounded-2s-early-access-gets-off-to-a-flying-start-as-obsidian-detail-the-next-year-of-updates]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The gaming world hasn’t talked enough about how it feels to get good at the original <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> for the NES. I mean, I get it, it’s a notoriously brutal example of “Nintendo Hard” difficulty. I still have nightmares about those endlessly respawning birds that boomerang relentlessly around protagonist Ryu Hayabusa. Yet with enough time, practice, and memorization, it’s possible to lay those hordes of 8-bit foes low in a split second of precise button presses. Once overwhelming challenges give way to the intoxicating realization of “whoa, did I just <em>do </em>that?” where your hands react faster than your brain can process what’s going on. If it weren’t for the next threat lurking right around the corner, you’d just sit there in awe of how absolutely cool you felt.</p><p>I bring this up because The Game Kitchen’s <em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em> is a pure distillation of “whoa, did I just <em>do </em>that!?” with virtually none of the trial-and-error frustration that its predecessors demanded. Even if the developers hadn’t gone on record and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendolife.com/features/i-cant-believe-this-is-happening-the-game-kitchen-on-reviving-ninja-gaiden&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/i-cant-believe-this-is-happening-the-game-kitchen-on-reviving-ninja-gaiden" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">proclaimed their love for the series</a></span>, that deep level of mechanical understanding about what makes vintage <em>Ninja Gaiden </em>awesome would have been evident just from a few minutes of playing <em>Ragebound</em>. This team <em>gets it</em>.</p><p><em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound </em>makes its homage to its NES predecessors obvious from the jump. Opening with the fatal duel between Ryu’s father and the mysterious gray ninja that series fans will remember from the first console <em>Ninja Gaiden</em>, our story begins with Ryu taking up the Hayabusa family’s sword and heading to the United States on a quest for revenge. However, <em>Ragebound </em>immediately strikes its own path by instead following the story of Ryu’s protege Kenji, who stays at home to deal with the <em>rather small matter</em> of a demon invasion. That’s right, Ryu sticks around for a tutorial and a tricky boss fight that’ll put new players in their place, but afterwards he’s out for virtually the entire adventure. Vengeance waits for no one.</p><figure id="" data-id="7c24e25e4cf33a51a5e918c38acaec11" data-recommend-id="image://7c24e25e4cf33a51a5e918c38acaec11" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A gameplay screenshot shows a blue-clad ninja attacking a large blue monstrous figure of some sort on a wooden structure in the water.

Just as The Game Kitchen had to carve its own vision for <em>Ninja Gaiden </em>with respect to the works that came before it, so too do we follow a hero who carves his own destiny using the skills of his master. You’ll miss a few references and leitmotifs if this is your first <em>Ninja Gaiden</em>, but otherwise it’s perfectly accessible to newcomers.</p><p>Kenji’s path eventually crosses with Kumori, a kunoichi of the Black Spider Clan that stands opposed to the Hayabusas. Extenuating circumstances force Kenji and Kumori into an unholy alliance, and the two embark on a journey that sees them facing off against both man and demonkind alike. The beats from here on out share similarities to those of the first <em>Ninja Gaiden</em>, even if <em>Ragebound </em>is a self-contained side story. The <em>Ninja Gaiden </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://jisho.org/search/gaiden&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://jisho.org/search/gaiden" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gaiden</a></span>, if you will.</p><h2 id="h481213"><a id=""></a>You’re that ninja</h2><p>While Kenji may be Ryu’s student, he plays just as fluidly as his master ever did. Whether he’s climbing walls, dodge rolling to pass through otherwise unavoidable attacks, or bouncing off enemies mid-air to execute sick aerial combos, every button press feels impeccably responsive. And despite the impressive range of attack and movement options Kenji has at his disposal, they’re all made possible through a simple control scheme that wouldn’t feel out of place in an actual SNES game.<em> </em>Aside from a few <em>very </em>specific quirks (does my aerial attack have a cooldown?), I always felt in complete control while playing <em>Ragebound</em>.</p><p>And trust me, I needed every tool in the toolbox to succeed. The earliest levels aren’t afraid to litter the screen with bad guys to take down, giving me little time to react before I’d take damage. Yet nine times out of ten, before my eyes could register everything that was happening, I’d perform a flurry of jumps, rolls, and slashes that’d clear the screen instantly. It’s not like I just relied on one tried-and-true strategy either, as I’d intuitively try attacks that just felt cool to do in the moment, often leading to huge payoffs.</p><p>While I’d like to chalk this up to my hardcore retro gaming skills, those consistent feelings of being <em>so cool </em>are a testament to how impeccably balanced <em>Ragebound </em>is. For instance, most enemies can be killed in a single strike, but there are also bulkier foes who won’t go down from one single, standard slash. Meanwhile, there are also glowing enemies who can grant Kenji a supercharged attack that cleaves right through these more imposing adversaries. This setup incentivizes you to think about the order in which you wish to take out your opposition, and even in chaotic situations, spotting a graceful way to navigate the fray and deploy those supercharged attacks on more formidable foes felt easy and natural. It helps that <em>Ragebound</em> features such fluidly animated pixel art that reading enemy attacks and telegraphs is a cinch. I didn’t master every encounter right off the bat, but I’d have a good idea of what I should have done differently to avoid a hit or keep my combos going.</p><p>Most importantly, <em>man</em>, does <em>Ragebound</em> feel as good as it looks. The sounds of cutting through small fry never get old, and those moments when the action stops just as Kenji uses a supercharged attack to slice a huge foe clean in half <em>really </em>convey the weight of the blow. I rode a consistent stream of “whoa, did I just <em>do </em>that!?” highs, whether or not I’d practiced a stage before. There were moments where I was completely immersed in a flow state, feeling just the right amount of adrenaline coursing through my veins as I played out ninja-based power fantasies I’d never actually realized I had.</p><p>And for all the ways in which its design elegantly encourages precision, I also always felt I had ample room to make mistakes, and <em>Ragebound </em>barely dwells on deaths before throwing Kenji back in the action. Rather than encouraging mastery through failure, the game feels <em>so </em>rewarding when played well that I never wanted to settle for a victory by the skin of my teeth. It helps that each stage looks and feels so distinctive that there’s nary a repetitive challenge to be found, even when bosses reappear later in the game. I could do without the two short vehicle-based autoscroller stages, but other than that, it’s all bangers here.</p><h2 id="h481214"><a id=""></a>I can’t believe it’s not Tecmo</h2><p><em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em> brilliantly evolves the gameplay of its vintage 2D predecessors in a way that feels fresh, modern, yet familiar all at once. I do wish I could say the same about its storytelling. I get that plot typically isn’t a priority in retro revivals like this, but the first <em>Ninja Gaiden </em>on the NES was a trailblazer when it came to narrative. The original manga-style cutscenes are well-directed given their vintage and limitations, and the story aimed high with surprise deaths, big plot twists, and a climactic finale. It’s nothing mind-blowing nowadays, but you just weren’t getting this kind of storytelling in stage-based action games back in 1989 (settle down <em>Astyanax </em>fans, I see you).</p><p><em>Ragebound </em>does start strong in this regard. The Game Kitchen utilizes its signature art style from <em>Blasphemous</em> to weave together some impressive cinematics that pay loving homage to the series’ origins. However, once the game enters its third act, the story mostly devolves into small quips between frenemies Kenji and Kumori with little else to keep the narrative exciting. I’d go as far as to say that 1989’s <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> actually makes <em>Ragebound</em> feel simple by comparison. There’s the occasional twist, but I never felt especially connected to what was happening on screen.</p><figure id="" data-id="9c62723dbd47cf9c1f7ef907bc91d058" data-recommend-id="image://9c62723dbd47cf9c1f7ef907bc91d058" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image from a cutscene shows the blue-clad ninja looking distraught, his head in his hand.

An older man sits across from him." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s a shame, because <em>Ragebound</em> ends on a note that <em>should </em>have been meaningful and impactful had the buildup been better executed. The moment in question didn’t linger in a way that let me sit with what had happened either, which made the entire ending feel like clumsy tonal whiplash. Even completely disregarding the story, I thought <em>Ragebound </em>ended an act too soon. The set pieces in the end convey more “rising action” than “climax of the story,” a problem that I’m sure is observable by even the most dedicated cutscene skipper. By the time I hit the final boss, I was thinking less “oh this is <em>it</em>!” and more “oh, <em>this </em>is it?” It’s a bummer of a way to end an otherwise strong journey.</p><h2 id="h481215"><a id=""></a>It’s Blasphemously good</h2><p>I could certainly nitpick at <em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em> more. Hitboxes occasionally felt a little too big. I didn’t love a few of the enemy types near the end. The unlockable hard mode modifies an early game boss in a way that felt way too rigid, creating an awkward difficulty spike that the rest of that playthrough never wound up matching again.</p><p>Still, a few grievances and an underwhelming finale haven’t stopped me from returning to <em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em>, even after I’d seen everything I’d need to write a review. The moment-to-moment action just feels <em>so good</em>, and there’s enough variety between stages to make mastering each one a unique, worthwhile challenge. I’ve never fancied myself a high score chaser or a speedrunner, but all I can think about as I write this is picking up my controller and chasing max ranks on stages. Not because I have anything to prove or unlock, but because I want to see what other combos or tricks I can pull off. In a modern gaming landscape where we often need a slow drip-feed of rewards as encouragement to keep playing, it’s refreshing to see a game with such high replay value simply because it’s that tight and concise. Just the act of play is its own reward.</p><p><em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound </em>captures virtually everything that made 2D action games of yesteryear awesome while ironing out all the rough edges synonymous with that era of gaming. It looks spectacular, controls like a dream, and boasts levels that are worth experiencing over and over again. It does end too soon for its own good, and its short runtime may throw some people off. Aside from that, however, the developers at The Game Kitchen have proven themselves to be masters of their retro-inspired craft with this one. <em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound </em>is a worthy successor to its NES predecessors, without a boomerang bird in sight.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-review-2d-blasphemous-1851787265]]></content:encoded>

Nothing to see here."</p><p dir="ltr">This update comes in spite of Aggro Crab literally saying it <a href="https://x.com/AggroCrabGames/status/1940498163875696969" rel="nofollow ">can't add cannibalism to Peak</a>, but hey, the people get what the people want. Luckily, this new feature doesn't force you to Hannibal-style cut up the cute little avatars that are your friends. Instead, when your player character is too hungry, your friends' avatars start to <a href="https://x.com/ava_lamp/status/1950341032844923029" rel="nofollow ">look like a walking rotisserie chicken</a>. If you manage to successfully eat them, they turn into a skeleton (and die, unsurprisingly).</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrlUVhLBjG0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jrlUVhLBjG0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Thankfully, cannibalism wasn't the only thing added in with this update. In the options menu you'll find a few new additions, like the ability to adjust your field of view while climbing, and a push-to-mute setting ("No more having to listen to your streamer friend talk to chat"). There's also been some big fixes, one being a temporary solution to a bug that caused a lot of fall damage from short distances, and performance has been "greatly improved" too.</p><p dir="ltr">You can check out the full patch notes below.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Patch 1.10.a Notes</h2><p><b>Features:</b></p><ul><li>Added cannibalism.</li></ul><p><b>Options:</b></p><ul><li>Polish and Turkish translations are in!</li><li>New Setting: "Climbing Extra Field Of View". This lets you adjust how the FOV changes while climbing.</li><li>New Setting: PUSH-TO-MUTE. This works the opposite way of "Push-To-Talk." No more having to listen to your streamer friend talk to chat.</li><li>Settings that were previously hidden outside of the Main Menu will now show up but be disabled. Hopefully this reduces some confusion!</li></ul><p><b>Balance Changes:</b></p><ul><li>Fixed an issue where Trail Mix, Granola Bar, Medicinal Root, and Airline Food would not give extra hunger reduction after cooked.</li><li>Fixed an issue where cooking something Well-Done and then stashing it would remove the buffs. For reference, the intended behavior is that Well-Done items give the same bonus as Cooked items. It's your warning before it burns :)</li><li>Remedy Fungus now also cures poison in addition to injury, because it seems like it would.</li></ul><p><b>Major Fixes:</b></p><ul><li>We have a temporary solution to the FALL DAMAGE BUG where you would take a signifcant amount of fall damage when falling a short distance, often from spamming the climb and lunge buttons. A more comprehensive improvement will come in a later patch. Let us know if you still see any weird fall damage behavior!<br>EDIT: It seems like this only addressed the issue when sliding down while holding the wall, but not the one where you are on a slope. Sorry about that folks, we'll continue to investigate.</li><li>THE NAPBERRY PLANT IS TEMPORARILY DISABLED. Some folks were having issues with lag and crashes due to our implementation of the Napberry Plant. Trust me its a weird one. While we work on a better implementation asap, the Napberry Plant won't show up in the level.</li><li>Performance at the PEAK is greatly improved. It was the dang wildflowers.</li><li>Fixed an issue where an item would get stuck in your "Hands" Item Slot. This issue happens when the server can't keep up with items that are swapped too rapidly, so a tiny delay has been added after swapping items before you're able to pick up a new item.</li></ul><p><b>Minor Fixes:</b></p><ul><li>You can no longer get the Bookworm Badge by simply reading the final page without the others.</li><li>Fixed an issue where reading the guidebook pages out of order could result in inconsistent stat tracking for the Bookworm Badge.</li><li>Removed an un-spatialized sound effect that would play when players landed from a fall.</li><li>Fixed an issue where Ticks counted as berries toward the Foraging Badge, lol.</li><li>Fixed an issue where an item in the temporary slot would display the wrong amount of Cooked.</li><li>Fixed an issue where eating a Scorchberry wouldn't contribute toward the Forager Badge</li><li>Fixed an issue where getting an Anti-Rope Cannon wouldn't get you the Esoterica Badge.</li><li>You can no longer obtain progress achievements (such as Beachcomber Badge) while you are a ghost. Reaching a new area while alive should grant you achievements for all the areas completed that run.</li></ul>

                <p dir="ltr">Battlegrounds might be literally built into the acronym PUBG, but Krafton sees something far bigger for the battle royale game's future. The company wants PUBG to become a "gameplay platform" in the vein of Fortnite and Roblox--featuring various modes and even user-made content.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/krafton-pubg-unreal-subnautica-donkey-kong-darth-vader" rel="nofollow ">GameFile</a> reports that Krafton chief financial officer Dongkeun Bae discussed the company's expanded vision for PUBG on an earnings call earlier this week. "In the age of PUBG 2.0, it will not simply be a battle royale game per se," Bae said. The CFO wants the game to turn into a platform, noting that they're "developing wide-ranging modes under that objective."</p><p dir="ltr">A major part of this transition will include <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-getting-destructible-environments-and-switching-to-unreal-engine-5/1100-6521738/">the switch to Unreal Engine 5 for PUBG</a>. Krafton has openly talked about this change since March 2024, with the Epic game engine opening up user-generated content to become a part of the experience. (Things have really come around, considering the PUBG Corp. once <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-getting-destructible-environments-and-switching-to-unreal-engine-5/1100-6521738/">sued and then dropped a lawsuit against the Fortnite maker</a>.)</p><p dir="ltr">There is also a PUBG <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-spin-off-gets-a-new-name-and-more-details/1100-6529319/">spin-off in the works called PUBG: Blindspot</a>, previously known as Project Arc. The game is "a 5v5 team-based top-down tactical shooter," according to Krafton. Another spin-off in the same universe is reportedly an extraction shooter called PUBG: Black Budget.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ousted-subnautica-2-devs-lawsuit-demands-full-250-million-payout-and-creative-control/1100-6533246/">Krafton is currently embroiled in a lawsuit</a> with Unknown Worlds co-founders Charlie Cleveland and Max McGuire, who were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-subnautica-2-director-says-the-game-is-ready-for-early-access-release/1100-6533016/">reportedly forced out from the developer</a> earlier this month. In the middle of this, Krafton has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/subnautica-2-leak-is-real-krafton-confirms/1100-6533144/">confirmed an internal document leak for Subnautica 2 was legit</a>, pointing to multiple missed development milestones.</p>

Wilson said during EA's latest earnings call that, "We love competition" after being asked if EA sees any "competitive pressure" with its FC series.</p><p>To be sure, Rematch and EA's FC series are not exactly true competitors given the size and scale of EA's franchise. But Rematch is nonetheless a new player in the soccer market that EA is paying attention to.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Rematch GameSpot Review</p>
      </div>
<p>"We come to work every day to compete--that's been true for all of our games, especially our sports games, for the best part of 30 or 40 years," Wilson said, as <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/ea-sports-fc/ea-boss-doesnt-seem-worried-about-rematch-stealing-ea-sports-fc-26s-thunder-as-he-insists-we-love-competition-but-are-always-watching-competitors-we-never-sit-back-with-arrogance/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reported by GamesRadar</a>. "I think competition makes us better. We're always watching what the competition does. We're always evaluating where there are new needs being met for new players. We're always looking to work that into the offerings that we have for players."</p><p>Rematch is an arcade-style soccer game that doesn't feature real-life players or leagues. Wilson said "the magnitude of licenses" for EA's FC series helps set the franchise apart.</p><p>That being said, Wilson said EA won't "rest on our laurels" and will try to find new ways to win fans and keep them. "We never sit back with arrogance and pretend we don't have to be thoughtful about what's going on in the marketplace and what new players might want out of the next football experience that they want to play," he said.</p><p>Rematch launched in June on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, and it reached 5 million players after a month. The next EA Sports FC game, meanwhile, launches in September.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As I sat in a crowded room full of video game kiosks during <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/summer-game-fest-2025-recap" rel="nofollow">Summer Game Fest 2025</a>, I had the chance to talk to a The Game Kitchen developer for&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em>. I was watching my colleague, Andrew Otton, play as I gushed about<em>&nbsp;</em>the game with the developer. About a week prior, I had already played the demo in full and thoroughly enjoyed all of its offerings.</p>

<p>The developer's enthusiasm for&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em>&nbsp;was palpable. He talked about collaborating with Koei Tecmo, and about staying true to&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden</em>'s roots, and how awesome it was to create this canonical entry in a coveted franchise.</p>

<p>Now that I've had a chance to go through&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em>&nbsp;in full, it's evident that passion for the franchise was put to good use. Incredible, high-quality pixel art is combined with fast-paced, challenging gameplay to create one of 2025's best platformers.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-ryu.jpg?itok=ttZiqxLq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-ryu.jpg?itok=axnwWx4q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ryu, the true master.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><h2>Step Aside, Ryu. A New Ninja's in Town!</h2>

<p><em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em>&nbsp;comes from the talented developers from The Game Kitchen. They're known for their work on the&nbsp;<em>Blasphemous&nbsp;</em>series, with its impressively detailed pixel art and addictive 2D Metroidvania/platforming gameplay. It's clear The Game Kitchen's experience in the field of 2D platformers was put to good use.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But make no mistake,&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em>&nbsp;is not a Metroidvania; rather, it's a traditional, hard-as-nails 2D platformer. Players take the role of Kenji Mozu, a ninja of the Hayabusa clan. When the Hayabusa village is attacked by ferocious demons, Ryu takes a step back in the narrative, having his own escapades in the USA. It's all in Kenji's hands to clean up this mess.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-ninjas_0.jpg?itok=hZciYht1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-ninjas_0.jpg?itok=0KCrltOa 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The dual protagonists of our game, Kenji and Kumori.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>Through a series of events taking place early on in&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em>, Kenji becomes fused with a Black Spider Clan kunoichi named Kumori. While Kenji is more adept with his katana, Kumori relies on shuriken.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first few levels are a fine introduction to these two characters; you get to play them without being fused, so you come to learn the tools of their trade. A bit later on, when the two merge, it's easy to appreciate the increase in power by being able to utilize both sword and shuriken.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-jumping.jpg?itok=lzMfaBtI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-jumping.jpg?itok=JDb91QVi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Guillotine boost your way to victory!</figcaption></figure><h2>Katanas, Shurikens, and Demons</h2>

<p>At its core,&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em>&nbsp;is a relatively straightforward platformer, but it's a game thick with action. I tried to go through levels at a fast pace, as the fantastic soundtrack encouraged me to hack and slash my way through enemies with incredible speed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You quickly get a sense that it's a game meant to be taken at a faster pace than other 2D platformers. There's a certain flow you get into in these levels, and that's aided by two handy abilities at your disposal: the Guillotine boost and the Hypercharge.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Guillotine boost allows you to bounce on enemies and objects. In doing so, Kenji's able to stay in the air for longer periods of time. Bouncing from obstacle to obstacle is satisfying to pull off, especially when you're using the boost to navigate past long gaps and dodge pesky projectiles.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-hypercharge_0.jpg?itok=ST0w9iF7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-hypercharge_0.jpg?itok=ZUMgDUAV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Kill this guy with your sword, and you'll get a Hypercharge!</figcaption></figure><p>Hypercharge, meanwhile, is a boost that increases the damage of a single strike from Kenji's katana or Kumori's shuriken. Some enemies can't be killed in a single hit, so Hypercharge will be your friend for those brawny lookin' enemies.</p>

<p>You can manually give yourself a Hypercharge at the expense of some of your health, but many enemies, with a colored aura, are conveniently placed so that they grant you a Hypercharge when you slay them. A blue aura is for Kenji, while a pink one is for Kumori, so you have to slay them with the right weapon to get a charge.</p>

<p>I was able to get a quick grasp on these mechanics, and in doing so, that certain "flow" I mentioned becomes cathartic to experience. As a gameplay example, you can guillotine bounce from obstacle to obstacle, then slice an enemy with a blue aura for a Hypercharge. Use that Hypercharge buff to throw a shuriken at a bulky enemy with a pink aura, and you can essentially become an unstoppable force.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-kumori_0.jpg?itok=lSnIMWFf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-kumori_0.jpg?itok=UbsHlGNq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Kumori can temporarily separate from Kenji. Her segments of gameplay are sparse, but are often filled with time-based platforming challenges.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><h2>Putting Your Ninja Skills to the Test</h2>

<p>That's not to say&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em>&nbsp;is without any sort of challenge. Levels are riddled with obstacles that constantly test your finesse as a ninja. You're able to climb on walls, for instance, and that introduces its own platforming challenges as it limits your abilities to a certain degree.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Boss fights are also exciting. When it comes to 2D platformers such as this, I'm hard to please when it comes to bosses.&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden</em>&nbsp;introduces quite a few bosses, and, with the exception of a few repeats, each one feels distinct and poses its own distinct challenge. The final boss, in particular, really put my skills to the test, but it was very satisfying to finally win.</p>

<p>Upon beating&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em>, there's also a hard mode. I'd almost argue this is the "true" way&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em>&nbsp;is meant to be played, paying homage to the tough-as-nails lineage of the series. Checkpoints, which heal the player, are more sparse and danger is much more abundant.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-boss.jpg?itok=140v6cwN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-boss.jpg?itok=KkBh9Of8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This is getting out of hand, now there are two of them!&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>You can expect more enemies, obstacles, and difficult platforming challenges in hard mode. Bosses, by the way, are exponentially tougher and will try your patience. Making use of your abilities, and taking the proper equipment into each level will be necessary for this mode.</p>

<p>My only complaint is that this mode is front-loaded with some truly brutal, almost insurmountable fights, so it doesn't really&nbsp;ease you into this new difficulty. In fact, bosses in the latter half of hard mode felt easier than the first two or three.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2><em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound:&nbsp;</em>A Pixelated Feast for the Eyes</h2>

<p>The pixel art in&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em>&nbsp;is jaw-droppingly good. The Game Kitchen absolutely flex their muscles to an absurd degree when it comes to&nbsp;this title, and each level holds so many surprises not just from a gameplay perspective, but from an artistic one.&nbsp;</p>

<p>From the burning, demon-infested Hayabusa village, to corporate high-rises (and even a secret pirate cove?), there are a lot of different locales to explore. Backgrounds in levels are robust in detail, truly capturing the feel and essence of the&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden&nbsp;</em>series with elements of traditional Japan and semi-futuristic tech and cities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Levels are dynamic in that enemies can be seen jumping both from the foreground and background onto the stage. In one instance, at a construction site, a canopy is torn open as enemies jump in your way. In another level, a rushing waterfall shows the shadow of enemies lurking in wait, and upon getting closer, they reveal themselves and attack you.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-water-graphics.jpg?itok=lDyXj8J6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-water-graphics.jpg?itok=LW2RJIjA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It might seem simple, but the water graphics here were really impressive.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>My favorite instance of The Game Kitchen's technical prowess in all things pixel art is in a Black Spider Clan high-rise. These demons come charging through the glass windows of the building, shattering glass everywhere, creating a chaotic and action-packed sequence. All of this is in 2D, mind you, but it captures the essence of the adrenaline-pumping sequences from 3D&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden</em>&nbsp;titles.</p>

<p>All of this is accompanied by a soundtrack that's sure to amp you up.&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em>&nbsp;uses traditional instruments like the shamisen and combines them with nostalgic, 90s-inspired rock-and-roll. Believe me when I say the ending credits song is not to be missed.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-gameplay_0.jpg?itok=i7RS6JRb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-gameplay_0.jpg?itok=p8y1WRvc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ninjas are so back.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound&nbsp;</em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>As a canon entry into the&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden</em>&nbsp;series, you can expect a narrative. Though, I say "narrative" loosely, as this is very much an action game first. There are some attempts to develop Kumori and Kenji as characters, and I find them likable... but writing never quite lives up to its potential. Dialogue is very short and to the point. A bit more dialogue to flesh out their personalities would have done wonders.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Small gripes aside,&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em>&nbsp;is a triumphant entry into the franchise. It's the Year of the Ninja, so we're all expecting big things from&nbsp;Koei Tecmo. So far, they're batting at 1000 with&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</em>&nbsp;and now with the outstanding&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em>.</p>

            <p>The game of chicken between publishers and players over whether $80/£70 is an acceptable price for the shiniest of video games continues. EA have announced that, as regards their forthcoming shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>, they don't think it is, but that may change, because they are never going to say no to more money. </p><!--more-->
<p>Some brief background: executives at various companies have been bandying around the idea of a general price hike for a while. The broad justification often given is that standard price points for blockbuster shootybangers such as Battlefield have not risen in proportion to development costs, and that games theoretically offer many more hours of funtimes than, say, those stupid no-good films, with their shocking absence of levelling systems and sidequests.</p>
<p>Capcom's president Harushiro Tsujimoto, for example, recently <a href="https://kotaku.com/capcom-president-game-prices-too-low-resident-evil-4-1850874279">opined</a> that "raising unit prices is a healthy option for business". Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-publisher-ceo-thinks-videogame-prices-are-very-very-low-for-what-they-offer">has suggested that</a> videogame prices are "very, very low" for what they give you. Michael Douse, publishing director of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> developer Larian, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-publishing-director-says-almost-all-games-should-cost-more-at-a-base-level-because-they-cost-so-much-to-make">reckons</a> "almost all games should cost more at a base level". He thinks next year's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a> could breach the current, widely embraced $70/£60 ceiling for the standard boxed edition of a premium game.</p>
<p>Nintendo may have beaten Rockstar to it. They've been selling first-party Switch 2 games for $80, and appear to be <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/it-was-the-biggest-console-launch">getting away with it</a>, though a lot of game sales at launch form part of hardware bundles. As ever, it's worth noting that Nintendo enjoy a stature among game publishers equivalent to the High Elves in Tolkien. That's to say, they've been around forever and do not have to live by the same crude laws as the mortal races. </p>
<p>The same isn't true of Microsoft, who recently tried to raise the price of Obsidian's corpo satire <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a> to $80. Mass internet screeching resulted, and Microsoft decided <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-u-turn-on-charging-80-for-the-outer-worlds-2-and-other-xbox-games-cue-memes-and-pre-order-refunds">they were going to sell The Outer Worlds 2 for $70 after all</a>, spoofishly framing this on social media as the intervention of a government regulator. At what point in capitalism's co-option of criticism of capitalism do skulls start to actually implode, I wonder.</p>
<p>Now, here comes TD Cowen analyst Douglas Lippl Creutz with a question for EA chief executive officer Andrew Wilson during the publisher's <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4805853-electronic-arts-inc-ea-q1-2026-earnings-call-transcript">latest quarterly earnings report</a>. He would like to know whether EA are considering selling Battlefield 6 and other major games for $80, in the wake of Microsoft and Nintendo's movements.</p>
<p>"We're not looking to make any changes on pricing at this stage," Wilson responded, continuing that "we already offer a fairly broad pricing scheme across our various products. When you think about everything from free to play through to our premium products and our deluxe editions, our orientation is always to capture the full spectrum of pricing so that we can serve players in the best way possible and offer them the greatest value. We'll continue to look at opportunities to deliver great value to our players through various pricing schemes over the course of time, but no dramatic changes planned yet."</p>
<p>Here are some simple, non-exhaustive objections to the "games should cost more" reasoning above: some game development budgets are exorbitant because the projects are badly managed, and there is a difference between a game making enough money and a game making enough money for its investors. Publishers often have frankly insane expectations. There was no mention in the quarterly earnings call of a recent report that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-reportedly-has-a-100-million-player-albatross-around-its-neck-and-its-single-player-is-running-massively-late">EA want Battlefield 6 to attract 100 million players</a>, a feat no other Battlefield game has come close to achieving.</p>
<p>The game's first single player trailer surfaced last week, in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-has-finally-been-revealed-with-a-firmly-anti-helicopter-trailer-and-no-release-date">a terrible show of helicopter abuse</a>. Look out for a full reveal of the multiplayer tomorrow.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-wont-cost-80-but-ea-arent-ruling-out-future-price-hikes-to-capture-the-full-spectrum-of-pricing]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> is the newest entry in one of Nintendo’s longest-running franchises, and it’s a rip-roaring good time for fans eager to destroy everything in their paths. However, players only control Donkey Kong this time around, with his usual sidekicks like Diddy and Dixie taking on supporting roles as non-playable characters. What does that mean for the prospect of co-op, though? Let’s talk about it.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196165" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="95" data-playlist="196165,196646,196452" data-current="196165"><div><p>What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21711.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h481076"><a id=""></a>Does <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> even have co-op?</h2><p>If you’re looking to play <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> with a friend or family member, I’ve got some exciting news: <strong>The game features a co-op feature</strong>! One other player can join up and help you beat levels, but it just might not be in the way that you think. But what can you do with it? </p><p><strong>Co-op in <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> doesn’t split the screen and give a second player full control of their own DK-like hero in the game world.</strong> Instead, it allows them to control Donkey Kong’s adorable companion Pauline as she rides along his shoulder. Because of this, the second player is rather limited in their moveset, not getting to experience the rolling, punching, or general sense of momentum that comes from playing as the game’s titular star.</p><p>However, that doesn’t mean that Pauline is useless. She’s anything but! While controlling Pauline, <strong>the second player can copy materials around a level, then shout that material at enemies or obstacles to deal damage</strong>. This can help with clearing paths, and it’s especially helpful for dishing out damage to bosses.</p><p>You can play <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> via local co-op or online. Even cooler, <strong>by using GameShare, you can temporarily allow your friend or family member (especially young children) to join your game with their own Switch or Switch 2, even if they don’t own the game themselves</strong>. Whoever’s controlling Pauline also doesn’t have to worry about abilities cooling down. They can spam away, which can make the game even more fun and chaotic. Like many Nintendo games, this opens up the door to a lot of fun play opportunities and quirky moments of discovery. It’s rad as hell.</p><p><br>While the co-op mode in <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> is a little limited when compared to other fully fledged co-op games, it’s still a neat way for youngsters or casual gamers to join in the fun. Whether you’re flying solo or bringing a pal along for the ride, <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> is available now for Nintendo Switch 2.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-co-op-support-gameshare-pauline-1851787349]]></content:encoded>

And you know what, I think <em>FF8</em> might’ve been an even better candidate for a remake project that fools around with possible multiple timelines and recurring events. </p><p>I’ll defend the <em>FF7</em> remake project’s silly little narrative that sorta implies there are multiple versions of the same events of the original game’s timeline happening all at once, but really, <em>FF8</em>’s narrative was made for such a retelling. Why? Well, I’ll have to spoil a 26-year old game to explain that. </p><figure id="" data-id="97ff336391ae4b9df780dab87a54f9f0" data-recommend-id="image://97ff336391ae4b9df780dab87a54f9f0" data-format="png" data-width="1600" data-height="176" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="97ff336391ae4b9df780dab87a54f9f0" data-recommend-id="image://97ff336391ae4b9df780dab87a54f9f0" data-format="png" data-width="1600" data-height="176" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Like any classic <em>FF</em> game, <em>FF8</em> had multiple layers of plot twists. After finding out that Squall and crew all grew up together in an orphanage before their bonds with the summoned Guardian Forces drained their memories, we also learn that the very existence of Squall’s mercenary group, SeeD, was created after a sorceress traveled back in time to bestow Squall with the task of eliminating sorceress Ultimecia, who sought to do some funny business with time, collapsing it in on itself or something (sounds an awful lot like Sephiroth’s goals in <em>Rebirth</em>, come to think of it). </p><p>What this boils down to is this: <em>FF8</em> is a story of meddling with the past, literally, to change the future. </p><figure id="" data-id="c97a5578199bc488b83b4cefbe2ce43d" data-recommend-id="image://c97a5578199bc488b83b4cefbe2ce43d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="607" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rinoa and Squall look out over the city of Kalm." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rinoa and Squall look out over the city of Kalm." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / ReforgedStudio / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c97a5578199bc488b83b4cefbe2ce43d" data-recommend-id="image://c97a5578199bc488b83b4cefbe2ce43d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="607" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rinoa and Squall look out over the city of Kalm." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>So not only is time travel native to the lore of <em>FF8</em>’s setting, but the theme of recurring events would make for a much more natural remake built on that premise. <em>FF7 </em>does have themes of spirits and the flow of energy across time and space, but what the remake project does with it is a <em>bit</em> of a stretch. </p><p>And hey, maybe then we can finally all admit that Rinoa <em>is</em> Ultimecia, regardless of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Forum:Rinoa-Ultimecia_Theory&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Forum:Rinoa-Ultimecia_Theory" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">what some guy said</a></span>.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/ff7-rebirth-remake-ff8-cloud-aerith-tifa-squall-rinoa-1851787335]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Valve co-founder Gabe Newell has revealed he originally thought he might become a doctor before he had a fateful chance meeting at Microsoft where future CEO Steve Ballmer gave him some pointed advice.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="http://youtube.com/@zalkar.saliev">YouTuber Zalkar Saliev</a> (<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/the-young-gabe-newell-thought-i-was-going-to-be-a-doctor-until-he-ended-up-visiting-his-brother-at-microsoft-where-steve-ballmer-got-mad-and-said-if-youre-going-to-be-hanging-out-here-why-dont-you-do-something-useful/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via PC Gamer</a>), Newell said when he started programming in high school, it wasn't necessarily thought to be a real career path. Video games didn't exist at that time, either, he said. "So when I was a kid I thought I was going to be a doctor, and programming was what I did when I should have been doing something else," he said. "It wasn't a career path, you know, there were no classes in it, and my first programmable device was a calculator, a [Texas Instruments] calculator."</p><p>Newell's brother Dan worked at Microsoft and was an early hire for the company, which was founded in 1975. At the time, Microsoft wasn't a big player in software development, with Newell saying it was only the third-largest software developer in Washington state. "So there was no notion of having any of the reputation that it would have, say, 10 years later," he said.</p><p>Newell visited his brother at work one day with the expectation that the two of them would just hang out. Newell said Ballmer got upset with him because he was distracting Dan. Newell said Ballmer told him, "'If you're going to be hanging out here, you know, why don't you do something useful?'"</p><p>So that's what Newell did--he took time off at Harvard to "just work at Microsoft."</p><p>Newell never returned to Harvard and instead built a career at Microsoft where he helped build the first versions of Microsoft Windows. He worked at Microsoft for 13 years before leaving in 1996 to start Valve with another Microsoft employee, Mike Harrington. Newell enjoyed tremendous success at Valve, helping steer the company through various game-development projects and the creation of Steam.</p><p>Newell is now a billionaire who <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gabe-newells-daily-routine-sounds-very-legit/1100-6533251/" data-ref-id="1100-6533251">works from his yacht and goes scuba diving on breaks.</a> Newell also recently revealed the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gabe-newell-explains-the-secret-to-his-success/1100-6533485/" data-ref-id="1100-6533485">secret to his success.</a></p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> has announced Showdown, the 26th season of Respawn's Battle Royale, which introduces a brand new permanent game mode called Wildcard, a new progression system and more quality of life updates. Additionally, Caustic and Bangalore get some love and Elite weapons join the game. There are also a couple of ranked updates on the way. With changes come sacrifice, Arenas has been removed for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Wildcard is a new fast-paced permanent game mode for 30 players on a modified version of Kings Canyon with ziplines, gravity cannons, jump pads and other traversal objects. The starting ring in Wildcard will be compressed, forcing you to fight almost instantly on the drop but don't worry - a Self Revive Kit will be in your inventory from the start. Also you can now auto loot so you can stay focused. Running, walking, or sliding over ground loot will automatically add it to your backpack. Ground loot will typically be Shield Cells, Ammo and Evo Orbs.</p>
<p>Evo Orbs can be picked up from knocked down players to level up weapons, reduce respawn times, grant a bit of Shield Charge and much more. Death Boxes still exist but these will contain skills and weapons. Your inventory will be auto-sorted, leaving you more time to focus on the action.</p>
<p>Of course, Wildcard needs, well, Wildcards! You can get Wildcards at Wildcard Replicators and they can grant new abilities like wall running.</p>
<p>The Wildcard Replicator will also be where you get new weapons, Legend perks and more. The contents of the replicators will be randomised for each match. Levelling up weapons in Wildcard Replicators will be capped at gold with a 1% chance to get a Mythic Lupin (loot). Also, for the first time ever, Legend stacking will be allowed in Wildcard - imagine the possibilities!</p>

<p>Onto Battle Royale, E-District will see some changes in Showdown. It's now daytime at the district while micro and macro visual clutter has been reduced in an overall bid to improve visibility. Shop interiors have doorways linking them together inside, some buildings have been removed in dense POIs, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a> Fans may be pleased to know that the Angel City Skybox inspired some of the new look for E-District.  Other maps will also be seeing smaller updates this season, such as the time of day in Storm Point changing.</p>
<p>The Battle Royale map rotation for Season 26 Showdown is E-District, Broken Moon and Storm Point.</p>

<p>Caustic is seeing a lot of love this season, his gas is more deadly and he’s got a brand new passive to sink your teeth into. The gas will surround enemies and slow them too. When you’ve been slowed by gas (even if you're moving fast initially) your movement ability cooldown will be removed too - so if you’re gassed you'll need to fight your way out. Caustic's health bar won’t show in gas and he'll have an easier time seeing out.</p>
<p>Bangalore is also getting some buffs, she's got a full set of new upgrades, including now  her Tactical and Ultimate can be electrified to emit EMP on a direct hit! Her smoke will still remove aim assist.  It's not the end of the road if you come up against these two, smoke and gas will be influenced by ordinance or Legend abilities which gives you the chance to clear the air.</p>
<p>The entire Control Class is getting some new perk buffs too, ring consoles can spawn an extra tall evac after scanning survey data, zone overcharge will continuously charge your shields but taking any damage will stop this.</p>

<p>Elite weapons are a new addition for Season 26 and only one has received the makeover for Showdown - the RE-45 Burst. It's now an Energy weapon, replacing the long-standing Light ammunition it ran on before and a few more surprises await. Elite weapons are temporary additions to Apex Legends, so while the RE-45 has been given a makeover for this season it may not be around forever.</p>
<p>The Peacekeeper is returning to floor loot and, brace yourselves, the Akimbo P2020 is going into the Care Package with the Kinetic Feeder Hop-Up attached to it. Mozambiques have a faster fire rate and tiger blast pattern while the power of LMGs and hipfire accuracy has been reduced.</p>
<p>Locked Hop-Ups make their debut in Showdown too! Hop-ups will still be baked into weapons but to access their full power you need to deal a certain amount of damage with that weapon to ‘unlock’ it. Once you’ve fully unlocked a Hop-up, it will last for the rest of the match. However, if you switch weapons or drop the weapon and pick up a new one your Hop-up progress you'll lose some of your progress. Teammates can pick up your fully unlocked weapon if you drop it and they will see the benefit.</p>
<p>Amps are new powerful lootable perks available in ranked and unranked, helping you customise your playstyle. For example, the Bottomless Batteries Amp will prevent your Shield Batteries being used if you’ve got two or more in your inventory.</p>
<p>Ranked, among other changes, is introducing a new reward - Auras. These are a reactive cosmetic that sits behind your Legend and will reflect your current rank. Your first rank Aura will be free as you progress through the road to ranked challenges (if you've done this, you'll get one too). Auras are optional, they can be turned off in your Legend locker. Turned on, you can see them in the locker, lobby, podium and occasionally on the map. They'll also be visible during the initial skydive, during some emotes, and during finishers and revives but only between the two players involved in these moments.</p>
<p>There are also small increases to the Bronze, Gold and Platinum entrance cost. The amount of RP you gain from kills and assists has been reduced, but there's an increase in RP gains from completing challenger bonuses.</p>
<p>Drop Zones in ranked have been added to give more structure to the start of a match, squads will be assigned random POI which you can see from the dropship. Teams will fly in and exit together, the Dropship will also be lower to the Drop Zone too.</p>

<p>There's all that and plenty more coming in Apex Legends Showdown, which launches on Tuesday 5th August on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S and Nintendo Switch.  </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/apex-legends-season-26-introduces-new-permanent-mode-elite-weapons-and-locked-hop-ups]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>FromSoftware has elected to postpone the release of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-mode-coming-next-week/">Elden Ring Nightreign update 1.02</a>, which would have added the highly-requested duos mode to the game, due to tsunami warnings following a major earthquake on Russia's coast. An earthquake that hit the Kamchatka Peninsula off the coast of Russia earlier Wednesday morning has sent tsunami waves towards Russia, Japan, and Hawaii, with each region on alert. </p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/climate-and-environment/article/88-magnitude-earthquake-sends-tsunami-into-coasts-of-russia-japan-and-hawaii/">CTV News</a>, the earthquake was one of the strongest ever recorded at an 8.8 magnitude, and sent at least one tsunami wave of up to 13 feet to the shore of Japan's northern island of Hokkaido. Though it's been several hours since the initial earthquake, Japan has kept its northern regions at high alert, while the alert has been lowered to an advisory in its more southern regions.</p>



<p>"<em>Due to the tsunami warning following the earthquake near the Kamchatka Peninsula, we have decided to postpone the distribution of the 'ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN' Patch 1.02, which was scheduled for today to tomorrow, July 31 (Thursday) after 10:00CEST | 1:00 PDT</em>,<em>"</em> FromSoftware wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1950415325264031884">post on X</a>.</p>

<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Due to the tsunami warning following the earthquake near the Kamchatka Peninsula, we have decided to postpone the distribution of the 'ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN' Patch 1.02, which was scheduled for today to tomorrow, July 31 (Thursday) after 10:00CEST | 1:00 PDT.</p>— ELDEN RING (@ELDENRING) <a href="https://twitter.com/ELDENRING/status/1950415325264031884?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 30, 2025</a></blockquote>

<p>While players who are looking forward to the update might be upset to learn that they'll have to wait a little longer to play Nightreign in an official duos mode, a tsunami is a more than reasonable reason to delay anything. Hopefully, the warnings and alerts pass with the waves causing minimal or better yet, no damage, and no one is hurt. We'll update you when FromSoftware confirms the new release window for the update.</p>

But for those of us who’ve spent tens or hundreds of hours in <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl</em>, tackling the same side quests repeatedly for cash becomes downright gruesome—more so than the mutants we fight. Thankfully, update 1.5 introduces a new money-making method: Hunting! Now you can hunt and skin mutants for rare resources, like fangs, tusks, and tentacles, that you can sell off to earn a buck. You might think it’s pretty straightforward: Just get out there and start hunting.

Instead, players must log into Call of Duty HQ, find their game of choice via a Netflix-style launcher, then load the app. At the time, Call of Duty HQ was required to play either Modern Warfare 3, 2, or Warzone, and unlike parts of those games, Call of Duty HQ itself cannot be deleted if you want to play.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time, Activision said Call of Duty HQ "was developed to bring players benefits like Carry Forward, easier file size management, and more seamless switching between Call of Duty: Warzone and the latest annual releases," but that wasn't the reality many players reported, as getting to a selected game or mode could be really time-consuming, particularly with endless prompts to "update to restart." It also takes up a tremendous amount of space on console. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision didn't give a reason for the change, and it doesn't seem HQ haters are going to be relinquished of the launcher any time soon, but it's fair to suggest this is just a way of tidying up HQ ahead of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7"><u>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</u></a>'s release later this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the next Call of Duty game?

Matt Cox, General Manager of Call of Duty, insisted that “as a team, our vision from the start was to create a back-to-back series experience for our players that embraced the uniqueness of the Black Ops sub-franchise.” It's set to star Milo Ventimiglia, Kiernan Shipka, and Michael Rooker, with Ventimiglia portraying David Mason, Shipka as new character Emma Kagen, and Rooker reprising his Black Ops 2 role of Mike Harper.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Top 10 Call of Duty Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We know it'll feature the Skirmish and Overload multiplayer modes as well a 20v20 wingsuit option as details of a developer-only Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 playtest were <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-developer-accidentally-posts-private-playtest-details-to-public-cod-app"><u>accidentally released to all fans on the Call of Duty app</u></a>.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/how-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-was-transformed-into-a-festival-feature-film</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-was-transformed-into-a-festival-feature-film.1257090/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve put down your controller this year to go touch a very particular patch of grass, you might have noticed that something strange is going on at the world’s major film festivals. It started in May, when a film adaptation of virally-successful Japanese indie game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-exit-8">Exit 8</a> premiered at the prestigious Cannes Film Festival – the first videogame movie to do so. The film’s director, Genki Kawamura, gives his source material a compelling structural spin, appealing equally to the arthouse crowd and to game fans. But live-action adaptations of video games are, of course, nothing new.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s why <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> Cinematic Cut is so interesting. It is not a live-action adaptation of developer Warhorse Studios’ critically-acclaimed RPG. Instead, it is an abridged and reformatted version of Act One of the game itself, presenting a newly-edited blend of the open-world game’s cutscenes and gameplay in a two-hour linear form. It was perhaps the strangest Special Presentation at this month’s Karlovy Vary International Film Festival in the Czech Republic – a unique cross-format experiment. One that wasn’t Warhorse’s idea. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It all happened at the official launch of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2,” explains KVIFF artistic director, Karel Och. “The first contact was made through a mutual friend, and Warhorse and KVIFF made each other understand that they wanted to collaborate at some point. During the following months, it was exciting to have a glimpse of what Warhorse represents – and I dare to say the same goes for our friends from the top of the gaming business.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Warhorse’s communications director, Tobias Stolz-Zwilling, concurs. “They wanted to make the festival more modern and interesting – to offer something new”. The largest film festival in Eastern Europe, KVIFF attracts a younger, more adventurous audience than its contemporaries. The studio saw the film festival’s strange idea as a chance to give video games greater cultural relevancy in the broader mainstream. Besides – much of the game’s cinematics team were already speaking the festival’s language.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2’s cinematic director, Petr Pekař, studied film editing and directing with the intention of becoming a traditional filmmaker, but he found his calling in video games. “There are a lot of filmmakers in the Czech Republic, but the market is not that big, so it's a bit overcrowded.” says Pekař. “Thankfully, there are multiple studios creating cutscenes, which are basically animated movies”. Pekar learned on the job creating cutscenes for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mafia-iii">Mafia 3</a>, then joined Warhorse – first as a cinematic designer on the original Kingdom Come, then as director on its sequel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bringing Deliverance 2’s cutscenes to the big screen invites comparison with conventional cinema, an arena far from the cinematics’ original purpose. “If you're a player, you’re mainly looking forward to playing the game,” says Pekař. “The cutscenes are more like dessert for the game – not necessary – but when it's good and it clicks, it really helps the game, the story, and the overall feel”. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Cinematic Cut opens, naturally, on the game’s first cutscene. As it happens, you can’t help but feel like you’re settling in for a YouTube video titled ‘Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 – All Cutscenes’ (“I don’t think anybody actually watches those in full” Pekař quips). The team’s cinematic direction is confident, but familiar – steeped in high fantasy tropes. A fiery siege on the castle is highly reminiscent of Peter Jackson’s The Lord of the Rings trilogy – a major influence on Warhorse’s stylistic approach. Transported to the cinema screen, the scene serves as a striking reminder of how video games have traded in pastiche since their inception, responding to our desire to live out the fantasy ourselves whenever we see something cool on screen. But, of course, Cinematic Cut doesn’t deliver on this pivotal fantasy like its source material does – it’s non-playable.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I think this is an experiment that somebody can pick up and do better than we did.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">When the cutscene footage ends, something curious happens. Father Godwin readies his crossbow and the scene transitions into first-person. But this is no Let’s Play. Smart, quick cuts establish a new, more cinematic editing language for first-person gameplay.  Godwin heads towards the stairs – cut – now he’s halfway up them – cut – now he’s atop the ramparts, plunging his sword into an enemy. It’s remarkably thrilling. “[The gameplay] was mostly recorded by Vítek Mičke, our marketing specialist,” explains Pekař. “He also made the trailers, and he's got a good sense of timing and aesthetics. He knows how to control the camera with the controller to properly set the scene and set the mood – so it looks cool.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A couple of awkward transitions disrupt this otherwise ‘cinematic’ tempo. A sudden cut to a ladder lowering, for example, has the distinct feel of a gameplay segment ending and a cutscene beginning, and reminds you of the objective-based game that birthed the footage. But these moments are few and far between, and they accentuate how much Warhorse has otherwise succeeded in their first attempt.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think this is an experiment that somebody can pick up and do better than we did – or maybe we can do it again in the future with our future projects, and learn from our mistakes.” reflects Pekař. “It’s a really interesting experience to see it on the big screen – and I was surprised that it held up. It’s odd, but it somewhat works. It’s not some kind of new cinematic media that will sit next to the movies, but for festivals and conventions, for fans – I think it’s a format that others will be doing as well”.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team at KVIFF are equally pleased with the results. “Storytelling has many faces,” says Och. “We’re proud that a new chapter in the festival’s modern history was written in collaboration with people that we respect a great deal who follow the same goal.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think this format builds a bridge,” concludes Pekař. “Gamers can come to appreciate aesthetics and cinematography, the color palettes and moods in games more, and – in the same way – movie fans can understand how movies have different functions when they’re working with interactivity. When these two mediums collaborate, sometimes it creates really strange and cool ideas. When people go out of their bubble to see something different, it helps us to understand each other’s mediums.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 Cinematic Cut is available to watch on the <a href="https://kviff.tv/catalog/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-cinematic-cut" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KVIFF.TV</a> website for a small fee (approx. $6) until July 31, 2027. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Blake Simons is a journalist with a taste for the self-reflexive, sentimental and surreal. </em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/how-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-was-transformed-into-a-festival-feature-film]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Last week, the typically indie digital-games storefront Itch.io deindexed a majority of not safe for work (NSFW) or adult content. Deindexing doesn't mean that the games are all no longer available, but it does mean you can no longer find them through searching on the site. This came after the organisation <a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/open-letter-to-payment-processors" rel="nofollow ">Collective Shout</a> launched a campaign against both Itch.io and Steam demanding that payment processors prevent the sale of particular forms of content. Now, in an <a href="https://itch.io/updates/update-on-nsfw-content#addendum-faq" rel="nofollow ">updated FAQ from Itch.io</a>, the storefront has shared that it's looking to work with other payment processors that do allow NSFW and adult content.</p><p dir="ltr">Explaining the timeline for these changes, Itch.io wrote, "The situation is evolving as we await final determinations from our current payment processors, Stripe and PayPal. There are still unknowns that prevent us from providing a fixed timeline.</p><p dir="ltr">"In the meantime, we are actively reaching out to other payment processors that are more willing to work with this kind of content. We have suspended the ability to pay with Stripe for 18+ content for the foreseeable future. Our immediate focus has been on content classification reviews and implementing stricter age-gating on the site."</p><p dir="ltr">The expanded FAQ also explained why so many more games have been removed from Itch.io as opposed to Steam: "The difference in our responses stems from the difference in our platforms. Steam is a “closed” platform where every product page is approved before it appears on the store. Because they were generally aware of the content they host, they could identify and act on specific pages.</p><p dir="ltr">"Itch.io is an open, “UGC” (User-Generated Content) platform. With over 2 million product pages, anyone can publish content at any time with minimal barriers. We could not rely on user-provided tagging to be accurate enough for a targeted approach, so a broader review was necessary to be thorough."</p><p dir="ltr">Since the changes took place, payment processors like Visa and Mastercard have also been <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/616835/visa-mastercard-steam-itchio-campaign-adult-games" rel="nofollow ">inundated with emails and phone calls</a> in an effort to push back against the banning of adult content. The International Game Developers Association has also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/international-game-developers-association-seriously-alarmed-by-recent-delisting-of-games/1100-6533536/">released a statement condemning the move</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>After plenty of rumours and build up, Nintendo has confirmed that a Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase will take place tomorrow, 31st July, at 2PM BST / 3PM CEST / 9AM EST / 6AM PDT.</p>
<p>Watch it here:</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase – 31/07/2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T-9mHP826oQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Nintendo Direct will be around 25 minutes long and, as it’s a Partner Showcase, it will put the focus on third party titles from publishing partners, with games for both <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> and Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>Naturally there’s an awful lot of speculation about what could be included, with games like Hollow Knight: Silkson, Hades 2 (which will be a timed console exclusive), Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition, Professor Layton and The New World of Steam, Two Point Museum and more all already announced for 2025.</p>

<p>We also wouldn’t put it past Nintendo to sneak in a first party announcement or two as well. Everyone is desperately keen to know when Metroid Prime 4 will release, and Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment is also expected this year. Actually, the perfect announcement would be an Age of Imprisonment release date, and a Switch 2 update for Age of Calamity to lift its 30fps cap.</p>
