<figure data-uuid="02b59d3d9989a"><a title="Micro sd express shortages?" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/02b59d3d9989a/micro-sd-express-shortages.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Storage-hungry consumers in Japan have been jumping on available stocks of super-fast MicroSD cards as an ongoing memory shortage continues across the computer industry, with no signs of getting better in the immediate future.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/microsd-cards/large-capacity-microsd-cards-are-now-regularly-out-of-stock-in-japan-as-storage-crunch-claims-another-victim-high-capacity-hdds-are-also-vanishing">Tom's Hardware</a>, a spiralling issue of rising costs and demand that's far exceeding availability means empty shelves and insane prices as regular consumers swoop on anything that's left over once large data centres and AI companies have bought up their fill. Oh, AI, is there anything you can't make worse?</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.itmedia.co.jp/pcuser/spv/2511/22/news019.html?s=31">IT Media</a>, Tokyo-based vendor Techhouse Toei said that its inventory had been very badly affected. "The larger versions of popular series keep running out of stock...This might drag on for a while." With all sizes of MicroSD cards, from 256GB all the way up to 2TB models involved, it's not hard to see how or why consumers (and those pesky AI centres) might start to make the jump en masse to new and improved MicroSD Express technology used in Switch 2.</p>
<figure data-uuid="becc08a4273ea"><a title="Micro sd express shortages?" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/becc08a4273ea/micro-sd-express-shortages.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Have you picked up one of these yet? — <em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The report goes on to detail how even older tech, such as HDD drives with huge storage capacities, is being bought up. "It looks like large-capacity models are getting sucked up for AI use," one shop owner said, "so we aren't getting any stock at all. Everyone knows what's going on, so even if the price goes up, the drives sell out immediately… and the cycle repeats."</p>
<p>It's certainly something that's already been an issue here in the West, and even through our own personal searching for MicroSD Express cards online, it's been notably hard to find sizes beyond 256GB for anything approaching a reasonable price, and the 1TB options are already being sold for...well, a quick search indicates around £200, which is quite a lot.</p>
<p>Some of this, of course, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/microsd-express-cards-are-selling-out-thanks-to-switch-2-fever">has been down to the popularity of Nintendo's console</a>, but there's little doubt that any further stress on MicroSD availability would make it significantly harder to find a card for your Switch 2.</p>
<p>With no signs of the supply situation abating, and with AI being the number one reason cited behind all of the shortages of storage, RAM, and GPUs, it does seem as though the prepared Switch 2 gamer should perhaps brace for the inevitable impact and nab some backup storage ASAP.</p>

			<p>Nintendo first-party developed games rarely get discounts, but the Japanese publisher decided to briefly amend their pricing strategy just in time for Black Friday 2025, offering some of its best Nintendo Switch games at reduced prices.</p>



<p>Among the Switch games that can be purchased for reduced prices this week is <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Super Mario Odyssey</strong>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MY7GHKJ/?tag=wccftech0a9-20">available for <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">$39.99</strong></a> (50% off the MSRP). The game is also fully playable on Nintendo Switch 2, so if you never played the game before and own any of the Switch systems, there's no better time to get it, and experience what is widely considered one of the best 3D Mario games ever.</p>



<p>Other notable Nintendo Switch Black Friday 2025 deals include <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">Splatoon 3, Princess Peach: Showtime, Donkey Kong Country Returns HD, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</strong>, and many others. You can check out all the deals available this week by <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=nintendo+switch+games&amp;i=black-friday&amp;language=en_US&amp;crid=2AY0R6066IY62&amp;linkCode=sl2&amp;linkId=ad1a5b1f9f5ebcd44c4563e3b1540d00&amp;sprefix=ps5+g%2Cblack-friday%2C517&amp;tag=wccftech0a9-20&amp;ref=as_li_ss_tl">heading over to Amazon.</a></p>



<h2 id="h-should-you-go-for-these-nintendo-switch-black-friday-2025-deals-now-or-wait">Should You Go For These Nintendo Switch Black Friday 2025 Deals Now or Wait?</h2>



<p>As Black Friday 2025 is still a few days away, some additional deals are expected to become available as we get closer to November 28.</p>



<p>However, given Nintendo's historical stance on pricing and their previous Black Friday deals, it is doubtful you will be able to find better discounts than these in the next couple of days. Nintendo’s first-party titles are known to maintain their value for years. As such, you should definitely take advantage of these deals as soon as possible before stock runs out.</p>

            <p>Right, time for some box news. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hands-on-with-the-new-steam-machine-valves-square-shot-at-steamos-pc-redemption">Steam Machine</a>. Valve have confirmed, or <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/steam-machine-will-be-priced-like-a-pc-not-like-a-console/">reaffirmed</a>, that its yet-to-be-revealed price will be in line with a regular PC built to similar specs, rather than subsidised in order to try and compete with consoles.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Speaking on Skill Up's  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvu66Y2VLq8">Friends Per Second podcast</a>, Valve’s Pierre-Loup Griffais said the device's price still hasn't been settled on internally due to some factors which are "fluctuating", but said the aim's to offer a "good deal" compared to a the sorts of existing PCs which offer comparable bang for your buck.</p>
<p>He went on to confirm that the price won't be subsidised by Valve in an effort to keep it on the lower end and compete with consoles, an idea that's been floated around on the lines since the box's reveal. To be honest, as someone who can't currently see where the Steam Machine would fit into my existing setup of a decently beefy desktop and a PS5, that'd be something in its favour, but I'm also conscious that I may well just not be the target audience for the thing. Then again, I'm also yet to invest in a Steam Deck despite regularly being told I likely won't regret it, so maybe I just don't like spending money.</p>
<p>"It’s more in line with what you might expect from the current PC market," Griffais said of the Machine. "Obviously, our goal is for it to be a good deal at that level of performance. And then you have features that are actually really hard to build if you’re making your own gaming PC from parts." Those features are the likes of its small size, quietness, and ability to be easily flicked on via TV remote or controller.</p><p>Basically, a level of ease or convenience which he reckons is "not really something that exists in the PC market right now". That sounds very much like an 'appeal to newbies considering making the switch' pitch to me, but could also have some catchet with folks who're just <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/if-valve-creates-an-entry-point-for-living-room-pcs-the-console-beating-steam-machines-will-follow-argues-baldurs-gate-3s-publishing-director">keen not to muck around with a/their big PC</a> for everything but the most hairdryer-inducing behemoths (hi, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>).</p>
<p>For now, we'll just have to see what number Valve finally settle on and judge things from that. Until that point, there are far more important conversations to be had, as James dipped his toe into last week when he tried to define <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-search-of-soul-with-the-steam-machine">whether the Steam Machine has soul</a>. Can PC hardware be Aretha Frankliny? Probably, I guess.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Samsung launches new flagship tablets every year and the latest models, like the Tab S11 series, easily cost upwards of $1,000. The 2024 Galaxy Tab A9+ finds its place in the <strong>middle of budget and premium</strong> and offers solid specs without the price of a flagship. You get an 11-inch tablet ready to provide a quality Android experience for consumption, casual gaming and productivity tasks. Now down to just <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3880/">$149 from $219 for the 64GB/WiFi, it has reached a record-low price on Amazon for Black Friday</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3880/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Big Screen Entertainment</h2>
<p>It has an<strong> 11-inch display running at a resolution of 1920 x 1200</strong>, and provides sharp text and detailed video playback. The <strong>90Hz refresh rate</strong> gives you a noticeably smoother scrolling through apps and websites compared to the more common 60Hz on tablets. Peak brightness reaches 480 nits to give you good visibility outdoors or in bright rooms. The TFT LCD panel does a solid job with color reproduction-whether you’re watching shows, browsing photos, or reading e-books.</p>
<p><strong>Dolby Atmos powered quad speakers</strong> turn this tablet into a surprisingly capable media machine. Movies, TV shows, and music will all be augmented by the increased audio that fills a room. The speakers feature directional sound, a more immersive experience than that of single or dual speaker arrangements. You can comfortably watch content without having to use headphones and actually hear what is being said.</p>



<p>The Qualcomm Snapdragon 69<strong> processor performs everyday tasks with competent performance</strong>. Streaming video, web browsing, social media scrolling, and casual gaming are relatively smooth. Similarly, 4GB of RAM manages multiple apps open simultaneously without excessive slowdown. You won’t mistake this for a flagship tablet when running demanding games or heavy multitasking, but it covers the basics reliably. The 64GB of internal storage <strong>expands up to 1TB via microSD card</strong> and gives you room for downloaded content and files.</p>
<p><strong><em>Multi Window Display</em> lets you run multiple apps side by side on the large screen</strong>: Browse the web while checking email, take notes while doing video calls, or refer to a document while writing in another app. This split-screen functionality turns the tablet into a productivity tool for real work: students can research and write papers in parallel, professionals can manage spreadsheets while being part of video conferences.</p>



<p>Quick Share makes it easy to transfer files across devices: <strong>Send photos, videos, or documents to other nearby Samsung devices, Android phones, or even iPhones</strong>. Choose the file you want to share, select the device nearby, and voilà! In a few seconds, your file transfers wirelessly. No more need for pesky email attachments or cloud uploads for simple file sharing. Immediately swap vacation photos with family members.</p>
<p>This Black Friday, the Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ is $149 which means it offers solid tablet performance at an accessible price. You’re getting an 11-inch 90Hz display, quad speakers with Dolby Atmos, expandable storage up to 1TB, multi-window multitasking, and Samsung Kids parental controls for 32% off retail.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hytale-reveals-plans-for-proximity-chat-multiplayer-%E2%80%98portals%E2%80%99.1362577/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hytale devs are working on two significant social features to add to the game, with proximity chat and the potential of ‘portals’ in single-player that allow friends to join your game without having to tweak settings.</p>



<p>News on Hytale continues to come thick and fast following the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-back-reacquired-hypixel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">founders reacquiring the title from Riot Games</a>, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-price-revealed-ahead-of-early-access-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pricing revealed last week</a> and details on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-early-access-release-date-announcement-coming-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">early access release date</a> arriving in the coming days.</p>



<p>The early access launch will be a major step for the future of Hytale, but there is still a lot to come, and two major features have been revealed.</p>







<h2 id="h-proximity-chat-amp-multiplayer-support-in-single-player-coming-to-hytale">Proximity Chat &amp; Multiplayer Support in Single-Player Coming to Hytale</h2>



<figure><figcaption>More to come. Image via Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>In an in-depth interview with YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcmNb40D6Vg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ElRichMC</a>, Hypixel Studios founder Simon Collins-Laflamme answered a range of questions about the development of Hytale and plans for the future, alongside taking the opportunity to reveal two components that are in the works.</p>



<p>One of those is support for multiplayer in single-player worlds, allowing players to have drop-in, drop-out gameplay with friends, but, in a bid to make it more immersive, the current plan is for an item that needs to be built to access the feature.</p>



<p>“I want the game to be more social, so I was thinking, what if, to invite your friends, you have to make a portal? And when you leave the game, they go out from that portal, to make it more immersive,” Collins-Laflamme said.</p>



<p>While this may seem like a simple feature, it’s added that “some other popular games don’t have it,” and the crucial aspect is the ability to “invite your friend with no need to change your firewall settings.”</p>



<p>Another feature that goes hand-in-hand with the planned multiplayer functionality is proximity chat, which is confirmed to be in the works, but Collins-Laflamme admitted he’s “not sure” whether the feature will be available at the early access launch.</p>



<p>Voice chat is “very important” for Hytale, opening the doors for plenty of other experiences to be built, particularly given the expansive modding support the game will have.</p>

<p>Fortnite’s Sidekicks feature looks set to receive a huge flock of collabs, according to leakers, as a major agreement with Paramount is said to have been reached.</p>



<p>The Sidekicks feature was added earlier this month, featuring customizable pets, visible only to you and players in your party, in specific modes, and additional Sidekicks are expected to be added regularly.</p>



<p>A first collab Sidekick has been added in The Simpsons season, with Scratchy coming in the Itchy &amp; Scratchy bundle, and other animated stars are on the horizon.</p>

<p>According to reliable Fortnite leakers, <a href="https://x.com/SamLeakss/status/1992656693499756589" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">including SamLeakss</a>, Paramount IPs are coming to Fortnite as Sidekicks, which aligns with previous leaks indicating collabs with the likes of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-spongebob-collab-season-7-leak-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SpongeBob Squarepants</a>.</p>



<p>No specifics have been shared on what collabs to expect, but there is a lengthy list of potentials, with Paramount’s expansive list of IPs including the likes of SpongeBob, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Transformers, and more.</p>



<p>Some of those franchises, including TMNT and Transformers, have already featured as collabs in the past, including with skins, but the new Sidekick feature opens the door for other characters, smaller in size, to feature.</p>



<p>One of the biggest franchises under the Paramount umbrella that would certainly fit the Sidekicks theme is Paw Patrol, though the show is geared to a younger audience and may therefore not be suited to featuring in Fortnite.</p>



<p>An agreement with Paramount opens the door for plenty of options, and time will tell exactly what will be added to the game, but it’s clear Epic Games has big fans to utilize Sidekicks in more collabs.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[SIVGA Robin SV021 Wired Headphones Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/24/sivga-robin-sv021-wired-headphones-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sivga-robin-sv021-wired-headphones-review.1362562/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>I’ve been fascinated with headphones from an early age. My dad was a broadcast journalist and a real geek, filling our house with space-age tech like reel-to-reel players, condenser microphones, and CB radios. Most important, though, were the headphones. Huge, unwieldy things for my tiny head, they still opened my eyes – and ears – to just how good music could sound, and that fascination has stayed with me ever since.</p>
<p>So my interest was piqued by SIVGA’s latest, the Robin SV021, a closed-back, wired audiophile pair of over-ear headphones, which boast earcups crafted from wood. While they look genuinely beautiful, the sound they produce is even better.</p>



<p>Each of the Robin SV021’s earcups are handmade from Rosewood. If you want a pair of headphones that’s immediately different from the metal and black plastic-toting ones elsewhere, it’s a great place to start. Imprinted with the SIVGA logo, the external surface is perfectly smooth, and the wood carries a warmth and softness that plastic and metal simply can’t. I did worry about their durability, but after cramming the Robin into my bag on more than one occasion, they remained unblemished.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the headband is wrapped in leather, with a thin slice of memory foam beneath it, while the frame, extenders and hinges are made from rigid, burnished metal. It’s all finished off by a pair of the plushest, softest ear cushions I’ve come across in a while, and they feel absolutely fantastic, moulding around your ears and providing a decent level of passive noise cancellation as well. The Robin SV021 look and feel utterly premium, and they definitely punch above their £150 price point.</p>

<p>Audio is handled by dual wiring to each earcup, with the two ends of the braided cable leading down to a single gold-plated 3.5mm jack. While the braided section is noise-free, the single cabling to each earcup will produce cable noise if rubbing against clothing, which does make it less appealing for listening while on the go.</p>

<p>That’s not its main draw, though. The Robin SV021 are reassuringly universal, and I’ve spent my time hopping between a MacBook, Nintendo Switch 2 and my PC. It has a relatively low impedance at 32 Ohms, and it performed well with every device I tried, with plenty of volume while retaining an excellent level of detail.</p>
<p>The SIVGA Robin SV021 sound excellent. The 50mm drivers are capable of moving plenty of air around, and there’s a wonderfully wide soundstage here, giving instrumentation and audio some real room to breathe. I’ve been playing a huge amount of Octopath Traveler 0 on its way to review, and the orchestral soundtrack has been delivered exquisitely by the Robin SV021, with that wider soundstage making it feel as though you’re experiencing a live recording.</p>
<p>They’re absolutely perfect for gaming, thanks to their lightweight design and ultra-soft ear cushions. I was able to wear them for hours, and they may well be the most comfortable headphones I’ve reviewed this year.</p>

<p>Checking in with my music collection, I loved how enveloping Gunship’s Tech Noir sounded, with the throbbing synth tones delivered with an exacting level of detail. The intro’s sci-fi spoken word sits clearly apart from the ominous notes beneath, while the bass response is excellent, with plenty of warmth and clarity. The Robin SV021 are certainly warmer-sounding rather than clinical, and they’re easy to live with across a range of different genres and content types. Crucially, they make you want to listen to music.</p>
<p>At £150, the Robin SV021 are aimed at the mid-range audiophile who’s looking for something a little different. Despite their closed-back design, they boast a wide soundstage, and their well-balanced tuning provides a hugely enjoyable listening experience no matter what you’re using them for.</p>

			<p>As FromSoftware continues working on Elden Ring Nightreign, the Japanese development studio is also hard at work on The Duskbloods, which reportedly is a game the developer has spent time on fine tuning gameplay the most.</p>



<p>As reported in a new video shared by <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.youtube.com/@Ziostorm">Ziostorm</a>, a Chinese journalist who provided accurate information on <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-make-way-for-the-elden-lord/">Elden Ring</a> before the game's release, recently revealed some small, exciting tidbits about FromSoftware's upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive. The game was reportedly greenlit even before the marketing campaign for <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/sekiro-shadows-die-twice/">Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</a> started, and it is the game that FromSoftware has spent the most time on gameplay among all of their games.</p>



<p>All the time spent on prototyping The Duskbloods' gameplay is reportedly paying off, as the game, although PvEvP, features many innovative gameplay elements that the team is really proud of. So much so that the journalist speculates the game could influence games from other studios as much as the aforementioned Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice did, especially with the parry mechanics that are now prevalent in almost every action game.</p>



<p>Besides providing this small bit of information on The Duskbloods, the known Chinese journalist also revealed that we should see more of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-the-forsaken-hollows-release-date/">Elden Ring Nightreign DLC, The Forsaken Hollow</a>, soon. Apparently, three more trailers should be released before the game launches on December 4 to showcase the two new Nightfarers - the Scholar and the Undertaker - and the new content in a final launch trailer. As the expansion is nearing release, these trailers, if they are indeed coming, shouldn't be more than a few days away.</p>

</p></figure>



<p><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/fromsoftwares-the-duskbloods-announced-exclusively-for-nintendo-switch-2/">When it was revealed during the first Nintendo Switch 2 Nintendo Direct ever earlier this year</a>, many, including myself, jumped at the screen at the first footage of The Duskbloods, as the game looked like a sequel to the beloved <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/bloodborne/">Bloodborne</a>. However, the Switch 2 exclusive is going to be a much different game, having been built from the ground up as a multiplayer experience, which left a few disappointed, as FromSoftware is primarily known for its single-player experiences with multiplayer elements sprinkled on top.</p>



<p>Hopefully, the game's supposed innovative gameplay elements will make it a compelling experience for all fans of the studio, possibly turning doubters' opinions around as much as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/">Elden Ring Nightreign did for me when it launched earlier this year on PC and consoles.</a></p>

            <p>Ubisoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-racing-games">racer</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crew">The Crew</a> has avoided yet another shutdown after being ressurected in server-emulated form by fans <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fan-made-the-crew-revival-gets-a-release-date-a-year-and-a-bit-on-from-the-ubisoft-racers-controversial-shutdown">earlier this year</a>. According to the modders behind its revival project, The Crew Unlimited, a bug would have seen the game stop working once 2029 rolled around. Thankfully, they say a solution's been found.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"This may be one of the most important updates we've ever released, or arguably THE most important," reads <a href="https://thecrewunlimited.com/news/?post=news-update-tcuserver-1.3.0.0">a post</a> from lead developer Whammy4 about The Crew Unlimited's latest server emulator update, 1.3.0.0. They outlined that not long after the server emulator's 1.0 release, the group realised that if the date on the PC it's being played on is set to something after June 2029, the game simply stops working.</p>
<p>"As you may imagine, we were extremely concerned (how many deaths is this game going to go through? TWO weren't enough already?)," Whammy4 explained. "At first we were hoping that it was just a bug on the TCU Server's end, but that turned out to not be the case. It is an issue within the actual game client itself, and is not intentional but rather a bug. From our research, we've narrowed it down to either the Summit calendar system (from the Wild Run 2015 update), or the daily Crate mission system (from the Calling All Units 2016 update). Likely culprit is the Summit, even though nothing in the summit calendar data references anything about a June 2029 or 2029 in general."</p>
<p>The good news is that the team say they've found "a less than ideal, but working fix" for this potentially lethal bug, which they've dubbed "Y29K", by making some changes to the server emulator's software. So, crisis averted, even if it sounds like more work may be needed to try and find a better solution for the long-term.</p><p>Here's hoping The Crew can manage to go a few years without any more existential threats from this point, even if its initial shutdown's had the silver lining of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-uk-petition-has-been-debated-in-parliament-the-law-works-but-companies-may-need-to-communicate-better">sparking worthwhile debate</a> about what the end of service for online-only games should look like going forwards.</p>

His first American role came in 1991 film My Own Private Idaho, which starred River Phoenix and Keanu Reeves. Madonna, a fan of Kier's work, cast him in her music videos for Erotica and Deeper and Deeper. Later notable roles came in the likes of Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, Johnny Mnemonic, Armageddon, End of Days, and Blade.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> has announced a new update in December titled 'Home Sweet Home', which includes a vast amount of base customisation options as well as a crossover with one of the coolest indie games in recent memory. It's set to release just around the corner too, on the 17th December.</p>
<p>This game is Ultrakill, the high-intensity ultraviolent FPS by Arsi Patala, which is coming to Pocketpair's open world creature collection game. As part of the Home Sweet Home update, players will be able to venture the world as either V1 or V2, reflecting bullets off flipped coins and blasting away Pals with a new shotgun.</p>
<p>When not murdering animals in-game, you'll be able to change the colours of your bases through new customisation tools which should make your abode feel more homely. A variety of colours can be seen in the new trailer, all of which are quite vibrant.</p>

<p>Palworld and Pocketpair continue trucking along all this time after its explosive release back in 2024. As you may know, the developer has been in the midst of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-infringement-of-multiple-patents">a legal battle with Nintendo over alleged patent infringement</a>. This has actually been leaning in Pocketpair's favour, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/could-palworld-triumph-over-pokemon-in-lawsuit-japans-rejection-of-nintendo-patent-might-make-things-more-interesting">with a recent rejection of Nintendo's patent</a> throwing a spanner in the works for Nintendo.</p>
<p>In addition, earlier this month Nintendo's patent covering the summoning of a sub character to battle an enemy <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-palworld-lawsuit-suffers-another-potential-blow-as-us-takes-rare-step-of-re-examining-previously-granted-pokemon-patent">was ordered to be reassessed in the USA</a>. A rare occasion that too could spell trouble for Nintendo's lawsuit.</p>

<figure data-uuid="df1e6e9ca6684"><a title="Kirby Air Riders" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/df1e6e9ca6684/kirby-air-riders.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>The latest UK physical gaming charts are in, giving us our first indication of how Nintendo's latest is performing on store shelves. You'll have to scroll a little way to find the new first-party release this week, mind you, as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> has missed out on a top 10 spot!</p>
<p>The game zoomed into 12th in its debut week, falling behind the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, and — of course — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a>, all of which keep the Switch and Switch 2 in the upper bracket.</p>
<p>Of course, this might not be all that much of a surprise. Air Riders was always going to attract a niche audience with its blend of racing and all-out action, and with Mario Kart World still appearing new and shiny, we'd imagine that many people will be picking up just the one racer for their fresh console. We're sure the sales will be drastically different in Japan, which we'll find out later this week</p>
<p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> parried its way back into the top 10 — thanks to all of those <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/the-game-awards-nominees-announced-donkey-kong-bananza-up-for-goty">Game Awards nominations</a>, no doubt — and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/gallery-hades-2s-switch-2-physical-boasts-a-stunning-reversible-cover">sweet physical edition</a> of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades II</a> made its debut at number 21. And if you're looking for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>, you won't find it in <em>this</em> top 40...</p>

            <p>Well, that was quick. Season two of Prime Video's Fallout show is still weeks away from arriving on December 17th, but a group of modders have wasted no time in studying its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/macvulpes-inculkin-stares-at-a-guy-spitting-blood-as-fallout-season-2s-latest-trailer-sets-up-many-family-searches">latest trailer</a> and taking a crack at adding the NCR ranger power armour shown off to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a>.</p>
<p>Can't take a break and wait for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-4s-anniversary-update-didnt-quite-land-with-the-impact-many-hoped-for-so-nexus-mods-have-assembled-their-own">anniversary update's fallout</a> to totally dissipate when there's a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-new-vegas-latest-modathon-has-flying-robots-evolving-gear-and-cheeky-waving-in-its-pockets">modathon</a> on, I guess.</p>

<p>Anyway, enter the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/98482?tab=description">Ranger Power Armour</a> released by modder PrincessAries and co over the weekend. While not an exact replica, it's based on the armour that shows up in the most recent season two trailer (which I've embedded above) at around the two minute and ten second mark, with its wearer walking into a street wild west-style alongside The Ghoul.</p><p>The mod's armour is designed to be similar in stats to the Fallout series' iconic T-51 power armour, mirroring it being a custom set the NCR have developed, rather than the scavenged T-45d Brotherhood sets sometimes seen on NCR soldiers in New Vegas.</p>
<p>As with a lot of the best power armour mods, this set comes with a wide range of customisation options, including four different base paint jobs. One of those is a lick of red paint so you can sacreligiously use the armour to show how into Caesar's Legion you are. Where the mod really shines, though, is in the various accessories you can add to each bit of the armour for a different look and some stat buffs.</p>
<p>The likes of cloaks, backpacks, bandoliers, and helmet lenses can be mixed and matched to create a unique look. I'm a particular fan of the brahmin skulls strapped to your shoulders and enough bullet casings draped over you to be a human ammo box aesthetic, as well as the hoods which make you look like an unruly fusion-powered teenager. Though, it is worth noting that the modders admit the cloaks in particular can be subject to some clipping misbehavior, especially if you opt for a hooded one.</p>
<p>To get the armour, you'll need to have the Far Harbor DLC, then install the mod and head to a small shack north of the power station outside the ruined town of Natick for a short quest. Given this kind of thing's happening already, I'm keen to see what sorts of mods might arrive once season two's actually aired, assuming it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-electronic-wireless-show-podcast-s3-episode-15-everyone-loves-fallout-and-the-fallout-tv-show">gets folks going</a> like the first one did.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a fresh report from NewZoo, it has been confirmed that ARC Raiders skyrocketed within just two days on the market, beating many of the world’s most capable and impactful games in October’s revenue charts. The data revealed that ARC Raiders secured the seventh spot in the charts in October, despite being released on October 30.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders has proven to be one of the most transformative games ever released, taking over the extraction shooter genre and retaining an enormous player base almost a month after release.</p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-on-top-almost">ARC Raiders On Top (Almost)</h2>



<p>In an all-new October revenue report from NewZoo, it was documented that ARC Raiders hit the seventh spot in the charts despite being on the shelves for just two days in October.</p>



<p>It effortlessly walked over some of the biggest games in the business:</p>



<ul>
<li>Counter-Strike 2</li>



<li>Call of Duty</li>



<li>Minecraft</li>



<li>VALORANT</li>



<li>ROBLOX</li>



<li>World of Warcraft</li>



<li>Marvel Rivals</li>
</ul>



<p>The stunning achievement sat ARC Raiders behind the likes of NBA 2K26, Fortnite, Ghost of Yotei, and Battlefield 6, all of which is/were to be expected.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders continues to stun gamers worldwide, and everyone from diehard extraction shooter fans to those totally new to the concept is getting on board. Recently, a streamer-backed initiative saw some of the biggest creators in the space take part in an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-war-bungulators-arc-battle/">unofficial ‘war’</a> that pulled unprecedented audiences into some streamers’ chats.</p>



<p>There’s a hefty roadmap in store for ARC Raiders, and Embark Studios, the game’s stellar creator, has vowed to support the title for years to come. The next major update will be <strong>Cold Snap</strong>, coming in December 2025.</p>

            <p>Veteran actor Udo Kier has passed away. He was 81.</p>
<p>Kier was born Udo Kierspe in Cologne, Germany. When he was 18, he moved to London, before going on to star in films including Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, Armageddon and Blade.</p>
<p>The news of his passing was <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/udo-kier-dead-own-private-idaho-andy-warhol-frankenstein-1236590259/">shared by his partner</a>, artist Delbert McBride. Along with his film credits, Kier also starred in a number of games, including as Yuri in the Command and Conquer: Red Alert series. The actor was also due to star in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-teases-xbox-horror-od-with-enigmatic-first-trailer">Xbox horror game OD</a>.</p>

<p>Reflecting on Kier's passing, Kojima said he was "at a loss for words".</p>
<p>"It all happened far too suddenly," <a href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1992785286712209409">Kojima wrote on social media</a>. "Because of the strike, we weren't able to shoot 'OD' for a long time, and we were forced to reschedule to next year. Even during that time, Udo and I exchanged emails frequently. We stayed in close contact. When we met in Milan at the end of September, he told me how much he was looking forward to the shoot starting up again next year. He was full of energy then too, making me laugh with his usual 'Udo-isms'.</p>
<p>"I still can't believe this.</p>
<p>"Udo wasn't just an actor. He was truly an 'icon' of his time. We've lost a great 'icon'. There will never be another like him.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ferocious-indie-fps-where-you-fight-dinosaurs-but-also-control-them/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ferocious-is-an-indie-single-player-fps-where-you-fight-dinosaurs-but-also-control-them-and-it%E2%80%99s-out-on-december-4.1362526/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Publisher tinyBuild has announced that the indie single player first-person shooter game FEROCIOUS will be released on December 4 for PC <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1645630/FEROCIOUS/?mc_cid=5e1f5669c5&amp;mc_eid=728a334a9c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via Steam</a>.</p>



<p>FEROCIOUS, powered by Unity, is the debut game of OMYOG, a small studio that features the expertise of both AAA game and film veterans. Leonard Saalfrank, inspired by King Kong, leads the vision, while Mark, ex-Far Cry and Battlefront II director, brings sandbox-level design expertise. Writers like Jörg Ihle and Dominik Hochwald add narrative depth from film, games, and theme parks.</p>



<p>In FEROCIOUS, players will find themselves stranded on a dangerous island and forced to survive against mercenaries, dinosaurs, and a vibrant yet hostile ecosystem. At every turn, they must face challenges in the form of savage predators, treacherous terrain, and limited resources. Careful exploration is vital to uncover hidden paths, secrets and essential gear. Furthermore, as shown in the release date trailer (embedded below), there's a twist in that a so-called 'dino control device' lets you turn the dinosaurs to your side, so that they might be used to attack enemies, open paths, or infiltrate guarded areas. </p>



<p>The lore explanation is that it scans the creature's brain and reproduces its vocal signals, not unlike what was shown in Jurassic Park 3, but with the usage of ultrasonic calls that only the lizards can hear. Once scanned, the player can get a dinosaur to follow them, move to a particular spot, attack a target, break obstacles, or even fetch items. The commands depend on the species; some are more obedient (or smarter) than others. Not every dinosaur in the game will be controllable, though.</p>

<p>TinyBuild did not share the pricing yet, but given that it's an indie game, we expect it to be priced accordingly. The Steam page also includes the minimum and recommended PC system requirements for FEROCIOUS, by the way.</p>



<p><strong>Minimum:<br></strong>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br>OS: Windows 10/11 64-bit<br>Processor: Intel Core i5 4th Gen or AMD equivalent<br>Memory: 12 GB RAM<br>Graphics: NVIDIA GTX 1060 / AMD RX 580<br>DirectX: Version 11<br>Storage: 25 GB available space</p>



<p><strong>Recommended:<br></strong>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br>OS: Windows 10/11 64-bit<br>Processor: Intel Core i7 or Ryzen 5 3600 and up<br>Memory: 16 GB RAM<br>Graphics: NVIDIA RTX 2060 / AMD RX 5600<br>DirectX: Version 11<br>Storage: 25 GB available space</p>

            <p>November is... merry! As the great grim centipede of people and property that is Videogaming continues its progress of the midnight wood, a dozen auteur designers from theatre backgrounds don coxcomb hats and sequined codpieces. They climb onto carts and stage a chariot race, beating each other with bladders decorated to look like Roger Ebert. There is laughter up and down the train. Meanwhile, the industry seers and marketing-mancers have received hopeful tidings from their friends among the owls and bats. The trees are thinning out ahead. The stars can sometimes be seen. There is wild talk that third-person cover shooters are about to come back into fashion.</p>
<p>That isn't all the owls and bats have seen, however. As the path curves, we find ourselves in the courtyard of a squat and forbidding tower. Five levels of blood-flecked obsidian and pixelated braziers, each named for a day of the week, each infested by perfectly terrifying new PC games. Never mind that the edifice has clearly been slapped together using assets lifted from a webinar. Never mind that you can see fuchsia checkerboards everywhere. The tower's frightful denizens must be defeated - or possibly even bought - if the convoy is to proceed.</p><!--more-->
<h2>Monday 24th November</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2725250/Nientum__OpZERO/">Nientum - Op.ZERO</a> (early access) is a mix of 2D platforming and rhythm-action in which amnesiac anime girls restore a creepy theatre and perform twisted versions of familiar musicals.</li>
<li>On a similar theme, here's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2313700/Constance/">Constance</a>, a 2D metroidvania about a somersaulting painter who is navigating worlds derived form her mental health difficulties. Your paintbrush is at least as mighty as a sword, but watch out, using its magical abilities will corrupt you.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2357350/Primal_Fray/">Primal Fray</a> is a turn-based, creature-collecting strategy roguelike set on floating hexagonal islands. Try to make your enemies fall off first.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tuesday 25th November</h2>
<ul>
<li>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2695430/AILA/">A.I.L.A</a> you are a games tester contending with a villainous AI level designer (think Portal, not ChatGPT), rather than the more familiar problems of precarity and crunch.</li>
<li>In Newgroundsy cartoon FPS <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2319790/Captain_Wayne__Vacation_Desperation/">Captain Wayne - Vacation Desperation</a> (pictured), you are a sailor with a shotgun fist on a mission "to rob the rich to feed the badass". I hear and salute the praxis of the implication that one cannot be both rich and badass.</li>
<li>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3200220/Red_Rogue_Sea/">Red Rogue Sea</a> you are playing FTL, but with pirate galleons and turn-based combat and deck-building. Not that much like FTL, perhaps.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Wednesday 26th November</h2>
<ul>
<li>A dragon has turned the world to night and it's your job to settle his hash in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3464970/Holder_of_Place/">Holder Of Place</a>, an autobattling roguelite deckbuilder.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Thursday 27th November</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3120020/Kings_of_Hell/">Kings Of Hell</a> (early access) is a palpably Power-Stoned 2000s-style beat 'em up starring upwardly mobile demons.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1864690/Veterum/">Veterum</a> is a turn-based fantasy strategy-me-do with an emphasis on shaping battlefields in your favour.</li></ul>
<h2>Friday 28th November</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-in-abyss">Death In Abyss</a> is a 3D underwater "flight" combat game in which you play a nimble submersible with fins fighting off huge, fleshy leviathans. Chorus meets Devil Daggers, maybe?</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3146120/Ayasa_Shadows_of_Silence/">Ayasa: Shadows Of Silence</a> is a Little Nightmarish jaunt through six platforming worlds dedicated to Faith, Hope, Love, Greed, Indifference, and Betrayal. I get the sense that even the nice-sounding worlds will be dreadful.</li>
</ul>
<p>The tower is soon afire, for in these strange and glitchy times even obsidian may burn. Our gimlet-eyed QA staff chase the surviving games into the woods; they will haunt us for months to come, stealthily adding themselves to our wishlists while we huddle in our wagons, blowing into frosty fingers and dreaming of the brighter tomorrow promised by the soothsayers. Perhaps the Second Coming is at hand! Perhaps another 2.0 update is at hand!</p>

                <p>2025 has seen a surprising number of fun arcade racing games, including the recent <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0F8RBYYNM,B0F8R7QS54,B0F8RCDNH5&amp;tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a>, which landed on PS5, Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch, and PC back in September. And for a limited time during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/black-friday/">Black Friday</a>, you can get the Amazon Exclusive Edition for just $45 (was $60).

                <p>If you've picked up a Switch 2 console recently and you're looking to grab a game that'll keep you entertained for nearly 100 hours, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FKNJHYR9?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="nofollow ">Persona 3 Reload comes highly recommended</a>, and it's on sale at Amazon for $40 (was $60) thanks to the retailer's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/black-friday/">Black Friday</a> event.

The game also features quality-of-life improvements and a redesigned interface that refines the experience while preserving the heart of the cult-classic PS2 original.</p><p>Note that the Switch 2 version of the game comes on a Game Key-Card, which means none of the game data is included on the cart. Instead, inserting the physical game into your system unlocks the digital version, which you must download to your console before you can start playing. Expect Persona 3 Reload to take up about 25GB on your Switch 2's internal storage or SD card. It's also worth pointing out is that the Episode Aigis DLC expansion is available a separate $35 purchase on the Switch 2 eShop. Episode Aegis adds roughly 30 hours of new story content that takes place after the base game's ending, along with new costumes and music.</p></div>                      </div><p>While Persona 3 Reload came to Switch 2 just a few months ago, it originally launched on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X, and PC back in early 2024. The physical PlayStation and Xbox versions also happen to be on sale at Amazon, and at much lower prices than the Switch 2 version.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/invincible-vs-data-mine-reveals-unannounced-controversial-character.1362466/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>According to a data mine from the Invincible VS Closed Alpha, a controversial character is set to join the roster. Furthermore, it seems the character may be the next one announced.</p>







<p>Based on the comic series and animated show, Invincible is a more bloody version of superheroes. Think <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-boys-operators-for-call-of-duty-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Boys</a>, but more on the mature and dramatic side. The Prime Video show has been going strong for three seasons, with the fourth coming in March 2026. Many game adaptations <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/skybound-games-announces-new-invincible-universe-game-within-fortnite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have been made</a>, but Invincible VS gives the fans what they’ve wanted: a good old-fashioned fighting game. </p>



<p>Announced earlier this year, the game, which comes from former Killer Instinct developers, looks to be the ultimate Invincible experience, down to the show’s all-star cast (like The Walking Dead’s Steven Yeun and Whiplash’s JK Simmons) returning. Now, it seems a new character has been prematurely revealed, and it’s one that comic book fans will be taken aback by.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The news comes from Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1p53a5b/invincible_vs_closed_alpha_test_accidentally/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">RIPMrMufasi</a>, who posted on /GamingLeaksandRumours about the Invincible VS Closed Alpha. The test, which started on November 21st, has been going fairly well. As was the case with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-demo-data-mine-heroes-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Cosmic Invasion</a>, it doesn’t stop fans from doing a data mine into the files and seeing if anything unannounced is in it. As expected, there was indeed something: <strong>a character available through a model swap bug</strong>, seen in the video <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/bada-bing-VLST6Nh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>



<p>According to the video from the Invincible VS data mine, <strong>the character looks to be Anissa</strong>. In the show, the Viltrumite warrior is played by Shantel VanSanten (One Tree Hill, The Boys). The character, seen as an antagonist in the show, is <strong>a rather controversial choice</strong>. While not adapted into the show yet, an inappropriate moment in the comics between her and Mark, the protagonist, has made many worried about her inclusion. </p>



<p>As of now, the character has not been confirmed by Skybound Games or Quarter Up, so <strong>take it with a grain of salt</strong>. For fans of the show, the character is a welcome addition to the roster. However, to fans of the comics, it’s one that may stir up some controversy. Either way, if true, it won’t be long until it’s official.</p>







<p>What do you think of Anissa possibly being added to Invincible VS’ roster? Think it’s a controversial pick? Will it become a problem soon? Which Invincible character would you like to see in the game?

Furthermore, he played Dr. Peter Staub in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-call-of-duty-wwii-available-on-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty: WWII</a> and Erich in Martha is Dead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the actor’s future projects is OD, Hideo Kojima’s next big horror project for Kojima Productions. Unfortunately, it seems Udo Kier did not finish filming for the project, as Kojima <a href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1992785286712209409" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">tweeted about his passing</a>, saying filming was set to start next Spring. The actor was announced alongside Hunter Schafer and Sophia Lillis at the 2023 Game Awards. A teaser for the Xbox Game Studios’ title was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/od-gameplay-reveal-kojima/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed earlier this year</a>. It’s unknown if the actor will be recast or scrapped from the project at this time.</p>



<p>Our thoughts go out to his family and his partner during this difficult time.</p>

Amazon has two deals available--the first drops the Mea Quest 3S 128GB model to just $250 (was $300) and includes a $50 Amazon gift card as a free bonus. You can also score the Meta Quest 3S bundle that includes the 256GB model of the headset with a copy of Batman: Arkham Shadow and a $49 Amazon Gift Card for just $329 (was $400). These deals are exclusive to Amazon and won't stick around long, so grab them while you can.</p><h2>Meta Quest 3S VR Headset Black Friday Deals</h2><p>The Quest 3S is much bigger than the Ray-Ban AI Smart Glasses, but they're also much more powerful, acting as a complete standalone, wireless VR setup (though you can also plug the headset into your PC or PS5 if you want to play more demanding VR games). If you've been curious about VR gaming but haven't jumped in yet, these bundles are an excellent way to get an affordable VR setup.</p><p>For more VR and gaming deals, head over to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/black-friday/">GameSpot's Black Friday 2025 hub</a>.</p><p><strong>Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter:</strong></p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-first-ps5-pro-deal-in-six-months-is-up-for-grabs-for-a-limited-time/1100-6526406/">The First PS5 Pro Deal In Six Months Is Up For Grabs For A Limited Time</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-ps5-slim-bundles-and-collectors-edition-get-huge-discounts/1100-6534326/">Ghost Of Yotei PS5 Slim Bundles And Collector's Edition Get Huge Discounts</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-ultimate-2-switch-2-pc-controller-review-best-deals-at-amazon/1100-6529695/">Save Big On 8BitDo's Stellar Ultimate 2 Controllers In Amazon's Black Friday Sale</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/evercade-exp-r-tomb-raider-cartridge-bundle-retro-gaming-amazon-black-friday-deals/1100-6534530/">Evercade Retro Handhelds &amp; Cartridges Get Rare Price Cuts In Amazon's Black Friday Sale</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kirby-air-riders-nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide/1100-6534089/">Kirby Air Riders Buying Guide: Release-Day Delivery Still Available At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/meta-quest-3s-vr-headset-best-black-friday-deals/1100-6532962/">Meta Quest 3S Black Friday Deal - Save Up To $70 And Get $50 Amazon Credit</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-gamecube-third-party-controller-switch-2-pc-amazon-holiday-deal/1100-6532458/">Grab A Wireless GameCube-Style Controller For Switch 1/2 &amp; PC For Only $40</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lunar-remastered-collection-amazon-exclusive-physical-edition-deal-switch-playstation-xbox/1100-6528818/">Amazon-Exclusive Lunar Remastered Collection Gets First Price Cut</a></li>   </ul> </div>

Like Soda Jungle Maker, Peach's Castle is retiring soon, so this is likely your last chance to get a massive discount on the set.</p><p>Amazon has already sold out of this deal once today (November 23), but the deal is back in stock as of 5:55 PM PT.</p><div title="[Lego] Lego Super Mario Battle with Roy at Peach's Castle (BF2025)" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="5096" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="[Lego] Lego Super Mario Battle with Roy at Peach's Castle (BF2025)" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CV2896TL?ie=UTF8&amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0CV2896TL?ie=UTF8&amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CV2896TL?ie=UTF8&amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">Lego Super Mario: Battle with Roy at Peach's Castle (738 Pieces)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CV2896TL?ie=UTF8&amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0CV2896TL?ie=UTF8&amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CV2896TL?ie=UTF8&amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">$28 (was $65) | Retiring soon</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Battle with Roy at Peach's Castle comes with three buildable Lego Super Mario figures: Roy, Red Toad, and a Chain Chomp that pulls Roy's sled.

Toad can sling projectiles at Roy and Chain Chomp with a built-in catapult atop the castle. If you have Interactive Princess Peach, you can tap the Action Tags on the rotating throne, in the small garden where Toad likes to hang out, and in hidden spots. Tapping an Action Tag plays music and sound effects from the Peach figure's built-in speakers.</p></div>                      </div><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-first-ps5-pro-deal-in-six-months-is-up-for-grabs-for-a-limited-time/1100-6526406/">The First PS5 Pro Deal In Six Months Is Up For Grabs For A Limited Time</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-ps5-slim-bundles-and-collectors-edition-get-huge-discounts/1100-6534326/">Ghost Of Yotei PS5 Slim Bundles And Collector's Edition Get Huge Discounts</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-ultimate-2-switch-2-pc-controller-review-best-deals-at-amazon/1100-6529695/">Save Big On 8BitDo's Stellar Ultimate 2 Controllers In Amazon's Black Friday Sale</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/evercade-exp-r-tomb-raider-cartridge-bundle-retro-gaming-amazon-black-friday-deals/1100-6534530/">Evercade Retro Handhelds &amp; Cartridges Get Rare Price Cuts In Amazon's Black Friday Sale</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kirby-air-riders-nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide/1100-6534089/">Kirby Air Riders Buying Guide: Release-Day Delivery Still Available At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/meta-quest-3s-vr-headset-best-black-friday-deals/1100-6532962/">Meta Quest 3S Black Friday Deal - Save Up To $70 And Get $50 Amazon Credit</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-gamecube-third-party-controller-switch-2-pc-amazon-holiday-deal/1100-6532458/">Grab A Wireless GameCube-Style Controller For Switch 1/2 &amp; PC For Only $40</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lunar-remastered-collection-amazon-exclusive-physical-edition-deal-switch-playstation-xbox/1100-6528818/">Amazon-Exclusive Lunar Remastered Collection Gets First Price Cut</a></li>   </ul> </div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple manages impressive <a href="https://kotaku.com/apple-swallows-its-pride-macbook-air-falls-to-all-time-low-and-goes-2x-cheaper-than-pro-2000646450">25% discounts on MacBooks through Amazon during Black Friday</a>, but this HP laptop just shattered discount records with a massive 71% price drop.</p>
<p>Amazon dropped this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5860/">HP laptop to an all-time low of $859 for Black Friday, down from its usual $2,999 price tag</a>. For this price, you get a <strong>13th Gen Intel 10-core i5 processor, 17.3-inch Full HD display, 32GB of RAM, and 1TB SSD storage</strong>. Windows 11 Pro comes preloaded with Copilot AI, and HP includes a backlit keyboard plus fingerprint reader for security.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5860/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>10-Core Intel Power That Handles Real Work</h2>
<p>The 13th Generation Intel Core i5-1334U processor has <strong>10 cores that turbo boost up to 4.6GHz if you need that extra horsepower</strong>. The hybrid architecture splits the cores between performance and efficiency, throwing the heavy lifting of demanding tasks to powerful cores while background processes run on efficient cores. You can open multiple Chrome tabs, Microsoft Office applications, video conferencing software, and photo editing programs all at once without any lag.</p>
<p>The 32GB DDR4 RAM removes memory bottlenecks that plague laptops with 8GB or 16GB configurations. You keep dozens of browser tabs open, switch between heavy applications, and work with large datasets without seeing the dreaded spinning wheel. Virtual machines run smoothly for developers or IT professionals who need to test software across different environments.</p>



<p>The <strong>1TB PCIe NVMe SSD provides read speeds to make the entire system snappy</strong> and responsive. It boots up Windows in seconds, launches applications almost instantly, and complete file transfers in no time. The storage capacity holds an entire work library of documents, presentations, spreadsheets, photos, videos, and software installations without the constant management of the drive.</p>
<p>The<strong> 17.3-inch Full HD display provides serious screen real estate at 1920×1080 resolution</strong>. You can view full spreadsheets without horizontal scrolling, edit documents with toolbars visible, and run applications side-by-side comfortably. The anti-glare coating reduces eye strain during marathon work sessions and makes the screen readable in bright offices or near windows.</p>



<p><strong>Fingerprint reader security</strong> provides instant login without the need to type passwords every time one opens the laptop. Biometric authentication works quicker and more reliably than passwords, while it offers better security compared with simple PINs. You unlock the laptop with a quick touch of your finger, jumping right into work without delays in authentication. The fingerprint data remains stored locally on the device rather than in cloud databases.</p>
<p><strong>Wi-Fi 6 gives you faster wireless speeds</strong> and greater performance in crowded networks than ever before. Fast transfer of bulky files, smooth video streaming, and jitter-free video conferencing are now possible. <strong>Bluetooth 5.3</strong> connects your wireless mouse, keyboard, headphones, and other accessories with greater range and reliability. USB Type-A and Type-C ports support existing peripherals and accessories along with newer ones without the need for dongles.</p>
<p><strong>Windows 11 Pro</strong> incorporates enterprise features, remote desktop access, and domain joining for business users. Integration with Copilot AI will help users brainstorm ideas, organize tasks, create drafts of content, and answer questions directly in Windows. The AI assistant simplifies your workflow by automating routine tasks for you and displaying relevant suggested actions based on how you work.</p>
<p>This 17.3-inch laptop delivers 10-core Intel performance with 32GB RAM and 1TB SSD for nearly $2,000 off its usual price, at just $859.</p>

This includes hidden Chao across each level, a chance to play pinball in the Casino Nights zone, and a museum featuring all sorts of behind-the-scenes material.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Sonic X Shadow Generations Deals At Amazon</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D6JYR4M7?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5</a> -- $25 (<del>$50</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D6J5Q94Y?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox</a> -- $25 (<del>$50</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D6JKTRHP?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Switch</a> -- $25 (<del>$50</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F663CWT8?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Switch 2</a> -- $25 (<del>$50</del>)</li></ul></div>                      </div><p>Our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review-reruns/1900-6418303/" data-ref-id="1900-6418303">Sonic X Shadow Generations review</a> called it a "nice enough trip down memory lane," though it does come with some friction due to the age of Sonic Generations. If you're a Sonic fan, you'll probably find something here of value (especially at $25). "Shadow Generations' story is a great opportunity to revisit some of Shadow's most memorable moments as well as past boss battles against other artificial beings that could be considered rivals to the title of "ultimate life form," like the Biolizard from Sonic Adventure 2," wrote critic Jordan Ramée. "I was grinning like a kid again when Shadow faced off against Metal Overlord and Crush 40's "What I'm Made Of..." started playing, reminding me of the hours I lost to Sonic Heroes when I was 10 years old."</p><p>Many other <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0F8RBYYNM,B0F8R7QS54,B0F8RCDNH5,B08GHH697V,B0D6JKTRHP,B0F663CWT8,B0D6JYR4M7,B0D6J5Q94Y,B0BB13V163,B0BB1BDM72,B0B9ZFWMK1,B0B9ZTTCJG,B0BZFGSY5W,B0BZFKBL8L,B0BZFCRLDW,B0BZFQ6SLQ,B0C91MLPNG,B0C8ZW6391,B0C915HKTK,B0C9164THC&amp;tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sonic games are on sale for Black Friday</a>, including <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B9ZFWMK1?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sonic Frontiers</a>, which is down to $18 on PS5, $16 on PS4, $10 on Xbox Series X, and $25 on Switch.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/roborock-qrevo-curvx-drops-to-all-time-low-22-000pa-beast-with-auto-hot-water-cleaning-falls-to-record-pricing.1362418/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Roborock holds the same premium position in robot vacuums that Dyson commands in traditional vacuums, with flagship models regularly exceeding $1,500 to $2,000. These luxury cleaning machines pack technology that separates them from budget competitors flooding the market.</p>
<p>The good news is that Amazon just dropped one of Roborock’s best-sellers<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5859/"> to an all-time low of $849 for Black Friday, nearly half off from its usual $1,499 price tag</a>. The <strong>Qrevo CurvX</strong> delivers 22,000Pa suction, zero-tangling design, reactive AI obstacle recognition and 80°C hot water mop washing.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5859/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Technology That Solves Real Cleaning Problems</h2>
<p>The<strong> 22,000Pa HyperForce suction</strong> creates enough force to pull deeply embedded dirt from carpet pile and pulls debris from gaps in hardwood flooring. You can immediately tell the difference compared with a vacuum that has only 8,000-10,000Pa-suction power and tends to push dust instead of picking it up. Pet hair, long human hair up to 40cm, cereal crumbs, and tracked-in dirt-all get pulled into the dustbin in one pass. The zero-tangling design stops hair from tangling around the brushes, thus doing away with the maintenance nightmare of standard robot vacuums where you end up spending 15 minutes each week cutting tangled hair off rollers.</p>
<p>The <strong>ultra-slim profile, at only 3.14 inches, makes this the thinnest Roborock ever</strong> manufactured-just 7.98cm tall. This reduced height lets the robot glide under sofas, beds, and cabinets where dust bunnies really collect. Traditional robot vacuums with raised LiDAR domes get stuck or completely skip whole sections below furniture. This Roborock reaches those forgotten spaces and captures hidden dirt that ruins air quality even when visible floors appear clean.</p>



<p>Reactive AI obstacle recognition relies on structured light and an RGB camera to detect and avoid 108 different object types. It <strong>works both in bright and dark environments</strong> and navigates around toys, cables, pet bowls, shoes, and even furniture legs without getting stuck. You don’t have to preclean your floors before running the vacuum, which really changes the vacuum from a scheduled maintenance tool into something you can turn on spontaneously.</p>
<p>AdaptiLift Chassis is industry-first technology that <strong>can lift the entire robot up to 4cm or individually according to terrain</strong>. The system raises the front to climb high thresholds, adjusts side wheels to navigate around furniture legs, and lowers for tight clearances. This adaptability prevents the ‘stuck’ notifications which interrupt other robot vacuums in mid-clean.</p>
<p>The 80°C hot water washing of the mop dissolves stubborn stains and grease left by cold water. The dock heats water to 176°F before washing the mop pads to make sure they are thoroughly cleaned and sanitized after each use. Warm air drying at 113°F prevents mildew and odors from forming on damp mop pads. This focus on hygiene means your robot will never spread dirty water around on your floors in the course of subsequent cleaning.</p>



<p>The automated maintenance tasks handled by the<strong> Multifunctional Dock 3.0 Thermo+ mean you barely touch the robot</strong>. Auto dust emptying transfers collected debris to the dock’s larger bag, holding weeks of dirt. Auto tank refilling keeps the water reservoir full for mopping sessions. Intelligent dirt detection analyzes mop pad contamination and adjusts washing intensity accordingly. The dock performs self-cleaning with hot water, preventing the buildup that makes other docking stations smell terrible after a few weeks.</p>
<p>At $849, this Roborock delivers flagship cleaning technology and hot water mop washing for $650 off the usual price. You are getting premium features that normally would call for an outlay in excess of $1,500+, skimping on very few minor conveniences.</p>

"The game aims for accessibility at every opportunity, and while nothing about it is particularly exceptional, it still has plenty of unique flourishes to offer, and the wealth of different events and simple controls make for an appealing casual multiplayer title. Thanks to a generous selection of events and a few neat gimmicks, Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 is the best entry in this series."</p><p>Amazon is discounting several other Switch exclusives for Black Friday 2025, including hits like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MY7GHKJ?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MY7GHKJ?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Super Mario Odyssey</a>, but the deals are selling out quickly.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anker-solix-makes-ecoflow-and-jackery-look-overpriced-2-000w-power-station-selling-for-pocket-change.1362409/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>While EcoFlow, Anker and Jackery were all fairly aggressive in their Black Friday pricing on Amazon, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4782/">only Anker provides 2,000W output at $349</a>. Competitor power stations in the $350-$400 price range top out at 1,500-1,800W which gets you less power for similar money.</p>
<p>Amazon has just dropped the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4782/">Anker SOLIX C1000 (second gen) to an all-time low of $349, down from its usual $449 price tag</a>. You get <strong>2,000W continuous output with 3,000W surge capacity</strong>, a 1,024Wh LiFePO4 battery lasting 10 years and it can recharge fully in just 49 minutes.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4782/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>2,000W Output Powers What You Need</h2>
<p>The 2,000W continuous output handles high-draw appliances that kill weaker power stations instantly. You can<strong> power up space heaters, window air conditioners, power tools, electric kettles, and other demanding devices</strong> without triggering overload shutdowns. The 3,000W surge capacity absorbs the startup power spikes that motors and compressors create when they first kick on. Refrigerators, well pumps, and air compressors all draw massive current for a few seconds during startup, and this power station handles those surges without flinching.</p>
<p><strong>Ten output ports</strong> spread the power across various devices at once, without having to prioritize what charges first. The port selection <strong>includes AC outlets</strong> for the standard household devices, <strong>USB-C with fast charging for phones and laptops, USB-A for the older gear</strong>&nbsp;and a car outlet for the 12V accessories. You can power a full remote work setup with laptop, monitor, router, and phone charger while running a mini fridge and fan during power outages.</p>



<p>The <strong>49-minute recharge time using HyperFlash technology at 1,600W input</strong> redefines how you use portable power stations. The traditional models take 6-10 hours to recharge from empty, creating overnight charging rituals which make the power station unavailable when you need it. This Anker charges over a lunch break or during a quick stop at an RV park and is ready for another full day of heavy use. You enable HyperFlash mode through the Anker app when you need maximum charging speed, or use standard charging for quieter operation.</p>
<p>LiFePO4 battery chemistry<strong> offers 10 years of reliable performance with 4,000 charge cycles</strong> before capacity drops to 80%. Traditional lithium-ion batteries degrade much faster; many lose a large portion of their capacity after 500-1,000 cycles. The longevity transforms this from a disposable gadget into a legitimate long-term investment that keeps working through years of regular use. The battery is much safer while charging and discharging than a standard lithium battery due to a lower risk of fire and higher thermal stability.</p>



<p>UPS functionality with<strong> under 10-millisecond switchover</strong> keeps sensitive equipment running during power transitions. CPAP machines, computers, modems, and medical devices never experience interruption when grid power fails. The power station detects outages and seamlessly takes over power delivery before the connected devices even notice anything happened.</p>
<p>At 14% smaller and 11% lighter than other 1,000Wh class products on the market, this compact unit makes transport and storage easier. You can also move it between rooms, load it into vehicles for camping, or stash it in closets without excessive effort.</p>
<p>This $349, 2,000W power station offers more output capacity and 49-minute recharging, while its usual price is $100 lower than the normal. Other competitors charge similar prices for less powerful 1,500-1,800W models with slower charging.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sonos-offloads-era-300-at-zero-margin-dolby-atmos-speaker-that-destroys-competitors-hits-pocket-change-2000646735</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sonos-offloads-era-300-at-zero-margin-dolby-atmos-rival-to-devialet-hits-pocket-change-pricing.1362397/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sonos made its name with speakers that promise high-quality sound without the complexity of a traditional hi-fi system. The Era 300 is its most ambitious speaker yet, <strong>using spatial audio technology to create sound that moves around you</strong> rather than just blasting from one direction.</p>
<p>Amazon just <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5858/">dropped it to an all-time low of $379 for Black Friday, down from its usual $479 price tag</a>. You get six strategically positioned drivers that support Dolby Atmos Music and create <strong>wall-to-wall and floor-to-ceiling sound projection</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5858/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Six Drivers That Create Dimensional Sound</h2>
<p>Placement of Era 300 drivers on the front, sides and top projects sound in multiple directions at once. This configuration serves as the sonic environment Dolby Atmos content needs to operate. Instruments and vocals are placed in locations around your listening space. You hear guitar riffs coming from your left, vocals centered in front, and ambient effects floating overhead.</p>
<p>Custom waveguides tailor the sound dispersion of each driver to make sure you get audio coming from the correct right, left, forward, and above positions. The waveguides serve as acoustic lenses, focusing sound with directional control. You get a wide stereo soundstage that immerses the whole room, instead of a narrow sweet spot where everything sounds good. You can walk around the room without killing the effect, unlike what happens with traditional stereo speakers that only sound right when you’re seated perfectly centered.</p>



<p><strong>Dolby Atmos Music leverages these spatial capabilities</strong> when you stream compatible content from services like Apple Music and Amazon Music. Artists and producers mix Atmos tracks with height and surround channels, placing different elements in a three-dimensional sound field. Listening to Atmos mixes reveals details and separations you never noticed in stereo versions. Drum fills circle around you, backup vocals float distinct from lead vocals, and instrumental layers occupy their own space rather than competing for attention.</p>
<p><strong>Wi-Fi streaming provides stable, high-quality audio</strong> from all major music services, including Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music, Tidal, and dozens more. The Sonos app controls everything: You can browse catalogs, create queues, and manage multiple speakers throughout your home. Bluetooth pairing adds flexibility for devices or services that work better with direct connections. The Sonos Line-In Adapter lets you connect turntables or other audio sources, bringing analog gear into your wireless system.</p>



<p>Regular software updates mean that features and integrations are added over time and keep the speaker current as the streaming landscape evolves. Sonos has a great track record of supporting older products with updates years after you’ve bought them. Updates happen automatically in the background without any need for manual intervention or compatibility concerns.</p>
<p>The speaker <strong>works as a standalone device or incorporates with bigger Sonos systems</strong> across several rooms. You can group speakers together for synchronized music playback throughout your home or control each independently to have different audio in every space. The system scales from a single speaker up to whole-home audio, with no complicated wiring or technical expertise.</p>
<p>At $379, this spatial audio speaker delivers Dolby Atmos Music and multi-directional sound for $100 off its usual price. You’re getting Sonos build quality and future software support at a price that makes experimenting with spatial audio reasonable.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/anker-selling-30w-power-bank-for-pocket-change-10000mah-battery-pack-now-costs-almost-free-2000646730</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anker-selling-30w-power-bank-for-pocket-change-10-000mah-battery-pack-now-costs-almost-free.1362391/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Cheap power banks die after a few months or charge so slowly you’re still stuck glued to walls for several hours. The Anker <em>Zolo</em> power bank provides<strong> legitimate 30W fast charging to rival wall outlets</strong>, yet still brings the same durability Anker has built a name on. Amazon<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5857/"> just dropped it to an all-time low of $19 for Black Friday, down from the usual $25</a>.</p>
<p>You get here <strong>10,000mAh capacity good for two full iPhone charges</strong>, a baked-in USB-C cable tested for 10,000 bends and bidirectional charging that tops up the power bank itself in reasonable time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5857/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>30W Charging That Matches Your Wall Charger</h2>
<p>The <strong>output of 30W gives double the charging speed of the conventional power banks</strong>-5V/3A-that crawl at 15W. Your iPhone 16 Pro Max hits 50% in just 27 minutes, matching what you’d get from plugging into a wall outlet with Apple’s fast charger. Conventional power banks take more than an hour to reach the same charge level, which makes using them an exercise in frustration for a quick top-up between meetings or during short breaks.</p>
<p>The<strong> 10,000mAh capacity will yield nearly two full charges for an iPhone 17</strong>, 1.94 charges for a Samsung Galaxy S25, and two full charges for an iPhone 14 Pro before recharging the power bank. You should be able to make it through long days of traveling, outdoor activities, or power outages without feeling anxious that your phone is going to die on you. The capacity also delivers about 10 full charges for the AirPods Pro 3 and keeps your earbuds powered for weeks of commutes.</p>



<p>Eliminate the frustration of forgetting charging cables at home or digging through bags to find them <strong>with the 5.4-inch-long built-in USB-C cable</strong>. It’s attached to the power bank and is ready whenever you need it. <strong>Anker tested this cable through 10,000 bend cycles</strong> and they ensure the cable survives wrapping, twisting, or stuffing into a pocket thousands of times.</p>
<p><strong>Bidirectional 30W charging</strong> means the power bank recharges quickly through the same USB-C port it uses to charge your devices. The 20W input fills the battery much faster than older power banks that take six hours to recharge from empty. You can top up the power bank during lunch breaks or short charging windows rather than leaving it plugged in overnight. The convenience of fast recharging makes the power bank practical for daily use rather than something you charge once weekly.</p>
<p>The<strong> compact 4.32 x 2.58 x 0.98-inch dimensions</strong> slip easily into pockets, purses, or laptop bags without creating noticeable bulk. The power bank weighs less than your phone, making it comfortable to carry on any commute or travel.</p>



<p><strong>Additional USB-C and USB-A ports</strong> allow you to charge multiple devices at the same time using your own cables. The USB-A port remains compatible with older devices and accessories that haven’t transitioned over to USB-C. You can also charge your phone via the built-in cable while powering earbuds or a smartwatch through the extra ports. This multi-device capability proves useful when traveling with a lot of gadgets.</p>
<p>Anker backs the power bank <strong>with an 18-month warranty</strong> to cover defects and performance issues. The company’s customer service responds rapidly to problems, normally replacing faulty units with minimal hassle. This value-added support comes into play well beyond the price paid, since you are covered when problems crop up.</p>
<p>At $19, this 10,000mAh power bank offers 30W fast charging with a rugged built-in cable for well below the competition, which usually carries worse specs at higher prices.</p>

<p>We've already seen games such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> added to these store units, and now, in a very exciting update, it seems <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> is playable at select locations in the US.</p>
<p>This demo has been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Metroid/comments/1p4tohg/got_to_play_the_metroid_prime_4_demo/">spotted at Walmart and other stores</a>, and apparently has a time limit of 20 minutes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'SBelmont' via r/NintendoSwitch: "I played it myself once already. It's has a 20 minute time limit but I reached the "end" around 13 minutes in. It's a small portion of the prologue that takes place at a Federation base being attacked by Space Pirates before going to the new planet. Apparently it's the same demo that they had at Gamescom."</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt4gZSQE4poJM" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>So, if you happen to be located in the US and have a store nearby with one of these Switch 2 kiosks, you may want to head over and check it out. Nintendo hasn't announced an eShop demo for this title, so a store visit is currently the only way to get a sample of the action right now.</p>
