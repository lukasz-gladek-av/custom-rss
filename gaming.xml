            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dead-or-alive-and-ninja-gaiden-director-tomonobu-itagaki-passes-away-at-58.1326451/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Tomonobu Itagaki, best known for creating the&nbsp;<em>Dead or Alive&nbsp;</em>franchise and for the revival of&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden</em> as a 3D hack-and-slash action game&nbsp;back in 2004, has died aged 58.</p>

<p>As spotted <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1978723327435763751" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">by Wario64</a> on social media, Itagaki's Facebook account was updated earlier today with a post which (according to Wario64's machine translation) he asked "someone special" to release when the "light of [his] life is about to run out".</p>

<p>Itagaki says that the fact the post has appeared on his Facebook page "means it's finally time" and that he's "no longer in this world". He says he "stand[s] by [his] beliefs" and has "no regrets", except for "not being able to deliver [his] new work", for which he apologizes to his fans.</p>

No cause of death was announced in any of the places where Itagaki's death was confirmed.</p>

<p>Tomonobu Itagaki joined the games industry in 1992, where his inaugural project was the Super Famicom port of sports game&nbsp;<em>Tecmo Super Bowl</em>. What would arguably serve as his big break came in 1996, when he headed up&nbsp;<em>Dead or Alive&nbsp;</em>for what was then known as Tecmo Creative #3.</p>

<p>That studio would go on to change its name to Team Ninja, working on the rebooted version of&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden&nbsp;</em>for the Xbox back in 2004, as well as subsequent 3D hack-and-slash entries in the revived version of the franchise.</p>

<p>Itagaki departed Team Ninja in 2008 and would go on to work on just two games following his departure, namely 2015's much-maligned&nbsp;<em>Devil's Third&nbsp;</em>and 2020's&nbsp;<em>Samurai Jack: Battle through Time</em>, albeit as an advisor on the second title.</p>

The post said he had no regrets and stood by his beliefs, but apologized to his fans for not being able to produce more games.</span></p> <blockquote><p><span>Words I Leave Behind</span></p> <p><span>The flame of my life is finally about to go out.</span></p> <p><span>If this message has been posted, it means that the time has come.

            <title><![CDATA[Dell’s OptiPlex 7020 Mini PC Falls 71%, From 6× the Price of a Mac Mini to Clearance-Level Pricing]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/the-only-thing-skinnier-than-this-powerhouse-dell-desktop-is-its-71-off-amazon-deal-2000635765</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dell%E2%80%99s-optiplex-7020-mini-pc-falls-71-from-6%C3%97-the-price-of-a-mac-mini-to-clearance-level-pricing.1326439/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Maybe you’re still unconvinced by the recent wave of mini PCs, but you’re still not willing to plop a full-sized PC tower onto your desk, or even under it. Here’s a massive new Amazon deal on a desktop PC that’s slightly bigger than the other minis, way smaller than the towers, and quite possibly blows them both all of the water when it comes to performance. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4813/">The skinny Dell Optiplex 7020 is a fat 71% off at just $996.</a></p>
<p>The heart and brains of the Optiplex 7020 is the 14th-gen Intel Core i7-14700T processor that delivers enough power to handle all of your productivity tasks and even some creative ones too, and it can do so at sizzling speeds of up to 5.2GHz. There’s also 32GB of RAM and a 1TB hard drive inside the slender sub-2-inches-wide body, along with enough ports so it can easily handle being the centerpiece of your home workstation.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4813/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Mini In Name Only</h2>
<p>Dell calls the Optiplex 7020 a “mini PC,” but it’s a weight class or two above the palm-sized PCs that have been all the rage lately. Still, at just 7 inches high and 7 inches long, and just 1.42 inches thick, it definitely qualifies as portable, and can even be mounted on the back of a monitor for ultimate space-saving efficiency. You might have to choose which monitor to mount it behind, though, because the Dell Optiplex 7020 can support up to 3 displays at 4K resolution.</p>
<p>Performance-wise, there’s nothing “mini” about the Optiplex 7020, with all of that memory and Intel processing power driving the pre-installed Windows 11 Professional. The Intel UHD Graphics 770 chip will have all three of those 4K monitors looking crisp, if you so choose, in which case you’ll have plenty of visual real estate to put Microsoft Copilot to work as your AI assistant.</p>



<h2>All Your Hookups</h2>
<p>The HDMI 1.4b and two DisplayPort 1.4a outputs handle the external monitor situation more than amply, and there are also two USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 ports, a USB-A 3.2 Gen 2, and a USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 to satisfy all of your expansion and peripheral needs. The Ethernet RJ-45 port will give you outstanding hardwired internet speed, but it also has Wi-Fi 6 to keep your online work and play moving at a nice clip.</p>
<p>Dell’s foray into the small-PC world originally showed up at Amazon with a bloated $3,399 price tag that we wouldn’t recommend in a million years, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4813/">but with that number slashed down by 71% to just $996</a>, the Optiplex 7020 is a solid buy as a high-powered performance desktop PC that happens to be shrunk down to portable size.</p>

Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

<p>Team Ninja has just announced that their first leader, Tomonobu Itagaki, has unfortunately passed away. </p>



<p>All eyes are on Team Ninja right now, as their highly anticipated installment to the Ninja Gaiden franchise arrives on October 21, 2025. We have already seen a lot of the game through several trailers and teasers, and it seems that it’s going to be a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-ninja-gaiden-4-gameplay-trailer-shows-off-disgusting-levels-of-difficulty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">difficult one</a>. However, less than a week before release, one of the most integral people behind the franchise’s revival has passed away. </p>

<p>Tomonobu Itagaki’s passing was announced through Team Ninja’s <a href="https://x.com/TeamNINJAStudio/status/1978756897231798606" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter). The post stated: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are deeply saddened by the passing of Team NINJA’s first leader, Tomonobu Itagaki. </p>



<p>We will carry on the philosophy and creativity that Itagaki-san began and continue to create games that many gamers will enjoy. </p>



<p>Our deepest condolences for his loss. </p>



<p>From everyone at Team NINJA</p>
</blockquote>



<p>For those unaware, Tomonobu Itagaki is a renowned Japanese video game designer who started his journey at Tecmo in 1992. Itagaki’s claim to success came with 1996’s Dead or Alive. In 2001, Itagaki was named Team Ninja’s first leader, where he revived the 1988 arcade franchise Ninja Gaiden and released it for Xbox in 2004. The title received widespread critical acclaim and an international online tournament. </p>



<p>Following that, the Team Ninja leader helped release Ninja Gaiden Black, Ninja Gaiden: Dragon Sword, and Ninja Gaiden II. He then left Tecmo in 2008 due to a fallout and founded Vallhalla Game Studios, where he helped develop Devil’s Third with some former Team Ninja members. Then, in 2021, Itagaki created another studio, called Itagaki Games. </p>

<p>While Battlefield 6 has a fun and varied arsenal, nothing beats the best assault rifle, and our top meta loadout ensures the weapon has you locked in and will get you more kills than if you used any other AR.</p>



<p>An assault rifle is a staple of online FPS shooters. Sniper Rifles aren’t always applicable, Shotguns also depend on the size of the map, LMGs are powerful but as mobile as a tank, and SMGs also fall into that ‘circumstantial’ territory. An assault rifle is an all-around beast, and even the bad ones are good.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-review-multiplayer-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> has a reliable foundation of assault rifles to kickstart the game, so let’s see which AR is considered to be the meta selection, and we’ll take a deep dive into its best loadout and more.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-best-assault-rifle-in-battlefield-6">What Is The Best Assault Rifle In Battlefield 6?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Test it out if you’re unsure. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The consensus is that the M433 is the best meta assault rifle in Battlefield 6, which is no surprise as it’s an extremely effective weapon at most ranges.</strong></p>



<p>Whether you used it in <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield 6</a>‘s campaign or online, the M433 is a monstrous weapon. Everything about it works: Firepower, fire rate, recoil control, its default ammo clip size, mobility, and handling. It’s literally the perfect assault rifle, and it only gets better once you start applying the best attachments to it.</p>







<p>Our best M433 assault rifle class focuses on reducing recoil and making it more efficient and effective during combat. It’s not the most attachments you can have for the gun—so feel free to tinker and add more—but this is a simple and relatively easy to put together loadout.</p>



<p>Here’s our best M433 assault rifle meta loadout.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-m433-assault-rifle-in-battlefield-6">How To Unlock M433 Assault Rifle In Battlefield 6</h2>



<figure><figcaption>From the get-go. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>You’ll be pleased to know that the M433 assault rifle is unlocked by default at the beginning of your Battlefield 6 online multiplayer journey!</strong></p>



<p>It wouldn’t be convenient if all weapons were locked when you start playing Battlefield 6 online, would it? Some guns need to be available, and the M433 is one of them. This means you can equip it right away and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-farm-xp-level-up-fast-in-battlefield-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">start leveling it up fast and earning XP</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-assault-rifle-class-setup-in-battlefield-6">Best Assault Rifle Class Setup In Battlefield 6</h2>



<p>Alongside your M433 assault rifle, you also need the right equipment and abilities. From Frontliner to the M87A1 Shotgun, we’ve picked out the gear you need to complement the M433 perfectly.</p>



<p>Check out each slot and what to put in it:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Field Specs:</strong> Frontliner</li>



<li><strong>Sidearm:</strong> P18 (Pistol)</li>



<li><strong>Gadget 1:</strong> M87A1 (Shotgun)</li>



<li><strong>Gadget 2:</strong> Deploy Beacon</li>



<li><strong>Throwable:</strong> Fragmentation Grenade</li>



<li><strong>Melee:</strong> Sledgehammer</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Frontliner </strong>is preferable from Field Specs (once you unlock it) as it speeds up health recovery, reduces fall damage, and gives a brief buff to spawning teammates. It’s just a generally great set of abilities that aim to keep you alive for longer and make you stronger.</p>



<p>The <strong>P18 </strong>is the best and most consistent Pistol in Battlefield 6, so that’s an easy one. We’ve opted for the M87A1 shotgun as the first gadget, as that’s the best shotgun in the game. It’s unstoppable, and the perfect option for close-range combat. Whereas the <strong>Deploy Beacon</strong> gets you—and your squad—back into the fray faster.</p>



<p>The <strong>Fragmentation Grenade</strong> is a standard Frag Grenade that’s great for puncturing holes in the walls and enemies, and speaking of both of those things, the <strong>Sledgehammer </strong>is a beastly, bludgeoning no-brainer.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>EA employees and the Communications Workers of America union have issued a statement against the proposed private acquisition of the company, claiming they were not represented in the negotiations and any jobs lost as a result would "be a choice, not a necessity, made to pad investors' pockets".</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-privately-acquired-in-55bn-deal-by-group-of-investors-including-saudi-arabias-investment-fund-and-donald-trumps-son-in-law">acquisition of EA by a group of private investors</a> was announced at the end of September. The deal, for $55bn, includes investment from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and Affinity Partners, the company of President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner.</p>
<p>Following the announcement, there's been plenty of speculation around the future of EA and its multiple owned studios, split between EA Sports and EA Entertainment. Now, members of the United Videogame Workers union and the CWA have <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/united-videogame-workers-cwa-statement-proposed-electronic-arts-buyout">issued a formal response</a> alongside a <a href="https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/make-ea-better">petition for regulators to scrutinise the deal</a>.</p>
<p>"EA is not a struggling company," the statement reads. "With annual revenues reaching $7.5 billion and $1 billion in profit each year, EA is one of the largest video game developers and publishers in the world."</p>
<p>This success has been driven by company workers, the union stated. "Yet we, the very people who will be jeopardised as a result of this deal, were not represented at all when this buyout was negotiated or discussed."</p>
<p>Citing the number of layoffs across the industry since 2022, workers fear for "the future of our studios that are arbitrarily deemed 'less profitable' but whose contributions to the video game industry define EA's reputation."</p>
<p>"If jobs are lost or studios are closed due to this deal, that would be a choice, not a necessity, made to pad investors' pockets - not to strengthen the company," the statement reads.</p>
<p>"Every time private equity or billionaire investors take a studio private, workers lose visibility, transparency, and power," it continues. "Decisions that shape our jobs, our art, and our futures are made behind closed doors by executives who have never written a line of code, built worlds, or supported live services. We are calling on regulators and elected officials to scrutinise this deal and ensure that any path forward protects jobs, preserves creative freedom, and keeps decision-making accountable to the workers who make EA successful."</p>
<p>As such, workers have launched a petition in a "fight to make video games better for workers and players - not billionaires".</p>
<p>The statement concludes: "The value of video games is in their workers. As a unified voice, we, the members of the industry-wide video game workers' union UVW-CWA, are standing together and refusing to let corporate greed decide the future of our industry."</p>
<p>Eurogamer contacted the Federal Trade Commission following news of the proposed acquisition of EA, but it refused to comment "on pending mergers or acquisitions".</p>
<p>A report from The Financial Times suggested the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-private-acquisition-deal-expected-to-go-smoothly-says-report-as-what-regulator-is-going-to-say-no-to-the-presidents-son-in-law">deal won't face much opposition</a>. As one source said: "What regulator is going to say no to the president's son-in-law?"</p>
<p>Eurogamer also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-takeover-the-saudi-arabian-public-investment-fund-and-vanity-mega-projects-human-rights-watch-assesses-the-impact-of-gamings-latest-controversy">spoke with the Human Rights Watch on the controversial acquisition</a>. "We have found that the public investment fund has contributed to, and is responsible for, human rights abuses," said researcher Joey Shea on the involvement of Saudi Arabia's government. "This is a trillion dollars in Saudi state wealth that should be invested to realise the economic and social rights of Saudi citizens. We've found it's been invested in vanity mega projects inside and outside of the country.</p><p>"We see this as a deliberate attempt to distract from the country's human rights abuses [...] MBS himself wields enormous power over what is effectively public funds, and he wields this power in a highly arbitrary and personalised manner, rather than the benefit of the Saudi people more broadly. Effectively, Saudi Arabia's vast fossil fuel-derived state wealth is controlled by one person, which isn't good for human rights, or business either."</p>

            <p>
It's still a little hard to believe <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a> is a thing that exists and is finally here - but here it most definitely is, and developer Team Cherry continues to finesse the experience, with its fourth patch now officially in public beta.
</p>
<p>
Chief among Patch 4's additions is what Team Cherry is calling a "basic implementation" of Silksong's new Simplified Chinese translation - the first step in its efforts to remedy the original translation, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-is-being-review-bombed-in-china">heavily criticised in a wave of negative Steam reviews</a> back in September.
</p>
<p>
That arrives alongside localisation improvements across a range of languages, further improvements to controller support, and various fixes for a number of highly specific scenarios. Which is to say, you're out of luck if you were hoping Team Cherry might finally look upon you - and your struggles against <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/im-picking-it-up-a-lot-faster-hollow-knight-newcomers-and-veterans-respond-to-the-first-few-hours-of-silksong">Silksong's sometimes punishing difficulty</a> - with benevolent eyes.

<p>
Silksong's public beta patch is available on Steam by selecting Properties &gt; Betas, then opting into the public-beta branch under Beta Participation. Patch notes are below, but Team Cherry says development remains "very much in progress", so expect more fixes ahead of its final release to all players:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated Simplified Chinese translation with a new script for public testing. This is a basic implementation only, to be refined and updated based on player feedback.</li>
<li>Various localisation fixes implemented across all languages.</li>
<li>Switched to Unity's Input System to improve overall controller support. This includes rumble features now working for various controllers, and additional controllers being recognised. Some issues may remain. For a full list of supported controllers and features, please visit: https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.14/manual/SupportedDevices.html </li>
<li>Fixed Styx not giving rosaries when delivering the Queen's Egg.</li>
<li>Fixed Druid's Eyes sometimes not equipping correctly when first acquired.</li>
<li>Fixed some down attack colliders getting stuck on in rare instances.</li>
<li>Fixed several instances of Hornet's plasmified state clearing when not intended (eg Bellway travel).</li>
<li>Fixed issues entering the plasmified state when killing a Winged Lifeseed, rather than using the Plasmium Phial.</li>
<li>Reduced unintentionally long bind time when using Multibinder with the Shaman crest.</li>
<li>Updated Multibinder's initial bind to clear maggots, per community comments.</li>
<li>Various smaller tweaks and fixes.</li>
</ul>
<p>
In addition to Silksong's upcoming fourth patch, Version 1.0.28891 received its full release earlier this week, primarily bringing improved controller support. PlayStation's DualSense Edge controllers are now compatible with Silksong, for instance, and Mac users can expect better compatibility across a range of controllers too. Additionally, the game now automatically pauses if your controller disconnects, meaning you're less likely to spiral into a pit of enraged despair if your batteries suddenly run out in the middle of a boss fight.
</p>
<p>
Full Version 1.0.28891 patch notes for Silksong - which Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-review">awarded five gleaming stars in our review</a> earlier this year - can be found below:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added support for Dualsense Edge controllers.</li>
<li>Improved support for various controllers on Mac.</li>
<li>Game now pauses when the controller disconnects.</li>
<li>Fixed various smaller controller issues (more fixes to come in future).</li>
<li>Fixed remaining instance of certain players getting stuck cursed while in the late game.</li>
<li>Fixed Curveclaw not reacting to Hunter down-stab.</li>
<li>Fixed rare instances of being able to air dash and double jump when not intended.</li>
<li>Fixed several out of bounds situations.</li>
<li>Fixed Pharlid Divers sometimes sliding on roofs after ambushing in certain scenes.</li>
<li>Fixed Eva Hunter Crest upgrades unintentionally clearing tool equips.</li>
<li>Fixed rare instances of Harpoon sometimes granting 2 Silk instead of 1.</li>
<li>Fixed Cogflies sometimes appearing from odd locations after scene transition and, in rare cases, having their active quantity reduced by 1.</li>
<li>Fixed Crafting Kits not increasing the damage of offensive blue tools (eg Sawtooth Circlet).</li>
<li>Slight increase to Sharp Dart and Cross Stitch damage.</li>
<li>Updated damage scaling on Rune Rage to match other Silk Skills.</li>
<li>Slight decrease to Thread Storm damage at higher needle levels.</li>
<li>Fixed Surgeon enemies sometimes pulling the hero out of bounds.</li>
<li>Fixed instances of some Spool Fragments being permanently missable if a player immediately quit after collecting the item.</li>
<li>Fixed Crust King Khann sometimes falling out of bounds during entry, when fought on low-end systems.</li>
<li>Fixed rare instance of Second Sentinel becoming rotated when defeated.</li>
<li>Fixed additional case of Seth sometimes getting out of bounds and not returning.</li>
<li>Fixed Seth sometimes remaining invincible for a moment at the start of a refight.</li>
<li>Fixed Vaults slide blocks incorrectly responding to damage sources other than the needle.</li>
<li>Changed Fine Pins wish drops from 50% chance to 100%, but raised required quantity.</li>
<li>Fixed issues when consuming a Silkeater while in water.</li>
<li>Fixed Scuttlebrace sometimes allowing a wall jump when not intended.</li>
<li>Fixed a soft-lock during the Grand Gate opening sequence, if the Citadel had been visited and some bellshrines remained inactive.</li>
<li>Various smaller fixes and tweaks.</li>
</ul>

<p>Launching in Japan next month</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="c9f951f7c1376"><a title="Sakurai Manga" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c9f951f7c1376/sakurai-manga.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/images/202510/55235/506461">East Press / Famitsu</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>After <strong>Smash Bros.</strong> streams, Direct presentations and more YouTube uploads than we can count, we'd wager that you probably have a pretty good understanding of who Masahiro Sakurai is by this point. But seeing his life story told through a manga? Now that's new (thanks for the heads up, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-manga-based-on-the-life-of-smash-bros-creator-masahiro-sakurai-is-out-next-month/">VGC</a>).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202510/55235">Famitsu</a> has revealed that the legendary creator of <strong>Kirby</strong> and Smash will soon have his very own manga biography, titled "Masahiro Sakurai: Making the World More Fun with Games' (via Google Translate). The book, on which Sakurai has lent a helping hand, traces his life from a childhood passion for gaming, through the creation of Kirby and Sora, and up to the present day. There's even a conclusion that Sakurai himself appears to have written.</p>
<p>According to Famitsu, the manga's six chapters are titled as follows (again, via Translate):</p>
<ul>
<li>Chapter 1: "Boy Sakurai and Games"</li>
<li>Chapter 2: "The Birth of Kirby of the Stars!"</li>
<li>Chapter 3: "The Beginning of the Great Battle"</li>
<li>Chapter 4: "Sora Limited Company Established!"</li>
<li>Chapter 5: "Inheritance"</li>
<li>Chapter 6: "A Light for the Future"</li>
</ul>
<p>The book will launch in Japan on 18th November for 1,430 yen (roughly £7 / $9), and while an English translation hasn't been announced at the time of writing, Famitsu has revealed a peek at the following three pages:</p>

<p>Sakurai's YouTube channel provided us with an unparalleled look into the developer's mind, so we're not exactly sure what else there is to know. That said, a manga biography wouldn't have made our bingo card any time soon, so it sure is a cool announcement.</p>
<p>The next time we see Sakurai will likely be in his second <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> Direct, which was teased last month. The pink puffball's upcoming racer arrives on Switch 2 on 20th November, so there's only so many weeks left for another info dump from Sakurai himself. Keep those eyes peeled for a Direct announcement!</p>

                <p>Two prominent video game industry veterans have voiced their opinions on AI, with both people--Hideo Kojima and Glen Schofield--declaring that AI should not be feared but embraced.</p><p>Kojima, for his part, said AI is already used in a lot of creative work to "come up with ideas." But Kojima himself sees AI "as more of a friend." Kojima said he would use AI to "boost efficiency" but that he himself would continue to "lead the creative part" of game development.</p><p>"I'd like AI to handle the tedious tasks that would lower cost and cut down on time. It's more like co-creating with AI instead of just using it," he told <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DPECvLZjFzO/?igsh=MWp2Y25jcHV1djZvMA%3D%3D" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wired.</a> "I see a future where I stay one step ahead; creating together with AI."</p><p>Another game developer who talked about AI recently was Schofield, the Dead Space co-creator and Call of Duty veteran.

<p>But you have to beat it first</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/terminator_2d_no_fate">Terminator 2D: NO FATE</a> already looks incredible, but a new trailer from IGN Fall Fan Fest 2025 showcases the awesome feature in which you can actually change key moments from the original story.</p>
<p>You need to beat the game once first, during which you'll experience the story from Judgement Day in its entirety, but once you've done that, you're free to mix things up. Doing so will actually open up new levels and opportunities, so for example, instead of sparing the police that show up at Cyberdyne, you can eviscerate them with a mini-gun. Brutal.</p>
<p>There's also a short clip in which the T-1000 impales Sarah Connor, which is obviously quite a departure from how the original movie plays out. We can't wait to what kind of opportunities this might open up for the rest of the story.</p>
<p>As long as it's executed well and it's not, y'know... <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/walking_dead_destinies">The Walking Dead: Destinies</a>, then we're all good.</p>
<p>Terminator 2D: No Fate recently suffered a delay, but is still scheduled to launch this year on <strong>26th November 2025</strong>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-15%E2%80%B3-portable-monitor-turns-your-nintendo-switch-into-a-big-screen-console-for-pocket-change.1326373/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Nintendo Switch’s built-in screen is fine for quick sessions on the couch, but squinting at that 6.2-inch display during long gaming marathons gets old fast. The <em>MNN</em> <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3766/">15.6-inch portable monitor has dropped to an all-time low of $59 on Amazon, down from $89</a>, and it transforms your handheld console into something that feels closer to a proper gaming setup without sacrificing portability.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3766/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>What’s especially desirable about the monitor in its own right, is its real plug-and-play ease: The <strong>dual USB-C receptacles let you connect your Switch with one cable</strong> that handles power and video signal simultaneously. Not a distinct power brick in play, no HDMI converter to carry around but one cable from the Switch dock to the monitor.</p>
<h2>Why Size and Portability Actually Matter</h2>
<p>The <strong>15.6-inch display produces 1920×1080 Full HD resolution</strong> which is an enormous leap from the Switch’s native display at 1280×720. Text becomes crisper, game worlds display more detail and the experience becomes more immersive in general. The IPS panel technology allows for stable colors and<strong> clarity throughout a 178-degree viewing angle</strong> so you can see the display from the side without the colors washing out or contrast changing. The large viewing angle becomes beneficial in the case that you’re playing with friends huddled around a small table.</p>



<p>The screen’s <strong>matte finish cuts down glare from ceiling lights or windows</strong> which becomes essential in rooms you can’t completely control. Glossy screens are wonderful in lightless rooms but become mirrors in well-lit rooms. The diffusing effect the matte coating gives this MNN monitor prevents the picture from being obscured in well-lit rooms such as coffee houses, air terminal lounges, or sunlit hotel rooms.</p>
<p>Internal speakers reduce one cable and device from your carry-on equipment. Audio quality won’t be the same as with dedicated gaming headsets but the fact that you can have audio without the added hardware makes spontaneous gaming sessions easier. Speakers are loud enough for personal use in quiet spaces and headphones can always be plugged in via your Switch if you want superior audio or prefer the stealth.</p>



<p><strong>HDR support improves compatible games</strong> with increased contrast and wider range of colors. Games developed with HDR in view feature brighter highlights and richer shadows at the same time, and the result is more visual complexity. The contrast becomes particularly apparent in highly lit games such as Breath of the Wild or neo-noir games where atmosphere relies so highly on light and shadow interaction.</p>
<p>The monitor weighs <strong>a little more than two pounds and less than half an inch thick</strong>, so it can fit in laptop bags or backpacks right next to your Switch. The built-in smart cover shields the display in transport and doubles as a stand that tilts the monitor up at a comfortable viewing angle. Since the stand solution is built right in, you’re not searching for something to prop the monitor up against or wrestling with a standalone kickstand accessory.</p>
<p>At $59, this is fantastic value for a transportable display which really enhances your mobile gaming experience.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ego-ai-create-human-like-ai-characters-with-personalities/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98human-like%E2%80%99-ai-characters-with-memories-and-personalities-created-by-ego-ai.1326370/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Today, a San Francisco-based AI company has announced the launch of character.world, an AI engine that allows for the creation of ‘human-like’ characters with memories, personalities, and the ability to form relationships with users.</p>



<p>This technology is built on the Character Context Protocol (CCP), an open-source product from EGO AI, which allows for the seamless integration of powerful and authentic AI-powered NPCs across various games, apps, and platforms, including Discord and Twitch.</p>



<p>The announcement went hand-in-hand with the unveiling of almost $7 million in seed funding to further bolster these AI-driven creations entering the market.</p>



<h2 id="h-living-persistent-characters-who-can-make-games-richer">‘Living, Persistent Characters Who Can Make Games Richer’</h2>



<p>In a press release, the CEO of EGO, Vishnu Hari, explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Games and digital worlds have always struggled with flat, scripted non-player characters (NPCs) that feel mechanical and forgettable. EGO AI is tackling that head-on with characters who act, react and remember like real players.</p>



<p>Our mission is to move beyond chat windows and give people living, persistent characters who can make games richer, worlds more alive and interactions more meaningful.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In a short video presenting the abilities of EGO AI, the company showcased how a user can talk directly to an AI NPC powered by the CCP technology, getting an instant response that’s contextualized and makes sense. The AI NPC remembered the conversation and referred to it later, even recalling a topic when talking to the user <strong>outside </strong>the initial game.</p>



<p>Here’s the video:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="What is ego?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0dDGktWqUMI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>These are very early days for EGO AI, but investors are excited about the potential. In a statement, Adam Draper of Boost VC, one of the investors in EGO AI, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>What excites me about Ego is their approach to one of gaming’s biggest challenges: creating characters that truly feel alive.</p>



<p>Their foundation model is a breakthrough in AI character behavior. We’re entering a new era where AI characters will carry personality, memory, and emotion—indistinguishable from human players—and Ego is positioned to lead it. And Vish is the most resilient founder in the space.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In an extensive whitepaper, EGO AI explained everything that goes into the technology driving these AI characters and laid out the benefits, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>More authentic gameplay</li>



<li>Automatic population of game worlds</li>



<li>Automated play and balance testing</li>
</ul>



<p>Each AI character will have a personality, needs, emotions, and memory features that enable them to feel as human as possible, and EGO AI has promised that this is the ground floor for this technology.</p>



<p>It obviously has some concerning elements circulating around it, the most critical of which is the inherent threat to human actors who would otherwise play these roles. This will likely fire up a debate when EGO AI becomes more public.</p>



<p>Are you eager to see more technology like this surface, or would you rather stick to traditional methods of portraying NPCs? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"It would be a disaster if everyone tried to match them."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">As the debate over the price of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> rages on, one developer of the original Saints Row — itself heavily inspired by GTA — has said he hopes Rockstar charges $100 for it, insisting it’s the only game in the world that can get away with it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Strauss Zelnick, boss of Rockstar parent company Take-Two, is often asked how much Rockstar will charge for what is expected to be the biggest entertainment launch of all time. And each time he’s asked, Zelnick dances around the question, pointing to delivering value for customers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Adding fuel to the scrutiny is the industry's recent jump from $70 to $80 for some games. If Nintendo is charging $80 for Nintendo Switch 2 games like Mario Kart World, and Microsoft, as many expect, jumps to $80 for its games from next year after backtracking on doing just that this year, then it's hard to see GTA 6 priced any cheaper.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans often baulk at the idea of forking out $100 for GTA 6. But according to Chris Stockman, the design director of the first Saints Row game, GTA 6 “deserves” to be $100.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with <a href="https://esportsinsider.com/2025/10/saints-row-creator-interview-gta-vi" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Esports Insider</a>, Stockman responded to the suggestion that GTA 6 will be the first $100 video game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“They’re the only ones that can get away with it, Stockman said. “I don’t think it’s a rising tide that floats all boats. I think that there’ll be a tremendous amount of backlash if everyone switched to $100. Not all games are created equal. I think GTA is the only one that can get away with it, and I hope they do. I really hope it’s $100. I think it deserves to be $100.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The scope and magnitude of this production deserves that price tag, but not everything is treated equally. It would be a disaster if everyone tried to match them.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Vice City Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Stockman here is saying the sheer scope of GTA 6 will be of a magnitude higher than any video game before it. Certainly it’s rumored to have the largest development budget of all time. Rockstar has barely shown any of the game, so it’s unclear exactly how big and varied an experience it will be. But it seems like a safe bet that barring the worst disaster in video game history, GTA 6 will rewrite the record books when it comes to critical and commercial acclaim.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But is the world ready for the jump to $100? Earlier this year, a $100 GTA 6 was mooted by Epyllion CEO and analyst Matthew Ball in a <a href="https://www.matthewball.co/all/stateofvideogaming2025" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>lengthy presentation on the state of gaming in 2025</u></a>. Near <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-price-many-in-the-video-game-industry-hope-for-80-if-not-100-analyst-says"><u>the end of the presentation</u></a>, Ball said that “some gamemakers hope GTA 6 will be priced at $80 to $100, breaking the $70 barrier and helping $50 titles to move up to $60, $60 to do $70, $70 to $80 etc."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Packaged game prices have never been lower in real terms than they are today — even though budgets are at all-time highs and player growth is stalled,” Ball wrote. “GTA 6 could re-establish packed video game prices after decades of deflation despite rampant cost growth.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-at-100-would-be-a-bridge-too-far-even-for-grand-theft-auto"><u>Other analysts have poured cold water on the $100 suggestion though</u></a>, saying that such is the huge excitement around GTA 6 that there’s simply no need to limit the game’s potential audience by pricing some out of the experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, recently published research claimed that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-much-will-gta-6-cost-new-research-claims-100-price-point-would-actually-leave-money-on-the-table">if Rockstar were to go with $100 for GTA 6, it would actually cost the company money</a>, with the revenue “sweet spot” remaining $70.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Price is just one of the many unanswered questions swirling around GTA 6. Another is what Rockstar plans to do with GTA Online. Could the company charge more for access to GTA Online? Will it be a standalone free download? Could Rockstar sell a subscription? Will Rockstar and Take-Two really keep GTA Online available at no additional cost, as before?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hopefully it won’t be long before we get answers. GTA 6 is due out May 26, 2026, on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">You, too, can be Nurse Joy!</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Pokémon world can feel a bit idyllic at times to imagine, especially when you think of the free universal healthcare via magic healing machines provided to all Pokémon at any Pokémon Center. Since the very first games, these Pokémon Centers have been staffed by a roster of completely identical women (skin, hair, eyes, expression, everything!), all known in the anime as Nurse Joy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But in Pokémon Legends: Z-A, for the first time, working Nurse Joys can be a little different.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/14/20251014074504-01k7h8gfppvwt1x8pcq13w39ep-1760445962517.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon Legends: Z-A introduces unique Nurse Joys at every Pokémon Center for the first time in a Pokémon game. While the first one you're likely to encounter looks like a fairly standard Joy, every woman staffing a Center has slightly different features: different skin tones, different eyes, different mouths, and different eyebrows. They're all still in the same uniform and still sporting the same red loopy pigtails, but they now are giving a lot less pre-1980s Rockette.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/14/20251014074510-01k7h8kvje3ty85f9mg0h8f4gt-1760445973448.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">This is in keeping with one of the features I've really enjoyed about Z-A so far: its character diversity. In past Pokemon games, towns could start to look a little samey, as every character of a single trainer class would have the exact same features copy-pasted. That has started to change in more recent games, but Scarlet and Violet took a bit of a step backward by dressing most of its cast in samey uniforms, again creating the illusion that every character looked the same.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/14/20251014074506-01k7h8haxt6zfk1n7n6s1zb79w-1760445984566.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">In Z-A, though, not only do NPCs all have different facial features, their outfits can change things up a bit too.

            <p>
In Crisol: Theater of Idols, you fire bullets of your own blood at frenzied wooden puppets while exploring an island saturated with unpleasant Spanish folklore. As elevator pitches go, I like the immediacy of this one's trade-offs. Blood? But I need that stuff inside my body to convey oxygen and vital nutrients to my trigger fingers. Surely there are other fluids I can fill the bullets with. I get that it would prompt the less sexy kind of revulsion, but Norman Reedus <em>did</em> get away with lobbing cannisters of piss and dribble in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a>.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Crisol has a demo on Steam as part of this week's Steam Nexus Festering. Being a fan of hideous marionettes and foetid folkliquorice, I was about to download it. But then my powerful journalistic brain kicked into gear, and I realised that I'd already tried Crisol at this year's Summer Game Fest. My belated verdict from back then: the doomy circus setting and scarlet-gold aesthetics are appetising, but the controls are tanky in a way that is sometimes more annoying than thrilling. It's also a bit creaky and forced in terms of scenario design.
</p>
<p>
Here is one such scenario, which also appears in the below trailer: at one point I had to pass through a tumbledown high street area patrolled by a colossal and unkillable jugger-puppet. This objective saw me alternating between crouch-walking through the mud and ducking into shops along the route to scoop up some consumables. Then I came to a gate I had to raise by laboriously turning a crank for a moment or two. Doing this locked me in place, unable to keep an eye on the street behind. You get the idea.

<p>
It took me three attempts, with the jugger-puppet chasing me back indoors each time. While hiding inside shops, I had the pleasure of staring absently at the creature's crotch while it bellowed hoarse threats through windows that were surely large enough to admit its frame. After 20 seconds of this, the roided-up Guignol would go back to its patrol. I guess this kind of ponderous scripting makes sense when you're actually held together by strings. 
</p><p>
Cristol's overall tone veers a bit uncertainly between Guillermo del Torrid art-housiness and House of the Dead. Still, I quite like the wincing restraint imposed by the literal plasma gun gimmick, and the associated pressure to delve around in the crannies for sources of blood besides yourself. I like the webbed and brassy lustre of the vampiric weapons, especially the shotgun, with its double-barrelled syringes. And I quite enjoy the puppets, even though they are functionally <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-4">Resident Evil 4</a>'s villagers in their plodding relentlessness and susceptibility to limbshots. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1790930/Crisol_Theater_of_Idols/">Find the demo here</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Misplacing your keys five minutes prior to when you must go, desperately searching for your wallet in advance of a meeting, or walking up to baggage claim and questioning which carousel will produce your suitcase – these daily terrors have an easy cure. Good news is, Apple’s <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/">AirTag 4-pack has reached its lowest price ever at $64 at Amazon, down from its regular $99 price</a>. That’s $16 per tracker which is less expensive than the price of replacing a lost wallet and the hassle of making a lost luggage claim. In the single-pack size, the solo AirTag can be found at its lowest price ever too at $24, down from $29.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See 4-pack AirTags at Amazon</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4215/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See Single AirTag at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The brilliance behind AirTags is their compatibility with Apple’s current ecosystem. Installation takes quite literally one tap when you press an AirTag close to your iPhone or iPad. The device automatically shows up in your Find My app which you can then assign a name and emoji to. No pairing menus, no setting up an account, no fussy configuration: <strong>In a matter of seconds, that AirTag’s ready to track anything you attach it to</strong>.</p>
<h2>How AirTags Tap Into a Massive Network</h2>
<p>The actual magic occurs via Apple’s <strong>Find My network</strong>&nbsp;which depends on the hundreds of millions of Apple devices globally in order to find your belongings. Here’s the process: your AirTag broadcasts a secure Bluetooth message that can be picked up by Apple devices in close range. Those Apple devices then report the location of your AirTag anonymously back to you via the Find My network. It’s all anonymous and encrypted and therefore no one else can see the location of your AirTag or exploit in an attempt at tracking you. Even Apple can’t see the location of your AirTag or which device assisted in tracking it.</p>
<p>This crowdsourcing model enables AirTags to be extremely efficient in highly populated locations.<strong> Leave the backpack at the popular coffee shop in town and there’s a high possibility an iPhone-carrying person will pass by the backpack in minutes and report its location without ever realizing they assisted</strong>. The network also functions when your AirTag is outside the range of your own devices, which happens to be essential in pinpointing luggage in planes and identifying things left behind while you are moving from point to point.</p>



<p><strong>Precision Finding</strong> goes one better on iPhone 11 and later with Ultra Wideband technology: When you’re near a target item with your AirTag, your iPhone can also report directional arrows and distance in feet and inches, and leads you straight to the item with remarkable precision. Take the example of searching for your buried keys in the couch cushions: Precision Finding lets you know the exact direction in which the keys are and how far away in inches the keys are.</p>
<p>Each AirTag also comes with a <strong>internal speaker that produces a tone when you activate it from the Find My app</strong>. The tone enables you to locate things in close range, such as keys that went down in the space between the car seats or a wallet kept in a coat pocket that hangs in your closet. The speaker produces a tone that can be heard in the next room and enables very swift searches compared with having to search each possible location manually.</p>



<p>Battery life is extraordinarily sensible. The AirTags are powered by a standard <em>CR2032</em> coin cell battery<strong> which lasts around a year</strong> with normal usage. You can buy these batteries anywhere: supermarkets and gas stations and so on. Replacing them only takes a second: push down the stainless steel rear and turn counterclockwise. No spanners required, no shipping devices back to Apple, no annual fees in order for them to stay operational.</p>
<p>At $64 for a set of four AirTags on Amazon, you can protect your most commonly lost belongings without spending too much money. Hook one onto your keys, put one in your wallet, add one in your daily tote and have a fourth for suitcases or seasonal gear.</p>

                <p>Veteran video game developer Tomonobu Itagaki has passed away at the age of 58. Famous for his work on the Dead or Alive fighting game franchise and the revival of Ninja Gaiden in the 2000s, Itagaki's death was confirmed on his <a href="https://www.facebook.com/tomonobu.itagaki/posts/pfbid02kPXD7uXWaU3ZrRTXB1x2kYPH9SXjakibwS2poX8QU6oPXC7w5occ4GuidXECSUpZl" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook profile</a> where he left a final message.</p><p>"Final Words, the flame of my life is about to go out. The fact that this message has been posted means that my time has finally come. I am no longer in this world--I have entrusted someone important to me with this final message," Itagaki's post read (via Facebook translation).</p><p>"My life was a continuous battle which I kept winning. I caused a lot of trouble for others too. I take pride in having fought to the end, and having followed my convictions. I have no regrets, but I am deeply sorry that I could not deliver new works to my fans. I'm sorry. So it goes."</p><p>Itagaki's video game career kicked off in 1992 with Tecmo Super Bowl where he served as a graphics programmer, and in 1996, he rose to fame with the release of Dead or Alive. In 2001, he was placed in charge of Team Ninja--the studio that he founded originally as Tecmo Creative #3 in the '90s--and he led the production on the modern-day revival of Ninja Gaiden. Itagaki also served as both producer and director on multiple games like Dead or Alive Ultimate, Dead or Alive 4, and Ninja Gaiden 2.</p><p>By then, Itagaki had become infamous for not holding back his comments on the state of the video game industry at the time, and he later resigned from Tecmo amidst claims of the company withholding a bonus that he had been promised. He'd later found Valhalla Game Studios and release Devil's Third for the Wii U and PC, but the game was met with negative reviews upon release.</p><p>After leaving Valhalla in 2017, Itagaki returned to video game development with a new studio in 2021, Itagaki Games.

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/switch-2s-first-warhammer-40000-game-isnt-the-one-you-might-expect</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/switch-2s-first-warhammer-40-000-game-isnt-the-one-you-might-expect.1326340/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Switch 1 was home to plenty of <strong>Warhammer 40,000</strong> titles, so it was only a matter of time before Switch 2 got in on the fun. Well, that time is finally upon us, and the first series title on the new hardware is... the classic RPG <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader">Rogue Trader</a>! Wait, that's not <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/warhammer_40000_space_marine_2">Space Marine II</a>.</p>
<p>Yep, there was a part of us that expected to see the immensely popular 2024 shooter as the one to lead the 40k charge on Switch 2, but it looks like we're going for something different.</p>
<p>Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader is a story-rich RPG, where you'll explore the outer space perils of the Koronus Expanse. It boasts all the hallmarks of the genre, with crew-building, tough decisions that have a real effect on the story, and classic isometric turn-based battling. What's more, it seems to do them really rather well.</p>
<p>The game launched on PC, PlayStation and Xbox at the end of 2023 and, while this writer hasn't sampled it himself, it has gone on to rack up almost 15,000 '<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2186680/Warhammer_40000_Rogue_Trader/#app_reviews_hash">Very Positive</a>' reviews on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2186680/Warhammer_40000_Rogue_Trader/">Steam</a>. That's not bad going!</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the game's key features and a handful of screenshots from its Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Explore the Koronus Expanse</strong><br>
Begin your adventure aboard your personal, giant voidship, traveling between the multitude of systems within the Koronus Expanse, a barely charted and incredibly perilous region of space. Despite being considered a backwater of the Imperium, this region encompasses an enormous stretch of the void, filled with dangerous creatures and prodigious opportunities for profit and exploration.<br>
<strong>Gather your Crew<br></strong>Rogue Traders never travel alone. Gather your retinue of righteous heroes, twisted psykers, and perfidious xenos. All of them are ready to follow you into the darkness between the stars. They will offer you counsel, aid you in battle, and allow you to amass ever more power. In return, you can guide them through their own personal journeys, changing their destinies forever.<br>
<strong>Your Decisions Matter<br></strong>During quests show your subjects mercy or disdain, stay faithful to the God-Emperor, or consort with enemies of Mankind - your every decision and every act, even in character creation, is changing the in-game open world and those who inhabit it.<br>
<strong>Plan your Actions Carefully</strong><br>
Slaughter the enemies of Mankind in a fully-fledged isometric turn-based tactical combat. Take advantage of cover, the environment, and careful positioning to overpower your enemies. When that is not enough - use your companion`s powerful abilities to turn the tide of battle and achieve victory even in the direst of situations. Our video game adaption of the classic Rogue Trader ruleset allows an enormous number of possibilities for you to explore.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>OwlCat hasn't provided a specific release date for this one just yet outside of the teasing "coming soon", but we'll be keeping an eye out over the coming months for more info.</p>

            <p>Sonic Rumble will finally be released next month, following a number of delays.</p>
<p>The mobile and PC party game from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/angry-birds">Angry Birds</a> maker Rovio was originally intended for a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-rumble-segas-mobile-party-game-from-angry-birds-studio-delayed-into-spring">release last winter</a>, then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/segas-mobile-party-game-sonic-rumble-lands-release-date">delayed until May</a>, then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/angry-birds-maker-and-sega-delay-sonic-rumble-release-once-again">delayed once more</a> without a launch date.</p>
<p>Now it's finally due in November and it's "seriously evolved" over the last few months following various playtests. "This extra development time allowed us to roll out several, player-focused updates that refined the core game from the ground up," the developer said in a <a href="https://sonicrumble.sega.com/en/news/000209/">new blog post</a>. "The goal? A super smooth, intense, and incredibly fun game right from the jump."</p>

<p>Specifically, Rovio has updated the game in three key areas.</p>
<p>Firstly, the core of the game has been made deeper and more dynamic with iconic skills, new stages, and new game modes. Secondly, the player onboarding journey has been revamped and the UI has been drastically improved.</p>
<p>Lastly, the cosmetic and character progression systems have been updated and simplified to ensure "every unlock feels meaningful and impactful". The rewards and shop systems have also been fine-tuned.</p>
<p>"These adjustments were key in making Sonic Rumble awesome for the long haul," said the developer. "Even as we get ready for launch, our commitment continues and there will be plenty more to come!"</p>
<p>While the blog post doesn't provide a specific date, the iOS App store lists 30th November as the expected release. It's available to <a href="https://sonicrumble.sega.com/special/register/en/?referrer=singular_click_id%3D2aecdffa-3ac6-4708-b5e2-a8d8d0794317">pre-register now</a> and will be coming to iOS, Google Play, and Steam.</p>
<p>As the new trailer (above) shows, Sonic Rumble is a battle royale party game for up to 32 players online competing in minigames and platforming challenges for rings. Think <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fall-guys">Fall Guys</a> with a blue blur twist - I think it could be a lot of fun!</p>
<p>This will also be the first new game from Rovio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-buys-angry-birds-maker-rovio-for-625m">since it was acquired by Sega</a> back in 2023 for £625m.</p>
