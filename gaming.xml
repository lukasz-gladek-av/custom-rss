            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/2/24311337/roblox-robux-app-store-fees-worth-more-party<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Roblox is now incentivizing users to buy its in-game currency, Robux, on platforms that won’t take app store fees. You can now get up to 25 percent more Robux if you purchase the currency through gift cards, on your computer, or on the web, <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/users-can-enjoy-up-to-25-more-robux-on-computer-web-and-gift-cards/3275270">according to a developer forum post</a> from last week.</p><p>As for how that might look in practice, here’s some examples from the post:</p><div><blockquote><p>For example, users who purchase US $9.99 worth of Robux with a gift card, computer, or web would have originally received 800 Robux but will now receive 200 extra Robux or a total of 1000 Robux to spend on passes, in-experience items, and avatar items. Users who purchase a $10 gift card may now receive up to 1000 Robux when previously they would have received 800 Robux.</p></blockquote></div><div><figcaption><em>Roblox’s </em><a href="https://www.roblox.com/upgrades/robux"><em>Robux purchase page</em></a><em> also shows the additional Robux you’ll get by buying on your computer or the web.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Roblox</cite></p></div><p>Roblox says this isn’t a holiday promotion. “We plan to keep this new pricing in place globally beyond the holiday season,” according to an FAQ in the post. And if you redeem a gift card on a computer or on the web that purchased before the change was announced, you’ll get the higher amount of Robux, too.</p><p>The company gave a very vague answer its own FAQ about why the change only applies to Robux purchased via gift cards, computer, and web:</p><div><blockquote><p><strong>Why is the new pricing only available for gift cards and on computer and web?</strong></p><p>We’re always looking for opportunities to share more with our community, on all platforms and we’ll keep you updated on channels where the opportunity becomes available.</p></blockquote></div><p>But it seems likely that Roblox wants users to buy Robux through those channels to avoid losing money to fees taken by app stores and game console stores. And Roblox isn’t the only company to do something like this; YouTube Premium <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/28/24166546/subscribing-to-stuff-from-your-iphone-is-a-waste-of-money">costs more</a> when you subscribe via the iOS app, for example.</p><p>Today, Roblox also announced its <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2024/12/join-the-party-on-roblox">new Party tool</a> to help users more easily hang out and communicate on the platform. Up to six people can be in a Party, though they only support text chat to start — voice chat will arrive in “the coming months.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/is-path-of-exile-2-cross-platform-crossplay-cross-progression-explained/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Path of Exile 2 is backed up by a silly amount of content to explore. It would make sense that PoE 2 can be played across different platforms and give you the option to transfer your progress from platform to platform. It’s never this easy though, so let’s dissect Path of Exile 2’s cross-platform features from possible crossplay to cross-progression.</p>



<p>People assume Path of Exile 2’s similarities to Diablo 4 means it surely has to share the same network features. But life is never that simple, and just because Diablo 4 has crossplay and cross-progression, doesn’t mean Grinding Gear Games’ long-awaited sequel does. It makes me wonder why these functionalities aren’t uniform, but I digress.</p>



<p>Path of Exile has the potential to wow gamers as 2024 draws to a close, and prioritizing cross-platform connectivity would be beneficial.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-path-of-exile-2-crossplay">Is Path of Exile 2 Crossplay?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Tag team turmoil. Credit to Grinding Gear Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Path of Exile 2 most definitely has crossplay across all release platforms.</strong></p>



<p>If you have any doubts, let me shut them down by telling you it’s developer Grinding Gear Games who confirmed the wonderful news. In the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUUXKN7Kh9Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Path of Exile 2 Console Announcement Trailer</a>, appearing in large letters halfway through the trailer, it simply says, “<strong>Cross-play.</strong>” </p>



<p>A one-word answer tells us everything we need to know.</p>



<p>In short, if you’re on PlayStation, you can head into battle with Xbox and PC players, and vice versa. This is possible too as Path of Exile 2 has already assured the community of full <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-path-of-exile-2-have-co-op-multiplayer-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiplayer and co-op</a> integration during Early Access—and likely beyond.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-path-of-exile-2-have-cross-progression">Does Path of Exile 2 have cross-progression?</h2>



<p>We’re two for two as <strong>Path of Exile has also cross-progression</strong>—a detail once again confirmed by the game’s creator.</p>



<p>Tick all the boxes, give us your best grin, and choose your favorite <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-classes-are-available-in-path-of-exile-2-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Path of Exile 2 class</a> with the knowledge your saved data is transferable between platforms. The console trailer also flashes up “Cross-progression” a few seconds after the crossplay confirmation, ensuring flexibility for all. </p>



<p>So, if you’re enjoying the free-to-play adventure game on PS5, and want to continue your adventure on PC, cross-platform cross-progression allows this seamlessly. You save your data on one format, turn it off, load up PoE 2 on another piece of hardware, and you pick up where you left off.</p>



<hr>



<p>Let us know if you intend to take full advantage of these handy qualities. Also, boost your PoE 2 knowledge by knowing the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-path-of-exile-2-pc-system-requirements-minimum-recommended-specs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC requirements</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-can-you-play-path-of-exile-2-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to play Early Access</a>.</p>

Drew, who divulges new information about the midseason update for Zombies. The developer reveals Citadelle des Morts contains a big focus on magic, and the map's unique Wonder Weapons will be four elemental swords. Drew describes the map as being large, but it does feature a lot of claustrophobic spaces within the castle.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to Citadelle des Morts, the Tesla Storm field upgrade and Vulture Aid perk returns from past Zombies modes. Players will also have a new ammo mod and 18 new augments to unlock.</p><p dir="ltr">Kevin Drew confirms some quality-of-life changes for the big Zombies update as well. This includes reduced Mangler spawns at mid-to-high rounds, as later rounds of Zombies are currently flooded with Manglers beyond round 25, making high-round attempts very frustrating for players. Treyarch is also including a cap on active Manglers up to Round 100.</p><p dir="ltr">Currently, the Vermin and Parasite rounds of Zombies take a long time to complete due to slow-spawning enemies, but Drew revealed the special rounds will become shorter after the update.</p><p dir="ltr">Treyarch says more Zombies details will be revealed with the Season 1 Reloaded patch notes, which should arrive closer to the big update.</p><p dir="ltr">For more on Zombies, Citadelle des Morts's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-zombies-citadelle-des-morts-trailer-brings-back-a-familiar-face/1100-6528064/">first trailer can be seen here</a>. The cinematics also set up a narrative that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/past-call-of-duty-zombies-storylines-will-collide-in-black-ops-6-dlc/1100-6528073/">merge storylines from Treyarch's previously unconnected Zombies storylines</a>.</p>

Nothing coded," <a href="https://x.com/ImKeithDavid/status/1862258022627852457" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">he said.</a></p><p>David voiced the Arbiter in 2004's Halo 2, reprising the role in 2007's Halo 3 and 2015's Halo 5: Guardians. He's also known in the world of video games for voicing David Anderson in the Mass Effect series and as the self-referencial Vice President Keith David in Saints Row IV. This year, David took over for the late Lance Reddick as the voice of Commander Zavala in Destiny 2.</p><p>Also on social media, David said he understands if people don't believe him, but he maintains that he <a href="https://x.com/ImKeithDavid/status/1862305036321378387" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">does not know about any future Halo games and has not signed an NDA.</a> Instead, he's waiting to hear from Microsoft, and went on to say he'd love for one of the new Halo games to be an <a href="https://x.com/ImKeithDavid/status/1861942846338809878" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arbiter spin-off.</a></p><p>Outside of Halo and video games in general, David is known for voicing the Disney villain Dr. Facilier from The Princess and the Frog, along with his hundreds of appearances for film and TV in projects like Armageddon, The Thing, They Live, and Platoon, among numerous others.</p><p>In other Halo voice actor news, it recently came to light that Microsoft was apparently thinking about parting ways with Master Chief voice actor Steve Downes and Cortana actress Jen Taylor for Halo 4. However, Downes said Microsoft decided to hire him and Taylor again <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/master-chief-actor-says-halo-4-almost-recast-his-role-and-cortanas-with-new-voice-actors/1100-6528030/" data-ref-id="1100-6528030">after test audiences didn't like what they heard</a> from the actors hired to replace them.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDgR1FRJnF8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FDgR1FRJnF8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Earlier this year, Microsoft announced that 343 Industries had changed names to Halo Studios and that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-halo-games-project-foundry-unreal-engine-5-when-to-expect-them/1100-6527083/" data-ref-id="1100-6527083">multiple new Halo games were in the works</a> and are being made in Unreal Engine 5. None of the games have been announced, though. So far, Microsoft has only released footage from a demo called Project Foundry that aims to show off what is possible with Halo running on Epic's Unreal Engine.</p><p>The latest Halo game was 2021's Halo: Infinite, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-infinite-becomes-biggest-halo-launch-of-all-time/1100-6499962/" data-ref-id="1100-6499962">debuted to record-breaking numbers thanks to Game Pass but has since cooled off.</a></p><p>Microsoft's new Halo leadership is attempting to distance itself from Halo Infinite, saying the way that game was developed represented the "last remnant" of how Halo games were made. "That was our recipe. And what we're doing right now is changing our recipe," <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-halo-games-project-foundry-unreal-engine-5-when-to-expect-them/1100-6527083/" data-ref-id="1100-6527083">the studio said about its future projects.</a></p>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stalker-2">Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a> is reportedly  being targeted by a Russian disinformation campaign falsely claiming the post-apocalyptic shooter scans players' computers in order to help the Ukranian government "locate citizens suitable for mobilisation".
</p>
<p>
As <a href="https://www.404media.co/stalker2-disinformation/">reported by 404 Media</a>, the claims have been made in a one-minute video - stamped with a fake Wired watermark, but in reality unconnected to the publication - that's being circulated on social media sites including Telegram and sent directly to journalists' inboxes.
</p>
<p>
The video falsely asserts "an embedded program was discovered in [Stalker 2]'s code that collects player data and transmits it to [developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/gsc-game-world">GSC Game World</a>]'s servers". It's claimed this data - said to include the device name, IP address, and the current location of the player - is "transmitted every second" without the user's knowledge and handed to the Ukranian government, because GSC "made a deal with the state" in order to secure funding for Stalker 2. "It's better to play using a VPN or boycott this game for your own safety", the video concludes.

<p>
404 Media says the video bears the hallmarks of an ongoing Russian disinformation campaign, previously dubbed Operation Matryoshka, intended to flood social media and journalists' inboxes with "false stories that usually paint NATO countries and Ukraine in a bad light, waste reporters' time, and make people distrust news outlets more broadly." Eurogamer has contacted GSC for comment on the video currently being circulated.
</p><p>
As to why Stalker 2 is now being targeted by a disinformation campaign, that's likely down to the game having become something a symbol of Ukranian resilience during Russian's invasion of the country (development has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-documentary-shares-personal-stories-from-development-against-the-backdrop-of-war">continued throughout the Russian bombardment</a>, with some developers remaining in Kyiv while others have relocated to Prague), coupled with its recent high-profile - and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-has-sold-1-million-copies-so-far">enormously successful</a> - launch across Xbox Series X/S and PC.
</p>
<p>
This isn't the first time Stalker 2 has been targeted by Russian groups either. The Russian government previously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ukrainian-developer-stalker-2s-website-blocked-by-russia">blocked Stalker 2's website</a> after GSC posted a message calling for an end to its brutal invasion of Ukraine, and the studio was later targeted by Russian hackers who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-studio-defiant-in-response-to-claimed-russian-hack">stole Stalker 2 development material</a> and threatened GSC with blackmail. "We are a Ukrainian company," the developer wrote at the time, "and like most Ukrainians, we have experienced many things that are much more terrifying: destroyed houses, ruined lives, and the deaths of our loved ones. Attempts to blackmail or intimidate us are completely futile".
</p>
<p>
Stalker 2 received a solid critical reception when it launched last week, despite its significant technical issues - Eurogamer called it a "compelling and often busted survival shooter that frustrates and satisfies at alternating pitch" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review">our three star review</a>. Since then, GSC has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-dev-acknowledges-rough-edges-says-its-monitoring-feedback">pledged to fix Stalker 2's "rough edges"</a>, starting with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyls-first-patch-is-here-featuring-over-650-fixes">patch addressing over 650 issues</a>.

Some do have the Heavy Finishes Chain, but can only follow up with a Heavy Crush combo.</p><p>The inputs for the initial Rush Chain depend on the character. Some might need only one pair of Rush Attack and Ki Blast inputs (X/Y and Square/Triangle for Xbox and PlayStation respectively), while others might need four of the former. Delta Heavy Finish is thankfully the same no matter the fighter: <strong>Once your opponent is stunned by the Rush Chain, quickly tilt the left stick up and press Ki Blast, followed by two Rush Attack inputs.</strong> Perform it quickly enough and you’ll see your character dish out a three-part Vanish combo that ends with a Ki Blast to send the target flying. Make sure to use the entire input chain. The opponent will recover very quickly if you end the chain early.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-rush-super-landing-guide-1851673589&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-rush-super-landing-guide-1851673589"><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em>’s Rush Supers Can Be A Super-Rush Once Mastered</a></span></p><p>A notable difference from the original Tri-Attack in previous games is that this newer version ends with a launcher instead of slamming the target downward. This is reminiscent of the Delta Combination attacks from prior titles, which could be why it’s called Delta Heavy Finisher. This change lets you follow up on the final hit just like any other launcher. A Dragon Smash works just as well as more Vanishing Attacks or a Lightning Attack.

Helldivers 2 has the phrase "it's about freedom," for example. FInal Fantasy 7 has the phrase "it's about fantasy." And Bloodborne, as mentioned, has the phrase "it's about persistence."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The gothic horror role-playing game also ends the special, two minute long trailer, which some fans think adds further weight to the significance of its involvement.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It could be a simple reference to Bloodborne being a challenging game which requires persistence to conquer, of course, but as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bloodborne-announces-maintenance-scheduled-for-playstations-30th-anniversary-and-as-youd-expect-fans-are-struggling-to-cope">a bizarrely timed maintenance period is also scheduled for the exact 30th anniversary date</a> of December 3, fans are crossing their fingers and donning their leather hats in anticipation of a long-awaited remaster or sequel announcement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Ending this video on Bloodborne truly is something," said @mathijnd on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkmonzpHVRg&amp;ab_channel=PlayStation" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a>. "It's about persistence," said @davgil47. "That Bloodborne clip has a double meaning. They know we've been asking."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A screenshot of the Bloodborne clip is also at the top of the game's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bloodborne/comments/1h4x6cn/playstation_30th_anniversary_video_ended_with/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a> page, and has more than 3,000 upvotes despite the trailer being just two hours old. "I know we’re joking," EdGeater said. "But this is actually the first time in my memory that Sony put Bloodborne in a sizzle reel."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"They're doing this on purpose now," said another user. "It's a sign! The key to Bloodborne 2 is persistence," said someone else. "Saying 'it’s about persistence' on the Bloodborne part feels like a targeted attack on the community," another comment reads. "The light doesn't match the original game fight," pointed out someone else. "I'm wondering if this means something."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Similar sentiments can be seen all over social media, but fans will just have to wait until tomorrow, December 3, to see whether an announcement comes. Bloodborne launched on March 24, 2015 and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/24/bloodborne-review">is easily one of the most beloved PlayStation 4 games</a>, but developer FromSoftware has moved on to the likes of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/04/dark-souls-3-review">Dark Souls 3</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/03/21/sekiro-shadows-die-twice-review">Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-review">Elden Ring</a> in the years since, while leaving the Sony-published Bloodborne behind.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans have persisted in asking for a sequel or remaster or remake, however, so will be keeping an eye out tomorrow for any hints at a potential return to Yharnam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony is definitely celebrating the anniversary of PlayStation in other ways, at least, as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-psone-style-playstation-5-and-ps5-pro-as-part-of-30th-anniversary-collection">a range of PSOne themed hardware has also been released</a>.

                <p>As usual, Call of Duty is getting a holiday update, and some of the first details for what's going down in Black Ops 6 have now arrived. As part of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q2r0XSMkcA" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new COD POD from Activision</a>, the company showed off the first look at a holiday-themed makeover coming to Black Ops 6's Nuketown map.</p><p>As you can see, the map has been taken over with festive decorations and is covered in snow.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/lord-of-rings-battle-of-edoras-review-horses-and-pitchforks<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The clash of swords, the thunderous pounding of horses’ hooves - these of the sounds of war in the world of <i>Lord of the Rings</i>. And now, Games Workshop’s releasing a brand new Starter Set for their miniature wargame set in Tolkien’s universe (the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/lord-of-rings-middle-earth-strategy-battle-game-review-spring-2022-releases" rel="nofollow"><i>Middle-Earth Strategy Battle Game</i></a>). Following the story of the upcoming animated feature film, GW sent along a copy for me to review - so check out my thoughts on this epic, massive box in my <i>The Lord of The Rings: The War of the Rohirrim</i> – Battle of Edoras review.</p>

<h2><b>What’s Included in the Battle of Edoras Box?</b></h2>

<p>Battle of Edoras as a Starter Set truly does contain just about everything you need to begin your journey. The official contents are:</p>

<ul><li>Haleth, Prince of Rohan - mounted and on foot</li>
	<li>Háma, Prince&nbsp;of Rohan - mounted and on foot</li>
	<li>24 Rohan Warriors</li>
	<li>Wulf, High Lord of the Hill Tribes - mounted and on foot&nbsp;</li>
	<li>General Targg - mounted and on foot</li>
	<li>24&nbsp;Hill Tribesmen</li>
	<li>Two Rohan Houses</li>
	<li>The full hardcover 176-page rules manual</li>
	<li>48-page scenario and profiles booklet</li>
	<li>Double-sided 3’x3’ playmat, two reference guides, a range ruler, and 12 dice</li>
</ul><p>As you can see, this is a truly robust starter set, which you'd expect to see for its $220 USD MSRP. Now let's get into the box contents, the new rules of the game, and more!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battle-of-edoras-starter-set-pitched-battle-2.jpeg?itok=G6ScBJtD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battle-of-edoras-starter-set-pitched-battle-2.jpeg?itok=Uduml4Vd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The forces of Rohan square off against the Hill Tribesman in this epic showdown, featuring terrain from Battle Systems.</figcaption></figure><h2><b>How Does It Play/New Rules</b></h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-us/articles/2ifuwrwc/middle-earthtm-strategy-battle-game-key-changes-in-the-new-edition/" rel="nofollow">official article breaking down many of the larger changes</a> to the new set should serve as a go-to resource for tracking everything this new edition brings, but to quickly run through the details:</p>

<h3>New Profiles Break Things Up, Simplify</h3>

<p>Each and every character and unit in the game has undergone a significant change to their profiles. Some of these changes include new and different abilities, special gear, etc., while other changes are foundational to the very construction of the profile itself.</p>

<p>For instance, Courage is now a target number to beat, vs. a static ability. And the Shoot Value and Fight Value have been broke up into their own categories, which all just serve to simplify the process. In my opinion, <i>Middle-Earth Strategy Battle Game</i> has always been on the crunchier side of things - and there are still charts to consult based on the strength of weapons, etc. - but the changes here do hint at making the game more approachable.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battle-of-edoras-pretty-image.jpeg?itok=o9z_MXci 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battle-of-edoras-pretty-image.jpeg?itok=Do4oxLLT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The forces of Rohan clash with General Targg and Wulf, High Lord of the Hill Tribes. Image: Games Workshop.</figcaption></figure><h3>Intelligence Hints At Narrative Moments</h3>

<p>There’s a new stat on the profile of all units and characters: the Intelligence stat! This stat feels like a flexible stat that can be used in a variety of ways throughout the gameplay. For instance, the rulebook presents two opportunities: in one, a character is trying to free a relic from the ground and must pass an Intelligence check. In the other, Frodo’s been attacked by a special power from the Nazgul that forces him to make an Intelligence test to avoid being affected by it.</p>

<p>Here’s why I love this new addition, I think it truly does a lot of work to add the potential for narrative moments into the game. For a wargame based on some of the best storytelling of the twentieth century, it can sometimes feel like - aside from warriors squaring off 1v1 - it’s light on narrative touches. But now, with Intelligence, there’s so much open room in abilities, narrative play scenarios, and more to add even more storytelling moments and flourishes.</p>

<p>Beyond these two major changes, there are small tweaks and what I would call “quality of life improvements” to be found across the ruleset. Nothing here is earthshakingly different from the previous edition, but it feels very tightened up and tidy.</p>

<h3><b>The Models Included In The Battle for Edoras Box</b></h3>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battle-of-edoras-starter-set-good-heroes_0.jpg?itok=JNUICBNd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battle-of-edoras-starter-set-good-heroes_0.jpg?itok=M530e8q9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The princes of Rohan are shown here, both mounted and unmounted, in front of Battle Systems scenic terrain.</figcaption></figure><p>At this point - fair warning - there might be some slight spoilers for <i>The War of the Rohirrim</i> - at least in the fact that character’s crucial to the film will be discussed here. Nothing major, but worth shouting out.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The models included in the box feel very evenly balanced against one another, with all four good and evil heroes shining in their own light. To start, there’s Haleth, Prince of Rohan. He’s a strong fighter with three attacks, and comes mounted on an armored horse, and his special ability allows him to re-roll failed Wound rolls when he’s outnumbered.</p>

<p>Next up is Haleth’s brother, Háma, Prince of Rohan. He’s equipped with a bow, hand weapons, and is an expert rider on his mount. Though he only has two attacks, his special ability allows him to spend Will Points to allow nearby Rohan warriors to re-roll Wound Rolls of 1.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battle-of-edoras-starter-set-evil-heroes.jpeg?itok=5QHVwPSQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battle-of-edoras-starter-set-evil-heroes.jpeg?itok=qBAU-yP3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Evil Heroes, Wulf and General Targg, are seen here mounted and unmounted in front of Battle Systems terrain pieces.</figcaption></figure><p>On the evil side, there’s Wulf, High Lord of the Hill Tribes, who is also a strong fighter with three attacks, comes mounted, and can re-roll a single D6 during the duel roll (and <i>must</i> re-roll To Wound Rolls of natural 1 against an enemy Hero).</p>

<p>Alongside him is General Targg, a strong fighter with the Master of Battle ability (which lets him copy another friendly hero’s Heroic Action on a roll of 4+), and a more strategic ability that allows other friendly Dunland Warrior models near him to re-roll To Wound rolls of 1 if you’ve given priority to your opponent.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rohan-warriors.jpg?itok=LvmBks9O 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rohan-warriors.jpg?itok=FJk_h4LJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Battle of Edoras Rohan Warriors on display</figcaption></figure><p>The additional Rohan Warriors and Hill Tribesman are also fun, if standard, additions to the kit - and make up the great bulk of the forces. Rohan has armor, and the Hill Tribesman can bring flaming brands (which are pretty potent weapons with the Terror (Cavalry) and Terror (Beast) abilities). Overall, as you might expect, the Rohan Warriors have slightly better defense, and they also have a better Intelligence Score.</p>

<h2><b>The Look of the Models of Battle of Edoras</b></h2>

<p>The models included in this set all look really nice. While the Rohan Warriors are fairly standard in terms of their design and sculpt, I like the look of them all on foot. When I get these painted up in their traditional Rohan colors, I think they’re really going to stand out with their uniform design and long, pointed spears.</p>

<p>Contrasting them nicely is the chaotic look of the Hill Tribesman. With burning brands, pitchforks, and other improvised weapons, and with all of their models sculpted to look like they’re mid-run, there’s a kind of wild energy to these models that I really like.</p>

That’s my biggest (and really only) complaint with this set - there’s so much gluing of tiny pieces - in a way that feels a little outdated. I shouldn’t have to glue the front of a models face to the back of their head in the year of our Ilúvatar 2024.</p>

<h2><b>Special Note: Easy Rohan Terrain Perfect for Battle of Edoras</b></h2>

<p>I also wanted to take a moment here before the end of the review to make a special callout for one of my all-time favorite terrain solutions, <a href="https://battlesystems.co.uk/product-category/terrain/fantasy/" rel="nofollow">Battle Systems Fantasy Terrain</a>, because it fits so perfectly with the look, feel, and theme of <i>Lord of the Rings</i> and <i>War of the Rohirim. </i>This hard cardboard terrain, which comes pre-printed with lush imagery, snaps together easily, is highly modular, and takes a fraction of the time to set up.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battle-of-edoras-starter-set-battle-systems-terrain-showpiece.jpg?itok=DnL55YtR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battle-of-edoras-starter-set-battle-systems-terrain-showpiece.jpg?itok=6vbo-jZc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This setpiece from the Fantasy Village Battle Systems terrain kit adds some verticality and vivid design to the game.</figcaption></figure><p>Whenever I’m playing a skirmish wargame like <i>MeSBG</i>, <i>Frostgrave</i>, and <i>Warcry</i>, etc. I’m almost always reaching for this terrain vs. heavier plastic options. And while the terrain you see in my photos is from the Fantasy Village and Ruined Settlement kits, the set that really would be a one-to-one match for Rohan is the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/battle-systems-northern-settlement-and-ruined-monastery-preview" rel="nofollow">Northern Settlement set, which TechRaptor’s own Adam Potts reviewed a few years back</a>.</p>

<p>These pieces are obviously not part of this Starter Set (which comes with sprues for two Rohan Houses - I’ve only built the one so far), but I thought they deserved a callout here for anyone interested in getting into <i>War of the Rohirrim</i>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battle-of-edoras-starter-set-hill-tribesman.jpg?itok=f6PaWl7N 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battle-of-edoras-starter-set-hill-tribesman.jpg?itok=OhPL3yiK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Hill Tribesmen bring a ferociousness to the battlefield.</figcaption></figure><h2><b><i>The Lord of The Rings: The War of the Rohirrim</i></b><b> – Battle of Edoras - Final Thoughts</b></h2>

<p>There’s no other way of putting it - this Starter Kit is a masterpiece and a must-have for newcomers hoping to get into Games Workshop’s <i>Lord of the Rings</i> miniature game. Battle of Edoras is such a hugely robust kit, with over fifty models, to large buildings, the entire core rulebook in hardcover, and more.</p>

<p>The gameplay has been nicely streamlined in ways, though this still isn’t even as simple as <i>Age of Sigmar</i> (which of course has its own moments of crunchiness). So while brand new newcomers to wargaming might feel a bit stumped by the ruleset here and the intricacy of constructing these models, anyone familiar with wargaming at all will fall right in with this Starter Set.</p>

And speaking of expansions, <em>The Storybook Vale</em> hasn’t shied away from adding a wide variety of new meals and new ingredients to make them. One of these ingredients—Salt Crystals— can seem a bit elusive at first, but it’s really not that hard to find.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>That being said, obtaining a full stack of Salt Crystals can be a bit time-consuming, so we’ll tell you where to find this ingredient in <em>The Storybook Vale</em> and how to stock up on it faster.</p><h2 id="h9110"><a id="location"></a>Where To Find Salt Crystals In <em>The Storybook Vale</em></h2><p>If you’ve glanced at Salt Crystals in your collection menu, you’ve no doubt seen that it lists all four sections from the Everafter as locations to obtain the ingredient.

<p>The year isn’t over yet and there are plenty of great games still set to be released before it ends. In this article, we’re bringing you the 10 most promising games of December 2024. The last month of the year can hold some good surprises and, so you don’t have to pick through them one by one, I’ve put them all in this list.</p>



<h2 id="h-10-most-promising-games-of-december-2024">10 Most Promising Games Of December 2024</h2>



<h3 id="h-infinity-nikki-december-5">Infinity Nikki – December 5</h3>



<p><em>PS5, PC, Android, iOS</em></p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Infinity Nikki - Gameplay Overview Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zP7dLsL1b6M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Developed by Infold Games, Infinity Nikki is an open-world game that follows a gacha structure similar to Genshin Impact.</p>



<p>One of the game’s main differentiators is its dress mechanic, which profoundly alters the gameplay. Some dresses allow Nikki to float, others reduce her size, others allow her to slide and so on.</p>



<p>Unlike games such as Genshin Impact and Wuthering Waves, Infinity Nikki focuses on platforming and relaxing activities such as fishing, looking after animals and collecting insects.</p>



<h3 id="h-ufl-december-5">UFL – December 5</h3>



<p><em>PS5, Xbox Series</em></p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="UFL™ Insider #7" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J4YFxD21q2E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Popularly referred to as the “Fifa Killer”, UFL is a free soccer game that was conceived with a difficult mission: to stand up to EA Sports FC and eFootball.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/interview-talking-ufl-with-strikerz-ceo-eugene-nashilov/">RELATED: Check our interview with Strikerz CEO, Eugene Nashilov</a></strong></li>
</ul>



<p>It’s not easy being the “new kid on the block” in a genre dominated by two forces. Despite the obstacles, the team is motivated to make the game succeed, attracting the attention and investment of personalities such as CR7.</p>



<h3 id="h-fantasian-neo-dimension-december-5">Fantasian Neo Dimension – December 5</h3>



<p><em>PC, PS4, PS5, Nintendo Switch, Xbox Series</em></p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Fantasian Neo Dimension - Release Date Announcement Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zz37fdo_lqU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Fantasian Neo Dimension is a JRPG led by Hironobu Sakaguchi and Nobuo Uematsu, two names that practically solidified the genre around the world.</p>



<p>For those who don’t know, Hironobu Sakaguchi is considered the father of the Final Fantasy franchise. In the story, we follow the protagonist Leo on an inter-dimensional adventure to save the Earth from Mechteria, a mechanical infection that steals the emotions and lives of humans.</p>



<h3 id="h-delta-force-december-5">Delta Force – December 5</h3>



<p><em>PC</em></p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Delta Force | Technical Test | Official New Map &quot;Tower of Babel&quot; Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/16AXLgniZFU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>On December 5, Delta Force will receive what the studio considers to be a global open beta for everyone. However, as progress will be maintained, we can consider this to be a PC release.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-delta-force/">RELATED: Everything we know about Delta Force</a></strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The console versions will arrive in early 2025. The game is being very well received by the community, featuring both PvE modes, such as the campaign that reimagines the same Black Hawk Down campaign from 2003, and PvP modes such as Havoc Warfare, where 32-player matches take place.</p>



<h3 id="h-marvel-rivals-december-6">Marvel Rivals – December 6</h3>



<p><em>PC, PS5, Xbox Series</em></p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Marvel Rivals | Stars Aligned - Official Launch Date Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a49DJ2bj9Gs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Marvel Rivals is a multiplayer game along the lines of Overwatch. The big difference here is that the playable characters are part of the Marvel universe.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-marvel-rivals-maps-game-modes/">RELATED: All Marvel Rivals Modes &amp; Maps</a></strong></li>
</ul>



<p>At launch, there will be dozens of playable characters, ranging from well-known names such as Spider-Man, Hulk and Thor to heroes unknown to the general public, such as Luna Snow.</p>



<h3 id="h-path-of-exile-2-december-6">Path of Exile 2 – December 6</h3>



<p><em>PC, PS5, Xbox Series</em></p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Path of Exile 2: Early Access Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0VZsq_vJjGk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Path of Exile 2 is coming to consoles and PC in early access format. The game has everything it takes to be the definitive aRPG, with hundreds of hours of content and thousands of options when it comes to customizing builds.</p>



<ul>

<p>If you like games like Diablo and Last Epoch, you can’t pass up Path of Exile 2.</p>



<h3 id="h-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-december-9">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle – December 9</h3>



<p><em>PC, Xbox Series</em></p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Gameplay Deep Dive - Indiana Jones and the Great Circle" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vujiFT4cQm8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle promises to be the best game ever created about one of the most iconic characters in the history of entertainment.</p>



<p>Developed by MachineGames, the game will put players in Indy’s shoes on an adventure full of dangers, puzzles and, of course, breathtaking scenery!</p>



<p>At first, the game will only be released on Xbox Series and PC. The PS5 version will arrive months later, in April.</p>



<h4 id="h-mighty-morphin-power-rangers-rita-s-rewind-december-10">Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita’s Rewind – December 10 </h4>



<p><em>PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox Series e Nintendo Switch</em></p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers: Rita's Rewind | Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pgm1RkQgp5E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Time for nostalgia! There’s nothing more vintage than MMPR: Rita’s Rewind. The game tells the origin story that made the eyes of several generations light up.</p>



<p>The brawler was developed by Digital Eclipse, the team responsible for the excellent TMNT: The Cowabunga Collection.</p>



<p>In the game, you’ll be able to face various enemies and classic bosses from the franchise, such as General Goldar, and all with the possibility of playing in local co-op or online with friends. If you consider yourself a Power Rangers fan, it’s impossible not to be excited about this game!</p>



<h4 id="h-legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-1-amp-2-remastered-december-10">Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1 &amp; 2 Remastered – December 10</h4>



<p><em>PS4, PS5, PC, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series</em></p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Legacy of Kain Soul Reaver 1-2 Remastered - First Reveal | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7pRyL8y7vZ4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>After many years of requests from the community, Legacy of Kain is returning. The two Soul Reaver games will be remastered, bringing improvements in texture, resolution, audio and gameplay.</p>



<p>It’s the perfect opportunity to reminisce about these classics, or, if you’ve never played them, to have that first contact with two games that marked an entire generation and feature many brilliant mechanics.</p>



<h4 id="h-the-spirit-of-the-samurai-december-12">The Spirit of the Samurai – December 12</h4>



<p><em>PC</em></p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Spirit of the Samurai | Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yYMznGwZB1M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Developed by Digital Mind Games, The Spirit of the Samurai is a 2D action game made in stop motion. Yes, you didn’t get it wrong.</p>



<p>The artistic style chosen by the studio gives the game a great air of originality. The story follows Takeshi, a samurai who must stop an Oni who commands an army of the undead.</p>



<p>The game is heavily inspired by Japanese folklore, featuring a rich lore of the country’s mythology. In addition to Takeshi, at certain points you control Kodama, a brave spirit and Chisai, a warrior cat.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/blizzard%E2%80%99s-pulling-of-warcraft-i-ii-tests-gog%E2%80%99s-new-preservation-program.1049889/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/blizzards-pulling-of-warcraft-i-ii-tests-gogs-new-preservation-program/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>GOG's version goes a bit beyond the classic versions that were on sale on Blizzard.net. Beyond the broad promise that "This is the best version of this game you can buy on any PC platform," GOG has made specific tweaks to the networking code for&nbsp;<em>Warcraft I</em>, and fixed up the DirectX wrapper for&nbsp;<em>Warcraft II</em> to improve its scaling on modern monitor resolutions.</p>
<p>It's quite a novel commitment, keeping non-revenue-generating games playable for buyers, even after a publisher no longer makes them available for sale. The&nbsp;Warcraft titles certainly won't be the only games for which publisher enthusiasm lags behind GOG and its classic gamers.</p>
<p>As noted at the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/gogs-preservation-program-is-the-drm-free-store-refocusing-on-the-classics/">Preservation Program's launch</a>, for some titles, GOG does not have the rights to modify a game's build, and only its original developers can do so. So if GOG can't make it work in, say, <a href="https://www.dosbox.com/">DOSBox</a>, extraordinary efforts may be required.</p>

<p>Beyond being tied to Blizzard's Battle.net service in perpetuity, there are other reasons&nbsp;<em>Warcraft </em>fans might want to hold onto the originals. Blizzard's 2020 release of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/01/warcraft-iii-reforged-not-the-flavor-of-chaos-we-were-hoping-for/"><em>Warcraft III Reforged</em></a> was widely panned as uneven, unfinished, and in some ways unfair, as it, too, removed the original&nbsp;<em>Warcraft III </em>from stores.&nbsp;<em>Reforged</em> was still in rough shape a year later, leading <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/01/warcraft-iii-reforged-tops-our-list-of-2020s-most-disappointing-video-games/">Ars' list of 2020's most disappointing games</a>. A 2.0 update promised a total reboot, but fans remain torn on the new art styles and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-says-warcraft-3-reforged-20-is-a-fresh-start-but-fans-remain-unconvinced-after-rocky-launch">are somewhat wary</a>.</p>
<p>Then again, you can now select more units in the first two&nbsp;<em>Warcraft</em> games' remasters, and you get "numerous visual updates for the UI."</p>

		<p>As we come to the second anniversary for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/warhammer-40000-darktide">Warhammer 40,000: Darktide</a>, Fatshark has dragged their grimdark co-op shooter back from a difficult initial launch. This week sees the latest free update arrive, Grim Protocols, which kicks off a free new story arc and new Havoc endgame mode, and comes alongside <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/07/warhammer-40000-darktide-washes-onto-ps5-in-december/">the PS5 launch of the game</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Darktide - Havoc Endgame Mode | Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oUzMxKl9qqM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The new Dark Communion mission nudges the overarching story of Darktide along, as Interrogator Rannick sends your team of misfits back to the area nicknamed the Carnival to try and figure out where Chaos-infused Tainted Stimms are coming from. As you get dropped off at a landing pad, it’s pretty damned obvious that it’s the Cathedrum that’s blanketed by a glowing green storm.</p>


<p>The Carnival first appeared as a location with The Traitor’s Curse update for the game’s first anniversary, and Dark Communion picks up on some common threads here, fighting along a different path to reach new areas added onto common spaces. It’s a great-looking location, blending together cyberpunk vibes from the red neon lights that illuminate the market place with the gothic architecture that dominates the Imperium.</p>


<p>It builds up nicely to the final battle at the Cathedrum, as you battle through barriers conjured by cultists to reach and destroy the apparatus that’s producing the tainted Stimms. It’s an abrupt ending though, and it really feels like there’s much more to come.</p>
<p>For long-time players, though, the real draw of this update will be the new Havoc game mode. Pitched as a new endgame that promises to ramp up the challenge higher and higher the more you play, it comes with new modifiers and challenges as you battle at the behest of Commisar Dukane.</p>

<p>At first it won’t necessarily be that stern of a test for you. Running our first mission saw us confronted by certain enemies having Pus-hardened Skin, making them glow green as they could soak up a bit more damage than usual, but there could also be faster-firing enemies, more highly corrupted foes, enemies with head parasites and more thanks to a handful of bespoke mutators. We actually made it through with relative ease –&nbsp;thanks in no small part by Fatshark providing us with some kitted out level 30 characters to play with on this pre-release build –&nbsp;and that gave a false sense of security when hopping back across to try a Maelstrom difficulty mission from the main mission selector… only to get absolutely stomped by multiple boss enemies appearing all at once, tough modifiers and more.</p>
<p>So Havoc starts off easier, but the idea is that it’s more of a challenge mode. As you complete a mission, your ranking increases by one, applying a new baseline difficulty but also giving you a new Havoc Assignment with a randomised mission and mutator to take on, getting incrementally more difficult each time. You can climb up through 40 levels of difficulty, but if you fail, you’ll be stuck at a particular level and can actually slide back a level if you fail three times on the trot – repeating a mission will see enemy spawns re-randomised so that even running the same mission will be a little bit different. Thankfully, assignments are remixed and doled out to the individual, so you can team up with other players or use the party finder to try and find a better configuration if yours is a real stinker (this also allows you to play at both higher and lower levels, depending on the party members).</p>

<p>Of course, it’s not just the glory of the Emperor that will be pushing you to do this. There’s new weapons in the form of the two-handed Power and Force Swords, while the Ogryn is getting a Heavy Stubber (and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1361210/Warhammer_40000_Darktide/">a slightly reworked talent tree</a> that’s being reset for all players).</p>
<p>There’s also the promise of new rewards, with new Havoc-related penances to work through that can net you a Moebian 53rd black set of clothing, frames, titles, and insignia. There’s also weekly reward caches of materials and Mastery XP depending on how you do, and that ties in with a weekly reset of sorts that marks your new highwater mark of difficulty with a Havoc Clearance Level – this determines your new starting assignment, and you can be demoted if you fail to play Havoc from one week to the next.</p>
<p>It’s an interesting new mode, tapping into the need to continually remix the game’s content and provide new ways to keep players engaged once they’ve reached the limits of the main progression and unlocked all those higher tier weapons and abilities.</p>
<p>For me, though, I’ll be heading right back to the very beginning with new characters. This preview was actually my first time playing Darktide, despite it having been on my wishlist ever since launch. With two years of updates and now with the PS5 release, it’s probably in the best spot its ever been, if a bit overwhelming for newcomers to figure out where everything is in the hub area and decide which character to play as. I’m thinking a Zealot, having played here as a standard Veteran. The real question is, do I play on console or PC? And will I be in it for the long haul of levelling and gear, or a quick sprint through the loose story woven through the levels?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/warframe-1999-has-two-novels-worth-of-lines-dedicated-to-romance/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Digital Extremes has hosted its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYHoyHxbj0s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">final devstream for 2024</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/warframe-1999-is-out-this-winter-will-add-romance-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warframe: 1999</a> was understandably the focus of the conversation. The upcoming free update will introduce a full-fledged romance system to Warframe, and Creative Director Rebecca Ford revealed that there will be two novels worth of lines dedicated to the relationship/romance via the new in-game chat system with fellow members of the Hex squad.</p>
<p><em>What we've done with Warframe: 1999 is we've basically tried to make as authentic an experience as possible which is in who are you chatting with in 1999 and how did you chat with them. It lets you connect with the Hex and learn about them, what they like, and what they don't like. It doesn't have to be romantic; you don't even have to do it at all, because the bounties will get you chemistry, but so does this system. Our goals with this system were for it to be really immersive for people who want deeper relationships with the NPCs we make. It gets you a sort of immersive and fictional and deeper way to connect. There's two novels worth of words. The count clocked in today at 166,00 words.</em></p>
<p><em>You have to kind of figure out who they are. You can ask different questions you can learn a little bit about them. For those of you who are into the more character side of our games,&nbsp; there is a bit of an endgame for this system. We're not going to talk too much about it. This isn't a system that's going to have sort of like instant gratification.</em></p>
<p>We also learned that a new 'PvPvE' mode called Faceoff will be added with Warframe: 1999. Eight players will split into two teams and run a friendly competition on opposite sides of Höllvania to take on various objectives for The Hex while fighting off endless enemy waves.</p>
<p>During the match, players can accrue points to unlock Boosts (buffs) for their team and Hindrances (debuffs) for the rival squad to get distinct advantages like guaranteed critical damage against enemies for a limited time, or even send missile strikes to bombard the other team.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Digital Extremes keeps working on the base game, too. The new player experience is being improved with increased capacity for weapon and Warframe slots and the removal of cooldowns for the Master Rank Test on failed completion. In addition to reworking Trinity, Nyx will get a light rework in preparation for her Protoframe debut. Her abilities will receive a user interface visibility overhaul, Mind Control will guarantee radiation damage types, Psychic Bolts will receive two additional bolts, and her Absorb ultimate will receive an overall mobility and damage buff.</p>
<p>Are you looking forward to Warframe: 1999?</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stalker-2-review-flawed-yet-compelling.1049856/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/stalker-2-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In an alternate future, former Soviet scientists inadvertently created a dangerous region filled with mutants and strange phenomena. It has been 15 years since we've last had a chance to step foot in the Zone — in this&nbsp;<em>STALKER 2</em>&nbsp;review, I'll explain how GSC Game World has succeeded (and failed) at bringing this classic survival game into the modern era.</p>

<p><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d17f3e9f-b364-4022-97dc-49c7e0851506" href="https://techraptor.net/games/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl" rel="nofollow"><em>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl</em></a>&nbsp;is the latest entry in a niche subgenre of survival games. As is tradition, players take on the role of someone new to the enigmatic "Zone" — the region surrounding the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant that exhibits strange, physics-defying "anomalies" and is filled to the brim with deadly mutants and even deadlier men.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stalker-2-review-holding-a-bolt-given-to-you-by-richter.jpg?itok=FivDrhfy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stalker-2-review-holding-a-bolt-given-to-you-by-richter.jpg?itok=6nI2Bjs5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A simple bolt is enough to reveal (and in many cases, temporarily disable) the strange anomalies in the Zone.</figcaption></figure><h2>Stepping Into the Zone</h2>

<p>Each&nbsp;<em>STALKER</em>&nbsp;game gives its protagonist a burning motivation to explore the Zone. Our hero "Skif" has managed to sneak in after the Zone quite literally reached out and touched him, depositing a mysterious <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="791ae017-1b00-44d7-b743-dd1d4d274208" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/stalker-2-artifacts" rel="nofollow">artifact</a> in his apartment's laundry basket (and leaving a hole in the wall, to boot).</p>

<p>Skif's naivete and inexperience with the Zone make him a perfect audience surrogate. Neither he nor the player truly knows what to expect, and you're carefully guided through the potential hazards you'll encounter in the first hour of gameplay: strange anomalies, deadly mutants, and merciless bandits.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are several competing factions in the Zone, and your actions and choices could make a faction completely hostile to you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The prologue is very much on rails, but the time after it represents the heart of&nbsp;<em>STALKER 2</em>&nbsp;well — you could opt to head straight to the nearby town of Zalissya, you could chase down some nearby side quests, or you could also disregard these options entirely and start exploring the Lesser Zone region of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c6b0767a-b575-4657-971f-daae39968aae" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/stalker-2-map-and-locations" rel="nofollow">the map</a>&nbsp;on your own.</p>

<p>As someone who played some of the original&nbsp;<em>STALKER: Shadow of Chernobyl</em>, I was initially impressed by&nbsp;<em>STALKER 2's</em>&nbsp;presentation. It&nbsp;seemed to be everything that a fan of the franchise would have wanted: a stable, relatively bug-free representation of the unique&nbsp;<em>STALKER</em>&nbsp;experience in a modern engine. Sadly, that sense of wonder didn't last for long.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stalker-2-review-the-whip-rifle-jammed-due-to-low-durability-in-stalker-2.jpg?itok=5j9b8ejk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stalker-2-review-the-whip-rifle-jammed-due-to-low-durability-in-stalker-2.jpg?itok=_CN64RPl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Low durability causes guns to randomly jam, forcing you to clear the stovepipe before you can shoot again.</figcaption></figure><h2>Flimsy Guns Falling Apart</h2>

<p>The first major issue I noticed with&nbsp;<em>STALKER 2</em>&nbsp;was with its guns. Firing a few dozen rounds would absolutely tank the condition of your firearm. The durability damage to weapons and armor alike is simply far too harsh, especially with legendarily resilient weapons platforms such as the AK series of rifles.</p>

<p>To illustrate this point, one of the final story missions features a running gun battle through a large underground facility. My high-quality, unique sniper rifle was in perfect condition at the outset, and it was practically falling apart at the halfway point of the mission. I had to pick up guns from dead enemies to have a fighting chance.</p>

<p>Adding insult to injury is the need to pay Technicians to maintain and repair your weapon for you. These repair costs were frankly absurd at launch (and have since been toned down in a post-launch patch), but the durability issue remains a seriously annoying problem.</p>

<p>There's no way to repair or maintain your weapons in the field, either, despite the fact that Skif shows off his ability to expertly reassemble an AKM-74S in under a minute during an early-game cutscene. Either the durability of guns needs to be substantially increased or there needs to be a mechanic to repair them a small amount in the field.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stalker-2-review-the-player-equipped-with-a-shotgun-in-front-of-three-dead-bloodsucker-mutants-in-zaton-in-stalker-2.jpg?itok=aIm-W_7s 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stalker-2-review-the-player-equipped-with-a-shotgun-in-front-of-three-dead-bloodsucker-mutants-in-zaton-in-stalker-2.jpg?itok=WNdVty-X 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bloodsuckers are notorious for appearing seemingly from nowhere.</figcaption></figure><h2>Enemy Spawns Are a Farce</h2>

<p>Gun issues aside, I fully embraced the spirit of a clever, cautious Stalker as I explored the Zone. I'd carefully check my corners and sweep rooms before moving forward, lest I be ambushed from behind. Unfortunately, the game was rigged from the start.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>STALKER</em>&nbsp;franchise was once renowned for its "A-Life" system of interacting NPCs. You could be trodding along a relatively safe path and happen upon two groups of men in a gun battle or a group of mutants attacking a lone Stalker. That happens here, but the way these events and NPCs spawn is, frankly, atrocious.</p>

<p>Enemies would simply pop into existence within my line of sight. Sometimes, they would appear within a few meters of me! This didn't always happen, but the game does a poor job of hiding random enemy spawns much of the time.&nbsp;<em>STALKER 2's</em>&nbsp;handling of enemy spawns is downright clumsy.</p>

<p>This is especially frustrating in confined spaces. In one side mission, I went into a junkyard maze of crushed cars. I activated a side objective and was immediately set upon by two groups of bandits, even though I had checked all approaches and there was no one in sight. It shattered my suspension of disbelief then and there.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stalker-2-review-simon-dubny-asking-skif-if-he-is-with-them-or-the-ward-in-stalker-2.jpg?itok=5kTBdihs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stalker-2-review-simon-dubny-asking-skif-if-he-is-with-them-or-the-ward-in-stalker-2.jpg?itok=zkRC6CZC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>At the time, I had no idea which faction was represented by the symbol next to "I'm with you" and I'm still not entirely sure now.</figcaption></figure><h2>Factional Friction</h2>

<p>As with previous&nbsp;<em>STALKER</em>&nbsp;games,&nbsp;<em>STALKER 2</em>&nbsp;requires you to make choices that will affect the world around you and, ultimately, which ending you get. There are several competing factions in the Zone, and your actions and choices could make a faction completely hostile to you. None of this is communicated as clearly as it should be.</p>

<p>For example, some major choices are presented to the player with a unique interface showing a choice on either side. Each choice shows a particular symbol, but there is no easy way to know which faction these symbols represent or what the effects of your actions are on the world, nor is there any way to see your overall standing with a faction.</p>

<p>These same symbols are shown on the major bases (that is to say, towns) on the map. I intuited that the funky B symbol represented the Ward, but what faction is represented by the radiation symbol? How will my choices benefit them or harm them? I had no idea and no real way to find out.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I could imagine asking any character about a particular faction and they'd be able to tell me anything I wanted to know, but that's simply not an option</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Identifying these factions and what their motivations are is difficult, and this has consequences for you. I found myself completely cut off from several major bases simply because I opposed the Ward. In a game with limited fast travel, that made exploring certain regions of the map a downright ordeal.</p>

<p>There is no recorded in-game information for mutants, anomalies, or other zone phenomena, either. I only learned the names of Bloodsuckers and Poltergeists after I killed a truckload of them and happened upon their names through random NPC dialogue or mission objective text.</p>

<p><em>STALKER 2</em>&nbsp;needs&nbsp;a way to clearly find out this information and a section of the PDA to catalog what you've learned about the Zone. I could imagine asking any character about a particular faction and they'd be able to tell me anything I wanted to know, but that's simply not an option. This lack of information made it difficult to truly understand the world I was in.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stalker-2-review-exploring-prypiat-with-a-udp-pistol-and-an-artifact-scanner-equipped-in-stalker-2.jpg?itok=FRMr4OF2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stalker-2-review-exploring-prypiat-with-a-udp-pistol-and-an-artifact-scanner-equipped-in-stalker-2.jpg?itok=PNpv441Z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Overall,&nbsp;<em>STALKER 2</em> does a fine job of bringing the haunting atmosphere of the Zone to life.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>STALKER 2&nbsp;</em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>I spent close to 200 hours thoroughly exploring&nbsp;<em>STALKER 2</em>&nbsp;at a fairly relaxed pace. While it has its flaws, most of these are minor issues that are easily fixable; gun durability could be buffed a bit without too much work, and GSC Game World has already addressed the problem of outrageous repair costs and paltry payouts for mission rewards.</p>

<p>The more substantial issues such as a lack of information about factions or the janky enemy spawns can be fixed, too, although that will probably take a little more time. Thus far, the developers have shown a commitment to ironing out the rough edges and I believe that they'll make the overall experience much smoother in time.</p>

<p>Still, I can't help but love the Zone and its colorful cast of characters. There are no good guys or bad guys, there are just guys, and they all have their own motivations for the actions they take. It's up to you to hear them out and decide which choices will be best for you, the Zone, and all of the odd people (and mutants) who dwell within.</p>

<p>If you can get past these flaws,&nbsp;<em>STALKER 2</em>&nbsp;is a unique flavor of survival game that can be enjoyed by veterans of the franchise and new players alike. If you can't stand the occasional jankiness, though, it would be best to wait a few months and see if GSC Game World can iron out the more serious problems.</p>
