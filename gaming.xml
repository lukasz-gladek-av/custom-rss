            <p>Misbehaving bullets, your hour of reckoning is nigh. A <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> hotfix has been deployed with the goal of stopping you from refusing to register hit damage when you embed yourselves in virtual flesh. Bouncy ladders, your time will likely come soon, as EA's Battlefield Studios are busy trying to work out the arcane secrets of your rubbery rungs.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We're aware of reports of rare cases where bullets may not register damage correctly when hitting enemies," the developers have <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1978400189476896968">just posted</a>, "Following our investigation, we found this was related to certain weapon attachment combinations. A hotfix has been deployed to address known instances."</p>
<p>For those who haven't run into this issue, there've been a bunch of clips shared by players since the weekend in which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-best-weapons-guns">guns</a> have been infected with a bit too much bad guy aim-itis. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> has mechanics in place to ensure you do have to work to get shots on target and do damage, but firing directly at someone and having them brush it off like it's nothing obviously isn't ideal.</p> 
<p>Here's hoping this fix, which follows DICE principal game designer Florian Le Bihan <a href="https://x.com/DRUNKKZ3/status/1977698663427133659">tweeting on Monday</a> that an investigation had commenced, can persuade these tiny hunks of metal to return to work. Unless the devs are hiding the fact they've become sentient and are objecting to the purpose they've been ascribed, in which case I say free the ammo. Independence for peace-loving projectiles, damn the consequences!</p><p>The same applies to the <a href="https://x.com/mokeysniper/status/1977115683839152535">bouncy ladders</a> players have been using to vault themselves around, which Battlefield Studios are <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1977705926476918979">also looking into</a>. If a ladder wishes to experience the joy we have to assume trampolines get from springly sending soldiers skyward, who are we to deny that? Sod the laws of physics and warzone realism. </p>
<p>I look forward to being sniped by someone who's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-backend-tweaks-tune-down-some-sniper-rifles-and-shotguns-as-ea-keep-fiddling-with-little-knobs">had to lead their shot just a little bit more</a> than was required a few days ago for expressing these controversial positions.</p>

            <p>Have you been struggling to hit other players in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>, especially when shooting for extended periods of time? Well, it turns out it may not be a skill issue, as a bug related to bullet dispersion is causing shots to go wide.</p>
<p>It's meant to work is like this. When you shoot an automatic weapon in Battlefield 6 for an extended period of time, the bullets will start to shift away from where your aiming reticle is pointed. This is due to a combination of recoil and random, intended deviations, and is there to prevent people being able to maintain near-perfect accuracy while unloading an entire magazine. It also promotes firing in bursts, which is more realistic and Battlefield-y.</p>
<p>The problem is, even when you do fire in bursts, stopping to allow this weapon bloom to reset, right now that doesn't always happen. As shown in the clip below, the bullet spread you had at the end of your previous burst can remain even after you stop and start firing again, leading to greater inaccuracy. In laymen's terms, your guns may not be as accurate as they should be during persistent firefights.</p>

<p>This was a problem during the Battlefield 6 beta too, and some have speculated this is the same problem from that early version of the game alive and well during Battlefield 6's full launch. However, it turns out this problem is thanks to entirely new bugs.</p>

<p>Principle game designer on Battlefield 6 Florian Le Bihan stated on X: "The Beta bug was actually fixed but we've identified another issue (two in fact) that impacts dispersion/bloom in an unintended way and will cause you to have more dispersion at times," Bihan stated on X. "The team is working on this and we're looking at general balance/tuning of dispersion too."</p><p>Such small problems do have a wider impact on the gameplay experience, especially for more competitive players. However it's worth noting that the Battlefield 6 team has proven especially keen to fix bugs and other issues. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-ladder-launching-one-of-the-games-funnest-bugs-will-soon-be-gone">It was only recently they announced that Ladder Launching will soon be gone</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-issues-fix-for-jump-momentum-bug-and-is-monitoring-breakthrough-player-counts">various movement techniques that proved unpalatable for the intended Battlefield experience were removed too</a>.</p>
<p>These come as Battlefield 6 remains a powerhouse in terms of player numbers, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-has-only-been-out-a-day-and-its-already-one-of-steams-biggest-games-ever">quickly becoming one of the biggest Steam launches of all time</a> with nearly 750,000 concurrent players on its launch day last weekend.</p>

            <p>Ladder launching will soon be removed in an upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> patch, according to lead producer David Sirland.</p>
<p>The act of ladder launching allows players to essentially bounce off Assault Ladders to get a sudden boost of speed up into the air, allowing for unintentional mobility options and alternative angles of attack. It is absolutely a bug and needs to be removed, but on the other hand, it is really fun to do! So you should probably give it a go while you can.</p>
<p>Sirland, asking for general feedback on X following the initial launch of Battlefield 6, outright confirmed this bug in particular will be removed in an upcoming patch. He wrote: "Please keep the feedback coming! With the first weekend for BF6 in the wild, we are bound to have found issues, problems, stuff you like to see change - perhaps even praise? It's still all good, I want to know. And the team is eager to show you how much we care!"</p>

<p>Other suggestions Sirland publicly acknowledged include names for objective points, as well as problems with helicopter spawns. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-issues-fix-for-jump-momentum-bug-and-is-monitoring-breakthrough-player-counts">Quick hotfixes have already been pushed out to fix movement bugs</a>, so it looks as though Battlefield 6 will certainly continue to get improvements in the coming weeks, as the game marches towards its major season one update on the 28th October.</p><p>Assault Ladders it seems are a source of a few headaches, at least as far as bugs are concerned.

Well, you should be, it's bloomin' great. If you <em>are</em>, then you might be keen to check out a new upcoming physical edition from Limited Run Games.</p>
<p>Pre-orders open on <strong>17th October 2025 and close on 16th November 2025</strong>, and you can choose between three available SKUs: Standard, Steelbook, and Collector's Edition.</p>
<p>The latter, priced at <strong>$134.99</strong>, has a boatload of tat included that we suspect only the most passionate of fans will be interested in. This includes:</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067nrjxhg&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

<p>Yeah, you read that right, action figures! Now little Timmy can recreate the infamous beheading scene while you play. Or maybe not... You'd need a Frau Engel figure, at least.</p>
<figure data-uuid="e8e66b8576f49"><a title="Wolfenstein II - Collector's" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e8e66b8576f49/wolfenstein-ii-collectors.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Limited Run Games</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Still, it all looks pretty cool, but we're particularly enamoured with the steelbook – it looks really nice! If you feel similar, then its <strong>$69.99</strong> price tag might sound more tempting. Alternatively, if you're fussed about any extras and just want the physical game, this will set you back <strong>$49.99</strong>.</p>
<p>Wolfenstein II originally released on the Switch back in 2018 and wound up being one of the stronger ports for the console. We highlighted its "brilliantly-written story and intense action" in our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/wolfenstein_ii_the_new_colossus">9/10 review</a>, so we think it's well worth checking out.</p>

<h2 id="h-lol-worlds-2025-schedule">LoL Worlds 2025 Schedule</h2>



<p>This year’s League of Legends World Championship tournament is broken down across four stages:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Play-In Stage: </strong>October 14</li>



<li><strong>Swiss Stage</strong>: October 15–25</li>



<li><strong>Knockout Stage</strong>: October 28–November 2</li>



<li><strong>Grand Final</strong>: November 9</li>
</ul>



<p>The tournament’s Grand Final will take place in the Dong’an Lake Sports Park Multifunctional Gymnasium (that’s one heck of a name) in Chengdu, China. It’s one of the biggest venues for an esports tournament to occupy, featuring a whopping 18,000-seat capacity.</p>



<h2 id="h-teams-playing-at-lol-worlds-2025">Teams Playing at LoL Worlds 2025</h2>



<p>There are 17 teams competing at the League of Legends World Championship in 2025. The first team to be eliminated on October 14 was Invictus Gaming, whittling the teams in the Swiss Stage down to 16.</p>



<p>Here’s the full list of teams competing at the League of Legends World Championship in 2025:</p>



<ul>
<li>Gen.G</li>



<li>Hanwha Life</li>



<li>KT Rolster</li>



<li>Bilibili Gaming</li>



<li>Anyone’s Legend</li>



<li>Top Esports</li>



<li>FlyQuest</li>

<li>CTBC Flying Oyster</li>



<li>Secret Whales</li>



<li>PSG Talon</li>



<li>T1</li>



<li>Invictus Gaming (<strong>eliminated</strong>)</li>
</ul>







<p>Everyone comes into the League of Legends World Championship with keen eyes on T1 Gaming, the defending champions and the home of Faker, arguably the GOAT of the esports world. Last year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lol-worlds-2024-winner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Faker made history</a> while flying his traditional T1 banner, and the team has every opportunity to win <strong>yet another </strong>LoL Worlds this time around.</p>



<p>Behind T1 sits Gen.G, the top seed coming out of Korea and heading into LoL Worlds after a <strong>dominant </strong>run through the summer and regional qualifiers. Faker’s nemesis in Chovy is ready to bring it all to the table in China.</p>



<p>For the European League of Legends fans, the pick remains G2 Esports, Europe’s best hope for a League of Legends World Championship trophy.</p>

		<p>PUBG remains one of the best online multiplayer shooter experiences going. I’m not sure what that says about more modern releases, but still, if you’re looking for the truest battle royale experience out there, you want to play PlayerUnknown Battlegrounds. Part of that ongoing popularity comes from the teams’ constant stream of updates and patches over the year, and update 38.1 has just dropped today for PC, with consoles not that far behind, with the update due to follow on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S on October 23rd.</p>
<p><iframe title="Patch Report #38.1 | SMG Nerfs, Destructible Terrain on Miramar, and Halloween Collab Mode" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U2iaopdqRSw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The October update introduces a limited-time Halloween collaboration mode featuring the globally popular YouTube animation IP <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DaFuqBoom">Skibidi Toilet</a>, a new Contender character, and a series of gunplay and gameplay improvements, including updates to SMGs, vehicles, and map mechanics. You can find the full patch notes below!</p>



<h2 id="patch-notes3" data-renderer-start-pos="23474">Gameplay</h2>
<h3 id="isPasted" data-renderer-start-pos="23484">Vehicles &amp; Special Vehicle Skins</h3>
<p><span id="isPasted">Update 38.1 brings broad adjustments to vehicles and Special Vehicle skins.</span></p>


<ul id="isPasted" data-indent-level="1">
<li>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="23600">A similar level of window tint has been applied to the front and rear windows of base vehicles, matching those of Special Vehicle skins.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="23740">The driving experience has been improved for the following vehicles and Special Vehicle skins:</p>
<ul data-indent-level="2">
<li>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="23838">Dacia, Mirado, Coupe RB, “The Good Ol’ Days (Black)” Sedan, “The Good Ol’ Days (White)” Sedan</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="isPasted" data-renderer-start-pos="23937">Special Vehicle Skins</h4>
<p id="isPasted" data-renderer-start-pos="23960">When equipping Special Vehicle skins:</p>
<ul data-indent-level="1">
<li>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="24001">All vehicle windows can now be penetrated by bullets, regardless of skin type.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="24083">All vehicles now share the same wide, consistent penetrable area at the rear, regardless of design.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em id="isPasted" data-renderer-mark="true">&lt;Dev’s comment&gt;</em></p>
<p><em id="isPasted" data-renderer-mark="true">Across the vast Battlegrounds, vehicles serve as more than just a means of transportation—they are vital strategic elements that can shape the outcome of survival and combat. The PUBG development team has always valued the unique experiences and tactical depth that vehicles bring to the game. As Special Vehicle skins also serve to expand the joy of PUBG, we’ve collaborated with premium car brands to deliver realistic, immersive experiences that capture the essence of driving within the Battlegrounds.</em></p>
<p><em id="isPasted" data-renderer-mark="true">Throughout the development of Special Vehicle skins, we have always prioritized maintaining identical driving performance to their base vehicles. We’ve also worked to maintain balance in vehicle hit areas by allowing penetration based on material type, ensuring that combat remains as fair as possible. However, as more Special Vehicle skins have been introduced over time, we began to notice that the differences in size and shape were creating slight advantages or disadvantages in actual engagements, an unintended outcome that diverged from our original goal of offering purely visual variety. As players’ skills and understanding of vehicles have grown, these disparities have become more pronounced, revealing a growing imbalance that could no longer be overlooked. We recognized that adhering solely to our original policy of equal performance was no longer enough to address this issue. Since these discrepancies could directly impact survival and fairness, we saw this as a crucial matter that required fundamental action. Therefore, rather than making adjustments to specific skins, we decided to take a comprehensive look at the entire vehicle system—including previously released vehicles—and make improvements.</em></p>
<p id="isPasted" data-renderer-start-pos="27702"><em data-renderer-mark="true">In this update, we’ve implemented improvements in two key areas. First, we refined the overall driving experience of base vehicles and adjusted window transparency to make seated players less visible from the outside, narrowing the gameplay gap between base vehicles and Special Vehicle skins. At the same time, we’ve adjusted the hit areas of Special Vehicle skins to closely match those of the base vehicles, ensuring a fair and consistent experience regardless of which vehicle or skin players choose. These standards will continue to apply to all future Special Vehicle skins.&nbsp;<span data-renderer-mark="true" data-text-custom-color="#00b8d9">However, the Bugatti Special Vehicle skins were not included in this update, as no adjustments were required in relation to the changes made in this patch. (The balance of all Special Vehicle skins is subject to change depending on development progress.)</span></em></p>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="28539"><em data-renderer-mark="true">We understand that these changes may alter some aspects of the familiar experience, but we believe they are a necessary step toward maintaining a fair competitive environment. We will continue to listen closely to player feedback and remain committed to creating a more balanced and enjoyable Battleground for everyone. As always, we appreciate your feedback and thank you for your continued support.</em></p>
<h3 id="isPasted" data-renderer-start-pos="26919">Recall System</h3>


<ul id="isPasted" data-indent-level="1">
<li>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="26942">The registration time at the Blue Chip Tower now scales with the number of Blue Chips.</p>

<p data-renderer-start-pos="27074">Information regarding players returning to the Battleground is now provided through system messages and the Match Log.</p>

<p data-renderer-start-pos="27196">On 8×8 km maps, the Recall flight will appear one fewer time and will no longer appear from Phase 6 onwards.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="isPasted" data-renderer-start-pos="27308">UX/UI</h4>
<ul id="isPasted" data-indent-level="1">
<li>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="27317">The countdown message for the Recall flight has been removed from the spectator view, and the remaining time is now displayed at the top of the Minimap and the bottom right of the World Map.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="27511">Recall-related system messages now follow the same format as regular system messages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="27600">Some recall-related UI messages have been updated.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em id="isPasted" data-renderer-mark="true">Dev’s comment: Since the Recall system was introduced to Ranked and Esports, it has given eliminated players a second chance and had a significant impact on the overall flow of gameplay. To ease the fatigue that can come from repeated recalls, we’re making a few adjustments in this update. With these changes, recalling multiple teammates at once now carries greater risk. Players can also view other teams’ recall information, which creates new opportunities for strategic play. In addition, recalls are now limited in the late game so that the feature mainly serves as a recovery option for players eliminated early. We’ll continue working to give players more intense and strategic choices in every stage of the match.</em></p>

</li>
</ul>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="28461"><em id="isPasted" data-renderer-mark="true">Dev’s comment: With Update 38.1, we’re applying a series of adjustments to SMGs and the Panzerfaust. SMGs have been on a steady rise, and while we want to preserve their core strengths—low recoil and close-range dominance—we felt their stability when firing from the hip, without aiming over the shoulder or using scopes, was a bit too strong. To address this, we’ve made changes to improve balance in those situations. We’ve also reduced the damage of the MP5K, which has shown a noticeably higher usage rate than other SMGs. Its TTK (Time to Kill) will remain the same at close range, but you’ll feel a clear increase in TTK at longer distances. These changes are aimed at keeping SMGs an appealing choice for close-quarters combat while maintaining healthy weapon variety across the Battlegrounds. As for the Panzerfaust, which has long been known for its overwhelming firepower, we’ve introduced several penalties to its handling and damage potential. True to its nature as a large, heavy weapon, movement is now more restricted when it’s equipped, adding a layer of risk to its use. We’ve also increased the sight deployment sound and reduced the damage it does to players inside vehicles, giving players more opportunities to respond to Panzerfaust attacks.</em></p>

We’ve been gradually rolling out terrain destruction to multiple maps. With this update, players can now enjoy creating new cover strategies not only on Rondo, Sanhok, and Taego, but also on Miramar. These changes aim to bring Miramar’s gameplay experience more in line with other maps. Please note that the Destructible Buildings feature, which currently exists only on Sanhok, is not planned for other maps at this time.</em></p>

            <p>Given how quickly older games can be delisted or end up near impossible to run properly without tinkering nowadays, efforts like GOG.com's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gog-are-doubling-down-on-game-preservation-and-making-it-easier-to-see-which-games-run-well-on-modern-pcs">preservation program</a> are always nice to see. There's obviously a money-making motive behind it for the storefront, but keeping retro works in working order's a noble way to earn that cash. As it turns out, though, the folks behind the CD Projekt-owned site underestimated just how difficult an undertaking the program would be.</p>
<p>That's not to suggest they're giving up though, just that they've had to re-evaluate some of their ambitious early goals.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"To be perfectly honest, it’s harder than we thought it would be," GOG senior business development manager Marcin Paczynski told <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/when-we-launched-resident-evil-on">The Game Business</a>. "What we’ve found out is that the games and how they work has deteriorated way faster than what we thought. And we are not talking only about the game not launching. We are talking about more subtle things as well, like the game not supporting modern controllers, or the game not supporting ultra-widescreen or modern resolutions, or even a simple thing like being able to minimalize the game, which is an essential feature today. Modern gamers expect to be able to minimalize the game and then to bring it up without issues."</p>
<p>So, it's turned out that the sellers have had more work on their hands than they anticipated to bring older games up to "the standards that we defined". As you might expect, that's led to the revamped games pot not filling up at quite the rapid rate GOG predicted, with the preservation program now forecasted to end 2025 with somewhere between 300 and 350 titles, rather than the 500 originally set as a goal. As of writing, it's 232 games strong.</p><p>GOG managing director Maciej Gołębiewski also picked out the ancient DRM tech old games have often been saddled with as a headache when it comes to performing these updates, suggesting that companies should consider making the DRM easier to ditch once it's protected the game around launch. The other side of that coin, of course, is that companies will always want to cover their own backs - convincing them to compromise early on in the name of a future comeback project surely resembles a chat with a tie-wearing brick wall in a lot of cases.</p>
<p>Finally, Paczynski picked out a couple of cases which have seen getting the rights to preserve games present a different challenge than simply convincing a lawyer people still dig classic Resi. Amongst other things, GOG have hunted down ex-shooter devs turned Texan oil magnates, and hired a private investigator to track down one bloke living totally off-the-grid who'd inherited the rights to some games. </p>
<p>Imagine, you're living in a tent in the wilds of somewhere like the Scottish highlands. As you snooze, the zip gently winds down, startling you into fight or flight mode. It's Tom Selleck. 'Oi, people want to play Links: The Challenge of Golf without running into weird popping audio,' he declares. You reach into an old tin and hand him a bit of paper which reads 'Do what you want with it'. He leaves. You accidentally forget to check that none of the berries you've picked for breakfast are poisonous.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>I can't remember much about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-1942">Battlefield 1942</a>, two decades on, but I'm pretty sure I never thought "by golly, what if this + enormous sad stone monsters" while storming the beaches of Wake Island. It's one of many things that separate me from Fumito Ueda, director of melancholy PS2 titan-feller Shadow Of The Colossus, first released in 2005. In a new interview, he and other staff at Team Ico and Sony explore the game's development from start to finish, including some early dabblings with multiplayer.</p><!--more-->
<p>That SOTC - aka Nico, aka Ico 2 - was envisaged as a group hunting sim is reasonably well known, but this is the first I've heard that it took inspiration from DICE's khaki ballistics fest. Read all about it in <a href="https://www.designroom.site/shadow-of-the-colossus-oral-history/">this oral history</a> published by Design Room, a longread mothership recently launched by former Polygon writers.</p>
<p>The piece begins with Ueda and other staff reflecting on the poor sales of Ico, their reputation-making Gormenghastian escort questathon. "In terms of inspiration, I wasn't playing many offline games back then," Ueda recalls. "But I was really hooked on Battlefield 1942, an FPS. I felt immense potential in the experience of that as a competitive game, where you'd shoot at or help out other players you didn't know. That desire to create a network game - meaning a game where you play together, battle, or cooperate with others online - led me to start with the idea of a game where you cooperate to defeat giant monsters."</p>
<p>Design Room include a cheeky offstage Jerry Springer-style reaction here from Johan Persson, the lead programmer responsible for Battlefield 1942's original concept. "You tend to just assume these ideas were the result of someone having a eureka moment, waking up one morning, without any context," he says.</p><p>You might think that Capcom's original Monster Hunter would be the major influence, but that only came out the year before SOTC, and it's hard to imagine the development timelines lining up. Still, the prototype outline given by then-Sony Computer Entertainment America producer Kyle Shubel certainly evokes the team tactics of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-walkthrough">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> and co. "I'm going to stun it. I'm gonna tie its leg while you mount on top of it. I'll go in front of it and blind it while he takes it out," Shubel expounds. "That concept, and then jumping back off onto your horses, and riding off in the sunset -- yeah, if we could have pulled that off, everyone would be talking about this game."</p>
<p>The multiplayer concept didn't come together for mostly humdrum reasons. Team Ico had little experience making multiplayer games, and PlayStation's online support was in its infancy at the time. The idea never progressed beyond some early prototypes. "We probably hadn't gotten as far as testing multiplayer, or maybe we just connected two controllers on a local network and were able to move characters around," Ueda says. "That was about the extent of it. We hadn't reached the point where you could play online. </p>
<p>"Personally, I thought we could attempt making a multiplayer game because we were developing within Sony's first-party studios," he goes on. "But looking at the production resources at the time, I decided that we couldn't realistically do it. To efficiently concentrate resources, we cut the multiplayer portion." Ueda adds that it was likely other parts of Sony's Japan Studio would have had to help out.</p>
<p>SOTC was a humongous undertaking even without the ability to gank the lonesome juggernauts. "Compared to Ico, this game had to have the following: an open-world setting with dynamic loading to express infinite space; "deforming collision" where you cling to giant structures; and a quadrupedal animal for the horse," Ueda details. "All of these features were already raising the bar significantly compared to Ico.</p><p>"We had nearly the same production team as Ico, and we knew network games were tough to make. Adding network support would also require the player to have more hardware to play, limiting those who could experience it. For these reasons, I decided to cut our losses early." It wasn't the only thing they ended up chopping - the game had 48 colossi at one point, not 16. You can read more in the full feature, with selections reserved for paying subscribers.</p>
<p>Given SOTC's story themes, introducing multiplayer may seem utterly ruinous. It's hard to imagine losing yourself in the mossy undulations of massive grieving metaphors when you have DorminNova69 spamming "revive me" in chat.</p>
<p>Still, grief is as much a collective ritual as a personal ordeal, and there is such a thing as "emotive multiplayer" - see the sherpas of Journey and the gloomier covenants of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a>. Somebody should make a proper mod for it. Somebody should mod the colossi into Battlefield 1942 as well. I'm frankly appalled that there don't appear to be any such mods already - SOTC at least has the excuse of (somehow) not yet being officially available on PC.</p>
<p>As for what Ueda is up to these days: he and Team Ico are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-creator-of-ico-and-shadow-of-the-colossus-is-making-a-giant-robot-piloting-game">getting into the mech business</a>.</p>

It’s a traversal tool that can be used to reach high-up places, opening up opportunities to gain new vantage points or even sneak up on unsuspecting enemies. The thing is that now, just days after Battlefield 6 launched for PC and consoles, the ladder is also being used for much, much more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve even accidentally whipped out the ladder while playing Battlefield 6 multiplayer, you might have noticed that actually mounting it can be a hassle. The bottom of the gadget bumps players around if placed at a certain angle, triggering moments that balance frustration with slapstick humor.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While some Assault classes in Battlefield 6 have found <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1o558n3/assault_ladder_is_criminally_underutilized_im/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>practical uses for the tool</u></a>, others are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1o4g675/me_when_i_meet_the_ladder_of_repulsion_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>struggling to use it at all</u></a>.

All it takes is maneuvering around the gadget at the right angle and speed, causing a chain reaction that sends players careening through the air.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sadly, ladder launching is, mostly, practically useless in Battlefield 6.

            <title><![CDATA[Space Adventure Cobra: The Awakening Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/15/space-adventure-cobra-the-awakening-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/space-adventure-cobra-the-awakening-review.1325047/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>If you’ve never even heard of the 1970s manga ‘Cobra’ and the anime movie – ‘Space Adventure Cobra’ – and TV show that spawned from it, then don’t worry; me either. What I came to learn is that Cobra is absolutely brilliant, it’s self-indulgent, silly sci-fi at its finest. An over-the-top tale in which a Han Solo-like hero called Cobra, an intergalactic adventurer no less, travels the galaxy battling the villainous Pirate Guide – whose numbers include the superbly named Crystal Bowie. Well, Space Adventure Cobra: The Awakening is the video game of that story, a 2D side-scrolling Metroid-lite shoot ‘em up that does a lot of things well, and just as many things badly.</p>
<p><iframe title="Space Adventure Cobra - The Awakening - Launch Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qur4Wfmu-BU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>What Space Adventure Cobra: The Awakening absolutely nails is the look and feel of an 80’s matinee cartoon. Footage from the original anime is interspersed with the gameplay, giving a satisfying, cohesive feel to proceedings, as well as a strong narrative flow. The game is smartly structured around a TV episode format, welcomingly aping the TV show that inspired it. Other than the original footage, the rest of the story is told via talking heads and text boxes, with dialogue kept pleasantly short, keeping the focus firmly on the gameplay.</p>


<p>The animation for Cobra himself is fantastic; he moves like a character from GI-Joe or Thundercats. Our red spandex-clad hero is all about dynamic comic book poses, demonstrating plenty of effortless style as he slides and dashes across each stage, blasting away with his Pychogun. Enemy types don’t fair nearly as well, however. Most are bland, colour palette swapped and near indistinguishable henchman, whilst bosses fall too often into small metallic drone tedium. The game singularly fails to give you anything interesting to shoot at, but thankfully the shooting itself is rather fun.</p>


<p>Along with all the regular run and gun, which has a distinctive Samus feel, Cobra is able to use his pychogun to entertaining and unique effect. After charging a meter, you can launch a special laser attack that briefly freezes time, whilst you steer the energy beam in a manner rather reminiscent of playing Snake on your old brick Nokia. Steer your laser strategically and you can nimbly dodge obstacles and take out numerous enemies in one hugely satisfying blast, Cobra congratulating himself – and you – as he does so.</p>
<p>This gameplay mechanic leads to some great moments and is one of the key elements in the handful of switch-based puzzles that will briefly befuddle you. Sadly though, the controls are inconsistent, all too often my laser snake took it upon itself to auto-steer – usually when up against bosses that require pinpoint targeting of weak points to destroy – taking me by surprise and thus missing my targets entirely. It’s a frustrating blip in what is an otherwise deeply enjoyable addition.</p>

<p>Sadly, the level design doesn’t live up to the standard of the combat. Bland and empty, running along corridors with some very predictable platforming interspersed, charging through these environments soon gets boring. There’s a light Metroidvania element to proceedings, encouraging you to return to previous levels with newfound abilities to unlock and discover secret areas, but when exploring is this tedious, there’s really little incentive to do so.</p>
<p>More problematically, the controls for Cobra don’t behave whilst he leaps and clambers, all too often missing a handhold that he clearly should have reached and so plunging to his doom. Worse is when the game sticks an enemy on top of a platform that you’re clasping onto. Try and climb up and things get confused, the game not knowing what you want to do, resulting in a stationary Cobra getting shot a lot as you frantically waggle your thumbstick and tap buttons furiously. Perhaps in recognition of these issues, the check point system is very generous, putting you right back into the action with full health and no lives to worry about. Which does undermine the challenge somewhat, that is at least until you run into one of the very unpleasant difficulty spikes.</p>

<p>Overall, Space Adventure Cobra is a smooth and accessible experience, putting up just the right amount of resistance to provide a slight challenge, but not much more than that. But then, rather too often, you run into a ridiculously tough mini-boss who will make you cry with despair. These rotters are veritable bullet sponges, and, unlike the main bosses, have no discernible weak points for you to take advantage of and boost your damage.</p>
<p>Each of these irritating foes usually fights you on a locked screen and spews a nasty bullet hell at you, something the game hasn’t bothered in teaching you how to avoid in the proceeding stages, resulting in a lot of frustration as Cobra dies and dies again until you eventually get lucky and can finally proceed. Because of the easy level of challenge elsewhere, these difficulty spikes really stick out, jabbing you right in the unmentionables.</p>

            <p>Banjo-Kazooie director Greg Mayles has confirmed he's now left Rare after 36 years at the British studio.</p>
<p>News broke of his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-thieves-and-banjo-kazooie-director-gregg-mayles-reportedly-leaving-rare-after-35-years">departure in the wake of layoffs at Microsoft</a> back in July, but now Mayles himself has announced his departure on social media - fittingly, with a rhyme.</p>
<p>N64 platformer Banjo-Kazooie was known for its script of rhyming couplets, and this charming post references plenty of the games Mayles worked on, from Battletoads and Donkey Kong, to Grabbed by the Ghoulies and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/viva-piata">Viva Piñata</a>.</p>

<p>In total, Mayles worked on almost 30 games for Rare.</p>
<p>While his announcement gives no specific reason for leaving the studio, he was overseeing development on the now-cancelled Everwild, which presumably prompted his departure.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Today was my last day at <a href="https://twitter.com/RareLtd?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@RareLtd</a>. Thanks to everyone who played and enjoyed any of the games I helped create while I was there. Also thanks to all the people that worked on the games alongside me. It seemed fitting that I should say farewell with one final rhyme! <a href="https://t.co/X54u8Bc2oI">pic.twitter.com/X54u8Bc2oI</a></p>— Gregg Mayles (@Ghoulyboy) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ghoulyboy/status/1978112736270655778?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 14, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>It comes at a rocky time for Rare. Acquired by Microsoft back in 2002, the studio has struggled to reach the same success it had on the N64. Live-service pirate game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a>, released in 2019, is its biggest recent hit, incidentally directed by Mayles.</p>
<p>Yet in July <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-begins-substantial-layoff-process-across-gaming-division-king-and-zenimax-impacted">Microsoft laid off a number of employees across its gaming division</a>. Rare's long-in-development Everwild was cancelled, as was The Initiative's Perfect Dark - a reboot of Rare's shooter series.</p>
<p>Executive producer Louise O'Connor also reportedly left the company alongside Mayles, having joined the studio in 1999 for N64 platformer Conker's Bad Fur Day.</p>
<p>As such, it's now unclear what Rare is working on next beyond continued development on Sea of Thieves. The departure of top developers further puts the studio's future into question.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/first-screenshots-of-rares-ill-fated-everwild-emerge-thanks-to-artists-portfolio-website">First screenshots of Everwild leaked</a> earlier this week, providing a look at the game's UI. Little was known about the game beyond the trailers officially released. Similarly, details on the<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-leak-fresh-info-suggests-studio-saw-gap-in-the-market-with-metal-gear-solid-and-bond-absent"> Perfect Dark reboot leaked last month</a>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-smash-hit-more-6-5-million-units-sold/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-is-a-%E2%80%98smash-hit%E2%80%99-with-more-than-6-5-million-units-already-sold-says-analyst.1325035/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>We already knew that Battlefield 6 was shaping up to be a big success <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-servers-hit-capacity-at-launch-steam-charts-747k-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">based on the player concurrency peaks reached on Steam</a>. However, the <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/battlefield-6-is-a-smash-hit-launch?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=5141681&amp;post_id=176159450&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;r=4mhhpq&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest Alinea Analytics newsletter</a> paints a much clearer picture that also includes data from the other platforms.</p>



<p>According to the analyst firm, Battlefield 6 has already sold more than six and a half million units across PC and consoles, thus generating over $350 million in revenue and approaching Call of Duty-levels of sales, which is what Electronic Arts has been seeking all along.</p>



<p>The vast majority of players (56.7%) purchased the game through Valve's Steam platform, where Battlefield 6 sold over three and a half million units and generated more than $220 million in revenue. As for the consoles, the PlayStation 5 userbase (23.7%) only narrowly beats that of the Xbox Series S|X (19.6%), which is surprising on one hand because there are many more PlayStation 5 consoles out there. On the other hand, Xbox fans were quite literally raised on shooters, so it's understandable they would flock in droves to the new hot shooter, whereas PlayStation users have always been more diverse when it comes to the games they play.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Alinea Analytics also reckons that, at least so far, the game is managing to keep the interest of those who bought it. The analyst firm remarks how Battlefield 6 is exhibiting an 'extraordinarily flat' daily active users curve, meaning there is practically no drop-off of existing users, while new users are still coming in daily.</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, those who bought the game on Steam regularly played other shooters like Call of Duty, Helldivers 2, The Finals, Marvel Rivals, Ready or Not, and, of course, previous Battlefield games. Regarding the regional distribution, a third of Steam's Battlefield 6 players are from the United States, but there's also a 15% from China. The 3% from Japan is also a further sign that Japanese players also like shooters and PC games nowadays.</p>



<p>Of course, this is just the beginning of what Electronic Arts hopes will be a long and successful live service. Already, the developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/first-battlefield-6-tweaks-rolled-out-without-patch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have started applying the first balancing tweaks</a>. Season 1, which will add new maps, modes, weapons, and more, <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-1-starts-october-28-roadmap-unveiled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is due to begin on October 28</a>. Then there's the Battle Royale mode, which is currently being tested<a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-mode-details-testing-starts-this-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> in the Battlefield Labs program</a>. Needless to say, if this mode also turned out to be popular, EA's <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-targeting-100-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lofty goals of reaching 100 million players</a> could suddenly become more than a pipe dream.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Some Pokémon fans have been hit with disappointment ahead of the long-awaited launch of Pokémon Legends: Z-A, after their Pokémon Center pre-orders were cancelled.</p>



<p>The title, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launching October 16</a> on the Nintendo Switch family of consoles, features the return to Kalos’ Lumiose City and makes a big change to battle mechanics with a move to real-time combat.</p>



<p>Two days before the big release, however, some fans who pre-ordered through the Pokémon Center have seen their pre-orders cancelled, with the majority reporting that they have received no reason.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Bad news. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>An initial post on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LegendsZA/comments/1o6icr4/pokemon_center_preorder_was_just_canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> stated two pre-orders from the Pokémon Center were cancelled without reasoning, even showing the plushie they had been granted as a pre-order bonus.</p>



<p>Many more users then commented that they had seen their pre-orders cancelled, with some reportedly being told the site was unable to reauthorize a payment method, despite a charge having been taken, and others stating they had been informed the product had been oversold.</p>



<p>Adding to the confusion, some of the tracking for the cancelled Pokémon Legends: Z-A pre-orders is said to be showing a status of received, which indicates the pre-order is still in the system.</p>



<p>At this stage, it appears the issues are only with Pokémon Center pre-orders for the game, and the specific reason for the cancellations is unknown. However, with the game due to launch in just a matter of hours, it serves as a major disappointment for those who were hoping to jump in immediately.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Pokémon for comment and we will update this article accordingly if we receive a response.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Halo: Combat Evolved Remake Rumored to Get Full Remake Treatment with Sprinting]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/halo-combat-evolved-rumored-full-remake-treatment-sprinting/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/halo-combat-evolved-remake-rumored-to-get-full-remake-treatment-with-sprinting.1325029/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://x.com/leaks_infinite/status/1977781382563745995" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to leaker Halo Leaks</a>, the rumored new Halo: Combat Evolved edition is getting the full remake treatment, similar to CAPCOM's latest Resident Evil games. This includes the ability for the main character, Master Chief, to sprint (which was, of course, absent in the original game) and modern gameplay mechanics.</p>



<p><em>I can definitely confirm the Halo: Combat Evolved Remake will have sprint &amp; "modern gameplay mechanics". I'm of the belief its gameplay will be similar to the new Halo Multiplayer game, which I also believe is Halo 7's MP. It's a full remake similar to the Resident Evil remakes.</em></p>



<p>This would inevitably change how the game plays compared to the 2001 game, which was initially launched on the first Xbox. Then again, <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-combat-evolved-anniversary-now-available-on-pc-as-part-of-mcc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">there's already the Anniversary edition</a> for those who would prefer sticking with that.</p>



<p>Earlier rumors suggest the remake <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-combat-evolved-remake-2026-release-campaign-only/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">could launch in 2026</a> and only feature the single player campaign, ditching the multiplayer modes. The 2026 date tracks, as Microsoft previously mentioned that they wanted to celebrate the 25th anniversary of Xbox with its core franchises, including Gears of War: E-Day, the Fable reboot, the new Forza Horizon game, and of course, Halo itself.</p>



<p>Other recent rumors have <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-combat-evolved-remake-development-virtuos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pointed to Abstraction</a>, a Virtuos studio, helping Halo Studios with the development. The Halo: Combat Evolved remake will allegedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-combat-evolved-remake-ue5-blam-engine-gameplay-tweaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">use a combination of Unreal Engine 5 and the original Blam engine</a>, just like Oblivion Remastered (also co-developed by Virtuos), which mixed UE5 and the Creation engine. </p>



<p>The developers had previously teased fans that more information on their next project would be revealed during the Halo World Championship (HWC) 2025, which will take place from October 24 to 26, in Seattle, Washington, at the Seattle Convention Center. In around ten days we'll know whether the Halo: Combat Evolved remake rumors were correct, although everything points in that direction, for sure.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Glitches Have Players Flying Around The Map]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-glitches-exploits-ea-working-overtime/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-glitches-have-players-flying-around-the-map.1325020/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6 has been in the open for almost a week, and it has been met with a solid response from players worldwide, except for the lacklustre campaign offering. The multiplayer platform is enjoyable, stable, and receiving constant tweaks by the Electronic Arts studios that fed energy into the creation of the first-person shooter.</p>



<p>In recent days, it has seemed as though the studios under the EA banner are working overtime to keep up with the number of movement exploits and glitches that are being uncovered by players, promising to patch them out as they crop up.</p>



<h2 id="h-hammers-ladders-and-drones">Hammers, Ladders, and Drones</h2>



<p>In the last few days, various clips have surfaced on social media of Battlefield 6 glitches that are being manipulated to give players an edge in-game.</p>



<p>One of the easiest to replicate is the ‘ladder glitch’ that allows players to launch themselves off ladders if they’re positioned and approached <strong>in a certain way</strong>. The resulting glitch catapults players at high speeds far across the map, which means users can gain access to an objective behind enemy lines in a matter of seconds.</p>



<p>This is actively being addressed by DICE, but as far as we know, a patch hasn’t been released to address the glitch:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Another entertaining bug that’s giving players a serious advantage is the ‘hammer and drone’ glitch. In clips on social media, we’ve seen players stand on their teammate’s drone and repeatedly slam it with a sledgehammer melee weapon. Each hit propels the drone higher and higher, pushing towards the skybox ad infinitum.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Hammer + Drone = INSANE SNIPES 🤣 #battlefield6" width="422" height="750" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NuFEl31l8Yw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Once at the highest point, players can simply whip out their weapons and start firing shots across the map, confusing everyone trying to spot where the incoming fire is originating from.</p>



<p>Again, this is being addressed by Electronic Arts’ association of studios.</p>



<p>Have you noticed any hilarious glitches in Battlefield 6 that are giving you an advantage? Let me know about them on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

Gamers might be more familiar with his later single Unshaken, which was recorded for the Red Dead Redemption 2 soundtrack.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/RockstarGames/status/1978209317409955963" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Rest In Peace D'Angelo, a true titan of soul. We are eternally grateful for his track "Unshaken" which will forever be an enduring part of the legacy of Red Dead Redemption 2. <a href="https://t.co/HvmcJ6FPWA" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/HvmcJ6FPWA</a></p>  — Rockstar Games (@RockstarGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/RockstarGames/status/1978209317409955963?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 14, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>A big fan of the original Red Dead Redemption, D'Angelo ended up playtesting the sequel while it was still in development, after he reached out to a contact at Rockstar. Seeing his enthusiasm for the game, Rockstar invited D'Angelo to contribute to a song for RDR2's soundtrack--a collaboration that eventuated in the single Unshaken.</p><p>Unshaken plays during the gameplay of RDR2, creating a cinematic moment as Arthur Morgan rides his horse back to camp following a pivotal story mission. The soulful song created an unforgettable moment within the game's narrative, and Unshaken has since become the most-streamed song on the RDR2 soundtrack.</p><p>Rockstar paid tribute to the artist on social media following news of his death, and many gamers have followed suit, recounting their memories of hearing D'Angelo's voice while playing RDR2. Fan tributes have proliferated across social media, including the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0AykH20X3Q&amp;list=RDL0AykH20X3Q" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">comments</a> of various versions of Unshaken on YouTube.</p><p>D'Angelo died on Tuesday morning at the age of 51, following a private battle with cancer, <a href="https://variety.com/2025/music/news/dangelo-celeberity-tributes-doja-cat-missy-elliott-1236552530/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Variety reports</a>.</p>

<p>If you've already got the new entry digitally preloaded on your system, then the update should already be applied.

<p>Of course, this new adventure is going to be loaded with online features such as trading and battling as well as connectivity with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_home">Pokémon HOME</a>, which will be made available in 2026. So it sounds like there's no getting around this if you want to access the online features.</p>
<p>If there's anything else discovered about this patch, we'll provide an update. And we'll share the official English patch notes when they go live as well. Once again, this update is available for both the Switch and Switch 2 versions of the game.</p>

                <p>Tencent Games and developer Grey State Studio aren't sending players to Hell in their upcoming game, Rules of Engagement: The Grey State. But this free-to-play tactical-horror action-RPG shooter might be Hell-adjacent, thanks to a nightmarish realm filled with monsters and other unspeakable creatures.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Wow0CtP7ng" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5Wow0CtP7ng" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The Grey State is the name of an unstable dimension that's too dangerous for humanity, but it also contains alien artifacts that are invaluable. To survive in this hellscape, players assume the role of Striders who remotely pilot their bio-engineered shells from the comfort of their own dimension. Grey State Studios describes The Grey State as a "graveyard of nightmares" and a "Horrorverse" that includes Lovecraftian creatures, as well as monsters inspired by films, books, and even creepypasta online tales.</p><p>The gameplay is a PvEvP loop that gives players only a limited time to drop into The Grey State. Striders will have to scavenge for gear inside the nightmarish dimension and ultimately choose between accepting an early extraction for limited rewards or taking a shot at even bigger profits if they can beat their fellow players to an alien artifact.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YZqXXxPn4U" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2YZqXXxPn4U" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Grey State Studios is planning an alpha test for Rules of Engagement that will feature four classes of Striders that players can pick. The fourth option is currently being hidden, but the other three are listed below.</p><ul><li>Sledge, an unstoppable juggernaut that forges a path with shield and hammer</li><li>Pyro, a chaotic madman that controls the battlefield with fire and gas</li><li>Phantom, a swift assassin that strikes from the shadows with extreme precision</li></ul><p>The studio notes that players who demonstrate talent for buildcrafting and strategy will reap the rewards in this game. It also added that "Rules of Engagement was built with the future in mind, and we plan to support the game for years to come with content updates, meta shakeups and player-friendly free-to-play business model supported by a cosmetics-only in-game shop."</p><p>Rules of Engagement: The Grey State will hit PC in 2026, and it can be played as a single-player experience or with up to three other players. Additional seasonal content is planned post-launch to explore other aspects of the game's Horrorverse.</p>

<p>Have the reviews for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> sold you, or do you still need to find out more about the game before you commit?

<blockquote>
<p>"Pokémon Legends: Z-A should be celebrated for its fabulous real-time combat and its largely smooth jump to the Switch 2, but in condensing things down to one single location, it loses part of the Pokémon magic that Arceus and many other entries managed to amplify."</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="vf32irwF2Do" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vf32irwF2Do?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vf32irwF2Do?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vf32irwF2Do?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5f76a2huvmjs&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-can%E2%80%99t-believe-we%E2%80%99re-still-talking-about-this.1324924/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Late last week, a cavalcade of cynics and useful idiots accused leftist Twitch streamer Hasan “HasanAbi” Piker – who many of the aforementioned cynics <a href="https://aftermath.site/twitch-youtube-tiktok-politics-election-hasan-piker-donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have been trying to bring down for years</a> – of being a secret dog abuser. This is on its face absurd; there are hundreds of hours of stream footage in which Piker does not abuse his dog, Kaya, in addition to numerous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/CACIN1uyZnM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">videos</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/kh_QXIMlEKk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clips</a> in which he dotes on her, takes her to play with other dogs, and generally treats her the way you’d expect from a decent pet owner. However, more than half a week later, this non-troversy remains the talk of the Twitch extended universe. What are we even doing here?</p><p>To be honest, I wouldn’t be mentioning this if not for the fact that it’s a microcosm of how online platforms work today: Somebody makes an accusation based on evidence that’s spurious at best, big names with something to gain (viewership or the downfall of a perceived enemy) uncritically boost it, internet sleuths obsessively piece together supporting evidence by amassing context-free clips and ignoring everything that doesn’t match their intended conclusion, and all of the aforementioned parties spread performatively apoplectic videos across Reddit, YouTube, TikTok, Twitter, and wherever else they can sucker in uninitiated normies.&nbsp;</p><p>Some version of this happens every week – every day, on a smaller scale – without fail. It accomplishes nothing aside from giving the disaffected masses a brief glimmer of what feels like purpose, but is actually a bloodsucking waste of their precious time on this dying planet. And of course, it provides platforms with sweet, sweet engagement numbers. As a result, platforms will probably never intervene to disrupt this corrosive dynamic, which has broken the general public’s ability to perceive anything resembling objective reality, even as society collapses around them and people like Piker attempt to identify the real reasons why (hint: they don't involve dog collars).</p><p>The internet has been like this at least since the Depp v. Heard trial, which wannabe sleuths similarly feasted on in 2022 while <a href="https://spitfirenews.com/p/what-we-didnt-learn-from-depp-v-heard" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">getting pretty much every important detail completely wrong</a>. At least back then they were obsessing over something of consequence. Now they’ve taught viewers to regard <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-pokimane-cookie-controversy-is-so-dumb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">every trumped-up non-issue they can surface</a> with similar gravity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The particulars barely matter in #CollarGate’s case, because they are stupid, but here’s a quick rundown: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/1o0sjun/hasan_reaching_for_something_and_seemingly/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The clip that started it all</a> depicts Piker, clearly not in a great mood, chiding Kaya for leaving her spot behind his streaming setup. Shortly after, she yelps, seemingly in pain, before laying back down. Piker proceeds to say in an exasperated voice that she’s “being such a baby.” Piker himself has admitted that in isolation, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/-tJWdxHHr7s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it’s not a great look</a>! But it’s also explicable: Kaya likely got her dewclaw – a small extra toe higher on the leg than the rest of the foot – caught on the side of her bed, resulting in a sudden and surprising burst of pain as she moved to climb back in.&nbsp;</p><p>This single moment was enough to send the conspiracy mill into overdrive. Content creators and their fans became convinced that, in that moment, Piker pressed an off-screen button to violently shock Kaya, who – according to their telling of events – he has been secretly torturing for years. In the coming days, they reinforced their claims with clips in which Piker reached in a direction and Kaya, napping, did not make any noise but<em> </em><a href="https://x.com/parkingtigers/status/1977435955033415795" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>suddenly moved</em></a>, as well as others in which Piker orders Kaya – clearly trained – to go back to her spot. Some of these <a href="https://x.com/Awk20000/status/1977590633104802212" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">include text narration</a> of every minute reaction from Kaya, which seem incriminating until you realize she’s just doing normal dog things like licking her lips and looking in directions; she’s not regularly yelping, nor does she appear to fear or loathe Piker. Others purport to depict unforgivable abuse by Piker when, in actuality, Kaya is just napping.</p><p>For his part, Piker has offered multiple plausible explanations <a href="https://x.com/KweenInYellow/status/1978174460269068486" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">backed up by testimonies by friends</a> who’ve spent ample time in his home. Kaya’s collar, he says, does not have shock functionality. It can only rumble. He’s backed this up by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/1o1r33t/labased_streamer_shows_off_his_canine_companions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">showing the collar to his audience</a>. He also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/1o5sdaz/another_explanation_from_hasan_hes_pushing_the/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">keeps a button on his desk</a> to open the gate that keeps her in his office.&nbsp;</p><p>Nonetheless, content creators like Ethan Klein, Asmongold, and Destiny – who have <a href="https://aftermath.site/twitch-youtube-tiktok-politics-election-hasan-piker-donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made countless hours of content about Piker</a> over the years both to farm engagement and because they <a href="https://aftermath.site/twitch-israel-palestine-frogan-ban-h3h3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">oppose his pro-Palestinian politics</a> – have kept the faux-outrage train rolling right into a new week, with additional <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/1o5vs5j/asmongold_on_valkyrae_throwing_him_under_the_bus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commentary on Piker’s friends</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/1o5z8gx/asmongold_says_pokimane_lacks_empathy_in_her/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a podcast episode Piker was set to guest on</a> that apparently <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/pokimane-lilypichu-cancel-hasan-podcast-over-shock-collar-controversy-3266093/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got canned against the hosts’ wishes</a>, and whatever other scraps they can pick up and throw around like so much attention-grabbing confetti. Number-chasing drama hounds like xQc and MoistCr1TiKaL, you will not be surprised to learn, have also been having a field day with this one.</p><p>These creators and their orbiters do not actually care about dogs, nor do their <a href="https://aftermath.site/asmongold-apology-palestine-hasan-piker-twitch-youtube" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ever-shifting</a>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/charlie-kirk-death-gamergate-ghost-of-yotei-probablymonsters-fired" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trend-chasing</a> stances suggest that they care about anything except themselves. The content creation ecosystem breeds sociopathic cynicism and preys on those credulous enough to have not yet realized this. Unfortunately, millions upon millions of people fall into the latter category. This is not helped by the fact that large portions of the internet, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/1ebzrqf/reddit_is_extremely_manipulated_by_bots_and/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">especially Reddit</a>, have been astroturfed via bots, making it seem like many more people give a shit about the non-issue of the day than actually do.&nbsp;</p><p>It is evident that Piker insists on maintaining structure in Kaya’s life so that she doesn’t go too far off the proverbial leash, but so do a lot of dog owners! My mom’s Kaya-sized dog, who I can attest lives a blessed life, spends most of his day napping next to her. This is because dogs sleep an average of 12-14 hours per day, almost as much as cats! That’s not evidence of abuse, nor is it in Piker’s case, especially in the face of an overwhelming amount of footage in which nothing is happening – or Piker is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcOtOQr9_Ys" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">going out of his way to give Kaya attention</a>. It is also clear that Piker has become vocally irritated with Kaya – and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/1o1ay9x/old_clip_of_hasan_piker_telling_a_dog_to_stay_or/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his dog before her, Fish</a> – at various points. He has even sworn at them and physically moved them. That’s not great! It is still not evidence of pervasive abuse, however, because pets cannot understand words, and sometimes all they do understand is a person pushing or pulling them.&nbsp;</p><p>Every pet owner gets frustrated with their pet sometimes; this is because animals are dumb and bad at recognizing what matters to us. My cat recently got into the habit of screaming at me before I was ready to wake up in the morning – in defiance of our long-established breakfast schedule, which keeps her from going over a healthy weight. Usually I would tell her to cut it out in a normal voice before rolling over and trying to get a few more minutes of shuteye. Occasionally, exasperated by her repeated attempts, I would yell at her from across the room to shut the fuck up. I’m not proud of that, and I wish I hadn’t done it. But I think there’s a pretty clear line between moments of frustration boiling over and outright abuse. My cat, by the way, remains perfectly chill and happy, and literally anyone who’s ever met her would attest that she loves me a lot.</p><p>The problem with the kind of supposed smoking gun people believe they’ve found conveniently offscreen of Piker is that it doesn’t really make sense in context. After all these years, the most incriminating evidence anyone can find is a handful of, at best, sus clips? And Kaya has only yelped in one of them? That kind of precision would require a diabolical mastermind to maintain, and what kind of calculating evildoer would film the whole thing for ten hours per day? While letting countless friends and high-profile guests – some of them politicians who could potentially <a href="https://aftermath.site/cuomos-latest-strategy-to-resuscitate-his-flatlining-campaign-go-after-zohran-mamdani-for-associating-with-a-twitch-streamer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">farm political capital</a> by disowning Piker – bear witness in person?&nbsp;</p><p>But the problem with conspiracies is that everything – even evidence to the contrary – becomes “proof” that the conspiracy is real. So despite how ridiculous it sounds when you put it to paper, the more likely explanation in the eyes of those both dishing up and dining out on this obvious bait is that Piker is a black-hearted villain, and every single person in his orbit is part of a meticulously coordinated effort to keep his secret, which he spent years allegedly parading around in the open, safe. </p><p>This despite the fact that it is simply much more likely that someone would have blabbed by now, because that’s how people work. This is the easiest hole to poke in almost any conspiracy: People talk. The more of them you bring into a covert operation, the more likely it is that somebody will slip up or switch sides for their own benefit. If you take into account the actual habits and tendencies of human beings, large-scale conspiracies are immensely difficult – verging on impossible – to keep going indefinitely.</p><p>We then arrive at the biggest worthwhile question of all: <em>Why </em>would anyone spend years performing not-so-secret secret dog torture? Or rather, if somebody possessed with your own human faculties – and not those of a cartoon super villain – was in this situation, why would they do it? I’ve seen people suggest that Piker just wants a living, breathing stream prop. But that also doesn’t make sense! Viewers tune into Piker for political commentary and himbo antics – not for a dog that evidence suggests does not meaningfully contribute to viewership numbers. For a period of time after Fish died, Piker didn’t have a dog. He nonetheless remained one of the biggest streamers on Twitch.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This is probably the dumbest psychosis event the internet has produced in recent months, but it’s still illustrative of how the machine works. All this so it can vomit meaningless slop into your mouth, siphon away your energy, and keep you docile. When you see a controversy take this shape, share this general silhouette, you can safely ignore it. You <em>should </em>ignore it. Engage at your own peril.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-party-wooooooo"><h3>We’re Throwing A Party, And You’re Invited</h3></a><p>Celebrate our two-year anniversary with us!</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-assassins-creed-reconstruction-ubisoft"><h3>Everything Is Assassin’s Creed</h3></a><p>"You can look at 15-ish games at this point and watch, nearly yearly, the progression toward the world we live in today"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/100-meters-gkids-anime-movie-review"><h3>100 Meters Is A Soulful Gem About The Poetry Of Running</h3></a><p>Studio Rock’N Roll Mountain’s rotoscope take on Uoto’s track manga unearths raw truths and soulful cadence with every thunderous footfall</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/hasan-piker-dog-collar-kaya-nontroversy-twitch]]></content:encoded>

<section><p>Skate's huge launch paints a hopeful picture, but the once dominating genre still has a ways to go</p></section>

                <p dir="ltr">Maybe you've noticed, but everywhere you look now, skating is back.</p><p dir="ltr">Though skateboarding games once dominated the gaming scene in the 2000s, the well appeared to all but dry up as the ambitions of the games industry evolved through the decades. Recently, however, there's been a resurgence of skating games, and an audience made up of both oldheads and fresh-faced players alike has been showing up for them. It feels safe to say there's still an appetite for these kinds of titles. With the early-access release of EA's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/skate/">Skate</a>--a revival of a series that once took up a lot of space in this industry--as well as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-review/1900-6417555/">acclaimed</a> <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-review/1900-6418379/">releases</a> of the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater remakes, the once-dying genre seems primed for a comeback.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> skate. | Early Access Season 1 Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">I first clocked this resurgence a while ago while playing an entirely different kind of skate game: a remarkably chill longboarding game called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2223700/Driftwood/" rel="nofollow ">Driftwood</a>. In Driftwood, you take on the role of a pretty cool sloth who carves and bombs--in skating parlance, to "bomb" means to ride down a huge hill--<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLvW64MuvO4">picturesque mountainsides</a>. As a guy who longboarded back in high school and primarily cruised through the city, Driftwood brought me back to what first turned me onto skating--the rush of wind in my admittedly unprotected hair as I barreled down derelict roads and hills, and the satisfying (not to mention casual) coolness I'd feel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A42mHv2pqsY">swerving through throngs of walkers and traffic</a>. It feels suiting, then, that the game that reminded me why I loved skating also opened my eyes to just how many skating games had emerged in the past few years.</p><p dir="ltr">For years now, developers have been producing a remarkable spectrum of titles, from the outlandish SkateBird to simulators like the aptly named Session: Skating Sim. SkaterXL came around a number of years ago, Bomb Rush Cyberfunk landed with all the noise and aplomb of Hawk's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YYTNkAdDD8">first successful 900</a>--and has a sequel on the way--and all the while, the OlliOlli games grew in size, substance, and style with every new release right up until Roll7's unfortunate closure.</p><p dir="ltr">There's been no shortage of skating games keeping the dream to shred alive, but with Skate's return, it feels like all the sectors of games development--the indie, AA, and AAA space, to be clear--are fully in the throes of a skating game renaissance.</p><p dir="ltr">So why exactly is this the moment for these kinds of games to re-emerge? What about the gaming landscape of 2025, and the last few years preceding it, has made developers choose to revisit this part of gaming's past?</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4585335-ss_62d5d8d0e98f490018e47ea0ad2bd56370da496f.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4585335" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4585335-ss_62d5d8d0e98f490018e47ea0ad2bd56370da496f.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4585335"></a><figcaption>A sloth skates downhill in Driftwood</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4585335-ss_62d5d8d0e98f490018e47ea0ad2bd56370da496f.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">According to Jason Mann, one of the developers who worked on Driftwood, the answer's pretty simple. "If I had to guess, it's probably that the people who grew up with the Skate and Tony Hawk series are getting old enough to make their own games, or at least have a bigger sway on consumer spending." Considering the timing, he's not exactly wrong. The Tony Hawk games first began appearing on the market back in the late '90s and the Skate series began about a decade after them. The average kid who played either is likely in a position to work in the industry and do something about their conspicuous hiatuses, the result of which we're seeing now. Given the industry's penchant for nostalgia and revisiting the touchstones of its past, this seems like the safest bet.</p><p dir="ltr">By and large, I agree with this opinion. But while I find the resurgence of skating games a welcome one, it also feels a bit like a tactical retreat at times. Maybe it's just the cynic in me, but when surveying the state of the games industry, one has to wonder: What works anymore? At a time when the field is fraught with layoffs and cancellations, it feels natural to see a reflexive nostalgia for the games that developers grew up with--games with legacies defined by their massive success and staying power. It makes ample sense then for something like Skate, which reshapes a beloved property into a new live-service model, to exist--even if it leaves audiences trepidatious.</p><p dir="ltr">For Jeffrey Spicer, a producer at crea-ture Studios who works on Session, the resurgence is reflective of skating culture's own highs and lows in popularity. Spicer added, however, that regardless of mainstream appeal, "there is always a core group of individuals that want a game that allows them the freedom and expression presented in real-life skating." It's a tough sentiment to deny when so many different skating games have cropped up over the years--a diversity that both he and Mann happily championed. It's especially fun seeing skate mechanics crop up in less-likely places too, like Thirsty Suitors from Outerloop Games back in 2023, the recently released Sword of the Sea (which seems more equivalent to surfing but we'll still take it!), and even last year's GameSpot GOTY, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metaphor-refantazio-is-gamespots-game-of-the-year-2024/1100-6528323/">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Amusingly, the latter two of these titles allow players to ride on a sword. If I had a nickel for every time that happened, I'd have two nickels, which isn't a lot, but it's weird that it happened twice.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4585336-scmwmu.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4585336" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1120" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4585336-scmwmu.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4585336"></a><figcaption>Metaphor: ReFantazio's protagonist skates through Grandtrad on his sword.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4585336-scmwmu.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">For Spicer, this sort of looming spectre of skating is likely because "the desire for skating games [has] never truly dwindled." Mann echoed this thought, pointing to how previous Tony Hawk and Skate games have enjoyed "cult followings that appear to get quite some social media engagement." And how many of us haven't seen some wildly popular <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/p2nAAD5zous">shortform video</a> of a player hitting an unbelievable Christ Air in Skate 3 set to Pearl Jam's "Even Flow."</p><p dir="ltr">Still, the uptick in skating games and their popularity is becoming palpable, which Spicer attributes to "the growing playerbase" and their demand for more. Fortunately, this moment feels ripe for someone who might want to get into them and clearly there is a desire. Mat Piscatella, a senior director and analyst at the market research company Circana, confirmed that Skate's release for EA seemed to be off to a "phenomenal start." Evidently, the free-to-play revival of the series "ranked among the top 5 titles in weekly total actives" over the majority of the platforms for which numbers are reported, putting its starting audience on par with the likes of giants like Fortnite and Grand Theft Auto. While it is typical of tentpole releases to see huge numbers out the door, it's a little rarer to see the feat accomplished by a title belonging to a once popular niche in a series that hasn't released a game in 15 years, making Skate's debut a refreshing shock to the system.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking of their once dominating presence, Piscatella also shared that when he worked at Activision, "Tony Hawk games were what games like Call of Duty and Madden are today: annualized releases with a loyal audience that would buy the new version every year." The challenge now, as Piscatella puts it, is to turn these "pulses," instances where a sporadic major release spiked interest and sales in skating games, into a flashpoint that translates to more staying power. Maybe Skate can manage that feat, but folks like Mann would also welcome more original games from the genre's other big series, as well as skating games with "full-fledged story modes" and a bit more grit.</p><p dir="ltr">No matter what form or shape it takes, the devs I spoke to seemed enthusiastic. Not just about the mainstream moment skating games are once again having, but at the prospect of their own work keeping a "torch lit for future generations to find skating," per Spicer.</p><p dir="ltr">"Be it getting new kids on their first board or getting old skaters to dust off their set ups, skating is for everyone."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This past weekend at New York Comic Con saw the announcement of a <em>Delicious in Dungeon</em> board game localization. Yen Press has announced that the tabletop adaptation of Ryuko Kui's fantasy manga will be getting an official English-language release.</p>

<h2>The <em>Delicious in Dungeon</em> Board Game Localization Announcement</h2>

<p>At a panel at New York Comic Con, Yen Press announced it had secured the rights for an English-language version of the <em>Delicious in Dungeon</em> board game. This announcement came alongside the company's purchase of the licenses of several manga and graphic novels.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/delicious-in-dungeon-board-game-game-set-up.jpg?itok=izf_k_tf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/delicious-in-dungeon-board-game-game-set-up.jpg?itok=b1DidOCU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The board game is an adaptation of the fantasy manga by Ryoko Kui. The manga follows a group of adventurers as they delve deep into a dungeon on a mission to rescue a friend. This standard fantasy trope is elevated by the dungeon being a fully fleshed-out ecosystem, complete with individual monsters having unique anatomy. Which means, if you know what to do, the monsters can be turned into delicious meals.</p>

<p>The original Japanese release, according to a report by <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/delicious-in-dungeon-board-game/announced" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Wargamer</a>, was published in 2022 and features original artwork by Kui. This is notable because it is two years before the debut of the&nbsp;<em>Delicious in Dungeon</em> anime, which catapulted the series into mainstream popularity. The game is a rough adaptation of Ginichiro Suzuki's 1998 board game, <em>Monster Maker</em>, with some dungeon crawl elements.</p>

While, according to an interview <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/comics/delicious-in-dungeon-manga-creator-known-for-immaculate-dandd-vibes-says-shes-actually-never-played-dandd-but-loves-rpgs-like-baldurs-gate-3/" rel="nofollow">by GamesRadar</a>, she hasn't played the most popular of fantasy TTRPGs, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>, Kui has put plenty of time into the officially licensed critical masterpiece, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/baldurs-gate-3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></a>.</p>

<p>The English release of the <em>Delicious in Dungeon</em> board game will be available May 2026.</p>
