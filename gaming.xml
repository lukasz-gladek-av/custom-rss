              <p>More games are coming out than ever before. <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-19-000-new-games-limited-pc-valve-unplayed-80-1851738322">Over 18,000 separate store listings</a> were added to Steam in 2024 alone. Our list of notable October releases hit 55, and there were dozens more games we could have included. It‚Äôs a good thing that with the market so flooded, the average gamer is also buying tons of games. Oh wait, they aren‚Äôt! A new survey by Circana finds the majority of players in the U.S. buy just two games a year or fewer.</p> <p>That data point was <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m27zezw2ek2v">shared last week</a> (via <em><a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/sept-2025s-top-new-steam-and-console?utm_campaign=email-half-post&amp;r=7owge&amp;token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxMjkxOTExOCwicG9zdF9pZCI6MTc1NDM3NzY3LCJpYXQiOjE3NTk4NjIyODQsImV4cCI6MTc2MjQ1NDI4NCwiaXNzIjoicHViLTE0MDg5Iiwic3ViIjoicG9zdC1yZWFjdGlvbiJ9.P7-FDk_km-Lb5u7RkPNCSLloq8feyciLH5rCuGYy4ew&amp;utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">GameDiscoverCo</a></em>) by the firm‚Äôs head of gaming research, Mat Piscatella. The group‚Äôs upcoming Future of Games report for the last quarter asked respondents how often they purchased new games. A whopping third said they don‚Äôt even buy one a year. Only 4 percent purchase more than one game a month. Did you buy <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> and<em> Borderlands 4</em> in September? Congratulations: you are a statistical outlier.</p>

 <p>Piscatella was presenting the data in the context of the recent Game Pass price hikes. While most players barely buy games at all, a small fraction of them spend a ton. ‚ÄúHyper enthusiast, price-insensitive players are really keeping things going, especially in the non-free-to-play gaming space,‚Äù he wrote. We can imagine this as the group who‚Äôs going to buy every game on their most-anticipated list no matter what. In fact, they might even buy the Deluxe Edition.</p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:bhqrrxt7yyfpwguioa7rwa7x/app.bsky.feed.post/3m27zezw2ek2v" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreigtnlcxloqjvmbylrdg2jzzq4x6qlon6az44xwjvfajx6viqo7h3m"> <p lang="en">Hyper enthusiast, price-insensitive players are really keeping things going, especially in the non f2p gaming space.</p> <p>According to Circana's Q3 2025 Future of Games, only 4% of US video game players buy a new game more often than once per month, with a third of players not buying any games at all.</p> <p>‚Äî <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:bhqrrxt7yyfpwguioa7rwa7x?ref_src=embed">Mat Piscatella (@matpiscatella.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:bhqrrxt7yyfpwguioa7rwa7x/post/3m27zezw2ek2v?ref_src=embed">2025-10-02T16:54:18.096Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <p>You can see this in the recent financial data for gaming companies like Sony. Despite console adoption stalling, <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-perfect-dark-halo-gears-war-fable-ps5-1851785732">they keep making more profit</a> on the same existing slice of fans. While some people buy a Switch 2, PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X/S and only ever buy a handful of games for it, others are content to keep adding to their backlog, a niche concept as foreign to the average gamer as the Criterion closet is to most people who subscribe to Netflix.</p>

 <p>We often think of the gaming as, broadly speaking, evenly divided and homogenous. We take the median player and imagine an entire audience made up of them, as opposed to the market being defined by lots of different groups of players with unique habits, tastes, and conceptions of the hobby. It‚Äôs also easy to see why game studios have gotten so precious about release windows. If the majority of people are only going to buy a couple of games of year, best not to go head-to-head with <em>Call of Duty</em>, <em>Madden</em>, or the next <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>.</p> <p>One obvious solution to this problem? Better curation and discovery. There‚Äôs only too many games if you can‚Äôt help the right people find the right ones. Valve has put a lot of work into exploring that problem and Steam is still far from perfect. The rest of the platforms, sadly, aren‚Äôt even close. And mobile, the biggest platform of all, is the worst of the bunch.</p>

<p>Metaphor: ReFantazio is celebrating its first anniversary this Friday with a surprise livestream and hinting at a mysterious special message.</p>



<p>Released last year, Atlus‚Äô Metaphor: ReFantazio is the newest IP from the minds behind Persona 5. Under Studio Zero, the JRPG took players to a medieval fantasy world with incredible turn-based combat. The game received multiple year-end accolades, winning three <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-winner-the-game-awards-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Awards</a> and IGN‚Äôs Game of the Year. With its success, it‚Äôs no wonder the team plans to celebrate its anniversary. However, it seems we may get some news there, as well.</p>







<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Celebrate Metaphor: ReFantazio‚Äôs birthday with us! ü•≥</p><p>Join us October 10th for our 1-Year Anniversary Special, airing on the ATLUS West YouTube page.</p><p>üìÖ October 10, 9pm PT/12am ET/5am BST <a href="https://t.co/EjouxPLZl9">pic.twitter.com/EjouxPLZl9</a></p></div>‚Äî Official ATLUS West (@Atlus_West) <a href="https://twitter.com/Atlus_West/status/1975608072748888546?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 7, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In a post from <a href="https://x.com/Atlus_West/status/1975608072748888546" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Atlus West</a>, an anniversary livestream for Metaphor: ReFantazio will happen on October 10th, 2025. The event will stream on YouTube and start at 9am PT/12pm EST. To find your timezone, check out this time checker <a href="https://everytimezone.com/s/3a687b72" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>. As for what it will entail, it simply states that it wil be a celebration for the game‚Äôs one-year milestone. Luckily, the message does say that it will feature a ‚Äúspecial message‚Äù. No other details were given regarding the tease.</p>



<p>It‚Äôs been rumored for a bit that Metaphor: ReFantazio may be ported to the Nintendo Switch, so it could be that. Coincidentally, Atlus‚Äô <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atlus-may-discuss-persona-3-reload-switch-version/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Persona 3 R</a>eload, which launched in 2023, is coming to the Switch this month. On the other hand, given the incredible reception to the title, we could see DLC or an enhanced version be announced. It‚Äôs a bit too soon for a sequel, but it may not be entirely out of the question. In any case, the game is available on Xbox Game Pass, so those interested can check it out there. For those who have already ventured to the United Kingdom of Euchronia, we may be returning rather soon.</p>



<p>Will you be tuning in for the Metaphor: ReFantazio livestream? What do you hope is announced there? Let us know in the comments below, in the forums, and on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/5f4cvU6G" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-players-dont-give-a-damn-about-new-portal-mode/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/only-12-of-battlefield-6-players-give-a-damn-about-the-new-portal-mode.1319143/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>When Battlefield 6 was revealed in full, Electronic Arts and the company‚Äôs associated studios spent a fair bit of time plugging the new Portal platform. It‚Äôs a full-fledged sandbox of sorts that allows players to create their own experiences, experimenting with Battlefield‚Äôs toolbox to manufacture all manner of fan-made functions.</p>



<p>In Battlefield 2042, Portal gave players a glimpse into the past, allowing them to play maps from previous games with all the weapons and vehicles that they fondly remember. In Battlefield 6, Portal is another thing entirely, but as it turns out, painfully few gamers actually give a damn about the mode.</p>



<h2 id="h-88-of-battlefield-players-don-t-care-about-portal">88% of Battlefield Players Don‚Äôt Care About Portal</h2>



<p>In an email circulated by Electronic Arts, a poll within revealed a range of four items that players had to vote on to determine which element of Battlefield 6 they‚Äôre most looking forward to.</p>



<p>By order of most popular to least popular, here are the results of that poll:</p>



<ul>
<li>Tactical Destruction ‚Äì 39%</li>



<li>Return of Campaign ‚Äì 30%</li>



<li>Maps, Modes, and Weapons ‚Äì 18%</li>



<li>Portal ‚Äì 12%</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>







<p>It‚Äôs surprising to see the Battlefield 6 campaign vote outpaces the maps, modes, and weapons vote by <strong>a mile</strong> ‚Äì almost <strong>double</strong>. The Battlefield 6 campaign is a welcome addition to this release, and from the trailer released to showcase the story, it looks like it‚Äôs going to be a banger, but it always plays second fiddle to multiplayer.</p>



<p>The tactical destruction being at the top of the table comes as no surprise. That was one of the most talked-about elements of Battlefield 6 in and around the game‚Äôs beta, with clips from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-sign-up-for-battlefield-labs/">Battlefield Labs</a> showcasing some jaw-dropping destruction that is being fine-tuned all the time.</p>



<p>Portal sitting flat at the bottom shows that players either don‚Äôt understand what it‚Äôs for this time around, or they simply don‚Äôt care. Why venture into Battlefield Portal in Battlefield 6 and play with the toolkit when you could 100% the campaign or grind multiplayer and rank up?</p>



<p>Portal will most likely become one of those things that is experimented with later, when players have gotten bored with the core offering. What‚Äôs bizarre is that DICE confirmed the Portal platform allows users to earn XP, no matter what they‚Äôre playing. That means that XP farms will be the only thing created on the platform in the early days</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to Portal in Battlefield 6? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>Ready to save the planet?</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nintendo and Square Enix have published a brand new trailer for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a>, the upcoming Switch 2 version of the 2020 PS4 original --which later got a PS5 upgrade <em>and</em> DLC.</p>
<p>Today's trailer acts as a bit of a rundown of the game's setting, Midgard, as well as the many factions within the sprawling metropolis. If you've already played the game on Sony's consoles or on PC, or even just played the original, you'll be <em>very</em> familiar with these names, but it's still worth a look.</p>
<p>Of course, Midgar is the setting for the entirety of the game ‚Äî which is essentially the opening area in the OG PS1 release. The city acts as the base of the Shinra Electric Power Company, a megacorporation that is monopolising the planet's energy and using it to power Midgar.</p>
<figure data-uuid="e6294790c3c26"><a title="Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e6294790c3c26/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>If planet-killing technologies weren't enough, then the company also has The Turks, a special task force who are left with "the company's dirty work", often involving assassinations, kidnapping, and other rather unsavoury things.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there's a group opposing Shinra ‚Äî Avalanche, a group you and Cloud will find yourself aligning with. They‚Äôre attempting to stop Shinra's abuse of power and save the planet by destroying Mako Reactors, which siphon the planet's energy.</p>

<p>And of course, to round the video off, we get a little snippet of info on both Cloud and Sephiroth ‚Äî though it's safe to say <em>everyone</em> has heard of those. Right? <em>Riiiight?</em></p>
<p>Naoki Hamaguchi, director of the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy, has been speaking <em>a lot</em> about the upcoming Switch 2 port lately. He's spoken about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/i-feel-a-great-responsibility-to-get-it-right-naoki-hamaguchi-on-the-pressure-of-remaking-final-fantasy-vii">feeling "a great responsibility"</a> to get the Remake right as well as how the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/lighting-is-the-crucial-factor-how-square-enix-made-final-fantasy-vii-remake-look-great-on-switch-2">team got the lighting just right</a> for this rerelease.</p>
<p>Plus, we <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/are-you-unsure-about-final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-for-switch-2-dont-worry-therell-be-a-demo">should be getting a demo</a> sometime before the game's 22nd <strong>January 2026</strong> release date, so keep an eye out for that.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Fortnite</em> maker Epic Games is suing two Michigan men, Idris Nahdi and Ayob Nasser, for allegedly abusing the <em>Fortnite</em> Island Creator program by artificially inflating engagement on their creations.</p><p>The company‚Äôs lawyers allege in a complaint filed Tuesday in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan that Nahdi and Nasser created and deployed ‚Äúfake ‚Äòbot‚Äô player accounts to simulate real hum <em>Fortnite</em> engagement on their islands.‚Äù In doing so, lawyers write, the two men earned ‚Äútens of thousands of dollars in unwarranted payouts.‚Äù&nbsp;</p><p>‚ÄúWe are taking legal action against two UEFN developers who used bots to inflate their player counts,‚Äù an Epic Games spokesperson told Aftermath. ‚ÄúWe also took down their islands and they are banned from <em>Fortnite</em>. Manipulating player engagement breaks our rules and will not be tolerated.‚Äù</p><p><em>Fortnite</em> user-generated content creators earn money from their creations with payouts related to engagement. People who create Islands in <em>Fortnite</em>‚Äîakin to Experiences in <em>Roblox</em>‚Äîearn money from a pool of money made up of 40% of revenue from Fortnite's Item Shop ‚Äúand related real-money purchases.‚Äù&nbsp;</p><p>That pool of money is divided up and distributed based on two factors: <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/introducing-the-creator-economy-2-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">player popularity and player retention</a>. The exact details of how the distribution is calculated isn‚Äôt public, but Epic Games‚Äô lawyers say in the lawsuit that active players, active playtime, and returning players (‚Äúamong other stats‚Äù) play into the calculation. Soon, <em>Fortnite</em> developers will be able to <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-developers-will-soon-be-able-to-sell-in-game-items?lang=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sell items from their <em>Fortnite</em> Islands</a> to earn additional revenue, but that hasn‚Äôt been rolled out yet. Currently, engagement is the only way to earn money from <em>Fortnite</em>.</p><p>‚ÄúBefore they got caught, Defendants were paid tens of thousands of dollars in unearned payments from Epic that would otherwise have been paid out to other developers who earned genuine engagement from real <em>Fortnite</em> players,‚Äù lawyers wrote in the complaint, <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/929543657/Epic-Games-suing-two-Fortnite-Island-makers-over-inflated-bot-engagement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which has been reviewed by Aftermath</a>. ‚ÄúEpic has also spent substantial resources investigating Defendants‚Äô conduct and working to implement safeguards against unearned payments.‚Äù</p><p>Both Nahdi and Nasser entered the program months apart in December 2023 and March 2024, respectively, Epic Games‚Äô lawyers say. They created multiple accounts with ‚Äúinaccurate or incomplete personal information‚Äù to ‚Äúcreate and publish a small number of <em>Fortnite </em>Islands.‚Äù&nbsp;</p><p>The multiple islands were a ‚Äúscheme‚Äù to ‚Äúdisguise‚Äù the fake engagement, lawyers say. Between December 2024 and February 2025, Nahdi and Nasser created more than 20,000 fake bot accounts, according to the complaint.&nbsp;</p><p>‚ÄúDefendants programmed the bot accounts to engage with Defendants‚Äô own <em>Fortnite I</em>slands by using a cloud gaming service that allows users to play video games, like <em>Fortnite</em>, remotely,‚Äù lawyers say.</p><p>The fake bot accounts accounted for 90% of visitors to the islands Nahdi and Nasser created‚Äîand they only engaged with their Islands, lawyers say. Epic Games started to get suspicious after Nahdi and Nasser were paid out for December 2024, finding that nine out of 10 Islands created by the two were populated by 80% to 99% of engagement. Epic Games began immediately withholding portions of the engagement payments "attributable to the artificial engagement in January and February 2025.‚Äù&nbsp;</p><p>Epic Games‚Äô lawyers say that the fake account activity dropped after Epic Games withheld payment, ‚Äúindicating the Defendants were aware their scheme had been detected.‚Äù</p><p>Epic Games is suing over breach of contract, copyright infringement, and fraud. It wants the court to forbid Nahdi and Nasser from accessing <em>Fortnite</em> or any server owned by Epic Games and award damages.&nbsp;</p><p>Epic Games has been ramping up its efforts to punish people who cheat in <em>Fortnite </em>in the past few years; the company has pursued legal action against alleged cheaters recently. One <em>Fortnite</em> esports player who was caught cheating <a href="https://x.com/FNCompetitive/status/1891564240604999725" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was forced to publicly apologize</a> this year and had their prize money donated to charity. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-tournament-cheat-forced-to-pay-175k-banned-from-game-forever" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Another player lost a $175,000 lawsuit</a> in June 2025 for cheating during <em>Fortnite</em> tournaments.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/100-meters-gkids-anime-movie-kenji-iwaisawa-director-interview"><h3>100 Meters Director On Capturing The Art And Agony Of Track And Field Through Rotoscope Animation</h3></a><p>Kenji Iwaisawa hopes his film adaptation will be ‚Äúthe first of its kind‚Äù to bring the quiet intensity of track to the big screen</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/hades-2-ending"><h3>Hades 2‚Äôs Story Doesn‚Äôt Change The Status Quo</h3></a><p>Melino√´'s journey is more about acceptance than change</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/wayward-netflix-martin"><h3>Wayward Is A Queer Exploration Of The Troubled Teen Industry</h3></a><p>Mae Martin's new Netflix show creates a *very* creepy small town</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/epic-games-suing-two-fortnite-island-makers-over-inflated-bot-engagement]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In a short period since partnering with <a href="https://gizmodo.com/toho-animation-acquires-gkids-and-aims-to-bring-more-japanese-media-to-the-u-s-2000512287" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Toho</a>, GKids has established itself as the anime equivalent of the Criterion Collection. Through its theatrical rereleases of <a href="https://aftermath.site/linda-bae-doona-gkids-james-iha" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deep-cut cult-classic films from yesteryear</a>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/gundam-gquuuuuux-is-the-sum-of-its-parts-in-the-best-way-possible" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anime TV compilation preview films</a>, and getting in on the ground floor of <a href="https://gizmodo.com/dandadan-first-encounter-review-gkids-crunchyroll-netflix-anime-2000499028" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new hot shows</a>, GKids established a name for itself bringing fans from the hovels of their streaming home setups to that magical place where heartbreak feels good to Nicole Kidman: the theatre. Its forthcoming release, <a href="https://gkids.com/films/100-meters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>100 Meters</em></a> by Studio <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2663/Rockn_Roll_Mountain" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rock‚ÄôN Roll Mountain,</a> taps into the big game pageantry by propelling one of the most low-key goated, yet slept-on, sports‚Äîtrack and field‚Äîinto the limelight through the awesome artistic power of rotoscoped animation.&nbsp;</p><p>Created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uoto" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Uoto</a>, a mangaka best known for <a href="https://gizmodo.com/netflix-orb-anime-review-madhouse-2000576670" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Orb: On The Movements Of The Earth</em></a>, <em>100 Meters </em>follows two runners: Togashi, a gifted sprinter lauded by all for his natural-born talents, and Komiya, an unconventional runner working hard to make a name for himself on grit alone. Similar to Tatsuki Fujimoto‚Äôs <a href="https://aftermath.site/look-back-gkids-tatsuki-fujimoto" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Look Back</em></a>, <em>100 Meters</em> follows the friendship-turned-rivalry of two friends from childhood through adolescence to adulthood as they struggle to meet their athletic goals without burning out or letting life‚Äôs challenges break them in their quest to become the absolute best in Japan‚Äôs 100-meter race.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="100 METERS | Official Trailer - In Theatres October 10" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oXeYSCXSFhs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>I spoke with director <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=186313" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kenji Iwaisawa</a> about the ingenious decision to adapt Uoto‚Äôs manga using rotoscope animation, the challenges and triumphs of its implementation, and what he hopes the film will do not just for the sport but also for establishing his studio‚Äôs presence in the realm of animation on a global scale.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Isaiah Colbert: </strong><em>100 Meters</em> follows <em>Orb: On The Movements Of The Earth</em>, another critically acclaimed work from creator Uoto, which has pushed him into mainstream recognition. What attracted you to direct <em>100 Meters</em> as your latest project? How does it stand apart from other animated works you‚Äôve helmed?</p><p><strong>Kenji Iwaisawa:</strong> I was really attracted to the world building that Uoto-sensei does in the original manga. Also, 100 meters is such a short race in a short amount of time. It‚Äôs very unusual to have that as the context of an animated movie, or anything. It‚Äôs really a first of its kind. It‚Äôs super unique, and I think that‚Äôs what really drew me into it.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Rock'N Roll Mountain/GKids</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>IC: </strong>Rotoscoping has deep roots in animation history‚Äîoften traced back to early horse motion studies. What made rotoscope animation feel like an intuitive choice for <em>100 Meters</em>, especially in capturing the kinetic intensity and emotional rhythm of running and character acting?</p><p><strong>KI: </strong>When I first started this project, I didn‚Äôt really know if rotoscoping would match it. But I think what worked out was not really when they‚Äôre racing, but, for example, the rain sequence‚Äîwhat happens before the race‚Äîor what happens after the race when they‚Äôre cooling down. I really thought rotoscoping matched those scenes better. I think that‚Äôs what works for the movie.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>IC: </strong>What was the most technically challenging sequence to animate, and what made it so demanding, either emotionally or logistically?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>KI: </strong>What was really difficult about this movie is the dialogue-heavy scenes‚Äîwhen there‚Äôs two characters talking to each other‚Äîbecause there‚Äôs no bodily movement. And there‚Äôs a lot of scenes like that where they‚Äôre just talking to each other. I really had to think about how to depict that to make it more interesting for the audience.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Rock'N Roll Mountain/GKids</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>IC:</strong> Sound design in sports films is often overlooked despite being vital to their presentation. Was there any Foley work involved to capture the specific textures of runners‚Äô footfalls, breathing, and track surfaces? How immersive did you want that sonic layer to be in <em>100 Meters</em>?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>KI: </strong>Because we use rotoscoping to take the film footage, the animation has realistic visuals. I really wanted to match the realistic visuals and have realistic sounds. This is a method that‚Äôs different from a normal animated movie. I got the live action film crew to take in the sound the way that they usually would like a sound team. I actually didn‚Äôt give them that much detailed instructions on how to take in the sound. I left it up to them, since they‚Äôre used to working on live action film.<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>IC: </strong>Did Uoto-sensei participate in the adaptation? What was his reaction upon viewing the film? Did he offer any suggestions, critiques, or goals in the lead-up to <em>100 Meters</em>‚Äô theatrical release?</p><p><strong>KI: </strong>Regarding the participation, he was really involved in the outline and script part of the film. Obviously, we couldn‚Äôt fit five volumes' worth of story into the film, so we wrote the script adapted for the film. We gave it to him, he gave us feedback, we would make adjustments, and then we‚Äôd give it back. That was repeated a couple of times, so he was pretty heavily involved in the script process.&nbsp;</p><p>As for his reaction, he really liked it. He thought it was really good. A big difference we made in the film is that we cut a lot of the monologues that the characters give when they‚Äôre running. Monologues, I think, are a specific characteristic of the manga, but he thought it was done really well, so that made me really happy.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Rock'N Roll Mountain/GKids</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>IC: </strong>Track and field is a fundamental sport, yet it‚Äôs often underrepresented in media. The film also highlights its true-to-life depiction of modest crowd sizes with seats filled with dedicated supporters. What impact do you hope <em>100 Meters</em> has on the perception of the sport, as well as Rock‚ÄôN Roll Mountain‚Äôs place in the world of animation?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>KI: </strong>Through watching <em>100 Meters</em>, if people could get interested in track and field, even if they don‚Äôt specifically get into it, if they watch this film, [and ] it adds some joy, spark, or positive impact to their daily lives, that‚Äôd be great. Rock‚ÄôN Roll Mountain, my studio, was created to support my career as a director. I think my style is unique, and I also think my works are unique too. (Laughs) So if I could continue creating works through my studio, it would be nice if everyone worldwide would know the name of my studio, hopefully.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>100 Meters</em> hits select theaters on October 10 and will be available nationwide from October 12 to October 14.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/epic-games-suing-two-fortnite-island-makers-over-inflated-bot-engagement"><h3>Epic Games Suing Two Fortnite Island Makers Over Inflated ‚ÄòBot‚Äô Engagement</h3></a><p>Epic Games says Idris Nahdi and Ayob Nasser made tens of thousands of dollars worth of ‚Äòunwarranted payouts‚Äô</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/hades-2-ending"><h3>Hades 2‚Äôs Story Doesn‚Äôt Change The Status Quo</h3></a><p>Melino√´'s journey is more about acceptance than change</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/wayward-netflix-martin"><h3>Wayward Is A Queer Exploration Of The Troubled Teen Industry</h3></a><p>Mae Martin's new Netflix show creates a *very* creepy small town</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/100-meters-gkids-anime-movie-kenji-iwaisawa-director-interview]]></content:encoded>

              <p>The next mainline <i>Resident Evil</i> game is months away, and the hype among devoted fans is likely as contagious as a well-designed Umbrella Corp. bio-weapon. <i>Requiem</i> doesn‚Äôt just look the part of a dark and violent survival horror game; the developers have made it clear that <a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-requiem-9-2-4-horror-scary-grace-2000630216"><i>Requiem </i>really wants to scare you,</a> unlike some previous <i>RE</i> titles that were more action-oriented. And with its return to the iconic series‚Äô location of Raccoon City, <i>Requiem </i>is sure to make <i>RE</i> lore enthusiasts eager to sink their teeth into every new detail it reveals in the series‚Äô larger canon.</p> <p><i>Resident Evil</i> has been with us since 1996. Since then, it‚Äôs become one of the most iconic and celebrated survival horror series out there, and deservedly so with its iconic cast of heroes and villains. Though some entries haven‚Äôt landed as well with hardcore fans, the series has arguably been riding high since 2017‚Äôs <i>Resident Evil 7 Biohazard</i>. And it didn‚Äôt stop there; a series of successful remakes of games from the series‚Äô glory years in the ‚Äò90s and 2000s have also served as reminders that when <i>Resident Evil</i> is firing on all cylinders, it‚Äôs a force to be reckoned with.</p>

 <p><i>Resident Evil: Requiem</i>, also known as <i>Resident Evil 9</i>, launches on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, <a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-requiem-switch-2-release-date-re7-2000625335">Switch 2</a>, and Windows PCs on February 27, 2026. Officially announced and shown off <a href="https://kotaku.com/re9-resident-evil-9-trailer-teaser-sgf-summer-game-fest-1851783941">during Summer Game Fest</a>, the game will follow the story of Grace Ashcroft as she revisits the nightmares of her past in her official duties as a technical analyst for the FBI.</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/a-bunch-of-resident-evil-games-are-reportedly-getting-switch-2-ports-2000624442">A Bunch Of <i>Resident Evil</i> Games Are Reportedly Getting Switch 2 Ports</a></p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-requiem-9-grace-trailer-gamescom-mother-2000618547">Grace‚Äôs past isn‚Äôt something she‚Äôs keen to relive</a>. Unlike many other <i>RE</i> protagonists, she‚Äôs hardly battle-hardened. But she‚Äôs certainly had her own experiences with the series‚Äô legendary violent threats, so she‚Äôs not a total newbie. Still,<i> Requiem</i> is ambitious for its use of a new protagonist and a return to an iconic city. So, what can we expect when the game arrives in 2026? Let‚Äôs go over everything we‚Äôve learned about this highly anticipated sequel.</p>

 <h2><i>Requiem</i> will embrace both first- and third-person</h2> <p><i>Resident Evil 7 Biohazard</i> was the first mainline <i>RE</i> game to pivot exclusively to a first-person perspective (though the series had had its share of first-person action in earlier spin-offs). Its follow-up, <i>Village</i>, started off in first-person but eventually introduced a third-person option. <a href="https://kotaku.com/re9-resident-evil-requiem-first-third-person-option-ps5-1851784320"><i>Requiem</i> will allow you to switch between first- and third-person perspectives at launch</a>.</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/re9-resident-evil-requiem-first-third-person-option-ps5-1851784320"><i>Resident Evil 9</i> Lets You Swap Between First-Person And Third-Person Whenever You Want</a></p> <p><i>Biohazard</i> made a compelling case for <i>RE</i> in first-person (even if it did feel like an answer to <a href="https://kotaku.com/od-hideo-kojima-productions-silent-hill-pt-game-awards-1851089141">Hideo Kojima‚Äôs wildly popular <i>Silent Hills</i> demo</a> that <a href="https://kotaku.com/nobody-actually-knows-how-they-solved-the-silent-hill-t-1621044581">had everyone terrified at the time</a>), so it feels appropriate for the series to carry on with it. But after three remakes (<i>2</i>, <i>3</i>, and <i>4</i>), it‚Äôs clear that surviving <i>RE</i>‚Äôs environments in third-person is also a treat. How then, could we possibly choose between them?</p>

 <p>The gameplay sounds promising. Thanks to a playable demo available during Gamescom earlier this year, some folks got a taste of the action. It seems clear that first-person amplifies the fear, but third-person will still be a spooky good time.</p>

  <p>The demo featured a flashback scene in which Grace is without a gun to wield and the experience to wield it. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-9-requiem-hands-on-preview"><i>IGN</i>‚Äôs Matt Kim</a> described a chase sequence in which Grace has nothing but empty bottles to throw at one of <i>RE</i>‚Äôs most terrifying creatures yet.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/onimusha-way-sword-pragmata-resident-evil-9-preview-2000618849"><i>Kotaku</i>‚Äôs Kenneth Shepard described his time</a> with the demo as featuring more ‚Äúhide-and-seek horror‚Äù than the likes of the series‚Äô eighth entry, <i>Resident Evil Village</i>. ‚ÄúIt felt like the game had been stripped down to its core elements to leave you with a terrifying helplessness.‚Äù</p> <h2><i>Requiem</i> is about ‚Äòaddictive fear‚Äô</h2> <p>In a special <a href="https://youtu.be/-hiC3qpghP0">‚ÄòCreators‚Äô Message‚Äô video from Capcom last June</a>, <i>Requiem</i>‚Äôs director Koshi Nakanishi described the philosophy behind <i>Requiem</i>, and it‚Äôs all about establishing an emotional contour that fans of survival horror know very well:</p>

 <blockquote><p>Our core concept for this game was ‚Äúaddictive fear.‚Äù There‚Äôs something about the catharsis you get from overcoming your fears. It creates an addiction that makes you want to do more, to play more. That intense focus, while scary, makes for a really fun game. This served as our launching point for <i>Requiem</i>.</p></blockquote> <p>While <i>RE</i> has largely course-corrected itself back toward horror starting with <i>Biohazard</i> in 2017, this is still music to the ears of us survival horror fans. Of <i>RE</i>‚Äôs large cast of characters, many are exceedingly proficient with firearms and, by now, are well acquainted with surviving hordes of zombies and lumbering giants eager to stalk them. Grace, then, with her comparative lack of experience, enters as a way to allow players‚Äô fears to synergize with the character‚Äôs emotional state.</p> <h2><i>Requiem</i> wants to avoid just letting you shoot your way through zombies</h2> <p>Originally, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/resident-evil-requiems-decision-to-scrap-leon-kennedy-as-a-playable-character-shows-the-franchise-is-finally-stepping-away-from-hardened-and-stoic-protagonists/">Capcom thought to center series legend Leon Kennedy</a>, the main character of <i>RE4</i> and co-protagonist of <i>RE2</i> and <i>6</i>, in <i>Requiem</i>. But given how experienced (and likely PTSD-ridden) Kennedy is, it didn‚Äôt seem to be a good fit. In the ‚ÄúCreator‚Äôs Message‚Äù video from last summer, Nakanishi said of Leon Kennedy:</p>

 <blockquote><p>Making a horror game based around [Leon] is difficult. He wouldn‚Äôt jump at something like a bucket falling. No one wants to see Leon scared by every little thing. So he‚Äôs actually quite a bad match for horror.</p></blockquote> <p>That‚Äôs how we got our new girl, Grace, as our protagonist for <i>Requiem</i>. But though we have a fresh face ready to scream in terror, <i>Requiem</i> is hoping to avoid just building up to a shooting spree with every baddie. ‚ÄúOf course, there will be boss battles,‚Äù <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/resident-evil-requiems-boss-battles-will-be-more-like-the-originals-and-re2s-but-will-still-include-several-new-combat-options/">Nakashi told <i>Automaton</i></a> in a joint interview at Tokyo Game Show this year. He continued:</p> <blockquote><p>However, rather than defeating enemies in a flashy manner as you progress through the game, like in games that emphasize gun-shooting action, the style is more like <i>Resident Evil </i>and <i>Resident Evil 2</i>, where players expand their exploration area in a closed space and overcome obstacles using their wits.</p></blockquote> <h2><i>Requiem</i> sounds like a perfect excuse to go back and play every <i>Resident Evil</i> game</h2> <p><i>Requiem</i> will arrive just before <i>Resident Evil</i> celebrates its 30th birthday. Director Nakanishi has stated that the title itself is intended ‚Äúto mark a milestone in the series‚Äù with its return to Raccoon City, where everything in the game‚Äôs fictional universe started. The team sees the game as a ‚Äúrequiem, a eulogy to those who came before.‚Äù</p>  <p>So if there was ever a <i>Resident Evil</i> game to make you go back and play through the series to prepare, it sounds like <i>Requiem</i>, arriving just before the series‚Äô third decade, is the game to do that with.</p>

 <h2>Hey, what about those rumors you‚Äôre seeing on the internet?</h2> <p>If you have a working internet connection and the ability to type <i>Resident Evil: Requiem</i> into a search bar, you‚Äôve likely seen alleged leaks and speculation about the game. Video games are fertile ground for wild theories and some folks have gone a little overboard with such things.&nbsp; <i>Requiem</i>‚Äôs producer, Masata Kumazawa, is well aware of this.</p> <p><a href="https://www.thegamer.com/resident-evil-requiem-director-reveals-who-mysterious-hooded-character-is/">In an interview with <i>The Gamer</i></a>, Kumazawa said the following:</p> <blockquote><p>I would like everyone to remember, let‚Äôs calm down a bit‚Äìwhat we‚Äôve shown you so far is everything we can say. People get frustrated with us, because even though we didn‚Äôt promise things, the rumors and theories were such that they were widely believed.</p></blockquote> <p>So yeah, the game ain‚Äôt that far away. Let‚Äôs relax with the speculation.</p> <hr> <p>Speaking for myself, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve been this excited about a <i>Resident Evil</i> game since <i>RE4</i>. Hopefully the game lives up to that excitement when it arrives in February of 2026. Now, if you‚Äôll excuse me, I have a few missing entries in the <i>Resident Evil</i> catalog to catch up on.</p>

                <p>Microsoft recently announced a major Xbox Game Pass price hike, but it's not going into effect right away in the US or abroad. Back when the<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-price-hike-announced-now-costs-30-month-for-ultimate/1100-6535138/" data-ref-id="1100-6535138"> 50% price hike for Game Pass Ultimate was announced on October 1</a>, people got emails from Microsoft saying when the change would happen for them, and for some people in the US, the price hike <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1974245210319196227" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wasn't set to go into effect until November.</a></p><p>Now, it's been confirmed that Microsoft will allow people to keep their existing membership rates in certain countries outside the US, so long as they do not cancel. If they do, the price will go up. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/794032/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-price-changes-countries" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge confirmed with Microsoft</a> that the price increase only affects users in Austria, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Korea, Poland, and India if they cancel and then sign up again.</p><p>"At this time, these increases will only affect new purchases and will not affect your current subscription for the market in which you reside, as long as you are on an auto-recurring plan," Microsoft said in an email to subscribers in those regions. "Should you choose to cancel your plan and repurchase, you will be charged at the new current rate."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAEKqYgIu4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9wAEKqYgIu4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>A spokesperson for Microsoft told The Verge members in the regions mentioned above can continue renewing at their existing price, but only "for now." This is due to "local requirements," Microsoft said. The email sent to members said they will be notified "at least 60 days in advance" of a price change. Given that, people in those regions shouldn't expect to pay the higher rates for at least a couple months.</p><p>In the US, existing subscriber should expect to begin paying the higher rates on November 4, Microsoft told The Verge. New subscribers in the US, however, must pay $30/month for Ultimate right now.</p><p>Also worth noting is that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-ultimate-is-still-20-at-gamestop-and-many-other-retailers/1100-6535162/" data-ref-id="1100-6535162">numerous retailers in the US continue to sell Game Pass Ultimate for $20</a>, so people who want to keep their membership and pay less should grab those while they still can.</p><p>Microsoft is jacking up Game Pass Ultimate prices just ahead of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>'s release on November 14. As a result, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playing-new-call-of-duty-games-on-game-pass-just-got-more-expensive/1100-6535141/" data-ref-id="1100-6535141">playing Call of Duty on Game Pass just got a lot more expensive. </a></p>

Those missions are Restart the Power Plant on the Geothermal map, Spray The Greenhouse in the Agricultural map, and Secure The Specimen in the Biomedical map. Players also have access to four tools with those being the motion detector, hacking device, tranquilizer gun, and and a med kit. Following on from today, there will be monthly mini updates which will add two story events, three sub missions, three items, and bug fixes. In the future, the Allosaurus will be added along with two more maps with associated missions, more story events, proximity chat, and two more loadout items. Even further down the line, more enemies will be added with even more story events, maps, missions, items, and collectables.</p>
<p>In Deathground, teams of up to four players have to work together to complete the missions while trying to survive the threat of dinosaurs that are hunting them. Deathground was first announced back in 2020, so it has been a long journey for the game to stomp on to Steam.</p>

<p>More reveals coming next week</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>If you've played <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/vampire_survivors">Vampire Survivors</a> with a friend in local co-op, then you know how chaotic things can get. Heck, if you've played enough of it on your own and come up with a ridiculous screen-filling build, then you've seen how far you can push the limits.</p>
<p>Well, poncle is <em>finally</em> adding online co-op to the "bullet heaven" game in version 1.14, which is coming this Autumn. Up to four players will be able to join a room and fight their way through various Vampire Survivors stages.</p>
<p>But it's only the first in a line of updates that the developer will be revealing over the course of the next month ‚Äî with the next reveal coming "next week". Four more updates are coming, so we're waiting with bated (garlic) breath.</p>
<p>For now, here's a rundown of online co-op:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Online Co-Op is coming to Vampire Survivors this Autumn on PC and consoles!</p>
<p>Play online with up to 3 other friends from around the world, just as Poe Ratcho intended. (That‚Äôs 4 players in total!)</p>
<p>Free roam the stages whilst your friend struggles to find their way through Astral Stair, or maybe see if you can all survive Room 1665‚Ä¶ More players doesn‚Äôt make it easier, or does it?</p>
<p>Autumn is our time to shine, so be sure to come back next week to see what the following card will reveal‚Ä¶ we might finally answer a burning question that has been asked thousands of times</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The game's last free update added <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/switch-2-owners-might-want-to-check-out-this-handy-update-for-vampire-survivors">cross-save to the Switch version back in June 2025</a>. And in April, Square Enix teamed up with Square Enix to make a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/vampire-survivors-and-square-enix-team-up-for-free-dlc-but-its-not-the-series-youd-expect">SaGa-themed DLC</a>.</p>
<p>Will we get a good ol' Switch 2 Edition? Mouse controls? Time will tell!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, NVIDIA announced the availability of the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/campaigns/arc-raiders-bundle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders GeForce RTX 50 Series bundle</a>. Purchasing a qualifying NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090, 5080, 5070 Ti, 5070 desktop or GPU, or laptop with a GeForce RTX 5090 Laptop GPU, RTX 5080 Laptop GPU, RTX 5070 Ti Laptop GPU, or RTX 5070 Laptop GPU at select retailers and digital stores will provide access to the upcoming PvPvE extraction shooter.</p>



<p>More specifically, users will receive a digital code to unlock ARC Raiders Deluxe Edition plus Astro Cosmetic Pack, which comes with the following goodies:</p>



<p><strong><em>The Wanderer Cosmetic Pack</em></strong></p>

The best (and pretty much <em>only</em>) solution is to buy an expansion card from Seagate or Western Digital. You can store Xbox games on a USB external hard drive, yes, but you‚Äôll need to re-transfer them to the system‚Äôs internal storage to play them. An expansion card allows you to play games from your library without having to move anything around.</p><p>Fortunately, you can pick up a <strong>512GB WD Black C50 expansion card</strong> for $85.99 ($8 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/WD_Black-Expansion-Officially-Licensed-Consoles/dp/B0C44B1VSH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, which is its second-lowest price since May. <strong>Western Digital‚Äôs 1TB expansion card</strong> is on sale for around $119.99 ($30 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/WD_Black-Expansion-Officially-Licensed-Consoles/dp/B0C44XVWCH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fwd-c50-1tb-storage-expansion-card-for-xbox-series-xs-gaming-console-ssd-black%2FJXJ62C6RX8" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>, which is its lowest price since July, though it‚Äôs $20 shy of beating that price.</p><p><strong>Seagate‚Äôs storage expansion card</strong>, meanwhile, starts in a 1TB configuration, and is discounted to around $123.49 ($30.50 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Storage-Expansion-Solid-State/dp/B08K3S6WJM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fseagate-1tb-storage-expansion-card-for-xbox-series-xs-internal-nvme-ssd-black%2FJ37C5HZ2W7" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>, which is lower than it was last Prime Day.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Current Game Pass Ultimate subscribers <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-price-hike-cod-2000632122">are getting hit with the new 50-percent price hike</a> on November 4, but only in some countries. Microsoft recently confirmed that fans in places like Poland and Korea can remain at the lower monthly price if they stay subscribed. Not so for Xbox users in the U.S.</p> <p>The confusion started when some fans started sharing the emails they‚Äôd received from Microsoft about Game Pass Ultimate going from $20 a month to $30. While some of those messages informed players about a price hike they‚Äôd see next time they renewed their subscription, others were told the pricing wouldn‚Äôt change unless they ended their subscriptions and later resumed them. Microsoft has now confirmed that the delay is only for users in some markets like Austria, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Korea, Poland, and India. Players in the U.S. and UK will see the changes take affect as planned on November 4.</p>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Is that one real. I got one saying tough it‚Äôs going up. <a href="https://t.co/EHbqiWvCr8">pic.twitter.com/EHbqiWvCr8</a></p> <p>‚Äî I play games (@G_Obertron) <a href="https://twitter.com/G_Obertron/status/1975558838607839518?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <div> <p>‚ÄúOur recent Game Pass update remains unchanged. Current subscribers in certain countries will continue renewing at their existing price for now, in line with local requirements. We‚Äôll provide advance notice before price adjustments take effect in these countries,‚Äù Kari Perez, head of Xbox communications, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/794032/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-price-changes-countries">told <em>The Verge</em></a> in a new statement.</p> <p>Why the discrepancy? Some have been speculating it has to do with local laws restricting how companies can hike subscription prices and the amount of heads-up they have to give consumers. Either way, it‚Äôs a bummer for any Xbox fan in the U.S. who thought they might be getting an unexpected reprieve from the latest Xbox price hikes. Microsoft also recently confirmed that Game Pass subscribers are <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-ops-7-game-pass-call-duty-points-discount-changes-2000631483">no longer eligible for 10 percent off of DLC</a> and other add-on content. That perk‚Äôs been replaced by an overhauled rewards program.</p> </div>

The daily puzzle is still hugely popular. Last year, it was played 5.3 billion times, up from 4.8 billion in 2023.

      <div><p>Today, the Shift RPG Kickstarter project has gone live. This new TTRPG, published by Hit Point Press, aims to be a more accessible experience for players new to the hobby. It' a pitch that is paying off since the project was fully funded the day of launch.</p>



<p>According to the official <em>Shift RPG</em> Kickstarter <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/shiftrpg/shift-rpg/description" rel="nofollow">campaign page</a>, this new TTRPG is designed to bring a rich experience to the table without hundreds of pages of rules or additional supplements. On the GM side, it is designed to be less cumbersome thanks to streamlined rules.</p>

These are a series of micro-settings with enough detail to get players' imaginations going. These micro settings are designed by industry creatives. The ones mentioned in the campaign a sci-fi western world by Carlos Cisco (<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/daggerheart-review-narrative-forward-yes-and-ttrpg-that-is-force-to-be-reckoned" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Daggerheart</em></a>), and a post-apocalyptic setting by Joseph Carriker (Fantasy AGE).</p>

<p>The Shift RPG Kickstarter is transparent with its influences in the campaign page. It cites various genre properties as inspiration for its atmosphere and fiction such as Transformers, Batman: The Animated Series, and classic Final Fantasy, but mechanic-lite, storytelling rich TTRPG systems like <em>FATE Core</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/john-harper-announces-blades-in-dark-deep-cuts-ttrpgs-first-official-supplement" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Blades in the Dark</em></a>, and <em>Mothership</em>.</p>

<p>The fundamental system involves the Trait and Shift Die mechanic. Traits represents a character, vehicle, item, or monster's strengths and weaknesses. Those strengths and weaknesses determine what Shift Die you use to resolve a skill test, which ranges from a D4 to a D12. A 1,2, or 3 is a success, which means the lower the die face, the better. But if you roll the highest number on your die, the die face goes up.</p>

<p>The different pledge tiers for the Shift RPG Kickstarter are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Print'N'Play PDF for $19:</strong> A digital copy of&nbsp; the game, a set of three reference sheets, and all unlocked PDF stretch goals</li>
	<li><strong>Softcover Book for $29:</strong> Everything from Print'N'Play tier, and a physical softcover copy of the game</li>
	<li><strong>Hardcover Book for $39:</strong> Everything from the Print'N'Play tier, and a physical hardcover copy of the game</li>
	<li><strong>Deluxe Hardcover Book for $59:</strong> Everything from the Print'N'Play tier, and a deluxe physical hardcover copy of the game illustrated by Elliot&nbsp; Bouriot</li>
	<li><strong>Shift Starter Box for $65:</strong> Everything from the Print'N'Play tier, and a Starter Set box that includes a physical hardcover copy of the game, a set of 3 notepads, and a GM Screen</li>

</ul><p>At the time of writing, the <em>Shift RPG</em> Kickstarter has raised&nbsp;$27,169, more than five times its initial funding goal of $5,000. The campaign concludes on November 6.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The year is 2025. An entertainment industrial complex once riding high on a new generation of bankable stars and fresh IP now faces increasing decline and desperation as it strip-mines what remains of its old energy reserves. Enter <em>Tron: Ares</em>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-tron-3-ad-features-mr-beast-tron-ares-disney-2000623530">a fall blockbuster that seems to exist entirely</a> to breathe new life into an old franchise and that accidentally commits the company‚Äôs latest act of stomach-turning necromancy instead. The first wave of reviews is in, and it does not paint a very flattering picture of Jared Leto‚Äôs latest vessel for renewed relevance.</p> <p><em>Tron: Ares</em> (2025) is a sequel to <em>Tron: Legacy</em> (2010) which was a follow-up to the original<em> Tron</em> (1982). It features Leto as the titular Ares, an advanced program sent by a defense contractor into the real world to attack a gaming company in a race to perfect a technology that can make digital objects exist in real life. Leto is essentially a <a href="https://x.com/thelegacyofnerd/status/1975228908862894321?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet"><em>Fortnite</em> skin come to life</a>&nbsp;fighting in a live-service turf war between competing metaverses, except eventually he joins the side of the good guys, including Jeff Bridges and his son. Gillian Anderson is also in this one.</p>

 <p>Forces within Hollywood have been trying to make this movie for a while. Leto was reportedly central <a href="https://gizmodo.com/tron-ares-set-visit-jared-leto-greta-lee-lightcycle-2000652340">to finally making it happen</a>. It was directed by Joachim R√∏nning, best known for the seminal 2019 fairy tale reimagining<em> Maleficent: Mistress of Evil</em>. The results with <em>Tron: Ares</em>, out October 10, probably could have been a lot worse, but by all accounts, they still aren‚Äôt great.</p>

 <p>‚ÄúThere is no drama or jeopardy or human interest anywhere,‚Äù writes Peter Bradshaw for<em> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/oct/07/tron-ares-review-gillian-anderson-sci-fi-jeff-bridges-jared-leto">The Guardian</a></em>. ‚ÄúThis franchise now looks about as urgently contemporary as an in-car CD player.‚Äù Alison Willmore was not much more impressed at <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/review-tron-ares-doesnt-realize-its-depressing.html"><em>Vulture</em></a>. ‚ÄúR√∏nning does get his own kick-ass score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, all ominous throbbing, but can‚Äôt come up with anything visually distinctive,‚Äù she wrote.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tron-ares-review"><em>IGN</em></a> considered the movie mid overall but adored the soundtrack. ‚Äú<em>Tron: Ares</em> is getting a 5. And honestly, I bumped it up from a 4 just because of Nine Inch Nails,‚Äù wrote <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tron-ares-review">Clint </a><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tron-ares-review">Gage</a>. <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/sci-fi-movies/tron-ares-review/"><em>Gamesradar</em></a> gave the movie 2.5 stars out of five, dinging it in part for Leto‚Äôs performance, with Emily Garbutt calling him ‚Äúthoroughly unconvincing as AI-with-a-heart Ares.‚Äù</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.polygon.com/tron-ares-review-jared-leto-jeff-bridges/"><em>Polygon</em></a> was let down by what critic Samantha Nelson saw as the paint-by-numbers storytelling, though she found the overall vibes more entertaining. ‚ÄúThe Daft Punk soundtrack was the best part of <em>Tron: Legacy</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>and the Nine Inch Nails album written for&nbsp;<em>Tron: Ares&nbsp;</em>similarly elevates even lackluster scenes,‚Äù writes Nelson. ‚ÄúThere are haunting sequences that evoke Vangelis‚Äô <em>Blade Runner&nbsp;</em>score and more propulsive tracks that perfectly complement the fast-paced action.‚Äù</p>

 <p>And not everyone found Leto so ill-suited to the role, though whether or not that‚Äôs a good thing is up for debate. ‚ÄúLeto‚Äôs performance works because he‚Äôs so utterly believable as a soulless ghoul that it‚Äôs easy to buy into the happy-to-be-here warmth of his emergent humanity,‚Äù writes David Ehrlich for <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/tron-ares-movie-review-1235154526/"><em>IndieWire</em></a>. ‚ÄúSure, the movie‚Äôs idea of ‚Äúemergent humanity‚Äù is limited to Ares‚Äô deep appreciation for Depeche Mode (who the security program rightly appraises as being superior to Mozart), but these days that‚Äôs more humanity than a lot of people could ever hope to muster.‚Äù</p>

 <p><a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/tron-ares-review-1236542140/"><em>Variety</em></a>‚Äòs Peter Debruge ultimately blames former Disney studio exec Sean Bailey for the ambitious misfire. ‚ÄúAs president of production at Disney, Bailey effectively pillaged the company‚Äôs back catalog (he was responsible for so many of those live-action remakes, franchise reboots and theme park adaptations),‚Äù he writes. ‚ÄúWhile it was exciting to see what <em>Tron</em> might look like in the 21st century, the brand gets in the way of Ares‚Äô internal evolution‚Ä¶there‚Äôs a sense that <em>Tron: Ares</em> has too much nostalgia to service, from the cobwebby re-creation of Flynn‚Äôs arcade-basement office to Bridges‚Äô extended cameo (as a drawling, laid-back Dude who sounds less like Flynn than his <em>Big Lebowski</em> character).‚Äù</p> <p>A parody news post claiming Leto <a href="https://twitter.com/DiscussingFish/status/1975205738416128324">had sex with AI</a> to prepare for the movie spread on social media yesterday. It was false, obviously, but maybe <em>Tron: Ares</em> would have turned out more interesting if he actually had.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Everyone deserves a pair of headphones that are comfortable to wear and sound great that doesn‚Äôt cost a ton of cash. Well you can have it all with the Sony WH-CH520 wireless Bluetooth on-ear headphones. They come in a wide array of fun colors and are dirt cheap, right now at least. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4594/">Normally going for $70, it‚Äôs down more than 46% to just $38. You‚Äôll save a whole $32.</a></p>
<p>I‚Äôve really got to applaud Sony on the brand‚Äôs naming scheme choices. You take a look at Apple and its flagship over-hear headphones are given a flashy name like the AirPods Max. Samsung‚Äôs line of earbuds are predictably the Galaxy Bus. But Sony? Nah. These are The WH-CH520. No sauce, just the meat ‚Äî but it‚Äôs good meat.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4594/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Pick between six stylish colors. The Sony WH-CH520 come in your classic black and white, but also in fun varieties like blue, yellow, pink, and cappuccino.</p>
<p>The headphones are super lightweight and the synthetic materials around the earcups are soft. You can comfortably wear them all day without taking them off. The band includes a plush head cushion. Some real bad pairs of headphones will create that awkward pressure right at the top of your head where it makes contact. That‚Äôs not a problem here.</p>



<h2>All-Day Listening</h2>
<p>And you really can wear them all day long with the super long battery life. One chare will last your an impressive 50 hours. Charging is fast too. If you find you‚Äôve forgotten to plug them in before a big trip and you‚Äôre rushing out the door, no sweat. A miniscule three minute charge will bring them back up to a whole 90 minutes of listening time. You can plug them in while brushing your teeth and then be good to go.</p>
<p>Take hands-free calls when wearing the Sony WH-CH520 headphones. Your phone can stay in your pocket the next time it buzzes as you accept the call. Built-in microphones are able to isolate your voice from any distracting background noise so this way folks on the other end hear you and only you.</p>
<p>Multi-point Bluetooth allows you to connect the headphones to two different devices simultaneously. Pair them with both your phone and laptop. This way you can be listening to Spotify off the computer while you‚Äôre working or maybe be watching a YouTube video with lunch, then when someone calls you one your phone, you can seamlessly switch over and have the call come through the headphones. You can even play a podcast or music off your phone while also paired with your gaming console to make the grind more enjoyable.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4594/">For a limited time, grab these Sony WH-CH520 Bluetooth Headphones for the reduced price of $38.</a></p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Silent Hill 2 Remake Everything To Know</p>
      </div>
<p>Like the 2001 original game, the Silent Hill 2 remake puts players in control of James Sunderland, a man who is lured to Silent Hill by a letter seemingly written by his late wife, Mary, three years after she died. But instead of a loving reunion, James finds a personal hellscape of his own creation. That story also serves as a basis for the upcoming live-action sequel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/return-to-silent-hill-will-hit-theaters-in-early-2026/1100-6532537/" data-ref-id="1100-6532537">Return to Silent Hill</a>, which will be out in theaters on January 23, 2026.</p><p>Earlier this year, Konami announced that Bloober Team signed on for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-remake-seemingly-teased-by-bloober-team/1100-6532382/" data-ref-id="1100-6532382">a remake of the original Silent Hill</a>, the 1999 PlayStation game that kicked off the franchise. Following the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/cronos-the-new-dawn/">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, Bloober Team CEO Piotr Babieno shared his desire to see <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-2-and-cronos-studio-wants-nintendo-to-become-the-scariest-place-in-gaming-again/1100-6534370/" data-ref-id="1100-6534370">more horror games on Nintendo Switch 2</a>.</p><p>The most recent game in the series, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hill-f/" data-ref-id="5000-574203">Silent Hill f</a>, was released last month and hit <a href="https://x.com/silenthill_jp/status/1972577585558433936" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">1 million in sales after its first 24 hours</a>.
