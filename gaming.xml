            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Boy howdy, there sure are a lot of<a href="https://kotaku.com/yakuza-like-a-dragon-the-kotaku-review-1845822473"><em> Yakuza/Like A Dragon</em></a> games to play! Perhaps, like so many others, you’ve been wanting to hop into the elaborate and wild franchise all about Japanese gangsters and bizarre side characters. Well, a big ol’ <em>Yakuza</em> franchise sale, happening now on Steam, might help you finally check out this popular series.</p> <p>20 years ago, in 2005, the very first <em>Yakuza</em> game launched on PS2. Since then, there have been over a dozen entries in the franchise, including remasters, re-releases, spin-offs, and even a weird non-canonical entry featuring zombies. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/LikeaDragonFranchiseSale2025">And (almost) all of those games are currently on sale on Steam</a> as part of a big <em>Yakuza</em> franchise sale that ends on October 23.</p>

 <p>I say almost, because the zombies spin-off, <a href="https://kotaku.com/prepare-to-yakuza-in-2012-with-dead-souls-452566043"><em>Yakuza Dead Souls</em></a>, isn’t included as it has never been ported to PC. The other odd duck here is<em> Yakuza 3 Remastered</em>, which isn’t on sale despite being included in the sales event page. Perhaps Sega made a mistake, and it will be marked down to $11 like most of the other <em>Yakuza</em> games in the sale. Who can say? Regardless, if you’ve been waiting to hop into the <em>Yakuza</em> series, this is a great time to snag a few (or all!) of the games and start enjoying them. As former <em>Kotaku</em> writer Luke Plunkett recommended in the past, <a href="https://kotaku.com/what-yakuza-games-to-play-after-yakuza-0-1792025738">you should probably start with <em>Yakuza 0</em></a> if you’re hopping into the series for the very first time. After that, check out <em>Yakuza</em> <em>Kiwami</em> and <em>Kiwami 2</em>.</p> <p>Here are all the games currently on sale as part of the ongoing <em>Yakuza/Like A Dragon</em> sales event:</p> <ul> <li><em>Yakuza 0</em> – $11 ($20)</li> <li><em>Yakuza Kiwami</em> – $11 ($20)</li> <li><em>Yakuza Kiwami 2</em> – $11 ($20)</li> <li><em>Yakuza 3 Remastered</em> – $20 – Not on sale… I guess??</li> <li><em>Yakuza 4 Remastered</em> – $11 ($20)</li> <li><em>Yakuza 5 Remastered</em> – $10 ($20)</li> <li><em>Yakuza 6: The Song of Life</em> – $11 ($20)</li> <li><em>Yakuza Complete Series</em> Bundle (0-6) – $77 ($140)</li> <li><em>Yakuza: Like A Dragon</em> – $8 ($20)</li> <li><em>Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth</em> – $21 ($70)</li> <li><em>Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name</em> -$18 ($50)</li> <li><em>Like A Dragon: Ishin!</em> – $12 ($60)</li> <li><em>Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza In Hawaii</em> – $33 ($60)</li> <li><em>Judgment</em> – $12 ($40)</li> <li><em>Lost Judgment</em> – $15 ($60)</li> </ul>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stop-what-you%E2%80%99re-doing-in-pok%C3%A9mon-legends-z-a-and-go-to-this-museum.1327114/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I’m very early in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-shiny-hunting-despawn-sound-effect-2000636142"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a><span>, but I just found something in Lumiose City I had to tell somebody about, or I might explode. The RPG’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-small-boring-map-how-big-time-to-walk-around-2000636148"><span>map is small</span></a><span>, but if you’re not looking in every corner, you might miss a hole-in-the-wall establishment that could enrich the game for you. That’s what nearly happened to me, but luckily, I did stumble upon the Lumiose Museum in the northeast corner of the city.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000636163" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636163"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636163">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure>  <p><span>If you’ve played <i>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</i>, you’re gonna want to stop by this place and check out one of this museum’s exhibits. As I passed by, a citizen remarked that it had a showcase of artifacts from the Hisui region, which was enough to make me spin on my heel and beeline into the building. </span><i><span>Arceus </span></i><span>players will know that Hisui is the previous name of the Sinnoh region from </span><i><span>Diamond </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Pearl</span></i><span>, and the historical setting of the last </span><i><span>Legends</span></i><span> game. Anyone who played </span><i><span>Arceus </span></i><span>to the end knows </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-arceus-story-dlc-lucas-dawn-ingo-volo-1850415489"><span>it ended on a bittersweet cliffhanger</span></a><span> that seemingly doomed its isekai’d main character and others to a primitive point in history, even while they had friends, family, and Pokémon waiting for them in the present day. However, the Lumiose Museum’s exhibit may give us at least a few details about what happened after </span><i><span>Arceus</span></i><span>’ conclusion.</span></p>

 <p><span>Once you’re there, head to the second floor and you’ll see several familiar artifacts from the Hisui region. There are hieroglyphics of legendary Sinnoh Pokémon, hand-crafted early Poké Balls, and a few outfits previously worn by characters like </span><i><span>Arceus</span></i><span>’ protagonist, the surprise villain Volo, and Commander Kamado, an ancestor of Professor Rowan from </span><i><span>Diamond </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Pearl</span></i><span>. While we don’t see anything belonging to him, one of the displays mentions a man named Ingo who would train people in Jubilife Village in the ways of Pokémon battles, but long-time fans will know that he was much more than that.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000636162" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636162"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636162">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Ingo made his debut in </span><i><span>Pokémon Black </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>White </span></i><span>as an elite trainer at the Battle Subway alongside his brother Emmet. His appearance in </span><i><span>Arceus</span></i><span> indicated he’d been shot through time just as the protagonist had been, only to have gradually forgotten his previous life in the modern day. It was an incredibly dark and tragic fate for a Pokémon character, and because </span><i><span>Arceus </span></i><span>ended without either of these displaced trainers going back home, fans have spent the past three years assuming they lived out the rest of their lives in Hisui and never saw their loved ones again. In the case of Ingo, at least, that doesn’t seem to be the case.</span></p>

 <p><span>The diagram of Ingo’s old training grounds has an accompanying text that says Ingo one day “simply vanished” after telling the people of Jubilife that it was “time for [him] to return.” Though we haven’t seen Ingo in any games since, it sounds like he did get to go home to his brother and friends eventually.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000636161" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636161"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636161">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The long-lost time traveler isn’t the only character we get an update on in the exhibit. Volo, the ancestor of </span><i><span>Diamond </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Pearl </span></i><span>champion Cynthia and a surprise religious zealot intent on usurping Arceus’ power for himself, also gets an epilogue of sorts in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>. You can find his final boss outfit in a glass case next to statues of legendary Pokémon Palkia and Dialga, and one of the museum’s patrons says that the person who wore it donated it to the exhibit personally. He also apparently looked at some of the sketches on display “with this nostalgic air,” implying that Volo has, somehow, persisted into the modern day. Is he time-traveling? Is he immortal? Will we see his crazy ass again? I have so many new questions.</span></p> <p><span>Whatever happened to Volo and Ingo, it also stands to reason that </span><i><span>Arceus</span></i><span>’ protagonist was likely able to return to the modern day as well, though I haven’t been able to find any direct mention of their whereabouts. Their uniform is on display here, though. So one way or another, history has not forgotten them and what they accomplished in Hisui all those years ago.</span></p>

<p>If a new Nintendo patent is true, we may be seeing DS games on the Nintendo Switch 2 soon.</p>



<p>Released earlier this year, the Nintendo Switch 2 has become one of Nintendo’s best-selling consoles. With its catalog growing each month, with the latest being <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-hands-on-preview-the-new-battle-system-could-become-the-new-standard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, there’s a lot to enjoy. For those who pine for the past, the Nintendo Switch Online brings a treasure trove of classic titles from the Game Boy and N64. Even with the most recent addition, Virtual Boy, being outside the box, it seems it may get ever crazier and cooler, thanks to a newly discovered patent.</p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-ds-games-may-be-next-for-nintendo-switch-online-with-new-patent">Nintendo DS Games May Be Next for Nintendo Switch Online With New Patent</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Nintendo DS coming to NSO Confirmed! Patent Discovery of a lifetime! Breaking News! The following patent shows how Nintendo will manage the dual screen situation on Switch 2. You will have 3 options. <br>1. Dual Screen (Parent screen, child screen)<br>2. Single Screen Mode (Picture in… <a href="https://t.co/MH1Ytv4Kfo">pic.twitter.com/MH1Ytv4Kfo</a></p>— Mike Odyssey (@MikeOdysseyYT) <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeOdysseyYT/status/1978839968895074613?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 16, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In a post from user <a href="https://x.com/MikeOdysseyYT/status/1978839968895074613" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MikeOdysseyYT</a>, they discovered a new patent from Nintendo. The images they provided show the Nintendo Switch drawn up to have a second screen show up during gameplay. What’s interesting is that each image correlates to one of the ways you could do a dual screen, like picture-in-picture and dual screen. While it could just be for new mechanics, it’s more than likely that it’s a possible way to bring Nintendo DS titles to the console. </p>



<p>For many, the Nintendo DS was home to dozens of amazing titles and one of the coolest ways to experience a game. If true, it’ll be interesting to see how it plays in action. Most games on the DS used the second screen for a map or, in Pokémon’s case, the action menu. Given it’ll likely be all Nintendo-branded titles, they’ll likely tweak some things here and there to make it look good, much like they did for the other NSO games. As it is a patent, nothing is yet confirmed by Nintendo, so be wary.</p>

                <p>Earlier this month, Microsoft announced a substantial price increase for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. If you're a subscriber in the US, you will now be charged $30/month, a $10 bump from the previous $20/month rate. The new price is effective immediately, so you may have already paid the increased rate if you were billed already this month. That said, there is a way to avoid the price increase: prepaid codes. The price of prepaid membership codes hasn't changed--at least not yet. Over at Amazon, you can <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership/dp/B07TGNFVWV?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">get Xbox Game Pass Ultimate 3-Month Membership codes for $55</a></strong> (was $60), which breaks down to $18.33/month. Based on Microsoft's new subscription price, you're <strong>saving $35 across three months</strong>.</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership/dp/B07TFP7JFH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">1-Month prepaid codes are sold for $20</a> at Amazon, so you're saving an additional five bucks every three months with Amazon's deal. Amazon's prepaid codes can be redeemed by existing and new subscribers with a US Xbox account. Once you enter a prepaid code, your next billing date is pushed. So if you redeem a 3-Month Membership in October, you won't be billed again by Microsoft until January.</p><p>The discount on prepaid codes becomes more glaring if you buy multiple. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate can be stacked up to 36 months. For instance, if you were to buy four prepaid 3-Month codes, you'd save $140 on a full year of Game Pass Ultimate. Here's a breakdown of the savings from buying Amazon's prepaid code deal versus subscribing directly through Microsoft. Note: The numbers in the Amazon column are based on the 3-Month Membership deal, but even if the price jumps back to $60, you're still saving a ton of cash.</p><h3>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate: Microsoft Store vs. Prepaid Codes</h3><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Duration:</th><th scope="col"><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Xbox+Game+Pass+Ultimate+Deal+-+Save+%2435+On+3-Month+Membership&amp;fnauthor=stevenpetite&amp;fndate=2025-10-16+12%3A59%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-10-16+12%3A59%3A20&amp;fnarticle_id=6535504&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.skimresources.com%3Fid%3D225336X1707200%26xs%3D1%26xcust%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.xbox.com%252Fen-US%252Fxbox-game-pass%2523join&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fxbox-game-pass-ultimate-sign-up-best-deal-available-now%2F1100-6535504%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Microsoft:</a></th><th scope="col"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership/dp/B07TGNFVWV?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon Deal:</a></th><th scope="col">Savings:</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3 Months</td><td>$90</td><td>$55</td><td>$35</td></tr><tr><td>6 Months</td><td>$180</td><td>$110</td><td>$70</td></tr><tr><td>9 Months</td><td>$270</td><td>$165</td><td>$105</td></tr><tr><td>1 Year</td><td>$360</td><td>$220</td><td>$140</td></tr><tr><td>2 Years</td><td>$720</td><td>$440</td><td>$280</td></tr><tr><td>3 Years</td><td>$1,080</td><td>$660</td><td>$420</td></tr></tbody></table><p>It's unclear how long retailers will stick with the old $20/month rate. Amazon's $55 deal is new this week; earlier this month, Amazon was charging $60. For what it's worth, Amazon has historically held out longer than other retailers when prices have changed in the past. The retailer was selling the 3-Month Membership code for $45 long after Microsoft increased the price of Game Pass Ultimate to $17/month. The latest price change for Game Pass Ultimate is by far the biggest of the three price hikes the service has experienced over the years. While this is a disappointing for subscribers, it also means it's more important than ever to take advantage of prepaid code discounts.</p><p>If you aren't a Game Pass Ultimate subscriber, now's a pretty good time to become a member. Multiple AAA games are coming to Game Pass Ultimate on launch day in the coming weeks, including <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FCJYV9DY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ninja Gaiden 4</a> (October 21), <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FCJHHYZY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Outer Worlds 2</a> (October 29), and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FMC62NCK?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> (November 14).</p><p>Additionally, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rog-xbox-ally-preorder-guide/1100-6535007/" data-ref-id="1100-6535007">Microsoft and Asus just launched the first Xbox handheld</a>.

Check out our buying guide for details on each of these handheld PCs.

<p>According to information that wasn’t part of the leaks earlier this week, Pokémon Gen 10 Wind and Wave will have a turn-based battle system. </p>



<p>For those living under a rock, The Pokémon Company and Game Freak have experienced a massive leak, with tons of data about their upcoming games surfacing. We already have an idea about Pokémon Gen 10 Wind and Wave’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-gen-10-wind-and-waves-story-setting-new-mechanics-leak-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">story, setting</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-gen-10-wind-and-waves-story-setting-new-mechanics-leak-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mechanics</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-gen-10-leak-reveals-boss-fight-and-mmo-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">boss fight, and MMO details</a>. Now, new details about Gen 10’s battle system have surfaced online. </p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-legends-z-a-s-real-time-battle-system-might-not-make-it-to-gen-10-wind-and-wave">Pokémon Legends: Z-A’s Real-Time Battle System Might Not Make it to Gen 10 Wind and Wave</h2>



<p>According to a new post by CentroLeaks on <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1978632737541271993" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), some of the information that wasn’t a part of the Teraleak has now surfaced online, revealing details about Pokémon Gen 10 Wind and Wave’s battle system. The post explicitly states that “the game is turn-based,” and if players like the new real-time battle system in Legends Z-A and want it to return for the next mainline instalment, then they should let the devs know. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We have some new information about Pokémon Wind and Wave that wasn't part of the Teraleak documents released this week:</p><p>– The feature to ride all Pokémon has been scaled down significantly<br>– The character bios / story have changed a lot<br>– The game is turn based, if you enjoy the…</p></div>— Centro LEAKS (@CentroLeaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks/status/1978632737541271993?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 16, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>The post also discusses another feature from the Pokémon Gen 10 Wind and Wave leaks. The leaks had stated that all Pokémon could be ridden or touched; however, the new update states that the feature to ride all Pokémon has been scaled down significantly. Lastly, there’s another point in the post which states that character bios/story have changed a lot. </p>



<p>In other news, the leaks have also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-games-and-dlc-roadmap-allegedly-revealed-in-new-datamine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed the roadmap</a> for upcoming Pokémon games until 2030. Additionally, did you know that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-shinies-dont-disappear-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shinies don’t despawn</a> in Legends: Z-A?

                <p>Earlier this week, Team Cherry <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-patch-stomps-out-more-bugs-adds-dualsense-edge-support/1100-6535403/" data-ref-id="1100-6535403">released a patch</a> for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong/" data-ref-id="5000-493311">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, and now the developer has already dropped a new beta patch that's currently in the works. For now, this update appears to be even smaller than the last patch, with a focus on localization and control issues.</p><p>One of the most notable improvements is that rumble features have now been implemented. The devs also note that they are using a new script with an updated Chinese translation, which will be further refined "based on player feedback." The previous Chinese translation was wildly unpopular and led to the game getting review-bombed. </p><p>Most of the other fixes in this beta patch are fairly minor quality-of-life improvements. The update from earlier this week had more compelling features, including DualSense Edge support. Team Cherry has previously shared a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-patch-makes-the-game-easier/1100-6534577/" data-ref-id="1100-6534577">patch to lower Silksong's difficulty</a>, but fans who need additional help making their way through the game may be better served by checking out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-already-has-a-bunch-of-mods-that-makes-the-game-easier/1100-6534541/" data-ref-id="1100-6534541">Silksong mods</a> that make it easier.</p><p>The beta patch 1.0.28954 is currently available to Silksong players through <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1030300/Hollow_Knight_Silksong/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>. But it's not automatically added to your game. If you want to opt into the beta patch, you need to follow these steps:</p><ol><li>Right-click the game in your library</li><li>Select Properties</li><li>Go to the Betas tab</li><li>Select the current beta branch option</li><li>Download the new update</li></ol><p>Team Cherry hasn't disclosed its sales figures for Silksong yet, but one analyst suggests that the game has already <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-has-already-surpassed-4-2-million-in-sales-report/1100-6534845/" data-ref-id="1100-6534845">surpassed 4.2 million in sales</a> across consoles and PC.

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/16/five-quick-tips-to-get-the-most-out-of-pokemon-z-as-early-game/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Look, we know, you just got the game, you don’t want to spend hours reading tutorials. So we won’t keep you long, but here’s a couple of tips to make life easy in a handful of key ways, and set yourself up for success in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>!</p>
<h2><b>Save like you’re quicksaving</b></h2>
<p>The autosave feature cannot be turned off in Pokémon Legends: Z-A, much to the chagrin of shiny-hunters around the world. But fear not, because if you manually save often enough, you can actually get around this… Just bring up the in-game menu with X, and then tap the left bumper for a manual save.</p>
<p>You can save whenever you’re not in battle or motion. Want to attempt a jump off a roof? Save first. Want to catch that annoying Alpha Pokémon? Save first.</p>



<h2><b>Catch Alpha Pokémon the easy way</b></h2>
<p>Alpha Pokémon can be a bit of a pain to get to actually stay in the Poké Ball you throw at them, but what if there was a way to have a second, third or more bites of the apple? Well, did you realise there’s a very brief save window while the Pokémon is stunned?</p>

<p>The trick is to KO all non-Alphas in the area before you tackle the big bad. Then, as soon as you see the dancing stars above its head – the sign that you have reduced its HP to zero – quickly do a manual game save, and <em>then</em> throw a Poké Ball. If you see it pop out of the ball, immediately hit the Switch’s Home button, quit and reload your game. You’ll jump back in right where you left off with a stunned Pokémon waiting for a Poké Ball to bounce off its noggin once again.</p>
<p>Note: we haven’t tried this with shiny Pokémon. Also note: feel free to practise on less important mons so you can get your timing down.</p>
<h2><b>Smash (and spend) those shards</b></h2>
<p>Mega Shards are everywhere in this game, which is great because you’re going to need them! Mega Shards are eventually needed to trade for Mega Stones, with the initial shop’s worth having 3000(ish) Shards’ worth of inventory.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you can only hold 999 at a time, so as soon as you unlock the shop, you should spend as much as you &nbsp;possible can and then check in your Satchel often to make sure you’re not maxing out.</p>

<h2><b>Don’t worry about missing with your Poké Balls</b></h2>
<p>You don’t have to fret if your aim is a little bit off with your Poké Balls. There’s actually a creeping ninja who follows you around picking up your dropped Poké Balls. You’ll then get to catch up with him at every Pokémon Centre.</p>
<p>He’s a lifesaver, especially when you accidentally lob your last Quick Ball at a Mega Shard because you clipped the wrong button. He doesn’t just pick up simple Poké Balls, but all varieties of Poké Ball (note: we haven’t tried this with a Master Ball).</p>
<p>The one exception is that if your Poké Ball connects and the Pokémon escapes, you don’t get it back, but don’t worry about the ones you simply chuck on the floor for no reason!</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PokemonLegendsZA-absolmegaevolution.jpg" data-lightbox="gallery" data-slb-active="1" data-slb-asset="444308888" data-slb-internal="0" data-slb-group="464874"></a></h2>
<h2><b>Make boss fights easy</b><b></b></h2>
<p>There’s a lot of Rogue Megas you need to fight throughout the course of the game. These are very similar to the boss fights in Arceus in terms of gameplay, except this time you have Pokémon backing you up in Z-A’s take on real-time combat.</p>
<p>You can only really damage Rogue Megas when you have your Pokémon Mega evolved themselves, or are using their Plus Moves. This means your choice of Mega is crucial to your victory.</p>
<p>You know what else is crucial? Not dying! You need to dodge attacks like Patches O’Houlihan is throwing wrenches at you because if you black out (and the boss will actively try to target you), you lose.</p>
<p>But you also need to keep your Pokémon alive. If you see a flood of purple particle effects coming from the enemy, withdraw your Pokémon so it doesn’t take damage from the incoming hail mary. You can then watch your buddy’s Pokémon be needlessly KO’ed, safe in the knowledge you’re smarter than an AI.</p>
<hr>
<p>And those are our five quick tips. Enjoy playing Pokémon Legends Z-A!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Global data firm <a href="https://newzoo.com/">Newzoo</a> has put out its report for which PC and console games in September 2025 led the industry in terms of revenue and monthly active users. Unsurprisingly, EA Sports FC 26 sat at the top of the charts in terms of revenue, though curiously it didn't even crack the top 10 for monthly active users. Elsewhere, Hollow Knight Silksong beat out one of September's major triple-A releases to crack the top 5 on the revenue charts.</p>



<p>With <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-fc-26-reportedly-hits-10-million-copies-sold/">EA Sports FC 26 at the top of the revenue charts</a>, coming in second was NBA 2K26, followed by Borderlands 4 in third. Fourth place went to Fortnite, which was three spots down from where it was in August 2025, but fifth in the charts was Hollow Knight Silksong, which shows just how impactful and successful a launch the game has had after years of players waiting for it.</p>



<p>Behind Silksong was Counter-Strike 2, and then in seventh place, September's other major triple-A release, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dying-light-the-beast/">Dying Light: The Beast</a>. Helldivers 2, EA Sports Madden NFL 26, and Valorant round out the rest of the top 10 in terms of revenue in eighth, ninth, and tenth place, respectively.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Image credit: Newzoo</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Despite EA Sports FC 26 leading the charts in terms of revenue, it was not one of the two EA games that made the monthly active users charts. Those spots were hit by Skate, which made the list in sixth place, and last year's FC game, EA Sports FC 25. It's odd to see EA Sports FC 25 this high on the charts in the same month that EA Sports FC 26 came out, but that's likely due to the fact that FC 26 only had four days in September to rack up user numbers, since it came out on September 26.</p>



<p>The rest of the monthly active users charts largely remained the same, with Skate being the only new game to make the list, and the other nine shuffling around in the top 10. Fortnite and Call of Duty stayed in their same spots at number one and number two, while Helldivers 2 found its way back into the list by hitting the number nine spot, thanks in part to its arrival on Xbox in August.</p>



<p>Outside of the top 10, No Man's Sky jumped 34 spots in terms of monthly active users to 18th, thanks to its new Voyagers update, and in regard to revenue, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hades-2-supergiant-guide-us/">Hades 2</a> made the top 20 at number 20, thanks to its 1.0 launch last month. </p>



<p>Here's Newzoo's full overview for the top games on PC and consoles for September 2025:</p>



<h3 id="h-engagement-highlights"><em>Engagement highlights</em></h3>



<ul>
<li><em><strong>skate. (2025)</strong>&nbsp;(#6, new)&nbsp;— Early-access launch on September 16 drew strong cross-platform engagement, proving accessibility still drives discovery.</em></li>

<li><em><strong>Hollow Knight &amp; Silksong</strong>&nbsp;(#19 &amp; #20)&nbsp;— Sequel release on Sept 4 and a deep discount on the original sent both titles climbing the charts.</em></li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has revealed that&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>has enjoyed the franchise's biggest launch to date, having sold over seven million copies since launching last week.</p>

<p>In a press release, EA says that the latest entry in the long-running first-person shooter series "hit all-time highs for franchise sales during the first three days of launch", confirming the aforementioned sales figure, as well as the game's "172 million matches played online" <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-6-revealed-release-date-october-maybe" rel="nofollow">in that weekend</a>.</p>

<p><em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>franchise general manager Byron Beede says this is "just the beginning" for the game, with the first season just twelve days away. For his part, executive VP Vince Zampella expresses his "sincere gratitude" to&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>fans while also looking forward to what's to come "in the weeks ahead".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-6-sales-7m-soldier.jpg?itok=Xqe9Xcs1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-6-sales-7m-soldier.jpg?itok=GWWpWQcW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>EA says&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>has enjoyed the series' best launch yet.</figcaption></figure><p>As for why exactly&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>has been so successful, there could be a number of factors. The fact that the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-6-no-80-pricing" rel="nofollow">won't cost you $80</a>, remaining instead at a far more sensible $70, probably doesn't hurt to begin with.</p>

<p>There has also been a growing discontent with&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>and its range of colorful skins from various different franchises. In the run-up to&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>'s launch, EA promised that the cosmetics it sold for&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>would be more <a href="https://www.dbltap.com/news/battlefield-6-will-avoid-goofy-crossover-skins" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sober and realistic</a> than those of its closest competitor.</p>

<p><em>Battlefield 6</em> has also received pretty positive reviews across the board, averaging 83 on Metacritic on both <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/battlefield-6/critic-reviews/?platform=playstation-5" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a> and <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/battlefield-6/critic-reviews/?platform=pc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> (and 86 on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/battlefield-6/critic-reviews/?platform=xbox-series-x" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, where EA <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-6-xbox-series-s-development" rel="nofollow">put in a little extra effort</a> to ensure the game ran smoothly).</p>

<p>Whatever the case may be, it looks like Activision will have to step up its game for the next major&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>release if it wants to compete with a resurgent&nbsp;<em>Battlefield</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-round-up-switch-2-metacritic-2000635309"><em>Pokémon Legends Z-A,</em></a> the newest entry in the long-running Nintendo RPG franchise, is officially out today on Switch and Switch 2. And while many are excited to hop in and start catching pocket monsters, many fans aren’t happy with <em>Z-A</em>‘s small and boring map, which lacks the environmental variety found in past <em>Pokémon</em> games.</p> <p>While <em>Pokémon Legends Z-A&nbsp;</em>technically didn’t launch until today, October 16, fans have been playing leaked versions of the game for <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-leaks-switch-2-image-mega-evolution-2000630717">a few weeks now</a> and have begun sharing their thoughts online about the game’s map, which is the entirety of Lumiose City, located in the Kalos region. This location first appeared in 2013’s <em>Pokémon X </em>and <em>Y.&nbsp;</em>In those games, Lumiose City was just one of many locations included in the large open world. However, in <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-shiny-hunting-despawn-sound-effect-2000636142">Z-A</a>,</em> Lumiose City is essentially the entire playspace, and that’s proving to be a disappointing fact for some players.</p>

 <p>Over on the <em>Pokémon</em> subreddit, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/1o7tmfh/it_takes_less_than_7_minutes_to_run_the/?share_id=JYaiqjNJddNjichD9iq1V&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1">a popular post with over 3,000 upvotes claims</a> that you can walk around the entire city in less than seven minutes. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-long-does-it-take-to-run-around-the-entire-pokemon-legends-z-a-map-weve-tested-it-and-its-shorter-that-youd-think"><em>Eurogamer</em></a> tested this out and confirmed that, yes, if you sprint around and avoid battles, you can run around the whole circular city in just about six minutes and 20 seconds. Now, a smaller map isn’t entirely a bad thing. Some open worlds don’t need much space to be wonderful. <em>Grand Theft Auto 3</em> feels pretty dang small when you go back to it in 2025, but it packs a lot in its limited sandbox. However,<em> Z-A’s</em> map isn’t just small, it also lacks visual variety. This is demonstrated perfectly <a href="https://youtu.be/Q-HGlHqkd3M">in this short video from YouTuber 101Leafy.&nbsp;</a></p>

  <p>On Reddit and YouTube, you can find comments from players lamenting the small map’s lack of visual variety. For a franchise that used to be about discovering new cities, towns, biomes, and environments, <em>Z-A</em>‘s focus on one city, filled with reused buildings and props, is disappointing to many. And while some of the complaints are clearly from fans who have long been done with the series but can’t stop torturing themselves, the more you look at screenshots and videos of <em>Z-A</em>, the more it becomes clear that, yeah, there ain’t much here.</p> <p>At least if you buy the game on Switch, <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-switch-2-comparison-framerate-upgrade-2000635404">it mostly looks the same as the Switch 2 version</a>. Don’t worry, everyone gets to enjoy the same copy-pasted buildings regardless of their platform of choice. That’s nice.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It appears that the development of Project Ethos will move forward as 2K has hired a new studio head at developer 31st Union. According to a report from Variety, Ben Brinkman has been hired away from Respawn Entertainment to lead the game.</p>



<p>Brinkman comes in to replace former 31st Union president Michael Condrey, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/2k-fires-31st-union-president-after-project-ethos-poor-response/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">who was fired back</a> in February.</p>



<p>A memo to staff, <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/project-ethos-update-31st-union-ben-brinkman-1236553878/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">acquired by Variety</a>, from 2K President David Ismailer called the community feedback to Project Ethos “enlightening.”</p>



<p><strong>“It affirmed the promise of a roguelike shooter but told us we still had work to do,” it continued. “It uncovered the need for a more distinct identity. It’s been inspiring to see how far you’ve come. You took the feedback to heart and reimagined Project ETHOS with a renewed vision – one that’s poised to deliver on its promise to our players. </strong></p>



<p><strong>“Our confidence in Project ETHOS grows every day. To further the incredible progress you’ve made, I’m excited to welcome Ben Brinkman as the new Studio Head of 31st Union. After several months of conversations, Ben officially joins us on Monday, October 20.”</strong></p>



<p>As mentioned, Brinkman comes to 31st Union from Respawn, where he served as an executive producer on Apex Legends since 2020. Before joining Respawn, Brinkman was a producer at Activision and Treyarch, working on the Call of Duty franchise since 2008. He’s been in the industry since the late 1990s, with other stops at EA and 2K over 20 years ago.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/16/battlefield-6s-conquest-matches-are-getting-shorter-patch-notes/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Even with the barnstorming launch success of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a>, the multiplayer side of Battlefield Studios, led by DICE, are already starting to tinker with the game’s balance alongside early bugfixing patches.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1o809hi/battlefield_6_update_1016/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=usertext&amp;utm_name=Battlefield&amp;utm_content=t3_1o6uuwp">Update 1.0.16 is now live</a>, described as, “This minor Quality of Life update focuses on backend stability to help us prepare ahead of the upcoming Battlefield 6 Season 1 update.”</p>


<p><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1o76u27/bfcomms_update_on_bullet_damage_registration_1510/">A hotfix</a> has also been applied to try and address inconsistent bullet damage registration.</p>
<p>However, the more significant change is a shift to Conquest mode, <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1o7bxf9/bfcomms_conquest_ticket_count_update_1510/">reducing the starting ticket count from 1000</a> to as low as 700, depending on the map.</p>
<p>“We’ve reduced the starting ticket count across all Conquest maps so matches finish at a more natural pace,” the team explains. “Previously, many rounds were hitting the time limit instead of ending when one team ran out of tickets. We’ll keep monitoring feedback and data to make sure the flow of each match feels right.”</p>

<p>The ticket counts are now as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>Siege of Cairo from 1000 to 900</li>
<li>Empire State from 1000 to 900</li>
<li>Iberian Offensive from 1000 to 900</li>
<li>Liberation Peak From 1000 to 800</li>
<li>Manhattan Bridge From 1000 to 800</li>
<li>Operation Firestorm From 1000 to 700</li>
<li>New Sobek City from 1000 to 900</li>
<li>Mirak Valley from 1000 to 700</li>
</ul>
<p>This has led to no small amount of consternation amongst fans on Reddit,&nbsp;<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1o7wtxs/700_tickets_on_operation_firestorm_is_a_crime/">causing </a><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1o87ap7/change_the_tickets_back_to_1000/">uproar</a> in the game’s<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1o84gyu/revert_ticket_count_back_to_1000_in_conquest/"> vocal community</a>, who are calling for the change to be reverted. It comes alongside some broader critiques and preferences for a slower pace of game again, shifting back toward &nbsp;the pace of older titles, and for larger maps that are less infantry and city warfare focussed – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/09/battlefield-6-review/">something I noted in our review</a>. It’s possible that DICE will revert or rebalance this again given the pushback, but with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/16/battlefield-6-races-to-franchise-record-7-million-sales-in-first-weekend/">7 million copies sold</a> and so many more players than the franchise has ever had before, they have a vast wealth of telemetry to call upon to back up their judgment.</p>
<p>Really it’s a call of whether they actually need to make this change. Are they seeing people drop out of games before they’ve concluded? Are players actually sticking through to the end regardless because they’re having fun? After all, back in the day, players would gladly log in for vastly inflated ticket count grind fests on Operation Locker and stuff, so there’s no doubt appetite for longer matches amongst series veterans.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-surface-manufacturing-china-xbox/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Microsoft is reportedly making changes to where its hardware is built. According to Nikkei, Microsoft is looking to move manufacturing of its Surface devices out of China as early as 2026.</p>



<p>The report (<a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/spotlight/supply-chain/microsoft-aims-to-make-most-new-products-outside-china-from-2026-sources" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">paywalled</a>) says that Microsoft will look to move data center servers, component production, and device assembly out of the country. They say that Microsoft has asked multiple supppliers to help with preparation for the move.</p>



<p><strong>“The scope is quite wide and covers components, parts and product assembly for new product introductions of both notebook computers and server products,” </strong>a supply chain executive told Nikkei.<strong> “Microsoft hopes all of these can be manufactured entirely outside of China starting from 2026 at the earliest.”</strong></p>



<p>As far as server production, one source told the outlet that Microsoft had already started moving server production out of China. It’s said that Microsoft has requested <strong>“at least 80% of the bill of materials (BOM) for servers come from outside the country.”</strong></p>



<p>In addition to the Surface production, Nikkei says that Microsoft is “pushing to increase non-China production of the Xbox videogame consoles”. That said, there hasn’t been any sort of requirement made to bring all Xbox manufacturing out of China yet. </p>



<p>This report of Microsoft’s manufacturing plans comes as trade tensions between China and the United States intensify. Donald Trump has threatened to place 100% tariffs on goods from China on November 1st, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/10/13/trump-meeting-xi-china-tariffs/86672514007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">though a meeting between</a> Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping could cool those threats.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Microsoft for comment on the report. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>

		<p>EA has a massive hit on their hands with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a>, with the efforts of the assembled Battlefield Studios leading to new record sales for the franchise, selling over 7 million copies through the first three days.</p>
<p><a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Battlefield-6-Shatters-Records-Becoming-the-Biggest-Launch-in-Franchise-History/default.aspx">EA has confirmed this figure</a>, which was previously reported by Alinea Analytics (via <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/battlefield-6-sells-over-7m-units-across-pc-and-console-in-five-days">GamesIndustry.biz</a>), who go further to say that it’s the biggest non-sports game launch of 2025, and is behind only EA Sports FC 26’s 7.7 million sales.</p>


<p>“First and foremost we want to thank our players,” said Byron Beede, General Manager of Battlefield. “Battlefield 6 was built with our fans. From the initial concept through to the implementation of Battlefield Labs and into the record-shattering Open Beta we have been obsessed with player feedback. Together, with our players we’ve had a singular goal: to craft the best Battlefield ever.”</p>
<p>Next up is the start of the game’s first season of live content on 28th October, promising two new maps and one redressed through its run, new weapons, vehicles, game modes and more, and with this strong start, it feels like Activision’s moves to try and drum up more engagement with Call of Duty over the past few weeks has been quite necessary. Activision extended the Black Ops 7 open beta weekend, and had a week-long free trial for Black Ops 6 to go head-to-head with Battlefield 6’s launch. Neither seems to have made dampened EA’s party.</p>
<p>But, and this could be quite a big but, they’re already tinkering with Battlefield 6’s balance, and that’s <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1o7wtxs/700_tickets_on_operation_firestorm_is_a_crime/">causing</a> <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1o87ap7/change_the_tickets_back_to_1000/">uproar</a> in the game’s<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1o84gyu/revert_ticket_count_back_to_1000_in_conquest/"> vocal community</a>, as DICE are lowering the ticket counts in the main Conquest mode, citing <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1o7bxf9/bfcomms_conquest_ticket_count_update_1510/">too many games reaching full time instead of a result before then</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/09/battlefield-6-review/">our review</a>, I said, “Battlefield 6 is a return to form for the large scale shooter, with a great blend of infantry classes, mechanised warfare, some clever new game modes, and without too much nonsense wrapped around it. It’s a true successor to Battlefield 4, right down to the naff campaign.”</p>

		<p>Even a few days out from release next week, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/vampire-the-masquerdae-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</a> is, to me, one of the more intriguing games of 2025. There’s so many layers to why that’s the case, from it nominally being a sequel to a decades old cult classic, to the protracted, rebooted development cycle, and then how The Chinese Room has gone about creating their own rendition of Hardsuit Labs’ original pitch, keeping some elements and changing others.</p>
<p><iframe title="Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 | Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1vt1FZSLUXg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Through August and September, I had the opportunity to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/18/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-preview-torpor-less-in-seattle/">play through the game’s opening hours</a>, experiencing Phyre’s reawakening from torpor, how they’ve been bonded to the mind of the merely century old Fabian, and the pair of them thrown into a rendition of Seattle’s vampiric night life that is in complete and utter turmoil.</p>


<p>Having an already created character is a bit of a bone of contention for fans of the original or the TTRPG, where you would create your own vampire.</p>
<p>Jey Hicks, Design Director at The Chinese Room, sets the scene. “The big thing is tying in with you being The Beast, right? In the first game you were a fledgling, and so that whole story was about you progressing from nothing upwards. Our game is that, oh, you were the Big Daddy Beast! You are the renowned, well known Nomad, right? You have taken a hit – you’ve come out of Torpor, and you’ve forgotten your abilities because of whatever this is – but, I mean, we painted the picture right from the get go. You walk out that door and there’s that guard coming towards you, and you punch him so bloody hard!”</p>


<p>Jason Carl, Brand Marketing Manager for White Wolf, and the voice of the weather radio you’ll hear when you start the game, chimed in, “The Chinese Room could have told that [newcomer vampire] story again, but we have told that story already, and I think everyone felt very strongly that it was time to tell a new vampire story in the same tradition.</p>
<p>“In some ways, there are parallels. Phyre is also dropped into a situation they didn’t ask for. They don’t know what’s going on, they don’t know what happened to them. They don’t know who’s in charge, and they’ve got to puzzle out what’s going on before is too late. So there aren’t parallel stories here, but they’re seen through very different ends of the Vampire: The Masquerade spectrum.”</p>
<p>Phyre, then, is a centuries old vampire who’s woken up in modern day Seattle. You might expect that would make them massively powerful and already set in their capabilities, but in true video game fashion, they’re mysteriously de-powered. Still hugely powerful as a vampire compared to a regular human, and already with some core abilities like telekinesis and the ability to glide, but without the bulk of their once mighty powers. That gives you the opportunity to remake them in your own image and style.</p>
<p>Jey explained “The main thing for us is that, as you’re at this elder vampire, you had way more abilities before, and the whole thing later on in the game will be that you awaken these abilities from the other clans and you can use them as your own. So you can feed those in so you’re not stuck to that same path that you were on.”</p>
<p>He continues, “Each clan has a set of powers that is there clan affinity, so as Ventrue, you are better at certain powers than others because they are intrinsic to your blood. You can learn any power from any vampire clan, but it costs you more. You have to pay more for it because it’s not your affinity as a venture and you have to find someone to help you learn it as well. And you need to hunt the correct flavour, emotional flavour of blood, from mortals to make it easier to get.”</p>

<p>Of course, from what I experienced of the game’s opening hours, my options were constrained to a single path. Playing as a Tremere, for example, I was using blood magics to curse someone to explode if they took damage, to be able to torture an enemy from within, to dive in to strike and then teleport back out of trouble. Basically, I was playing as a really bitey version of Batman. Vampire Batman.</p>
<p>That strike and retreat approach in a scaffolding-filled building site saw me cut my way through batches of tough Anarch ghouls fairly well. Even without teleporting, I’m thankful that Jey stood his ground about having stairs. “Time and time again we would find characters getting stuck and stuff like that, and so people were like, ‘Can’t we just get rid of the staircases and stuff like that, and just force you to drop in?’ And I was like, no, because I actually really like being able to use that as like a strategy or just just a place to have a break, to get a breather from the fight, to reassess the situation. I’m so glad that you started doing that!”</p>
<p>I was also using telekinesis to pick up guns and blast away at enemies, without getting my hands dirty.</p>

<p>But as I came up against Benny, the Sheriff gone rogue, and had to go toe-to-toe with a powerful combatant, I had to find a different approach, since this was set in an arena with little escape. It reminded me a little of the issue of games, such as Deus Ex: Human Revolution, where pacifist players were forced to kill during boss fights. How does Bloodlines 2 aid players with that sneakier approach?</p>
<p>“We have elixirs there to really boost you up, and so typically, the type of player you’re talking about also coincided with the more exploratory type of player. […] So yeah, probably a lot of players would come into this with a significant inventory of elixirs to fall back on that. Using the Brujah one alone, you can do a huge chunk of damage to Benny just with that. And additionally, dare I say it, there’s always the ability to fall back on an an easier difficulty. We allow that as the game is running, so if you do get stuck we’re not that cruel.”</p>
<p>Your choice of clan is just one aspect of Phyre’s characterisation, though –&nbsp;and actually, being able to unlock abilities from other clans down the line will let you shift your playstyle if you want to –&nbsp;because there’s also their view on the power vacuum that’s suddenly opened and been filled at the top of the Seattle nightlife.</p>
<p>Jason said, “We’ve said many times you’re an elder, you’ve been around for centuries. You’re more and less than human at the same time. You’re more powerful than humans, you’re faster, you’re stronger, you have all these powers, but you’re less than human. You don’t care as much about morality and humanity as you used to. Depending on how you choose to play as Phyre, you may follow a more humane way of dealing with the city and the mortals, and the vampires around you, or you may stay on that rather cold, distant Elder path.</p>
<p>“The contrast to that is Fabian. Fabian is still very much fascinated by mortal life. He loves it, loves mortals, loves interacting with them and engaging them, and he’s barely a century dead, or undead, as the case may be, so he hasn’t lost that spark of humanity that all kindred have when they’re first embraced. So he’s on a very different journey in the struggle between his humanity and his beast, the struggle that all vampires in Vampire: The Masquerade face.</p>
<p>“It’s more than just a buddy cop vampire story. It really is how to look at vampires and their humanity and their beast, very different ends of the telescope.”</p>

<p>It’s effectively a meme to describe a city as being a character in a story, but Seattle in Bloodlines 2 will inevitably give it a distinctive flavour, at least. In the grip of a winter that has blanketed the city in snow, the open setting takes a chunk of the downtown area to be your playground.</p>
<p>“I’ve lived in Seattle most of my life,” Jason said, “and the downtown core, in which much of our action takes place –&nbsp;although not all of it – is a fairly small, concentrated area. It’s not as broad as some cities. There’s a lot of people, mortals, living in quite a small contained place, and to me it feels like downtown Seattle very much. I could easily imagine myself going, ‘Oh, look, there’s that hotel I know. There’s that bar I will never go into again. Ah, the waterfront.” So it does feel, I think, fairly true to the city.”</p>

<p>Exploring that as a vampire, you can’t use your full powers in the open, or you’d be breaking The Masquerade and become hunted, but you do need to feast here, both to power up before reaching a potential confrontation, and to find those of the right resonance to match what you need to power up.</p>
<p>Cat Martins, level designer, noted, “So you broke The Masquerade, so you might think, OK, the safest place to be would be on rooftops, for example, but that’s not necessarily true because the rooftops are also where the Rules are going to be –&nbsp;you could use that as a way to farm XP, if you want.”</p>
<p>Jey added, “But those encounters on the roof, they’re not the same every time you go up there, right? So, different rooftops at different times of the game, you’re going to encounter different enemy types. And let’s just say that it fits with the point of the narrative as well. So say a certain events happens or something like that. You’d expect to see more of a certain type of enemy up there to have a little play with!</p>
<p>It’s fair to say that Bloodlines 2 will inevitably be a thoroughly different game to Bloodlines –&nbsp;inevitably so, with over 20 years between them and different creative choices – and it’s one that I’m very intrigued to see how it’s come together because of that. We won’t have long to wait to find out, with the game out next week on 21st October.</p>

Finding these rare critters with different shades and color palettes than their species’ default appearance is such an involved undertaking with secret math and other nonsense to contend with that some people spend hours looking for just one of these guys. Others spend even longer trying to find one of every ‘mon in the Pokédex. </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>is out today, and players have discovered the RPG has made one crucial change to Shiny hunting that has taken some of the difficulty out of this process, and while some fans are rejoicing, others are lamenting how much easier it’s gotten to capture these alternate-colored Pokémon.</span></p> <p><span>When you enter </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s Wild Zones, designated areas where wild Pokémon live and can be captured, typically every monster you encounter is refreshed when the game’s day and night cycle changes, your party is knocked out, or if you fast travel. However, that doesn’t seem to be the case for Shinies. Players have tested this on Pokémon they’ve found in the overworld, and it seems like, unless you defeat it in battle, Shiny Pokémon don’t despawn.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>If you've even idly checked in on the robust world of <em>Doom</em> fan development in recent years, you've probably encountered one of the hundreds of <a href="https://forum.zdoom.org/viewforum.php?f=43">gameplay mods</a>, <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Category:GZDoom_WADs">WAD files</a>, or <a href="https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/136771-every-gzdoom-game-on-steam/">entire commercial games</a> based on <em>GZDoom</em>. The <a href="https://github.com/ZDoom/gzdoom">open source <em>Doom</em> port</a>—which can trace its lineage back to the <a href="https://zdoom.org/wiki/ZDoom_version_history/1.x#1.11_(March_6_1998)">original launch of <em>ZDoom</em> back in 1998</a>—adds modern graphics rendering, quality-of-life additions, and incredibly deep modding features to <a href="https://github.com/id-Software/DOOM">the original <em>Doom</em> source code</a> that John Carmack released in 1997.</p>
<p>Now, though, the community behind <em>GZDoom</em> is publicly fracturing, with a large contingent of developers uniting behind a new fork <a href="https://github.com/UZDoom/UZDoom">called UZDoom</a>. The move is in apparent protest of the leadership of <em>GZDoom</em> creator and maintainer <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Christoph_Oelckers_(Graf_Zahl)">Cristoph Oelckers (aka Graf Zahl)</a>, who recently admitted to inserting untested AI-generated code into the <em>GZDoom</em> codebase.</p>
<p>"Due to some disagreements—some recent; some tolerated for close to 2 decades—with how collaboration should work, we've decided that the best course of action was to fork the project," developer Nash Muhandes <a href="https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/155567-uzdoom/">wrote on the DoomWorld forums Wednesday</a>. "I don't want to see the <em>GZDoom</em> legacy die, as do most all of us, hence why I think the best thing to do is to continue development through a fork, while introducing a different development model that highly favors transparent collaboration between multiple people."</p>
<h2>AI-way or the highway</h2>
<p>Zahl's project leadership has generated plenty of friction within the <em>GZDoom</em> development community over the years—<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/ns6jbe/video_games_how_an_avantgarde_doom_mod_angered_an/">this Reddit thread</a> provides a brief history of some of the drama. But the inciting incident leading to this week's <em>UZDoom</em> split seems to center in large part on Zahl's open use of AI-generated code in a recent <em>GZDoom</em> update. While such use of AI coding tools is often hard to identify from the outside (as Zahl himself <a href="https://github.com/ZDoom/gzdoom/commit/584af500736b0317e42824f39285ed3d954fc4e2#r167892953">noted in a GitHub post</a>), this particular instance was highlighted by <a href="https://github.com/ZDoom/gzdoom/commit/584af500736b0317e42824f39285ed3d954fc4e2#diff-9c544b5fb8828babb5d162b892c51edeb8d0959304c880ffb4ff064c00b73800R440">Zahl's own commented code snippet</a>: "This is what ChatGPT told me for detecting dark mode on Linux."</p>

And while Zahl eventually removed the offending code, he also allegedly tried to remove the evidence that it ever existed by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/git/comments/1db7n1w/is_force_pushing_really_bad_practice/">force-pushing</a> an update to delete the discussion entirely.</p>

<p>Zahl <a href="https://github.com/ZDoom/gzdoom/commit/584af500736b0317e42824f39285ed3d954fc4e2#r167887685">defended</a> the use of AI-generated snippets for "boilerplate code" that isn't key to underlying game features. "I surely have my reservations about using AI for project specific code," he wrote, "but this here is just superficial checks of system configuration settings that can be found on various websites—just with 10x the effort required."</p>
<p>But others in the community were adamant that there's no place for AI tools in the workflow of an open source project like this. "If using code slop generated from ChatGPT or any other GenAI/AI chatbots is the future of this project, I'm sorry to say but I'm out," GitHub user Cacodemon345 <a href="https://github.com/ZDoom/gzdoom/commit/584af500736b0317e42824f39285ed3d954fc4e2#r167890520">wrote</a>, summarizing the feelings of many other developers.</p>
<h2>A fork in the road</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://github.com/ZDoom/gzdoom/issues/3395">a GitHub bug report</a> posted Tuesday, user the-phinet laid out the disagreements over AI-generated code alongside other alleged issues with Zahl's top-down approach to pushing out <em>GZDoom</em> updates. In response, Zahl <a href="https://github.com/ZDoom/gzdoom/issues/3395#issuecomment-3402316482">invited</a> the development community to "feel free to fork the project" if they were so displeased.</p>
<p>Plenty of <em>GZDoom</em> developers quickly took that somewhat petulant response seriously. "You have just completely bricked <em>GZDoom</em> with this bullshit," developer Boondorl <a href="https://github.com/ZDoom/gzdoom/issues/3395#issuecomment-3402835418">wrote</a>. "Enjoy your dead project, I'm sure you'll be happy to plink away at it all by yourself where people can finally stop yelling at you to do things."</p>

<p>In <a href="https://discord.com/channels/268086704961748992/392006099462651906/1427980069216845937">a community update posted to the <em>ZDoom</em> Discord</a>, moderator Agent_Ash promised that the new <em>UZDoom</em> will maintain compatibility with old <em>GZDoom</em> saves and mods while adding new planned features in the future. But the new project will also provide "a more stable development structure with healthy collaboration and less power given to individual 'project leads,'" Agent_Ash wrote.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boomershooters/comments/1o6yw7o/comment/njpasu0/">a Reddit thread discussing the UZDoom fork</a>, Muhandes detailed how "<em>UZDoom</em> gets rid of the 'one man decides everything' / 'my way or the highway' development model. Everyone has to make pull requests that must be peer-reviewed thoroughly, and everything will be transparent—no one is allowed to commit directly to the master branch."</p>
<p>"I have never seen something I've worked so hard on, for the past 2+ decades—a life passion of mine, you could say—implode this hard," Muhandes <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nashmuhandes.bsky.social/post/3m3653ilevs2a">added on Bluesky</a>.</p>
<p>While <em>GZDoom</em> will continue to exist, Agent_Ash wrote that "it's reasonable to assume that <em>UZDoom</em> will be the 'main' flagship version of the engine moving forward." And while Zahl will be welcome to continue contributing to the new project, "<em>UZDoom</em> will not be led by him and he's not going to have a final say on new features and changes," Agent_Ash added.</p>
<p>The infighting over a modern source port of a 32-year-old game speaks highly of the deep cultural impact <em>Doom</em> continues to have on multiple generations of fans. Going forward, it's hard to say how this dramatic split will affect the continued development of what has become a load-bearing part of the game's continued legacy. For now, though, the move highlights how the use of AI coding tools has become a non-negotiable flashpoint for many in the world of open-source game development.</p>

Every other week, this curated overview will feature key takeaways from a vintage or classic GDC Talk with the goal of helping today's developers unearth new lessons from the past.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It feels somewhat shameful to admit I've never played </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dead Cells—</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Motion Twin's highly regarded pixel-rendered rouguelike masterpiece. But I still adore this talk from GDC 2019, aptly titled </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://gdcvault.com/play/1025788/-Dead-Cells-What-the">'Dead Cells': What the F*n!?'</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for being a breezy, no-BS design talk that manages to pack so much wisdom into a neat little 30 minute time slot.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After introducing the studio and its previous games (and noting that the project that would become </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dead Cells</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was a "last chance" for the studio, so they were inspired to make something bigger than they had) Motion Twin's Sebastien Benard goes right into the inspiration for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dead Cells</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: classic Castlevania. But the team was tiny, with only one visual artist at first (a second one came on eventually), so they just couldn't create massive, expansive content for a game in that vein. Voila: the decision to embrace permadeath at the heart of the game.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/dead-or-alive-creator-tomonobu-itagaki-has-passed-away-at-58" target="_self" data-discover="true">Obituary: Dead or Alive creator Tomonobu Itagaki has passed away at 58</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Death as progression">Death as progression</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Notably, the team was keen to modernize the schema, which was something of a hot topic at the time.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The team smartly chose to focus on "death as progression" instead of punishment for players, allowing them to open up and explore new areas upon death, rewarding play instead of punishing failure. "Dying should be like 'woo yeah, I died, so I can do something new!'" says Bernard, gesturing with a grin and a thumbs up.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The decision to run with this structure meant there was no back-tracking between levels—so if you want to go back to an earlier area (perhaps with a new ability), you have to go ahead and die to get back to the beginning again. The team also made "each run count" a core pillar, using the titular dead cells as currency to spend with the collector, allowing for progress across runs.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Mitigating the pain of permadeath">Mitigating the pain of permadeath</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dead Cells</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was designed to have a very short game over to new game loop, partially to minimize disappointment for a player death. The team also hyper-focused on a tight control scheme and modulated the challenge of the game judiciously, even offering a few small "cheats" in favor of the player to keep nasty platforming "accidents" to a minimum.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/how-power-inflation-compromises-live-service-games-like-the-first-descendant" target="_self" data-discover="true">How 'power inflation' compromises live service games like The First Descendant</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We always asked, with the platforming for example, 'is this meant to be a challenge?'" says Bernard. "If you take </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Super Meat Boy</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, yes, the platforming is part of the challenge, it's all about jumping and getting killed and getting back to action really quickly."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"But </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dead Cells</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is really combat oriented. Platforming is just a [means] to move, to avoid enemies, to position yourself, and it's not a hardcore platformer game. So, when we asked this question, it was really useful... 'Is the player meant to die doing this?' If the answer is no, we just make sure the player succeeds."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He then goes to show a brief clip from the game where the player jumps from one platform to another—there are a few frames where it looks dicey (maybe they won't make it!), but they succeed. Then he plays it back in slow motion. The game is absolutely correcting a poor jump here, serving to minimize frustration overall, since perfect platforming is just not a core value in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dead Cells</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and this trick allows players to focus more on fighting enemies. The devs dubbed these "just in time" jumps, allowing a few frames to leap after the character's feet are actually off a platform, since the intention is there!</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/how-capcom-designed-resident-evil-requiem-with-different-camera-angles-in-mind" target="_self" data-discover="true">How Capcom designed Resident Evil Requiem with different camera angles in mind</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These little tricks are also employed in hairier combat sequences, where the game will "correct" a player's position or orientation, for example, turning towards an enemy in a close call, and auto-aiming.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bernard noted that most players will just think they did everything correctly, and that the little cheats really helped to keep the game feeling fun. It also allowed the team to make the core game more difficult—with those little potential annoyances out of the way, they could construct much more strategic encounters that were more satisfying overall.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Unlocking the key takeaways">Unlocking the key takeaways</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In case you want the sparknotes version of the talk—or you're just outlining some of the major lessons in your notes—don't worry, I've got you!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The key takeaways here are </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Lesson #1:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Constraints can be your friend: part of the reason to embrace permadeath (and very much the core structure of the game) was having limited art resources. Dead Cells is a beloved game very much in part to its tight design around permadeath, and the team really embraced "finding the fun" in the structure. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Lesson #2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> here is that it's ok to cheat a little: if it makes the game more fun! Motion Twin was able to really focus on challenging, strategic combat encounters because they took care of little hiccups like jump correction and orienting the player correctly, making the game better by placing the focus squarely where they wanted it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game Developer and GDC are sibling organizations under Informa.</span></span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Editor-in-Chief, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Danielle is the editor-in-chief of Game Developer, with previous editorial posts at Fanbyte, VICE, and Polygon.
