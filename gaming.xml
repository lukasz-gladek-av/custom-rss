            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-nier-automata-crossover<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and Shift Up have announced the release date for the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade Nier: Automata&nbsp;</em>crossover, as well as when you can expect the former's photo mode to arrive.</p>

<p>Both the crossover and the photo mode will be added to&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>in an update on November 20th, and they'll both be completely free as well, so you won't have to pay to let Eve cosplay as everyone's favorite blindfolded android.</p>

<p>According to Shift Up CTO Dong Ki Lee,&nbsp;<em>Nier: Automata&nbsp;</em>"significantly inspired&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade</em>", and the collaboration between&nbsp;the latter's director Kim Hyung Tae and the former's Yoko Taro was "marked by mutual respect and creativity".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stellar-blade-nier-automata-crossover-costumes.jpg?itok=QXY2pXv6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stellar-blade-nier-automata-crossover-costumes.jpg?itok=dBMWsizy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Stellar Blade</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Nier: Automata&nbsp;</em>crossover will arrive next week.</figcaption></figure><p>The crossover will introduce a host of costumes for&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>based on&nbsp;<em>Nier: Automata&nbsp;</em>characters like 2B and A2, as well as&nbsp;<em>Nier&nbsp;</em>stalwart Emil, who will be the proprietor of a shop from which you can buy "eleven different collaboration-special items".</p>

<p>It's not just the&nbsp;<em>Nier: Automata&nbsp;</em>crossover, either. This update is also adding a photo mode to&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade</em>, allowing you to pause the action and take photos of the game's characters, landscapes, and more.</p>

<p>The photo mode will, of course, come complete with lots of different filters and options, so even if you don't quite have that perfect shot lined up, you should be able to get what you need by tweaking a few menu toggles here and there.</p>




<p>This update will also introduce various quality-of-life improvements and gameplay tweaks to&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade</em>, including new character customization options for Eve, new battle features, and more. You can see a list of what's new <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/11/stellar-blades-nier-automata-dlc-photo-mode-launch-nov-20/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">via the PlayStation Blog</a>.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade</em>, it's an action game created by&nbsp;<em>Goddess of Victory: Nikke&nbsp;</em>developer Shift Up, although unlike that game,&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-sony-publishing-deal" rel="nofollow">a console exclusive</a> and not a mobile gacha RPG.</p>

<p>You play as Eve, a survivor of an apocalyptic war against aliens known as the Naytibas, and you must reclaim Earth from its new alien occupiers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The game proved popular among players, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-sales-one-million" rel="nofollow">selling a million copies</a>&nbsp;just a few months after its launch, although the much-talked-about PC port remains unannounced at time of writing.</p>

<p>You can pick up&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/stellar-blade/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>.

Also, we got Cobb literally scorching a mother and son from the rival Maroni crime family, an inside look at the devastation The Riddler caused when he flooded parts of the city at the end of <em>The Batman</em>, and insight into Cobb’s plan to take over Gotham. </p><p>As great as the show was, it left a number of questions we need answered when we return to Gotham in 2026 for <em>The Batman: Part II</em></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="968a39a5759226fe8b9554ef57aaef2a" data-recommend-id="image://968a39a5759226fe8b9554ef57aaef2a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1280" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Colin Farrell as Oswald Cobb in The Penguin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Colin Farrell as Oswald Cobb in The Penguin." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Macall Polay/HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="968a39a5759226fe8b9554ef57aaef2a" data-recommend-id="image://968a39a5759226fe8b9554ef57aaef2a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1280" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Colin Farrell as Oswald Cobb in The Penguin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>In <em>The Batman</em>, Cobb is more of an annoyance than a major player in the action, but he had flashes of being a formidable foe to the billionaire vigilante. As Carmine Falcone’s (John Turturro) lieutenant and drug peddling nightclub owner, Cobb was able to talk his way out of multiple Batman beatdowns and lead him on the one of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/iA_wCcG-dQQ?si=NyyehKxTWeDaVITS&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/iA_wCcG-dQQ?si=NyyehKxTWeDaVITS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">coolest movie car chases</a></span> of 2022.

In eight award-worthy episodes of <em>The Penguin, </em>Cobb has dismantled the Maroni crime family, inspired mutinies in all of the rival gangs, and is figuratively and literally on top of Gotham. Although Gotham produces a new villain every day, for now, Oz is the king. And he’s already shown how he can influence the media and politics, making him even more formidable.</p><p>The biggest confirmation of Oz being Batman’s next nemesis is in the last scene of <em>The Penguin </em>when Eve Karlo (Carmen Ejogo), creepily cosplaying as Cobb’s mother, tells him there’s nothing in his way of Gotham being his, just before someone gets the bright idea to send the bat signal into the sky. Even though the “five or six scenes” Farrell revealed in a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/colin-farrell-penguin-finale-interview-1236055938/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/colin-farrell-penguin-finale-interview-1236055938/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Hollywood Reporter </em>interview</a></span>  he was told he’d be in for <em>The Batman Part II</em> is hardly enough for main villain role, nothing is off the table. </p><p>Is there a world where the new king of crime doesn’t become Batman’s biggest obstacle?</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ef26fb1b2e5a9ef3c8aef775cb206d40" data-recommend-id="image://ef26fb1b2e5a9ef3c8aef775cb206d40" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1280" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cristin Milioti as Sofia Falcone in The Penguin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Cristin Milioti as Sofia Falcone in The Penguin." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Macall Polay/HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ef26fb1b2e5a9ef3c8aef775cb206d40" data-recommend-id="image://ef26fb1b2e5a9ef3c8aef775cb206d40" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1280" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cristin Milioti as Sofia Falcone in The Penguin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>If the monster with the limp isn’t Batman’s nemesis, surely the woman he put in prison again will be Batman’s friend. While Batman was solving riddles and doing the most brooding version of flirting with Selina Kyle (Zoe Kravitz), Sofia Gigante was being drugged, electrocuted, and assaulted in Arkham Asylum thanks to Cobb. Now that she’s back in Arkham Asylum because of the same person, Batman may have gained an ally he doesn’t know he has yet.</p><p>In the comics, Gigante is secretly the serial killer The Hangman, an identity she denies is hers in the show, and runs into issues with Batman. Even if she isn’t The Hangman in <em>The Penguin</em>, she’s shown she’s a ruthless tactician willing to bomb an already decimated community like Crown Point if it means blowing up Cobb’s operation in the process. It would be safe to assume the only joy Gigante feels is the recurring thought of how she will enact revenge on Penguin. Why not let your half-sister’s love interest help do the job for you?</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fc224887797ec573910b55417d44e769" data-recommend-id="image://fc224887797ec573910b55417d44e769" data-format="jpg" data-width="1140" data-height="570" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An illustration of The Court of Owls from a Batman comic book panel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An illustration of The Court of Owls from a Batman comic book panel." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->DC Comics</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fc224887797ec573910b55417d44e769" data-recommend-id="image://fc224887797ec573910b55417d44e769" data-format="jpg" data-width="1140" data-height="570" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An illustration of The Court of Owls from a Batman comic book panel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Corruption in Gotham is like sand in the desert. In episode six of <em>The Penguin</em>, Cobb spoke about politicians diverting resources like electricity and infrastructure repair to richer communities instead of to the poorer communities like Crown Point that are living in rubble and FEMA tents. In<em> Batman </em>lore, this type of nefarious prejudice is usually the work of one shadowy cabal, The Court of Owls. </p><p>This is a secret society comprised of the wealthiest and most influential people who control every part of Gotham, yet only exist to most of the citizens as an urban legend. The classist divide in the city was a main motivator for The Riddler, who grew up as a poor orphan, targeting corrupt wealthy individuals who he felt abandoned those with similar upbringings. That insidious elitism, along with Gotham’s criminal hierarchy being in flux thanks to Cobb and Gigante’s turf war, might be enough for the true rulers of Gotham to come out of the shadows in <em>The Batman Part II</em>.<br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fad4fc1fb65a858a99a418a623c26986" data-recommend-id="image://fad4fc1fb65a858a99a418a623c26986" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1280" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Colin Farrell as Oswald Cobb in the penultimate episode of The Penguin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Colin Farrell as Oswald Cobb in the penultimate episode of The Penguin." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Macall Polay/HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fad4fc1fb65a858a99a418a623c26986" data-recommend-id="image://fad4fc1fb65a858a99a418a623c26986" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1280" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Colin Farrell as Oswald Cobb in the penultimate episode of The Penguin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>In two episodes, the Maroni crime family succession tree was dismantled after Cobb set fire to matriarch Nadia Maroni (Shohreh Aghdashloo) and heir to the throne Taj Maroni (Aria Shahghasemi), before fighting head of the family Salvatore Maroni (Clancy Brown) to the point of a heart attack. </p><p>The Maroni family is no joke and played a pivotal role in <em>The Batman</em>, as Salvatore tried blackmailing Batman’s father Thomas Wayne while he was running for mayor by threatening to release information about his wife Martha Wayne’s struggles with mental illness. This led to a domino effect where Thomas inadvertently got the journalist killed by Carmine Falcone after asking the crime boss to only threaten them into silence, and then got himself killed when he tried to turn Falcone in. In a not-so-roundabout way, the Maroni family is responsible for Batman losing his parents. </p><p>Now, that the heads of the family are gone, is there a long lost familial successor looking to take on the mantle and, as a result, the ire of Batman?</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="807584c861b1ffb7f41dfbe5c8ad8244" data-recommend-id="image://807584c861b1ffb7f41dfbe5c8ad8244" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1280" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cristin Milioti as Sofia Falcone in episode 4 of The Penguin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Cristin Milioti as Sofia Falcone in episode 4 of The Penguin." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Macall Polay/HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="807584c861b1ffb7f41dfbe5c8ad8244" data-recommend-id="image://807584c861b1ffb7f41dfbe5c8ad8244" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1280" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cristin Milioti as Sofia Falcone in episode 4 of The Penguin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>One of the biggest missteps the movie made that was fixed in the show was the relatively little time fans got to spend in the playground of nightmares that is Arkham Asylum.

Given the fact she’s back in her old, deranged stomping grounds, and the best <em>Batman</em> villains are in Arkham, <em>The Batman Part II </em>would be foolish to treat it like a side quest after <em>The Penguin</em> made us want to live in that world for longer.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ced66dfdea4c224c4539136f1dba03f8" data-recommend-id="image://ced66dfdea4c224c4539136f1dba03f8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1400" data-height="699" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Chinese mob boss in The Penguin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Chinese mob boss in The Penguin." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Macall Polay/HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ced66dfdea4c224c4539136f1dba03f8" data-recommend-id="image://ced66dfdea4c224c4539136f1dba03f8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1400" data-height="699" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Chinese mob boss in The Penguin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Gotham is fun, but it’s just one city. Both the movie and the show keep all of the action inside the murderous metropolis. But, in <em>The Penguin</em>, Cobb mentioned a few times how partnering with the Chinese crime syndicate The Triads could take his operation international. Now that they not only agreed to join his alliance with the other rival gangs of Gotham, but also had internal mutinies that helped Cobb ascend to the top of Gotham’s crime world, it looks like it’s only a matter of time before we see the true scope of Gotham’s influence beyond the city limits. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="87bf4d6c84d3388222df0d88fb813686" data-recommend-id="image://87bf4d6c84d3388222df0d88fb813686" data-format="jpg" data-width="1140" data-height="641" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A split image of Cristin Milioti as Sofia Falcone in The Penguin and Zoe Kravitz as Selina Kyle/Catwoman in The Batman" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A split image of Cristin Milioti as Sofia Falcone in The Penguin and Zoe Kravitz as Selina Kyle/Catwoman in The Batman" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="in-house-art" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros/Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="87bf4d6c84d3388222df0d88fb813686" data-recommend-id="image://87bf4d6c84d3388222df0d88fb813686" data-format="jpg" data-width="1140" data-height="641" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A split image of Cristin Milioti as Sofia Falcone in The Penguin and Zoe Kravitz as Selina Kyle/Catwoman in The Batman" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Carmine Falcone spread his seed far and wide, and somehow produced two of the most badass women to ever hit Gotham. Kyle may have despondently left the city after deeming it beyond saving at the end of <em>The Batman</em>, but we all know the woman who eventually becomes Catwoman always crawls back to the city that made her. And her letter to her imprisoned half-sister at the end of <em>The Penguin</em>’s season finale is her first step back home.</p><p>Kyle’s letter not only woke Gigante out of her catatonic gaze, but brought a smile to her face. This is arguably the most compelling wrinkle that <em>The Penguin </em>adds to <em>The Batman Part II</em>’s storyline. What could she have possibly written that would make a woman, who could be facing death in prison, feel joy? Did she congratulate her on wiping out multiple crime families, including the one they were both born to and victimized by? Did she let her know that she thinks she’s innocent (she isn’t) and she was framed (she wasn’t)? Or, maybe she told her a plan she has to get her sister out so they can enact her revenge alongside her lover boy Batman?</p><p>Whatever she wrote, <em>The Batman Part II </em>needs to find a way to make that a catalyst for the sisterly meet-up we all want. Plus, I’m sure if you have undeniable talent like Kravitz and Milioti in your cinematic universe, you’re legally obligated to make them share the screen. Or, you should be. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="431fb194b40af3cc114a60d591783cf1" data-recommend-id="image://431fb194b40af3cc114a60d591783cf1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1077" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Robert Pattinson as Bruce Wayne/Batman in The Batman" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Robert Pattinson as Bruce Wayne/Batman in The Batman" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="431fb194b40af3cc114a60d591783cf1" data-recommend-id="image://431fb194b40af3cc114a60d591783cf1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1077" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Robert Pattinson as Bruce Wayne/Batman in The Batman" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>The Batman</em> director <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a62282321/why-batman-is-not-in-the-penguin/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a62282321/why-batman-is-not-in-the-penguin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matt Reeves told us</a></span> from the start that Batman wouldn’t been swooping in to save the day in <em>The Penguin </em>because the show was meant to focus solely on telling the story of Gotham’s underworld, not how Batman fights their crimes.

While probably best known for his movie appearances in the Candyman and Final Destination franchises, the actor also has voiced some big roles in video games the past few years--such as Venom in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/marvels-spider-man-2-review-web-warriors/1900-6418134/" data-ref-id="1900-6418134">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Developer Insomniac Games paid tribute to Todd over the weekend, posting a statement <a href="https://x.com/insomniacgames/status/1855085273035530368" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on X</a> noting the team was "heartbroken" by his death. "He brought so much joy to our studio during the production of Marvel's Spider-Man 2 and to many fans around the world with his inimitable voice and presence. We are Venom... forever," said Insomniac.</p><p dir="ltr">Spider-Man 2 saw the introduction of the symbiote, portrayed by Todd. Last year, the actor showed up with other <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-spider-man-2-gets-comic-con-panel-this-month-with-a-bunch-of-big-names/1100-6515752/" data-ref-id="1100-6515752">big names from Spider-Man 2 for a Comic-Con panel called "Symbiotic Relationships."</a> Todd also told <a href="https://www.marvel.com/articles/games/marvels-spider-man-2-venom-tony-todd-interview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Marvel.com</a> before the game launched that "Venom is one of the coolest Marvel characters ever created." Last month, Insomniac revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-spider-man-2-comes-to-pc-in-january/1100-6527271/" data-ref-id="1100-6527271">Spider-Man 2 will arrive on PC on January 30</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Todd will also be featured in next month's Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.

            <p>Stop everything - Xbox is teasing that Spyro is coming to Game Pass.</p>
<p>We don't have much to go on - Microsoft simply posted a 30-second teaser of a glittery chest and the words, "hey, uhh who left this chest here?" - but it's enough to get fans excited that the Spyro: Reignited Trilogy could be on its way to the Xbox Game Pass subscription service.</p>

<p>The official Sypro the Dragon X/Twitter account responded with three wide-eyes emojis and shared the message. Up until today, the account had been dormant since May.</p> <div>

<p>The good news is these kinds of teases often come ahead of an imminent release, so, hopefully, we won't have to wait long for formal confirmation.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Microsoft has announced its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-november-line-up-announced">Xbox Game Pass line-up for the first half of November</a>, headlined by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-slug-tactics">Metal Slug Tactics</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/goat-simulator">Goat Simulator</a> Remastered and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</a>.</p>
<p>Xbox recently reaffirmed its commitment to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-reaffirms-commitment-to-bringing-great-games-to-more-people-on-more-devices">"bringing great games to more people on more devices"</a> and plans to "extend" its strategy to bring its most notable franchises to other platforms like PS5 and Nintendo Switch.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-will-make-exploration-feel-truly-rewarding-says-machinegames/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, MachineGames has <a href="https://youtu.be/ik6WEckZKh4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released </a>a new deep dive video for the upcoming action/adventure game <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-qa-game-features-dozens-of-upgrades-is-absolutely-inspired-by-riddick/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>. In the footage, Audio Director Pete Ward claimed that the game will make exploration feel truly rewarding, especially for those players who like to wander off.</p>
<p><em>The game is designed around the charm and resourcefulness of our hero. You will be thrown into this story-driven&nbsp;journey where Indiana must hunt for clues to uncover the Great Circle's mysteries. This race for answers will take you to ancient crypts, lost civilizations, and much more.</em></p>
<p><em>The focus for this game is adventure. When you venture into the unknown we want exploration to feel truly rewarding. We carefully crafted each environment to encourage players to uncover clues left, discover valuable objects, and reveal hidden secrets that can aid you in your adventure.</em></p>
<p><em>While the vividly recreated locations you visit have a clear goal driving the story forward, you'll always feel enticed to explore the world and discover the many secrets hiding around every corner. Open areas give you the freedom to find your own adventures beautiful. In these areas, let your curiosity take you off the main path and uncover new missions and mysteries.</em></p>
<p>As an adventure game first and foremost said to have been <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-a-spiritual-successor-to-classic-adventure-game-fate-of-atlantis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inspired</a> by 1992's classic point-and-click game Fate of Atlantis, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will also place a significant emphasis on puzzles.</p>
<p><em>During your adventure, Indiana's versatile tools are at your disposal. It's up to you to find clever uses for each of them. That includes Indiana's camera. Snap photos to reveal historical insights and important clues. Or if you feel the need, use it to receive puzzle hints.</em></p>
<p><em>The journal is your complete guide. It starts as a blank slate but becomes a detailed archive of your journey with maps, photos, and letters. It's a reminder of where you've been and, for the sharp observer, a hint about where to head next.</em></p>
<p><em>Indiana's greatest tool is his mind. Just like Indie, you'll use yours to navigate buried tombs and activate forgotten puzzles while avoiding deadly traps. Clues from the journal, traversal, and decryption are just a few of the things you'll need to figure out the solutions. Every puzzle is designed to fit seamlessly into the world. They range from smaller challenges hiding forbidden secrets to epic obstacles leading to greater mysteries. Solving these puzzles will make you feel like the world's greatest archaeologist.</em></p>
<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will be released on December 9 for PC and Xbox Series S|X, while a PlayStation 5 version is being <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-to-release-as-timed-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prepared</a> for Spring 2025. Meanwhile, check out our recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-hands-on-preview-swinging-in-style/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hands-on preview</a> from a press event.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dark Minimalist RPG Songs of Rats Revealed for Next Year]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/songs-of-rats-dark-indie-rpg</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dark-minimalist-rpg-songs-of-rats-revealed-for-next-year.1032573/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/songs-of-rats-dark-indie-rpg<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Salient Games and publisher Tesseract Studios have announced&nbsp;<em>Songs of Rats</em>, an "indie dark role-playing game inspired by choose-your-own-adventure books". It's coming to PC sometime early next year.</p>

<p><em>Songs of Rats&nbsp;</em>takes place in a cluster of broken-down spaceships and space stations "crushed and combined into one massive structure" known as the Wreckage. Bizarrely, due to "advanced self-repair technology", the Wreckage has become a haven for its inhabitants.</p>

<p>You must venture into the darkest, deepest corners of this "dangerous yet livable labyrinth" in order to uncover "the dark secrets of fallen civilizations", together with a team of fellow explorers that will help you to navigate the Wreckage's many dangers.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/songs-of-rats-announced-mutants-battle.jpg?itok=rtgbYN2L 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/songs-of-rats-announced-mutants-battle.jpg?itok=MWG2kHli 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Songs of Rats&nbsp;</em>has a deliberately lo-fi, grainy aesthetic.</figcaption></figure><p>As a roguelike,&nbsp;<em>Songs of Rats&nbsp;</em>will feature an ever-changing world, along with a range of "strange, human and inhuman enemies" with which to do battle. It wouldn't be much of an eldritch superstructure without them, after all.</p>

<p>Exploring will not just get you combat encounters with horrors; it'll also net you bonuses that you can use to upgrade your character, making you better-equipped to survive the dangers of the Wreckage.</p>

<p>Largely speaking,&nbsp;<em>Songs of Rats&nbsp;</em>tells its story through text and evocative lo-fi images rather than hoity-toity fully-3D graphics, so if you've got any degree of nostalgia for the old days of RPGs, then this one will likely serve you well.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Songs of Rats&nbsp;</em>right here. It gives a good sense of the strange, chilly sci-fi aesthetic the game is going for.</p>




<p>Aesthetically,&nbsp;<em>Songs of Rats&nbsp;</em>shares a fair amount in common with 2022's <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/norco" rel="nofollow">retro-style adventure game&nbsp;<em>Norco</em></a>, although it's perhaps a little closer to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/classic-gold-box-rpgs-to-hit-steam-later-this-month" rel="nofollow">old-school dungeon-crawlers</a> like&nbsp;<em>Eye of the Beholder&nbsp;</em>on the gameplay front.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Songs of Rats&nbsp;</em>launches on PC via Steam sometime in the first quarter of 2025. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3300470/Songs_of_Rats/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wishlist it here if you like</a>.</p>

The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/27/15958176/wolfenstein-ii-the-new-colossus-gameplay-preview-nazi-punching"><em>Wolfenstein</em></a> studio released a nearly 15-minute-long video, which seems to give a very good idea of what to expect in the full release. That includes plenty of cryptic puzzle solving inside of ancient ruins, and lots of using a whip in both combat and traversal.</p><p>While the exploration is obviously at the heart of the game, the new video makes it look like there will be quite a bit of variety to the combat as well. The hand-to-hand brawling looks a bit like a boxing game, but you can combine it with the whip to pull enemies towards you like Scorpion in <em>Mortal Kombat</em>. And there are plenty of other fun details, like an excellent adventure journal and an old-school camera that can take photos and provide puzzle hints.

This look at the back end, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1855420102985802149&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1855420102985802149" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently shared</a></span> by <em>Pokémon</em> community account CentroLeaks, outlines a suspected upcoming schedule of the card game from new events to new booster packs, with the card set after Genetic Apex <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://note.com/safe_abelia5761/n/n2e641cc42282&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://note.com/safe_abelia5761/n/n2e641cc42282" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">seemingly arriving around January 29</a></span>.</p><p>That deduction was based on the apparent naming convention in the code which tags current in-game events as part of A1, while after January they move to A2. But that doesn’t mean players will have to wait several months before the game’s first new cards appear. There’s also an A1a booster pack event starting around December 17 which seems like it could be part of a smaller, mid-season mini-expansion. That’s a good thing if it turns out to be accurate, as anyone playing daily up to that point will have likely filled out much of <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>’s existing Pokédex outside of the rarest cards. </p><p>Other significant milestones in the datamind findings <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-in-game-currency-gold-rewards-1851693684&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-in-game-currency-gold-rewards-1851693684">point to a new store update</a></span> on December 1, as well as something Bulbasuar-themed appearing in the weeks after that. In the meantime, November appears to have a part 2 to the current Meowth event waiting in the wings, as well as a potential Black Friday event and something called “Mass Outbreak.” </p><p>If you ask me, the updates can’t come soon enough. I’m starting to tire ever so slightly of the existing battle meta, and the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-lapras-drop-event-gacha-1851689506&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-lapras-drop-event-gacha-1851689506">Lapras event</a></span> is truly a grind. Fortunately, <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> still excels at the thing I need it for most: 5 minutes of peace staring at beautiful <em>Pokémon </em>cards while I drink my morning coffee. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-exists-in-part-because-younger-gamers-arent-familiar-with-the-series-anymore-konami-says<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Konami has revealed that one of the reasons it greenlit the Metal Gear Solid 3 remake is because younger gamers aren’t familiar with the series anymore.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to Play and shared by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/metal-gear/metal-gear-solid-delta-exists-because-konami-was-starting-to-get-worried-that-the-younger-generation-of-gamers-arent-familiar-with-the-metal-gear-series-anymore/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GamesRadar</a>, series producer Noriaki Okamura admitted Konami is looking to capture a new audience with the remake, which arrives 20 years after the original Metal Gear Solid 3 and nine years after the last mainline entry.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“One of the things that really sparked us to do the remake in general is because we realized that a lot of the newer, younger generation of gamers aren’t familiar with the Metal Gear series anymore,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It was basically our mission, our duty, to kind of continue making sure that the series lives on for future generations. After all, we leave behind much more than just DNA, as Solid Snake would say — but again, who is Solid Snake?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In fact, this is one of the reasons Konami chose the Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater name for the remake, as opposed to simply calling it Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. Timeline wise, Snake Eater is the first game in the series, so going with the Greek letter 'delta' helped get this new beginning across.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thr franchise began in 1987 with Hideo Kojima’s Metal Gear, and last saw a mainline entry with Kojima’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain">Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain</a>, released in 2015. Spin-off <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-survive">Metal Gear Survive</a> launched in 2018, with only collections of older games coming out in the subsequent years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, it’s easy to understand where Konami is coming from here. Metal Gear is well-known by fans of a certain age and has enormous nostalgia potential, but without a brand new mainline entry in nearly a decade, interest among younger gamers probably isn’t where Konami wants it to be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The question now is, after Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater comes out, where will Konami take the series next? <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-had-a-pretty-rough-launch-so-konami-says-its-being-more-careful-with-vol-2">We know MGS: Master Collection Vol. 2 is in the works</a>, but could Konami be set to remake Kojima’s seminal Metal Gear Solid next? After that, could fans finally get a brand new Metal Gear Solid game? If so, would Konami continue the story as set out by Kojima, or start fresh?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, Konami is yet to announce a release date, but it's due out on 	</p><p data-cy="paragraph">PS5, Xbox Series X and S, and PC at some point in 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-datamine-alludes-to-expansion-set-in-january<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a> players may want to get cracking Genetic Apex packs as quickly as possible as a datamine of the mobile game has alluded to expansion sets arriving in December and January.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">X/Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1855420102985802149?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@CentroLeaks</a> revealed an event scheduled in the backend of the digital TCG that references A2 and is therefore seemingly linked to a new card drop. Genetic Apex, the first Pokémon TCG Pocket set and the only one currently available, is labelled as A1 in the game, so A2 is presumably the second full set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The event is listed as beginning October 29 (the game's global release date) and running until January 29. It's dubbed "Period A1 to A2 (After Global Release) and therefore appears to indicate the end date of Genetic Apex being the main set in Pokémon TCG Pocket.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Alternate Art 'Secret' Card in Pokémon TCG Pocket: Genetic Apex</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Interestingly, another scheduled event could indicate a supplementary set or expansion to Genetic Apex coming in December. "Period A1 to A1a" is similarly listed as already begun but ends December 16, so players should perhaps expect a smaller card drop then.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is far from an official announcement, of course, and no further details will be available until developer Creatures Inc. shares them itself. But a full release every three months lines up with the proper Pokémon TCG schedule and standard card game practice in general.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The December event is more mysterious, as Genetic Apex already includes 226 standard numbered cards and 60 super rare alternate arts. Collecting all of these <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/it-takes-almost-2-years-to-complete-just-the-first-pokmon-tcg-pocket-set-unless-you-spend-money">will take upwards of a year</a>, so it's perhaps unlikely Creatures Inc. will expand the set even further.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The event may point to a special event for Genetic Apex instead, where more packs become available, or perhaps even a new bumper booster pack that contains more cards. Doing something like this is fairly common practice in games, with the larger, more expensive packs usually only available by spending real money.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Only time will tell what these events actually are, but fans can enjoy the myriad existing events already added by Creatures Inc. in the meantime. One offers players a free Wonder Pick with the chance of pulling either a Meowth or Chansey alongside event tickets and Wonder Hourglasses, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-adds-new-rewards-and-missions-to-wonder-pick-event">its second part currently active</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A solo battle event <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-releases-lapras-ex-through-limited-time-battle-event">lets players take on a handful of water themed decks</a> for the chance of winning new promo cards including Lapras ex, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-pocket-gets-first-pvp-event-today">a PVP event puts badges on the line</a> in true Pokémon fashion. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-battles-are-already-dominated-by-two-decks-in-particular">Mewtwo and Charizard are naturally dominating the meta so far</a>, but one outlier comes via Misty, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/misty-has-become-pokmon-tcg-pockets-greatest-villain">whose heads or tails effect is driving many up the wall</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the collecting front, some players are focused on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-players-think-theyve-discovered-a-secret-way-to-get-super-good-cards">a conspiracy theory about crinkled corners</a> while most are swooning over <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-players-swoon-over-mythical-god-packs-that-have-5-alternate-art-cards">mythical god packs that award five alternate art cards in one go</a>.

            <p>Bethesda and MachineGames have released an extended look at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-everything-we-know-9408">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, giving us a deeper dive into the upcoming game.</p>
<p>In the 15-minute presentation, the team offers a look at a broad spectrum of gameplay, including combat, puzzles and traversal. The part I am most looking forward to - Indy's turn as an Agent 47-like man of disguise - is also shown off, with MachineGames letting us see the archaeologist infiltrate areas dressed as a member of the clergy. </p>
<p>And yes, just like Hitman's Agent 47, you can hide bodies by picking them up and moving them out of sight of patrolling guards or whoever else you don't want happening upon your corpse wake.</p>

<p>The trailer also gives us a look at the Great Circle's Adventure Points, which are used to unlock new skills. One such skill is Lucky Hat, which allows our hero an extra chance to come back from a fatal blow. Another, Bear Hands, lets Indy do unarmed takedowns of enemies. Speaking of taking down enemies, Indy can use his gun and whip to get the upper hand, but also items he finds lying around the environment. One moment sees the archaeologist bopping his assailant on the head with a rolling pin.</p><p>On the puzzle side of things, we see Indy pouring out some wine to reveal a number hidden within a basin, and elsewhere bouncing light around a secret room with ancient mirrors. He can use his camera to search for puzzle clues, as well. </p>
<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is set to release across Xbox and PC next month, on 9th December. It will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-confirmed-for-playstation-5">arrive on PS5 next year</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/my-little-puppy-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Krafton and developer Dreamotion have announced&nbsp;<em>My Little Puppy</em>, an adorable-looking adventure in which you play a corgi who's waiting to greet their owner in the afterlife. Sniff.</p>

<p>Per a press release, the thesis of&nbsp;<em>My Little Puppy&nbsp;</em>is that "when a person departs from this world, the dog who went ahead will warmly welcome them". Dreamotion head Lee Joon-young says the game was created "to offer warmth and comfort" to those whose dogs have passed away.</p>

<p><em>My Little Puppy</em>'s little doggo protagonist must set out on a journey across the afterlife to meet their owner, exploring "oceans, deserts, and snowy plains" along the way.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/my-little-puppy-krafton-heaven.jpg?itok=OcewKKqj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/my-little-puppy-krafton-heaven.jpg?itok=slw1QcYk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>My Little Puppy&nbsp;</em>is bound to make you bawl if you love dogs.</figcaption></figure><p>As you explore said biomes, you'll also meet a host of other dogs who are awaiting the arrival of their owners in the afterlife, and you'll get to learn their stories. I don't know if I have the emotional strength for this.</p>

<p>Not only that, but you'll be able to engage in what Dreamotion and Krafton call "interactions based on real dog behaviors", including sniffing other dogs, barking, and, well, just hangin' around as a fluffy lil' dog. What's not to love?</p>

<p>Lest you fear that&nbsp;<em>My Little Puppy&nbsp;</em>won't have the kind of gameplay variation to keep you engaged, however, think again. It'll feature "a range of gameplay genres, from adventure to action and racing", according to the two studios.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>My Little Puppy&nbsp;</em>right here. Just try to make it through the whole thing without welling up.</p>




<p><em>My Little Puppy&nbsp;</em>is part of a slew of recent games that have you playing as little pet friends. Others include the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/little-kitty-big-city-players-sales" rel="nofollow">city exploration game </a><i><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/little-kitty-big-city-players-sales" rel="nofollow">Little Kitty, Big City</a>&nbsp;</i>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/stray" rel="nofollow">cyberpunk narrative adventure&nbsp;<em>Stray</em></a>.</p>

We don't yet know exactly when it's launching or whether it'll be available on consoles as well.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/yakuza-creator-next-game-time-to-finish<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Toshihiro Nagoshi, the creator of the&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon&nbsp;</em>franchise (formerly known as&nbsp;<em>Yakuza</em>), has revealed some new tidbits of information regarding his next project, and if you're hoping for something less bloated and overstuffed than many modern games, you may well be in luck.</p>

<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202411/23768" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Famitsu</a> (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/yakuza-creator-says-his-new-game-will-be-an-action-adventure-with-a-rather-high-age-rating-and-complex-game-system/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Automaton Media</a>), Nagoshi says he wants players to be able to complete his new game in "a sensible amount of time", suggesting that the age of games' size being a selling point "is coming to an end".</p>

<p>Nagoshi says that the amount of games available to gamers right now is "bordering on excessive"; he says there are so many games available now that "you can't play them all", and it's hard to disagree with him on that front.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/toshihiro-nagoshi-yakuza-creator-majima-kiryu.jpg?itok=WLhR55Vs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/toshihiro-nagoshi-yakuza-creator-majima-kiryu.jpg?itok=w7jkD6fF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Toshihiro Nagoshi was responsible for creating the&nbsp;<em>Yakuza&nbsp;</em>(now&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon</em>) franchise.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Nagoshi, his new project will achieve a "high level of expression" in terms of its character drama, and the game will be "large scale", although it seemingly won't take you hundreds of hours to finish.</p>

<p>In fact, Nagoshi says that his team is currently trying to find ways to make the in-game map smaller because it's currently "too large", which is a rather endearing thing to admit.</p>

<p>Although Nagoshi says his game's systems are complex, he also says he intends the game to be played by adults; it'll have a "rather high age rating", according to Nagoshi himself, and it'll espouse a unique worldview that will make people "think 'What's that? I need to see more' when they first see it".</p>

She’s an adult woman, it’s no big deal. But it’s <em>maybe</em> more of an issue when she starts leaving tabs open all over the merch sold to kids.

Two new Barbie dolls have been released, to coincide with the imminent release of the movie version of hit musical <em>Wicked</em>, based on the characters of Glinda, the Good Witch of the South, and Elphaba, the Wicked Witch of the West (Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo). Each is released in the traditional cardboard box, and as ever, it’s covered in all sorts of tiny writing almost no one ever reads. However, those who did read the fine print on the new dolls got quite a shock when they followed the URL listed for the products.</p><p>It’s easy to see how the mistake was made. The address on the boxes is “www.wicked.com,” which makes sense, right? Except, that takes you to porn site Wicked, owned by Dutch company Digigamma, a company that says it “specializes in running and managing high risk e-commerce businesses.”</p><p>Presumably the intention had been to point people toward Universal’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.universalpictures.co.uk/micro/wicked&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.universalpictures.co.uk/micro/wicked" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.wickedmovie.com</a></span>, but someone at Mattel assumed the production company had done a better job of scooping up URLs.</p><p>The Wicked porn site must have already been doing a roaring trade in mistaken traffic, long before the Barbie goof. The musical has been an astonishing hit since 2003, sitting on Broadway and touring worldwide ever since. The movie itself will have added to that, with early word suggesting it’s going to be <em>very</em> good. But Barbie has pushed it into the mainstream, with news sites jumping on the error.<br></p><p>Mattel told <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/wicked-dolls-mattel-mistakenly-link-to-adult-porn-site-1236058013/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/wicked-dolls-mattel-mistakenly-link-to-adult-porn-site-1236058013/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Hollywood Reporter</em></a></span> that it “deeply regrets” the incident, and the doll was removed from sale in stores like Target, Walmart and Kohl’s by the end of Sunday, the 10th. They’re also gone from Amazon, although <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mattel-Accessories-Movie-Inspired-Removable-HYM40/dp/B0CMGXW1CV&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mattel-Accessories-Movie-Inspired-Removable-HYM40/dp/B0CMGXW1CV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the UK version of the retailer</a></span> still has listings, albeit with no option to buy.</p><p>Those boxed dolls are going to be worth <em>a fortune</em>.

<p>Xbox has teased that Spyro will be added to Xbox Game Pass in the near future.</p>



<p>The tease came from the official Xbox Game Pass X handle (formerly Twitter), which posted a <a href="https://x.com/XboxGamePass/status/1855973786547601437" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">27-second short video</a> on a chest from Spyro. Several minutes after the post, the official Spyro X handle replied with <a href="https://x.com/SpyroTheDragon/status/1855974931156054091" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">several eye emojis</a>, suggesting that an announcement was on the horizon.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-game-pass-activision-august/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumors surfaced that several Activision games</a>, including Spyro, would be coming to Game Pass, but the exact timeframe could never be determined.</p>



<p>In October, Game Pass saw the addition of Call of Duty to the service, which some analysts believed increased the service’s subscriber count by several million. Now, though, it seems like Xbox and Activision are gearing up for another huge release in the form of your favorite purple dragon.</p>



<p>Activision announced in 2007 that the Spyro The Dragons series sold over 20 million units, but as of September 2023, the Spyro Reignited Trilogy sold over 10 million units across all consoles.</p>



<p>Xbox typically likes to announce and release its Game Pass games on a Thursday, so keep your eyes peeled later this week.</p>



<p>Are you excited to see Spyro coming to Game Pass? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forum</a>.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-dlc-teased-on-base-games-anniversary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lies of P</a> studio NEOWIZ announced today that it will publish the debut game of <a href="https://zakazane.studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ZAKAZANE</a>, a Polish indie developer founded a while ago by former CD Projekt RED and 11bit Studios developer Jan Bartkowicz, Piotr Chomiak, Radosław Gwarek, and Marta Sobek. ZAKAZANE had previously raised $1 million in pre-seed investment led by The Games Fund to kickstart the development of their first game, and this partnership is worth another $8 million. ZAKAZANE is currently working on a single player Noir Western RPG set in a&nbsp;remote mining town sheriff must solve a case that threatens to destroy the community.</p>
<p>Jan Bartkowicz, CEO and co-founder of ZAKAZANE, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>We found a great understanding of our vision with NEOWIZ, who got excited about our debut title the minute we showed them the demo. In conversations that followed, they never tried to steer us away from our principles but rather to make sure we stick to our guns. It’s clear both sides understand that games can become important to people on a personal level, making them both valuable works of culture and good business.</em></p>
<p>Seung-Cheol Kim, co-CEO at NEOWIZ, stated:</p>
<p><em>NEOWIZ is committed to delivering remarkable, story-driven games that resonate with gamers worldwide, and we're actively searching for talented developers with a passion for well-crafted narratives. When we first met ZAKAZANE, we felt an immediate kinship around their passion for developing projects that profoundly captivate audiences. Their upcoming neo-western RPG will be a key addition to our portfolio and reflects our ambition to build lasting franchises across PC and consoles. Together, we will create a brand that unites quality and storytelling for gamers to cherish for years to come.</em></p>
<p>It's not the first time that the developer of Lies of P has signed a deal with a Polish developer. The same happened a year ago with Blank Studio, another team formed from CD Projekt Red alums. They are making a post-apocalyptic character driven game, as you can read <a href="https://wccftech.com/blank-studio-qa-ex-cd-projekt-red-devs-talk-about-their-post-apocalyptic-character-driven-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in our Q&amp;A from June 2023.</a></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hello-neighbor-3-revealed</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hello-neighbor-3-officially-revealed-original-creator-heading-up-team.1032489/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hello-neighbor-3-revealed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>tinyBuild has officially announced&nbsp;<em>Hello Neighbor 3</em>, a third mainline entry in the cult classic horror series, and what's more, it boasts the involvement of the franchise's original creator.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Hello Neighbor 3</em>&nbsp;is officially in development, and franchise creator Nikita Kolesnikov is heading up "a small team of developers" to help bring to life what tinyBuild calls a game full of "systems-based exploration".</p>

<p>You'll explore the town of Raven Brooks as an outsider, enjoying a "cozy yet eerie adventure" as you get to know the locals and their "distinct personalities, circumstances, and desires". It sort of sounds like the original&nbsp;<em>Hello Neighbor&nbsp;</em>meets&nbsp;<em>Pathologic</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hello-neighbor-3-announced-yard.jpg?itok=ipNR9EN1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hello-neighbor-3-announced-yard.jpg?itok=gXxd6hRw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hello Neighbor 3</em>'s development process apparently closely mirrors that of the first game.</figcaption></figure><p>The publisher promises that you'll be able to "stick to the shadows in a full simulation" in which you can make decisions, and making said decisions can "potentially unleash catastrophic consequences" upon the inhabitants of Raven Brooks.</p>

<p>In the screenshots tinyBuild has released so far, the art style of&nbsp;<em>Hello Neighbor&nbsp;</em>looks like something of a departure from its predecessors, utilizing moodier and more muddy colors, although it's still got the strange, spindly art style you know (and potentially love).</p>

<p>Kolesnikov says he's hoping that early alphas of&nbsp;<em>Hello Neighbor 3&nbsp;</em>will be available to try out soon, and that he's excited to "keep the development of&nbsp;<em>Hello Neighbor 3&nbsp;</em>in an open format", so presumably, we'll be hearing more about how the project is coming along soon.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hello-neighbor-3-announced-original-game.jpg?itok=EhmrSxgg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hello-neighbor-3-announced-original-game.jpg?itok=pEQQNLnK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hello Neighbor 3</em>'s art style looks more realistic and gloomy than that of its predecessors.</figcaption></figure><p>Although&nbsp;<em>Hello Neighbor 3&nbsp;</em>may have that number at the end of its title, it's far from the third&nbsp;<em>Hello Neighbor&nbsp;</em>game overall.</p>

<p>After the first game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hello-neighbor-delayed-to-december-8" rel="nofollow">fully released in late 2017</a>, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hello-neighbor-card-game-lets-you-betray-your-friends" rel="nofollow">number</a> of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hello-engineer-releases-first-on-stadia" rel="nofollow">spinoffs</a> ensued, as well as a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hello-neighbor-2-announced" rel="nofollow">full-blooded sequel</a> in the form of&nbsp;<em>Hello Neighbor 2&nbsp;</em>(which began life in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tinybuild-announces-hello-neighbor-spinoff-hello-guest-and-not-e3-event" rel="nofollow">pre-alpha form as&nbsp;<em>Hello Guest</em></a>).</p>

<p><em>Hello Neighbor 3&nbsp;</em>will be released for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2789680/Hello_Neighbor_3/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, although we don't have a release date for it yet, nor do we know whether it's coming to consoles as well.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/video-game-history-falls-into-place-in-tetris-forever.1032486/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/11/24291537/tetris-forever-review-ps5-switch-pc-xbox<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For such a simple game, <em>Tetris</em> has a wild history. Developed in the mid-1980s by Alexey Pajitnov in the Soviet Union, <em>Tetris</em>’ global expansion involved a complex web of software copyright, clandestine meetings, handshake deals, and someone stretching a tourist visa to the very limits. It’s a story that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23650577/apple-tetris-movie-taron-egerton-review">inspired a feature film</a> — but it might be best explored in <em>Tetris Forever</em>, the latest retro game collection from Digital Eclipse.</p><p>The studio has made a name for itself with its interactive documentary format. The idea is that, instead of just presenting a bunch of games and supplementary material and leaving it to players to sort through it, the collections put everything into a timeline you can explore in chronological order. This structure adds context to the games so that you have an understanding of why they’re important or interesting before you play them. The format has been used to tell <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23451349/atari-50-review-xbox-playstation-switch-steam">the story of Atari’s first five decades</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23848883/karateka-making-of-digital-eclipse-game-preservation">how Jordan Mechner developed <em>Karateka</em></a>.</p><p>It’s also ideally suited for the story of <em>Tetris</em>. Like its past collections, Digital Eclipse uses a combination of short documentary-style videos, photos, magazine and advertising scans, and the games themselves, and puts them on a timeline. In this case, you start out watching interviews with Pajitnov about his early life and how he first came up with and developed the concept for <em>Tetris</em>. Then you can play the very first version, made up of ASCII symbols, which was available on a Soviet computer called the Electronika 60.</p><p>From there, the story expands as various figures swoop in to take <em>Tetris</em> to the rest of the world, including Pajitnov’s lifelong friend Henk Rogers, who has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henk_Rogers">his own fascinating backstory</a>. As with all of its releases, Digital Eclipse expertly weaves these storylines together, showing players the importance of each beat in the history of <em>Tetris</em>. It’s augmented by a few important voices — including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/31/18047826/tetris-effect-tetsuya-mizuguchi-interview-ps4-vr"><em>Tetris Effect</em> designer Tetsuya Mizuguchi</a> — who explain the game’s cultural impact.</p><p>What also makes it work is that <em>Tetris Forever</em> is just a great collection of <em>Tetris</em> games. It features 18 games, including some that were never widely released. Now, there are some notable omissions, namely the iconic original Game Boy version, but the collection gets around this in a few ways. First off, it includes an incredible array of variants that show the many ways Pajitnov and other designers tried to build on the original concept. (My personal favorite is <em>Magicaliss</em>, which came bundled with <em>Super Tetris 3</em> and adds some clever puzzles and a very metal fantasy theme.) Then there’s an unofficial Game Boy version that looks, sounds, and plays like the original, even if it doesn’t have the actual Nintendo license.</p><p>There’s also a brand-new version of the game called <em>Tetris Time Warp</em>. It starts out like a slick, modern rendition of the game, but every so often will literally warp you back in time briefly, reskinning the game to look like one of the many older variants, and introducing some new challenge that you only have a few moments to complete. Then you’re whisked back to the present. Honestly, I’d buy <em>Tetris Time Warp</em> on its own. But as part of this collection, it’s just an added bonus on top of a great group of classic interpretations.</p><p>For all the ways it has penetrated pop culture, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/31/23663214/best-ways-to-play-tetris-2023">finding a good version of <em>Tetris</em> to play on modern hardware isn’t always simple</a>. For that alone, <em>Tetris Forever</em> is worth the price of admission. But like the rest of Digital Eclipse’s work, it takes things a step further and shows how interactivity is the ideal way to dig into video game history.</p><p><small>Tetris Forever <em>launches on November 12th on PC, Switch, PlayStation, and Xbox.</em></small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-season-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6 Season 1</a> introduces players to a brand-new 6v6 game mode known as Ransack. It’s an objective-based mode with a unique goal that sees players collecting and protecting loot, and it can be played on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-game-modes-maps-equipment-field-upgrades/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">every 6v6 map in the game</a>, including the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-1-maps-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new ones arriving</a> with the first season.</p>



<p>If you’re interested in the full details about Ransack in Black Ops 6, here’s how the mode works.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-does-ransack-work-in-black-ops-6">How does Ransack work in Black Ops 6? </h2>



<p><strong>Ransack sees two teams of 6 fighting to collect gold bars from crates dotted around the map</strong>. Once players have the gold bars, they must transport them back to their team’s stash, which must be protected at all costs. </p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-one-mp-zombies-maps-modes-announcement#Wildcards" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CoD blog</a>, the enemy team can find and raid your stash, so you’ll need to make sure it’s well-guarded. The team that reaches the score limit or has the most gold bars when the time limit has been reached will win the match.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Activision.</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s important to maintain a balance of attack and defense, as you don’t want to fully focus on one or the other. So, Perks and Scorestreaks that aid your speed and knowledge of the enemy team’s location will be essential, as they’ll allow you to move quickly in either attack or defense and see if the enemies are trying to raid your stash.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-ransack-in-black-ops-6">How to play Ransack in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>Ransack will be <strong>available to play just like any other game mode in Black Ops 6 Multiplayer</strong>, and it’s not a limited-time mode. You will be able to select it when you filter the game modes you wish to play when finding a match. When Season 1 drops, it’s also likely that the new mode will have its own playlist too so you can easily find and play it.</p>



<p>This is a completely new game mode for Call of Duty, making its debut in Black Ops 6 Season 1. It seems like a mix between Capture the Flag and Grind, where you had to collect tags and bank them before dropping them upon death.</p>



<p>The new Ransack mode arrives alongside Prophunt and limited-time modes in Season 1. Players are also getting some new maps to sink their teeth into, as well as a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-season-1-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">huge update for Warzone</a>. </p>

<p>Genshin Impact’s update version 5.2, dubbed “Tapestry of Spirit and Flame,” will be released on November 20.</p>



<p>Genshin Impact’s update 5.2 introduces two new Natlan tribes, the Flower-Feather Clan and Masters of the Night-Wind. The elite warriors of this tribe are Chasca and Ororon, and they can be transformed into Saurian companions for players to move and fight mid-air. At the same time, you get to explore the ancient, ruined city of Ochkanatlan while investigating a mysterious incident in the region as a part of the leading seasonal event of the update.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-take-to-the-skies-in-genshin-impact-update-5-2-nbsp">Take to the Skies in Genshin Impact Update 5.2&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Two new species of Saurians will arrive with this update, Qucusaurs and Iktomisaurs. The Qucusaurs are known to be the best rides in the Flower-Feather Clan. They have an accelerated guiding mode that allows you to cover a lot of distance. You can also use Phlogiston to gain altitude or perform horizontal rolls in mid-flight.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Iktomisaurs, on the other hand, are known for reaching vertical heights rather than travelling horizontally. At the same time, they have a unique ability to see, which helps them discover hidden objects. The Iktomisaurs are known as the guides of the Master of the Night Wind. They can also draw energy from Phlogiston-infused objects or craft special items from graffiti patterns.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-new-characters-in-genshin-impact-update-5-2-nbsp">New Characters in Genshin Impact Update 5.2&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Genshin Impact introduces Chasca and Ororon in update 5.2. Chasca is known as the great warrior and peacemaker in the Flower-Feather clan and is a 5-star Anemo bow wielder. The characters use a Soulsniper as their firearm and can float in the air while firing different elemental bullets at enemies. Chasca can also use homing bullets for a lethal strike and restore Phlogiston by eliminating enemies.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Ororon, on the other hand, is the four-star Electro bow wielder from Masters of the Night Wind. Brought up by Iktomisaurs, this character also can rise in the air and have a keen sense of perception. Ororon can also enter Spiritspeaker state while charging an aimed shot, which allows the character to extract power from the graffiti and runes in Natlan. Lastly, having him on your team increases your gliding speed, too.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-other-features-and-content">Other Features and Content</h2>



<p>Genshin Impact’s update 5.2 will continue the story with Archon Quest Chapter V: Interlude, “All Fires Fuel the Flame, with Captain and Kansan assisting the tribe to recover from the damage caused by the Abyss. New threats and a boss called “Tenebrous Papilla” can be found in Natlan, and this monster has been powered by absorbing memories from the corrupted Ley Lines.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The developers have added the Imaginarium Theater, Serenitea Pot, Artifacts, and other key gadgets with this update.&nbsp;Check out the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/10/20241111-genshinimpact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> for complete details.</p>

            <p>It was the 20-year anniversary of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/halo-2">Halo 2</a> at the weekend, which saw the shooter's modern counterparts celebrating with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/halo-2s-lost-e3-2003-demo-will-finally-be-playable-thanks-to-modder-magic">classic multiplayer maps and long-lost levels</a>. But also emerging from the dust of time are insights to the sequel's development back in 2004. Rolling Stone <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/halo-2-bungie-development-1235157887/">interviewed two key designers</a> of the game and made a fun discovery. The Flood (the sickly pale alien infestation that briefly turns Halo into sci-fi horror) was partly inspired by a colourful and innocent children's book about a nice elephant.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Halo and its sequel had a smaller development team than an equivalent blockbuster today might have. This meant some designers would have to do odd jobs outside of their wheelhouse. This is what led Lorraine and Robert McLees, a husband and wife who worked at Bungie during Halo 2's development, to create various things for the game beyond the requirements of their job description. </p>
<p>Although Robert was a weapons designer, for instance, he was also made responsible for coming up with concept art for the Flood. And he particularly remembers creating the infection form of the creature (the little creepy bug-bois that burst and infect their victims with spores).</p>
<p>The first concept "looked like a cross between a house centipede and a blood sausage," he told Rolling Stone. "That was disgusting, but didn’t look very mobile." </p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/halo-2-anniversary-20-years-1.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>

</figure>
<p>Unhappy with the first pass, the artist discovered the perfect shape for the alien creature in time for another attempt. And it turned out to be an image that had been "skittering around in the shadowy parts of my brain" since childhood.</p><p>“When my daughter was born, I gathered up all those Golden Key books I remembered from my own childhood so I could read to her before she went to sleep at night. And there it was, in <a href="https://littlegoldenbooks.fandom.com/wiki/The_Saggy_Baggy_Elephant">The Saggy Baggy Elephant</a>, a palm tree launched into the air by dancing elephants — the weird shape that had been haunting my subconscious mind for thirty-odd years. That was the basis for the Flood Infection Form.”</p>
<p>You can see the exact palm tree he mentions in <a href="https://youtu.be/LrxiNYuqcKI?feature=shared&amp;t=16">this YouTube reading of the book</a>. And sure enough, the tree's roots do evoke the unmistakable tendril legs of a Flood critter. The trunk also looks a lot like that ugly conical appendage that crowns the alien larva's head. So I guess we all need to thank children's illustrator Gustaf Tenggren for inspiring a horrifying monster. Neat.</p>
<p>The interview is interesting reading if you're a Halo head. The two designers talk openly about how crunch at the studio affected their life, even as they dealt with a newborn baby. Lorraine, who was responsible for the game's cover art, was also the person who designed the Pillar Of Autumn, the human spaceship from the first Halo. That's cool. If I am ever asked to imagine "human military spaceship", to this day I would instantly summon that vessel to mind.</p>

<p>A lot of the crunch suffered by Bungie devs is well-documented already. One engineer at the studio said the brutal environment <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/bungies-13-year-battle-to-kill-crunch-culture">"almost killed Bungie as a company."</a> Another lead engineer, Chris Butcher, once told our sister site Eurogamer that they <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-recalls-brutal-halo-2-crunch">worked seven day weeks</a> for months on end. Or as he put it:</p>
<blockquote>"The crunch on Halo 2 was, 'Oh my god, we're f***ed. We're all going to die.' Months and months of that emotional, negative tone was really hard to deal with - but at the same time, we did a lot of awesome work."</blockquote>
<p>The Rolling Stone interview basically confirms a lot of that history. </p>
<p>"Bungie, up to then, never had good managers,” said Robert McLees. “They had creatives that were forced into managerial roles while still remaining in their creative roles — basically working two jobs. This kinda worked when there were 12 of us. It worked less well when there were 30 of us. It collapsed when there were 60 of us.”</p>
<p>"At the time, we really didn’t know what was going to happen," added Lorraine. "If we were going to make it or not. It was the make-it-or-break-it period for the young Bungie crew. So much burn-out.”</p>
<p>Crunch continues to be a problem for game developers today. The management of the studio working on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-citizen">Star Citizen</a> recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cloud-imperium-quietly-steal-star-citizen-developers-weekends-from-under-them-with-mandated-overtime-in-the-lead-up-to-citizencon">imposed a mandatory seven-day week on its employees</a>, for example. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/diablo-iv">Diablo IV</a> workers have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/diablo-iv-developers-allege-mismanagement-crunch-and-disturbing-creative-decisions-in-new-report">also complained about unsustainable work demands</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But that doesn’t mean we can’t still discuss the series and reflect on its history while BioWare forges its future. Somehow, we’ve never done a ranking of the <em>Mass Effect </em>squadmates. While I would love to throw the <em>Mass Effect: Andromeda </em>characters into the mix, those intergalactic explorers have only gotten one game that was clearly building up to a continuation we haven’t gotten. So, rather than pit characters with unfinished stories against people with complete, messy, trilogy-long arcs, we’ll just rank the original squad from the first three games. Grab your omni-tool and let’s dive in.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a632ea56177a9709cc4dc8fd3282b853" data-recommend-id="image://a632ea56177a9709cc4dc8fd3282b853" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Jacob plays an arcade game in front of Alliance students." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Jacob plays an arcade game in front of Alliance students." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a632ea56177a9709cc4dc8fd3282b853" data-recommend-id="image://a632ea56177a9709cc4dc8fd3282b853" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Jacob plays an arcade game in front of Alliance students." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Jacob Taylor is a tragic example of a character being mishandled at nearly every turn. On the surface, a man who has been disenfranchised by the usual channels resorting to joining an extremist group because no one else will listen can be a compelling basis for a character. It sure sounds buck wild to look back on, but it’s pretty in line with the <em>24</em>-esque, Bush-era politics of the franchise. But from then on, Jacob becomes an inconsistently written, often carelessly handled party member.</p><p>He goes back and forth between whether or not he trusts protagonist Commander Shepard, stops being so personable, and then his personal story with his father ends up falling into some weird Black stereotypes that are hard to swallow. It only gets worse in <em>Mass Effect 3 </em>as BioWare decided to use some untoward methods to make Jacob the only love interest who leaves Shepard in the final game, and it’s just a big ol’ bummer to look back on.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="78d91e38becfb3dbefe3985f1b524e51" data-recommend-id="image://78d91e38becfb3dbefe3985f1b524e51" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="James throws a punch." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="James throws a punch." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="78d91e38becfb3dbefe3985f1b524e51" data-recommend-id="image://78d91e38becfb3dbefe3985f1b524e51" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="James throws a punch." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>James Vega exists as <em>Mass Effect 3</em>’s new player insert. He’s a younger soldier who gets dragged into Shepard’s crew more or less by accident and seems pretty ignorant of the ways of the extended galactic society. So, he asks a lot of questions that a newbie might ask about why the Krogans and Turians hate each other and is pretty much a fish out of water for most of the game.</p><p>He can be endearing and heartfelt when he wants to be, and his friendship with shuttle pilot Steve Cortez is delightful. But he also flirts with female Shepard and the relationship systems in <em>Mass Effect 3 </em>never really let you put out that fire and also maintain a decent friendship with him. He feels like one final relic of a moment in <em>Mass Effect </em>that probably wouldn’t fly these days, and as the only character on this list who is only around for one game, he has the least amount of time to make a bigger impression.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="75a1278ef671a1f84545ac7cfc5c7245" data-recommend-id="image://75a1278ef671a1f84545ac7cfc5c7245" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Zaeed looks into a crane machine." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Zaeed looks into a crane machine." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="75a1278ef671a1f84545ac7cfc5c7245" data-recommend-id="image://75a1278ef671a1f84545ac7cfc5c7245" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Zaeed looks into a crane machine." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Both Zaeed and Kasumi suffer as <em>Mass Effect 2</em>’s DLC squadmates who get demonstrably less material to work with across their appearances in the last two games. But damn, bounty hunter Zaeed Masaani is truly elevated by the late Robin Sachs’ portrayal of the gruff, no-nonsense but also kinda sassy old man. Zaeed is an absolutely unhinged gun for hire who is more than willing to put people in the line of fire for his own goals, while also putting his own life on the line for a big enough paycheck. He’s a series of enjoyable contradictions, as he’s one of the most terrifying people on the ship who’s frequently in some of the funniest scenes in the trilogy. It’s just a shame that he feels so underutilized, but that’s what happens when only a fraction of the player base is going to ever see him.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="528bed371bb13b9299111f6db78ae1df" data-recommend-id="image://528bed371bb13b9299111f6db78ae1df" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ashley looks at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ashley looks at something off-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="528bed371bb13b9299111f6db78ae1df" data-recommend-id="image://528bed371bb13b9299111f6db78ae1df" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ashley looks at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Speaking of underutilized characters, I have a soft spot for the original <em>Mass Effect</em>’s human squadmates, but I think only one gets their due (we’ll get to him later). Ashley Williams, meanwhile, starts off as a really strong concept for a party member that could truly grow across the span of a trilogy. She begins as a military brat turned proper soldier herself, though her family’s history is a bit spotty. Because of her family’s relationship with other alien races, she comes in with a skepticism that she’s only comfortable voicing to Shepard because they’re also human, and, in theory, seeing a human character reckon with their past prejudiced beliefs makes for a compelling trilogy-long arc.</p><p>The trouble is, <em>Mass Effect 3</em> never truly gets there. You have a game with party members who are giving their lives as they subvert past prejudiced beliefs, but Ashley can’t so much as muster a sentence about how she used to be racist but has come to love and care for aliens she once judged. Sorry, girl. You’re another example of the <em>Mass Effect </em>trilogy not quite delivering on its promises.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6d3b156a0016b8821f33b4bfdec88d1c" data-recommend-id="image://6d3b156a0016b8821f33b4bfdec88d1c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Kasumi is shown wearing a hood and talking to someone off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Kasumi is shown wearing a hood and talking to someone off-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6d3b156a0016b8821f33b4bfdec88d1c" data-recommend-id="image://6d3b156a0016b8821f33b4bfdec88d1c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Kasumi is shown wearing a hood and talking to someone off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As previously mentioned, Kasumi Goto suffers quite a bit as a DLC character like Zaeed. But she’s also a big personality that makes the most of her limited screen time. The thief sometimes feels a little out of place in <em>Mass Effect 2</em>’s squad of soldiers, biotics, and tech wizards, but she also facilitates one of the game’s coolest missions in the form of an elaborate heist. She’s one of the most unabashedly fun characters on the roster and manages to be consistently funny and charming without devolving into something quippy and groan-worthy. But again, she’s just not utilized as much because people had to pay to have her around.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="191d8e4859111b76beef2fa151a68d0d" data-recommend-id="image://191d8e4859111b76beef2fa151a68d0d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Samara uses her biotics to fling an enemy aside." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Samara uses her biotics to fling an enemy aside." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="191d8e4859111b76beef2fa151a68d0d" data-recommend-id="image://191d8e4859111b76beef2fa151a68d0d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Samara uses her biotics to fling an enemy aside." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The Asari Justicar Samara is one of the most tragic figures in <em>Mass Effect</em>. She spends hundreds of years searching the galaxy for her daughter Morinth, who was born with a genetic condition that would kill anyone she mated with. As she hunts down her daughter, believing her to be an irredeemable killer drawn to the ecstasy she gets from manipulating and then discarding her prey, she also finds respect and pride for how her daughter fought for her freedom. It’s a multifaceted issue, of course, but Samara is bound by a Justicar code that demands she go to the ends of the galaxy to find and kill her own daughter.</p><p>It’s only natural that she would still feel all the nuance in between her code. There’s something compelling about a character who is more or less “trapped” within the boundaries of a code they’ve sworn an oath to, but what was most compelling to me was how, in <em>Mass Effect 3</em>, she decided she would choose death over following it if it meant she must kill the last of her daughters afflicted by the same condition. Though there are ways to stop it, I am still enamored by how even after two games of expressing her devotion to the Justicar code, the woman underneath it still shines through.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c39ca94505d7c1bebafc88c412363879" data-recommend-id="image://c39ca94505d7c1bebafc88c412363879" data-format="jpg" data-width="1680" data-height="944" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Grunt looks up at the sky." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Grunt looks up at the sky." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c39ca94505d7c1bebafc88c412363879" data-recommend-id="image://c39ca94505d7c1bebafc88c412363879" data-format="jpg" data-width="1680" data-height="944" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Grunt looks up at the sky." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>I love my reptilian son. Urdnot Grunt can sometimes feel like the “Wrex replacement,” as the first Krogan squadmate of the trilogy could die in the original <em>Mass Effect </em>and was thus banished from being a party member again until <em>Mass Effect 3</em>’s <em>Citadel </em>DLC. But despite them both being hulking tanks in battle, Grunt and Wrex are still demonstrably different characters with separate places in Krogan culture. Grunt is a tank-bred Krogan, which is a loaded position to be in when your people have a 1/1000 birth rate due to a manufactured sterility plague. Grunt’s whole deal is trying to find a place in a world that he was made to be part of, rather than something he was naturally able to integrate into.</p><p>There are Krogan who hope to deny him a place among their people, and others who advocate for him as he stumbles his way through understanding. He sometimes feels like a bull in a china shop, so having people who create the space for him to find himself is a heartwarming thing in a galaxy full of unfriendliness. By the time he makes a great sacrifice in <em>Mass Effect 3</em>, I was sobbing at the loss of my giant alien child, but then I was fist-bumping when he emerged from the wreckage covered and blood and looking for something to eat. His scene in <em>Citadel</em> is also one of the best ones in the game. Grunt rules.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="175ce8fcc39d49d757946f20b28a31c6" data-recommend-id="image://175ce8fcc39d49d757946f20b28a31c6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="EDI stands in the common area of the Citadel Presidium.

In <em>Mass Effect 2</em>, she’s portrayed as a spherical hologram that can show up in different places on the ship. She’s deadpan but witty, and it’s clear that despite being an artificial intelligence, she has inclinations toward humanity that shine through her code. However, at the tail end of <em>Mass Effect 2</em>, she is unshackled from her programming and is able to eventually inhabit a robotic body in the third game.</p><p>EDI is still one of the most sharply written, funny, and introspective characters in the franchise, and in a vacuum, her attempting to learn what it means to be a person without any previous framework in this universe to look to is fascinating. But it’s hard to feel like all of this introspection is happening for her when so much of her story ends up feeling tied to a possible human/robot relationship with Joker, the Normandy’s pilot.</p><p>The relationship feels uneven, as it wildly swings from Joker being excited about a sexy robot on the ship to trying to get at the heart of how much these two people care about one another. I get what they were going for, and it can help feed into some late-game decisions you can make, but overall, it just feels like swaths of EDI’s existence as a squadmate were reverse-engineered for that relationship. I still love her, though. When she stands on her own, she’s an incredible character.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e5beb7589a3d241341c69559a96ef7fc" data-recommend-id="image://e5beb7589a3d241341c69559a96ef7fc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Javik looks up at the sky with a shocked expression." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Javik looks up at the sky with a shocked expression." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e5beb7589a3d241341c69559a96ef7fc" data-recommend-id="image://e5beb7589a3d241341c69559a96ef7fc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Javik looks up at the sky with a shocked expression." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>While Zaeed and Kasumi felt underserved as DLC, <em>Mass Effect 3 </em>pulled out all the stops for Javik, the Prothean soldier awoken from cryo sleep. To be honest, it’s still baffling that he was a DLC character considering how instrumental Javik is to the world of <em>Mass Effect</em>. The Protheans are one of the last-known living species to have fought the invading Reapers that Shepard is fighting in the trilogy, and what happened to them is one of the biggest mysteries that unravels through each game.</p><p>Having Javik be an optional character you had to pay extra money for is baffling, but he’s noetheless one of the most compelling, meaningfully disappointing squadmates the series has to offer. Asari squadmate Liara has spent her life studying the Protheans her entire life, and to find the last living member of an entire race just to learn he’s kind of an asshole who views everyone around him as primitive cavemen <em>hurts</em>.</p><p>But Javik also has some of the most interesting writing in the trilogy. He’s an echo of a civilization long gone, but even if he dares to hope he can help stop a galaxy-wide invasion, what would his life even look like after? He has no contemporaries, the galaxy is looking to him as a source of wisdom, and all he has to give them are war stories and fearmongering. Even as the Milky Way falls around him, Javik is somehow, even if he doesn’t intend to be, a symbol of hope for the war effort. If one person still survives, the war is not lost. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d38e647c4799bc81adb7441e1614485a" data-recommend-id="image://d38e647c4799bc81adb7441e1614485a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Kaidan sits at a poker table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Kaidan sits at a poker table." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d38e647c4799bc81adb7441e1614485a" data-recommend-id="image://d38e647c4799bc81adb7441e1614485a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Kaidan sits at a poker table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Ashley Williams’ biggest problem is it doesn’t feel like she has an arc. Meanwhile, Kaidan Alenko feels like he’s one of the most underappreciated characters probably in all of BioWare’s portfolio. In a ship of mostly aliens, having a human character dealing with human problems seems unremarkable to some. But Kaidan’s story offers a clear window into the struggles humanity has been dealing with since it joined the galactic community.</p><p>Kaidan is a victim of humans’ insatiable need to be at the forefront of everything, having been subjected to abusive biotic boot camps as he was forced to undergo rigorous training to hone his telekinetic powers. By the time he reaches adulthood, he fears his powers, has frequent headaches, and has become a bit of a wallflower. He goes on to become a biotics teacher in the human military, controls his power, and becomes the second human Spectre. It’s an understated story of not letting your past define your future. But what about when that future seems tenuous? What if you’ve finally gotten your life together and then the world is ending around you? Kaidan’s story isn’t the most theatrical or dramatic, but it is one of the most grounded in a series defined by galactic-scale wars and life-changing choices.</p><p>Kaidan is the lead of a rom-com, running to Shepard as the Reapers rain hellfire down on everything they’ve known and loved. When the two meet one last time on Earth at the end of <em>Mass Effect 3</em>, he recounts his life and the things he’s done and thanks Shepard for the life he’s lived, hoping that there will still be more of it when the dust settles.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="cccbb2c1f28f43c11dc55c8379d699fc" data-recommend-id="image://cccbb2c1f28f43c11dc55c8379d699fc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Jack holds a gun and is hidden behind cover." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Jack holds a gun and is hidden behind cover." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cccbb2c1f28f43c11dc55c8379d699fc" data-recommend-id="image://cccbb2c1f28f43c11dc55c8379d699fc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Jack holds a gun and is hidden behind cover." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Jack and Kaidan are two interesting mirror images of one another. Both are victims of the abuses put on biotics to achieve some imagined version of human superiority, but at the hands of two different institutions. Jack’s mistreatment at the hands of Cerberus led her down a much different path. She had a lot of lives before she joined the Normandy. She was a pirate, a mercenary, and had even joined a cult. Her tattoos all tell the stories of the lives she’s lived, and that elaborate tapestry paints a picture of who she is.</p><p>Jack starts out as a foul-mouthed punk who puts up walls, but as Shepard and the crew chip away at her armor, she learns to trust a team of close-knit people once more. When she shows up in <em>Mass Effect 3</em>, she’s a changed woman, mostly. No longer a loner, she’s dedicating her time to building a better future for biotic kids so no one has to go through what she has. Some might take issue with the hokey way she has a swear jar, but I think it’s sweet to see how she is having to adapt to polite society after spending most of her life throwing middle fingers at it. It’s funny!</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="86eabbad76c8f11191f209d33061ee18" data-recommend-id="image://86eabbad76c8f11191f209d33061ee18" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Miranda sits at a desk and looks into the camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Miranda sits at a desk and looks into the camera." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="86eabbad76c8f11191f209d33061ee18" data-recommend-id="image://86eabbad76c8f11191f209d33061ee18" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Miranda sits at a desk and looks into the camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Miranda Lawson is not going to be everyone’s cup of tea. Unlike universally beloved characters like Garrus or Tali, The Illusive Man’s right-hand woman starts off cold, dismissive of the player, and generally mad that you’re even there. As her icy heart defrosts, you come to learn that Miranda’s cold exterior is a wall built up after a lifetime of everyone who’s ever cared about her always having ulterior motives. It’s not easy to put your trust in anyone when every connection you’ve made has come with a catch. That’s why she initially had only invested emotional energy into her distant relationship with her sister, largely facilitated anonymously as she saved her from her manipulative father’s clutches as a baby.</p><p>Miranda, much like Jack, is a concise summation of <em>Mass Effect 2</em>’s team-building focus, starting off operating on her own interests, then slowly but surely learning to trust the team she works with after believing for so long she could only rely on herself. What puts her a notch above Jack in my eyes is her role in <em>Mass Effect 3</em>. Miranda is a bit enigmatic in the third game, mostly working in the shadows as Shepard handles the Reapers. Having shed her Cerberus ties, Miranda seeks to atone for helping the extremist group reach the status it has in disrupting the war effort, but as she looks into her father’s plans and how they tie to Cerberus, she does so alone. Part of this is because Miranda still feels like she has to handle things on her own, but there’s something potent about someone who was once a radical unlearning their views, realizing that they can’t just integrate back into society and still doing the right thing anyway.</p><p>Miranda’s story can end tragically, as most characters in the <em>Mass Effect </em>trilogy can, and there’s a gutting sadness to that ending if that’s where your choices take you, but if she makes it to the ending, there’s something kind of beautiful about someone having gone to the dark side and reaching the opposite end.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5336031d5129e20a9bc495d670efb8a6" data-recommend-id="image://5336031d5129e20a9bc495d670efb8a6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Thane throws a punch." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Thane throws a punch." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5336031d5129e20a9bc495d670efb8a6" data-recommend-id="image://5336031d5129e20a9bc495d670efb8a6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Thane throws a punch." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>In all my years of having deep talks with folks about the <em>Mass Effect </em>series, I don’t think I’ve found a character more surprisingly divisive than Thane Krios. The Drell assassin is introduced in <em>Mass Effect 2 </em>as a religious, terminally ill, absentee father, who could have easily been an edgelord stereotype. He can often be frustrating to talk to, as he uses his being a tool for someone else as a justification for his actions as an assassin, which feels like a sorry attempt at renouncing all personal responsibility. But Shepard has killed plenty of people without monetary incentive, so who are they to judge?</p><p>Thane’s conversations center around the morality of killing, but while he can be a bit immovable on the subject, the guy isn’t immune to the introspection that a suicide mission prompts. As he attempts to reconcile his relationship with his son Kolyat, Thane finds meaning in his last days.</p><p>His final day is one of the most memorable in the trilogy, as he saves a prominent politician from the worst BioWare villain ever, Lieutenant Bastard Kai Leng, but is mortally wounded in the process. Thane’s final moments, in which he, having repaired his relationship with his son, dies in a Citadel hospital, still has me in a chokehold 12 years later. He, Kolyat, and Shepard (if you choose) recite a prayer. Initially, you do this under the impression that it is for Thane’s comfort in his moments of passing, but when Shepard asks about the contents of the prayer, Kolyat clarifies that the prayer wasn’t for Thane, it was for the commander. That shit still hits, get the fuck out of here.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="14e199da9ed4b86be8d0fa1752567736" data-recommend-id="image://14e199da9ed4b86be8d0fa1752567736" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Garrus looks real pumped about something." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Garrus looks real pumped about something." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="14e199da9ed4b86be8d0fa1752567736" data-recommend-id="image://14e199da9ed4b86be8d0fa1752567736" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Garrus looks real pumped about something." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>This will no doubt be an upset, and I’d say, “Hear me out,” but I know plenty of people will not do that. To be clear: Garrus is one of the best characters in the <em>Mass Effect </em>series, but he is also one of the most uneven characters in the trilogy.</p><p>To get the good out of the way first, the Turian vigilante is one of the most charming, memorable, and likable characters BioWare’s ever put into a video game. By the time we reach <em>Mass Effect 3</em>, he is Shepard’s best bro, a reliable shoulder to rest your head on, and his romance with FemShep is full of both goofy and heartfelt scenes that are some of the best BioWare’s ever written. However, the hill I will die on is that it took Garrus a while to become that character everyone remembers. In the original <em>Mass Effect</em>, he’s got the least going on of any of the party members, and it’s really about nudging him to be one flavor of cop or the other.</p><p><em>Mass Effect 2 </em>certainly fills him out more as a defined character and you can see glimpses of the charming hero we all know and love, though it pretty much repeats this arc by having him become a vigilante that you can Paragon or Renegade him into one conclusion. On top of this, his romance is undeniably the most shallow one in <em>Mass Effect 2</em>, mostly just being a bunch of innuendos and talk of “blowing off steam” when the stakes are high enough to have an emotionally vulnerable moment with your long-time squadmate.</p><p>Once we reach <em>Mass Effect 3</em>, there’s not a shade of either variation and he kinda funnels into one version of himself, but then this guy gets some of <em>Mass Effect 3</em>’s best work and a lovely romance. By the time you have the “no Shepard without Vakarian” conversation at the end, it’s a stunning, earned culmination of a trilogy-long friendship. Every <em>Mass Effect </em>game feels like it’s almost getting there, so by the time <em>Mass Effect 3 </em>really nailed the incredible character everyone remembers him to be, most people feel a brotherhood with him. But that meandering repetition of the first two games keeps him from ascending to the higher rankings for me.</p><p>Yes, yes, here are some tomatoes to throw at me. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="37464373e02f474f9a914bab5b9390ff" data-recommend-id="image://37464373e02f474f9a914bab5b9390ff" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Legion stands with a group of Geth." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Legion stands with a group of Geth." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="37464373e02f474f9a914bab5b9390ff" data-recommend-id="image://37464373e02f474f9a914bab5b9390ff" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Legion stands with a group of Geth." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The Geth are initially presented to you as a hive mind of murderous machines hellbent on the destruction of organics.

He is the first person to tell you the Geth’s side of the story in their uprising on Rannoch, the home planet of their Quarian creators. They were once curious gardeners and laborers who just wanted to know more about the world they were created to live in, and that was terrifying enough for their creators to try to wipe them out. After the Geth successfully drove their oppressors from their homeworld, Legion is an avatar of what’s left: an entire synthetic race of people just as complicated and divided as the rest of us.</p><p>But he also believes in a brighter future for his people, so much so that he sacrifices himself in <em>Mass Effect 3 </em>to elevate the entire race to a new state of intelligence. Legion dies as he lived: hoping that the Geth could find their place in the galaxy alongside not only their creators but the rest of the galactic community. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8a9bcea41a4e743c5e6ea3d2d71ff40b" data-recommend-id="image://8a9bcea41a4e743c5e6ea3d2d71ff40b" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Liara stands in front of a piano." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Liara stands in front of a piano." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8a9bcea41a4e743c5e6ea3d2d71ff40b" data-recommend-id="image://8a9bcea41a4e743c5e6ea3d2d71ff40b" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Liara stands in front of a piano." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Liara T’Soni is borderline the <em>Mass Effect </em>series’ mascot at this point, being the only throughline of every game in the series, including the upcoming fifth one. Part of this is because she is the only character other than James who is guaranteed to survive the events of the trilogy as long as you get a good ending in <em>Mass Effect 3</em>. Because of this, the asari researcher turned galaxy’s most powerful information broker can be a divisive figure for some fans who might consider her to be a “writer’s pet” who’s been given preferential treatment over the years. That’s all valid, but also, Liara’s constant presence in the <em>Mass Effect </em>universe makes her one of the most well-rounded heroes on the Normandy.</p><p>She starts off as an awkward introvert who has her world rocked twice over in the course of the first game. By the time you meet her again in <em>Mass Effect 2</em>, she’s notably hardened and angry at the world, and there’s almost no trace of the naive girl you once knew. Unpacking the various traumas she’s endured to become this person takes its own DLC, and <em>Lair of the Shadow Broker </em>puts her transformation into perspective while bringing the woman we knew back to the surface.</p><p>In <em>Mass Effect 3</em>, she is Shepard’s rock while being hit with as many life-altering blows and revelations as ever. But she remains vigilant, strong-willed, and unyielding, even after facing hardship that would break a weaker person. Liara wanted to discover worlds that had been lost to history and ended up being at the center of history herself. By the time we see her in the next game, she’ll likely be hundreds of years older and wiser. I’m eager to hear the stories she’ll have to tell.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b1970ce21f2244da50f611d7f64f156f" data-recommend-id="image://b1970ce21f2244da50f611d7f64f156f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Tali types on a keyboard." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Tali types on a keyboard." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b1970ce21f2244da50f611d7f64f156f" data-recommend-id="image://b1970ce21f2244da50f611d7f64f156f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Tali types on a keyboard." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Tali is one of the two constants in your party throughout the <em>Mass Effect </em>trilogy, and she absolutely makes the most of all that time. Tali starts out as a nomad who just happens to stumble into the beginnings of a galactic invasion, bringing evidence of the incoming Reaper invasion to Shepard. Throughout the rest of the first game, she’s mostly a representative of the Quarian people, as she’s the only person of the suit-wearing alien race to appear through Shepard’s first adventure. You get a sense that she’s a very important person to her people, but it’s not until <em>Mass Effect 2 </em>that it becomes clear that she’s in the thick of some of the Quarian’s vitriolic, divided politics.</p><p>Tali finds herself caught between everything she’s ever been taught about her people’s history, all her conflicted feelings of resentment and admiration for her father, and the pressures of being a notable figure within her community that gives her a sense of responsibility to her people. She’s the girl who feels pressure from every angle while she’s struggling to even find out who she is and what she wants in the process.</p><p>In <em>Mass Effect 3</em>, Tali has reached the other side of a suicide mission and knows who she is, knows the truth of what happened between the Quarians and the Geth, and is ready to try and usher her people into a new era, should you be able to facilitate that through your choices, at least. In a series where characters like Ashley start out with prejudiced beliefs and more or less just drop them like an old toy they got bored of playing with, Tali is one of <em>Mass Effect</em>’s most effective characters in terms of watching someone slowly but surely suck out the poison of everything they’ve been taught. She’s a changed woman by the end of <em>Mass Effect 3</em>, and the ending in which she’s able to see Quarians and Geth living side by side in Rannoch is one of the most rewarding conclusions in the trilogy.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="567cb2e9f10a8b4187ce284decdd7d03" data-recommend-id="image://567cb2e9f10a8b4187ce284decdd7d03" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Wrex stands at a bar with a pack of ice in front of him." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Wrex stands at a bar with a pack of ice in front of him." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="567cb2e9f10a8b4187ce284decdd7d03" data-recommend-id="image://567cb2e9f10a8b4187ce284decdd7d03" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Wrex stands at a bar with a pack of ice in front of him." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>It still haunts me that there are large swaths of <em>Mass Effect </em>players who never saw Urdnot Wrex fighting Reaper forces on his home planet of Tuchanka and proudly proclaiming “I am Urdnot Wrex, and this is my planet!” Wrex is the first possible casualty of Shepard’s war against the Reapers (RIP to Jenkins, who dies no matter what), and whether he lives or dies depends on whether you’re able to talk him down from a standoff.</p><p>When you first meet him, Wrex is a jaded bounty hunter who has lost all hope for the Krogan race. But when it becomes clear that there’s a possible cure for his people’s sterility on the planet Virmire, a sudden jolt of inspiration strikes. Is there a future for the Krogan that doesn’t end in wasting your life as a mercenary sent out to die, or in thousands of stillbirths? But this cure is being made at a facility that is a threat to the galaxy’s continued existence, so it’s gotta get blown up along with the rest of it.</p><p>Convincing a man who lost all hope for his people that you must destroy a key to their survival is no easy task, and if you can’t get him to stand down, he will meet the wrong end of a bullet. But if you can convince him, he appears throughout the rest of the trilogy as a radical clan leader seeking to usher the Krogan into a new era. Wrex becomes an advocate for the Krogan people where he was once expecting them to burn themselves out to extinction. Without him to help guide his people, the Krogan could have gone down a very different, destructive path.</p><p>Luckily, I never see that future because I am a good friend who he will listen to. The rest of y’all stay safe, though.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="50af322891b1bf72997b7916adc6f3e8" data-recommend-id="image://50af322891b1bf72997b7916adc6f3e8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mordin sits in a shuttle next to Eve." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Mordin sits in a shuttle next to Eve." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="50af322891b1bf72997b7916adc6f3e8" data-recommend-id="image://50af322891b1bf72997b7916adc6f3e8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mordin sits in a shuttle next to Eve." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The phrase “going out in the blaze of glory” is cliche, but Mordin Solus should get that shit trademarked. The Salarian scientist is exuberant, prone to singing, and also a brilliant doctor with an immense knowledge of different alien biology. But all that whimsical charm is in direct contrast with his actions and beliefs. Mordin is one of the people responsible for modifying the Krogan sterility plague when it seemed the people were adapting to it, and as horrific as that sounds, he’s pretty steadfast in believing that it was the right call no matter how much you poke and prod at his calculus. He mourns dead Krogan who gave their lives trying to help scientists find a cure for the sickness that has haunted their people, all while knowing his work pushed them to this point. It’s not until <em>Mass Effect 3 </em>that the cracks start to show. Mordin becomes a double agent for the Salarian government and Krogan clans, leaking intel about a potential cure his people have been working on, and helping to create and distribute the cure to the Krogan people.</p><p>But what sells Mordin beyond his charismatic nature and satisfying about-face is how well BioWare executes the end of his story. The cure must be sent through the Krogan homeworld’s atmosphere at the top of a facility that is crumbling down. Mordin’s fate here is determined by key choices you made over the course of the trilogy. Mordin is ready to die for the cause, and if he heads up to the top of the building, he will sing a <em>Mass Effect</em>ified version of “I Am the Very Model of a Modern Major-General” to calm himself as he dispenses the cure and a new hope to the Krogan race. BioWare mercilessly smothers the final moments of the song under an explosion, and it’s a devastating yet hopeful moment that the trilogy had been building toward.</p><p>Conversely, if you choose to sabotage the cure for more Salarian support in the war, Mordin’s story can end with a much more sinister conclusion. Mordin’s guilt for his crimes can be too great to persuade him, as he sees a future for the Krogan race that he helped delay. If he’s unwilling to back down, Shepard can shoot him in the back, and he won’t make it to the console in time. If your choices throughout the trilogy have undermined the growth of the Krogan race, Mordin can be convinced to help you sabotage the cure and disappear to keep the lie consistent, leaving with hope that maybe there might be a way for the Krogans to not repeat their past violence. All of these conclusions are in keeping with the multifaceted character that is Mordin Solus. He’s a calculated person who can see people as statistics, but he also wants to believe that there is a better way than the path he once chose.</p><p>Had to be him. Someone else might’ve gotten it wrong.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
