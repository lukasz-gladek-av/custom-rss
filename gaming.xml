			<p>The next title developed by Hazelight Studios has leaked online from <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/voici-la-date-de-sortie-de-split-fiction-le-nouveau-jeu-video-a-venir-des-studios-hazelight-59733" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reliable leaker billbil-kun</a>, who has said that the next game is called Split Fiction and is due out on March 6, 2025, on PC and console. Of course, this is just a leak for now, so we don't know whether it is true or not, and you'll have to take it with a pinch of salt. It's said that a reveal trailer for the game is supposed to be released this month and that the game will be announced at The Game Awards, which will be taking place next week.</p>
<p>Hazelight Studios has Josef Fares at the helm, the designer of A Way Out, Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, and It Takes Two. All of these games are published under EA's Originals banner. Split Fiction has the potential to be great, as all three of those games have won awards, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/returnal-it-takes-two-2022-bafta-games-awards-nominations/">It Takes Two</a> winning the most out of the three and being nominated for many more. With that in mind, it's a fair assumption to feel that Split Fiction will equally be full of promise.</p>
<p>Split Fiction is apparently another co-op adventure game being made by Hazelight, which, considering the games that both Hazelight and Josef Fares have worked on, it makes total sense that this is the direction they would go with, especially with the wide success of It Takes Two.</p>
<p>It is known that Hazelight Studios has been working on a new game, as both the Hazelight Studios and Josef Fares social media accounts posted about the upcoming title, confirming that a game was in development. Josef Fares even goes on to post, "Here is a tease. It is a BRAND NEW IP called S**** ******N. Can't wait to show it soon." Considering the number of letters censored and what it begins and starts with, it seems that billbil-kun is right on the money about the title of the game.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we don't have more details than that, and you'll have to wait and see if the upcoming title Split Fiction is announced by Hazelight Studios at The Game Awards, which is only a week away.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/starbreeze-and-krafton-announce-payday-pubg-crossover.1053906/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/payday-pubg-crossover-starbreeze-krafton<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Starbreeze and Krafton have announced a&nbsp;<em>PUBG Payday&nbsp;</em>crossover, with the latter set to infiltrate the world of the former through what sounds like a new gameplay experience within&nbsp;<em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em>.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://corporate.starbreeze.com/en/press/press-releases/starbreeze-partners-with-krafton-to-expand-payday-into-pubg-battlegrounds/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official announcement on Starbreeze's website</a>, the studio says the crossover is about increasing "the visibility and reach of the&nbsp;<em>Payday&nbsp;</em>franchise", which Starbreeze aims to do by "bringing the heisting experience to a broader audience through&nbsp;<em>PUBG</em>".</p>

<p>It's a goal that Starbreeze rather desperately needs to chase right now, since&nbsp;<em>Payday 3</em>'s in a bit of a tight spot. Recently, <em>Payday 3</em> saw <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/payday-3-game-director-steps-down" rel="nofollow">its director step down</a> in the run-up to its first anniversary, and the game's poor performance also led to Starbreeze's CEO <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-studios-ceo-steps-down" rel="nofollow">quitting back in March</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pubg-payday-crossover-zipline.jpg?itok=n-GvAGi8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pubg-payday-crossover-zipline.jpg?itok=qXEtFWam 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Payday 3&nbsp;</em>is making its way to the explosive, high-octane world of&nbsp;<em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>According to the aforementioned announcement, the collaboration will involve "about a quarter of Starbreeze's development organization during a year" under what Starbreeze calls a "work-for-hire agreement".</p>

<p>It sounds, then, like Starbreeze will be creating the&nbsp;<em>Payday&nbsp;</em>content that will make its way into&nbsp;<em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em>. The two studios say they're "currently collaborating on the project's integration roadmap", and we'll get more updates later down the line.</p>

<p>It's been a rocky road for&nbsp;<em>Payday 3</em>, with Starbreeze admitting back in February that the game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-payday-3-performance" rel="nofollow">performing at "significantly lower levels"</a> than it wanted.</p>

<p>Perhaps more embarrassingly for Starbreeze,&nbsp;<em>Payday 2&nbsp;</em>is currently leagues ahead of&nbsp;<em>Payday 3&nbsp;</em>in the Steam player count stakes; at last count,&nbsp;<em>Payday 3</em>'s 24-hour player peak <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1272080/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">was 860</a>, while&nbsp;<em>Payday 2</em>'s stood at a <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/218620/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">far more respectable 38,324</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pubg-payday-crossover-payday-3.jpg?itok=fTOWGsuF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pubg-payday-crossover-payday-3.jpg?itok=3S0I-Y21 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Starbreeze isn't having the best time of it when it comes to&nbsp;<em>Payday 3</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Krafton, meanwhile, is in a very strong position when it comes to&nbsp;<em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em>. The game's 24-hour Steam player peak is <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/578080/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a princely 756,872</a>, which probably goes some way towards explaining why Starbreeze wants to integrate&nbsp;<em>Payday&nbsp;</em>into the battle royale hit.</p>

<p>With regards to the two studios' future plans, Krafton is currently working on a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-mobile-version-krafton" rel="nofollow">mobile version of survival hit&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em></a>, and it's also overseeing <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hi-fi-rush-2-krafton-ceo" rel="nofollow">a sequel</a> to&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>, the IP for which (along with developer Tango Gameworks) it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-acquires-tango-gameworks-and-hi-fi-rush-ip-with-plans-for-future-expansion" rel="nofollow">bought earlier this year</a>.</p>

<p>Starbreeze, meanwhile, is engaged in a multi-stage plan to try and improve&nbsp;<em>Payday 3</em>'s fortunes, and the studio is also working on a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-dnd-game-2026" rel="nofollow">multiplayer game using the&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;</em>IP</a>.</p>

                <p>According to a new report, Ubisoft's family founders are trying to find funding to keep the company in good financial standing while simultaneously attempting to keep control of the firm's future.</p><p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/ubisoft-shareholders-talks-over-possible-buyout-terms-sources-say-2024-12-06/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reuters</a> reports that the Guillemot family--which owns the largest stake in Ubisoft--is talking to Tencent and other financial partners to try to find a way to fund a "management-led buyout."</p><p>CEO Yves Guillemot and his family members are keen to retain control of Ubisoft amid any such deal, and this has apparently been a sticking point in financing discussions. The report said Tencent is asking for a "greater say on future board decisions" in exchange for putting more money into Ubisoft. The report also said Tencent may not invest any further amount of money into Ubisoft.</p><p>The report went on to say Tencent wants to make a deal to help prevent any other firm from coming in to make a hostile takeover bid for Ubisoft. In 2017, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/vivendi-will-reportedly-pursue-a-ubisoft-takeover-/1100-6449572/" data-ref-id="1100-6449572">Vivendi attempted a hostile takeover of Ubisoft</a>. The French gaming giant successfully fought this off after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-is-safe-following-takeover-concerns-vivend/1100-6457541/" data-ref-id="1100-6457541">striking deals with Tencent and a Canadian pension plan.</a></p><p>Tencent currently holds nearly 10% of Ubisoft stock. The Guillemot family owns 15%.</p><p>"We remain committed to making decisions in the best interests of all of our stakeholders," Ubisoft said in a statement to Reuters. "In this context, as we have already indicated, the company is also reviewing all its strategic options."</p><p>Earlier this week, Guillemot released a memo to staff that alluded to ongoing business talks about the company's future. In announcing XDefiant's shutdown and the closure of multiple studios resulting in hundreds of layoffs, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-still-dedicated-to-live-service-after-its-call-of-duty-competitor-came-up-short/1100-6528215/" data-ref-id="1100-6528215">Guillemot said</a>, "I am working tirelessly with my team to identify the best solutions so we can maintain control of our destiny."</p><p>This latest development follows on from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-is-reportedly-considering-a-major-change-to-its-structure/1100-6526909/" data-ref-id="1100-6526909">a story in October</a> that claimed Ubisoft and Tencent were talking about multiple options, including a total buyout. At the time, Ubisoft acknowledged that discussions were underway as the company looked to find a deal that would appease shareholders. That report said it was early days for any such talks, and this new report doesn't mention anything being close to a done deal.</p><p>Minority shareholder and hedge fund AJ Investments published an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-shareholder-urges-company-to-make-drastic-change-amid-sinking-stock/1100-6526392/" data-ref-id="1100-6526392">open letter</a> in September asking Ubisoft to go private and change its strategy.</p><p>In September, Ubisoft's shares sunk to their <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-stock-sinks-to-10-year-low-as-star-wars-outlaws-underperforms/1100-6526262/" data-ref-id="1100-6526262">lowest since 2015</a>, falling by 12.6% after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-sales-were-worse-than-expected-ubisoft-admits-full-mobilized-to-fix-it/1100-6526702/" data-ref-id="1100-6526702">Star Wars Outlaws released</a> to lower-than-expected sales.

                <p>The world of The Witcher is full of monsters, madmen, and mages, but when Geralt isn't on the trail of any of those, the man knows how to wind down with a game of Gwent. The two-player card game has the players as generals pitting their armies against each other. There's been a Gwent mobile app and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1284410/GWENT_The_Witcher_Card_Game/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">free-to-play version on Steam</a>, but now a physical reproduction of the game is on its way.</p><p>Hachette Boardgames UK and new publisher No Loading Games--which is focused on bringing licensed brands to tabletop gaming--are collaborating on the release. The set will come with over 400 cards and a playmat to give players that authentic Witcher 3 experience. There will be variant rulesets from casual play to tournament rules.</p><p>"Gwent is the biggest 'game within a game' in media history," said the marketing manager for Hachette Boardgames UK, Rob Trounce (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-3-card-game-gwent-finally-getting-a-physical-release" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>). "After a 10-year wait, we are proud to be working alongside No Loading Games to bring this beloved game to tabletops in a stunning package--whether it's a souvenir for fans of Geralt and his adventures, or a game for competitive card game enthusiasts, Gwent will be one of the hottest games of 2025."</p><p>The rules are simple enough, but the path to victory has several routes, all depending on your deck, which has its own set of advantages. There are four decks to choose from: Monsters, Nilfgaardian Empire, Northern Realms, and Scoia'tael. A fifth deck--Skellige--was added with The Witcher 3's Blood and Wine expansion. There are also neutral cards that, while not a deck in itself, can be used with any of the main decks to boost their abilities.</p><p>Matches are won by two out of three rounds, which are tallied by red gems in the game. Losing a round loses you one of the points, and if you lose both, you lose the match. A draw makes both players lose a point unless you are the Nilfgaardian Empire, whose ability is to win matches that end in draws.</p><p>The entire Gwent game set is priced at around $40 and will arrive in late 2025.</p><p>While Witcher fans won't have to wait too long for Gwent, they'll have to wait a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-devs-tease-some-of-what-cd-projekt-red-is-planning/1100-6528173/" data-ref-id="1100-6528173">bit longer for The Witcher 4</a>. Though the game has reached full-scale production, we're still looking at two years before the release.</p>

Ubisoft is continuing its talks with Chinese giant <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> over a possible buyout deal that would take the Assassin's Creed maker  private, a new report states.
</p>
<p>
The move - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-and-tencent-considering-buyout-taking-the-company-private-report">first mooted last month</a> - would see Ubisoft take back control of its company from shareholders. Today, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/ubisoft-shareholders-talks-over-possible-buyout-terms-sources-say-2024-12-06/">Reuters</a> reported that Ubisoft is seeking a deal which would see its French founders, the Guillemot family, retain control.
</p>
<p>
However, the same report states that Tencent - Ubisoft's second-largest shareholder with ownership of nearly 10 percent of the company - is keen for a greater role and input on future board decisions.

<p>
Talks remain ongoing between the two companies on how to move forward. Ubisoft stock spiked 14 percent today as a result of the report.
</p>
<p>
"We remain committed to making decisions in the best interests of all of our stakeholders" a spokesperson for Ubisoft told Eurogamer today. "In this context, as we have already indicated, the Company is also reviewing all its strategic options."
</p>
<p>The buyout talks come after a particularly rocky year for Ubisoft, which has suffered at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-suffers-third-round-of-job-losses-this-year">least three rounds of layoffs</a>, staff walkouts, and disappointing sales of key titles. </p>
<p>Ubisoft recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-following-learnings-from-star-wars-outlaws">delayed its biggest upcoming launch Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> until 14th February 2025, after seeing "softer than expected" sales for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the company announced the closure of several studios, with the loss of 277 employees, as it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-shutting-studios-laying-off-277-employees-as-it-pulls-plug-on-live-service-shooter-xdefiant">pulls the plug on live-service shooter XDefiant</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-shareholders-are-reportedly-discussing-buyout-terms/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Two months after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-and-guillemot-family-planning-ubisoft-buyout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumors</a> that the Guillemot family and Tencent were planning a buyout of Ubisoft, Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/ubisoft-shareholders-talks-over-possible-buyout-terms-sources-say-2024-12-06/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> that the company's shareholders are still discussing buyout terms. One of the key issues is that the Guillemot family wants to maintain control over Ubisoft following the buyout.</p>
<p>Chinese giant Tencent is already the second-largest shareholder. However, despite earlier rumors, Reuters says they haven't decided yet whether to increase their stake and, therefore, join the buyout proposal. Tencent would like to exert greater control on board decisions (such as the distribution of cash flow) if it has to finance the deal, but the Guillemots haven't agreed to that yet. At the same time, Tencent also seeks to prevent any takeover of the company from third parties. As such, their strategy is reportedly to wait and see if the Guillemot family will sign on the proposal.</p>
<p>An Ubisoft spokesperson has released the following statement to accompany Reuters' article:</p>
<p><em>We remain committed to making decisions in the best interests of all of our stakeholders. In this context, as we have already indicated, the Company is also reviewing all its strategic options.</em></p>
<p>It sounds like the Guillemots will have to give up on their long-standing goal of <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-confirms-avatar-mario-rabbids-and-skull-bones-for-fy-23/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">keeping Ubisoft independent</a>. As you may recall, it's not the first time they had trouble with that, as Vivendi attempted a hostile takeover a few years ago. They were ultimately <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-and-vivendi-the-cutain-call/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unsuccessful</a>, and Ubisoft enjoyed a brief reprieve.</p>
<p>However, it would not last. First came the accusations of sexual misconduct, which brought their own issues for the company to face. More recently, even game launches were not as successful as planned due to commercially underwhelming games like Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, Skull and Bones, XDefiant (which will shut down in a few months, as we <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisofts-xdefiant-will-be-closing-down-for-good-in-june-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> yesterday), and Star Wars Outlaws. Ubisoft was even forced to <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025-ubisoft-announces-return-to-steam-on-day-1-and-departs-season-pass-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delay</a> Assassin's Creed Shadows, losing millions of dollars to try and prevent the same fate from befalling its premiere franchise.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-sales-2m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix has revealed that&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake&nbsp;</em>sales have hit a big milestone less than a month after the JRPG remake's launch.</p>

<p>Per a press release, sales of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake&nbsp;</em>have reached the two million mark across all platforms. That number includes both physical shipments and digital sales.</p>

<p>It's not clear whether that number meets, exceeds, or falls short of Square Enix's sales expectations. However, the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-16-rebirth-profits-square-enix" rel="nofollow">recently stated</a> that both&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XVI&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth&nbsp;</em>fell short of its projections, so it'll no doubt be looking for some successes to reassure shareholders.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-sales-world-map.jpg?itok=MIaAUDky 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-sales-world-map.jpg?itok=NnSjXec3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake</em>'s sales have hit a big milestone.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake&nbsp;</em>is, well, the clue's in the name. It's a remake of the classic 1988 RPG&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest 3</em>&nbsp;with a new coat of paint courtesy of Square Enix's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/trademark-for-octopath-travelers-hd-2d-filed-by-square-enix" rel="nofollow">trademark</a> HD-2D style.</p>

<p>The new remake (for it isn't the first remake of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest 3</em>) makes a number of changes, including the addition of difficulty options, voice acting at certain points in the game, and changes to the story.</p>

<p>Specifically, the narrative has been altered in order to make&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake&nbsp;</em>fit in better with the HD-2D remakes of the first two games, which are set to launch sometime next year.</p>




<p>As you'd probably expect,&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake&nbsp;</em>also contains a number of quality-of-life improvements, including increased movement speed, a minimap to help you explore the overworld, and more.</p>

<p>The battle system has also received a makeover; while it retains the basic essence of the original game's combat, you now view the action from a zoomed-out perspective, allowing you to see your characters as they fight.</p>

<p><em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2701660/DRAGON_QUEST_III_HD2D_Remake/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/dragon-quest-iii/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake/9P5ZQNN9WRL2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.

However, half the staff stayed in Ukraine even as the war raged around them, making development extremely difficult. Stalker 2’s rocky road to release and the incredibly difficult circumstances its developers found themselves in is at the heart of the 90-minute documentary, <a href="https://youtu.be/28CITqxwNz0?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>War Game: The Making of Stalker 2</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Stalker 2's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-delayed-again-this-time-by-2-months-so-the-dev-can-fix-more-unexpected-anomalies"><u>most recently delay was announced in July</u></a>, when the game was due out in September. GSC Game World said at the time that the extra two months would give the developers the chance to fix "unexpected anomalies," aka bugs.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But Stalker 2 launched with a number of bugs and features that do not work properly including A-Life 2.0, which governs the way life operates across the open-world. Following a screening of the documentary at BAFTA in Piccadilly, London, IGN spoke with GSC Game World CEO Ievgen Grygorovych and creative director Maria Grygorovych about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-dev-gsc-game-world-explains-for-the-first-time-what-went-wrong-with-a-life-20-and-why-it-was-removed-from-the-games-description-on-steam">what went wrong with A-Life 2.0</a>, but also more generally about the game’s development and launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the key questions GSC has faced is whether it could have delayed Stalker 2 further in order to iron out its bugs before launch. But both Ievgen and Maria said this would have been impossible, given the crunch the team had already endured in the months leading up to November.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">(It’s worth bearing in mind that English is not Ievgen or Maria’s first language.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Game development, it's hard,” Maria said. “Players can compare us with a lot of companies. A lot of companies have much more budgets for development. So for us it was even harder because we are an independent company, so we don't have some, I dunno, big daddy to help us every day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's a problem that we are not so perfectly finished like we really wanted to do before release, but for us we can't do better.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ievgen insisted GSC Game World did everything it could to get Stalker 2 in a decent spot for launch considering the impact the war had and continues to have on the developers. “We did everything possible considering everything that’s happening,” he said. “Considering how much time we have, considering what is our resources, considering, look, we have so much people, but what part of the daytime - part of our people don't have electricity at all and they can’t work.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/06/20241202-202049-1733223547947-1733493295077.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption"><strong>Ievgen and Maria Grygorovych, far right, discuss the making of Stalker 2 at BAFTA 195 Piccadilly. Photo by IGN.</strong></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Both Ievgen and Maria admitted it’s difficult for GSC to make excuses with its customers, customers who at the end of the day have spent their money on a product they expect to work properly irrespective of the circumstances in which it was made. But they hoped the documentary would help create a degree of empathy for the staff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We can't tell our players that every day, half of our team don't have electricity at all week after week,” Maria said. “And some of our people can't sleep at night, half of our people, because of drones, because of missiles. And it happens every day. And how can people even survive when they can't sleep? Can't work because of electricity. For example now, a lot of our people have problems with warming their apartments, because it’s very cold. Now Russia is beating [targeting] the place [energy infrastructure] who heat apartments, like houses. But it’s the game industry. We can't talk about it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We can’t say to a player, look, it’s hard to make the game,” Ievgen added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite the bugs, Ievgen is proud of Stalker 2, which he compared to building a “huge ship” it hauled over the Atlantic. Maria, too, sounds happy with the foundation GSC produced: “You hope that people can feel like the game is there… It's not so perfect that we wanted, but it's a game with soul.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And it seems players have responded, too. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-has-already-sold-1-million-copies-with-many-more-playing-on-xbox-game-pass">Stalker 2 sold one million copies in less than two days</a>, and currently enjoys a ‘very positive’ user review rating on Steam (84% of the 64,872 user reviews are positive).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Ievgen isn’t satisfied. Indeed, he wants Stalker 2 to eventually achieve a 90% user review rating: “For a creative person, we want to get an achievement, like we did a game that 90% of people loved, not 85, not 83, not 86. We want 90. ‘But 89 is also good!’ No! 89 starts from eight and you want to start from nine. I spent six years. It's maybe like a child's thing that you want to achieve it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ievgen then admitted that he expected a much worse user review rating on Steam than Stalker 2 ended up getting given the bugs the team knew players might run into at launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I expected to have much less success than we had from the audience,” Ievgen said. “We were afraid of that… we know that the game released in a state that we would like to make it better. And you release the game, there is always some bugs. We know maybe half of them. We know that we would like to have more time, but it's our limitation. It was impossible to make more than we were making.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He continued: “We as a developer, we see much more problems in the game than the players usually face. So many players didn't face 99% of the bugs inside our game. And we know much more problems. And we were like, ‘what if players face this problem and we haven't fixed it yet?’ And because we saw much more, we were much more stressed. It was impossible to say how many people would face this problem, or how many people would face problems we haven't faced yet and we don't know about. It's a very stressful moment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So I was afraid that it [Stalker 2] may get it [the reception from players]] worse than it was, but still we want it better.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, why not delay Stalker 2 yet again? Ievgen said the team simply had nothing left in the tank, equating the development to running a marathon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We were working maybe 16 hours a day for several months,” he said. “You are running a marathon and there are 10 kilometers left until the end, and you are so tired, and you say, ‘look, you have to run an additional 40 kilometers.’ And you say that I can't but okay, and you are running and running and running and running, and you understand that the time is going out and still some kilometers left, but you are not there. Not because you were not doing your best, you were trying to do your best and you can do it, but you just need more time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But everyone has limitations, so it's impossible to pause the time, to stop it and to make it better.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To help you survive in the Zone, we've got a list of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/stalker-2/Essential_Tips_and_Tricks">Essential Stalker 2 Tips and Tricks</a>, plus a guide on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/stalker-2/Things_to_Do_First_in_Stalker_2">Things to Do First in Stalker 2</a> to help you through the early game, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/stalker-2/Things_Stalker_2_Doesn%27t_Tell_You">Things Stalker 2 Doesn't Tell You</a> - everything we wish we knew before we started playing.

                <p>According to PlayStation veteran Chris Deering, Sony was anxious about the original Xbox and that concern prompted the company to sign an exclusivity deal with Take-Two for Grand Theft Auto.</p><p>"We were worried when we saw Xbox coming," Deering recalled at a recent EGX event in London, as reported by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/stories-from-30-years-of-playstation" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GI.biz</a>. "We knew exclusivity was the name of the game in a lot of fields."</p><p>With that concern in mind, Deering said he approached third-party publishers and developers to ask if they would be interested in taking a "special deal" for timed exclusivity for any of their upcoming games. Deering and company didn't realize GTA would become such a massive franchise, but that bet seemed to pay off, as GTA III took the series into a new direction with a 3D open-world approach.</p><p>"One of the deals we made was with Take-Two for the next three Grand Theft Auto games. At the time, it wasn't clear that Grand Theft Auto III was going to be as huge as it was, because it used to be a top down game," Deering said. "It was very lucky for us. And actually lucky for them, because they got a discount on the royalty they paid. Those deals aren't uncommon in industries with platforms. Including today with things like social media."</p><p>The original Xbox would go on to launch in November 2001, but GTA III did not show up on Xbox until November 2003. The timed-exclusivity deals extended Vice City and San Andreas.</p><p>While the exclusivity deals ended there--GTA 4 and GTA 5 launched on PlayStation and Xbox at the same time--Sony did continue to work with Rockstar on special deals. For example, GTA 5 was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2014-grand-theft-auto-v-coming-to-playstation-4-xbox-one-pc/1100-6420294/" data-ref-id="1100-6420294">announced for PS4 at Sony's E3 briefing in 2014</a>. There is no word on if Rockstar has any special relationship with Sony or Microsoft for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto VI</a>, however.</p><p>As for Deering, he left Sony in 2005. He also made headlines recently when he said recent video game industry layoffs were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-sony-exec-claims-that-industry-layoffs-arent-because-of-corporate-greed/1100-6526384/" data-ref-id="1100-6526384">not due to corporate greed alone</a>, but are instead part of general macroeconomic conditions. Deering was roundly criticized for saying people who have been laid off can just "go to the beach for a year."</p>

<p>You can expect redesigned versions of Main Story stages from the Prologue through Chapter 3, and future story chapters will also work on this new system. You can also now play as all contracted Agents in the city, as well as walking through New Eridu with your Agents in the new Quality Time Mode.</p>

<p>Your first new character is the Frost Anomaly Agent Hoshimi Miyabi, who can deal huge damage with "swift movements and precise slashes". She's joined by Electric Agent Asaba Harumasa, who wields both a bow and a blade.</p>

<p>New combat modes will also be introduced in this update, including a major Hollow Zero update and the new Deadly Assault periodic operation. If you feel like testing your strategy skills, you can also check out the new Bangboo tower defense game in the Reverb Arena.</p>

You can then go north again into The Beanstalk Marshes to fish before finally going down into Teapot Falls. </p><p>After exhausting all of the pools in each of these locations, you should be able to go from Teapot Falls back into The Wild Woods to find that some pools are replenishing, allowing you to begin the process back over.</p><p>Getting a stack of Sea Monster Tooth may take a while, but it’s necessary for crafting some of the coolest items from <em>The Storybook Vale</em>, so keep at it!</p><p>.<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Counter-Strike 2 has not been spared from the discourse about “dying” that surrounds multiplayer and live service games in recent years. Counter-Strike as a series has been around for decades, and the state of the game has been a constant discussion point since.</p>



<p>But is there any truth to the arguments that CS2 is dying?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-why-are-players-saying-that-cs2-is-dying">Why are players saying that CS2 is dying?</h2>



<p>There are a number of issues that the wider Counter-Strikes 2 player base has with the state of the game.</p>



<p>One of these issues has been Valve Anti-Cheat, the anti-cheat program that’s supposed to keep cheaters and hackers at bay. Many players claim that VAC hardly keeps cheaters out, and that they are constantly running into cheaters on a frequent basis.</p>



<p>Other issues plaguing the game include client performance, a lack of new content (seasonal operations), more frequent crashes, subtick issues, and various bugs.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-counter-strike-2-dying">Is Counter-Strike 2 dying?</h2>



<p>Despite the issues facing Counter-Strike 2 currently, the game is not dying. While the player numbers for CS2 have always fluctuated, there’s been no consistent dropoff. The <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/730/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">peak player and average player numbers</a> as of December 2024 are lower now than they were in April or May, but higher than they were in January or February.</p>



<figure><figcaption>CS2 player peaks and averages, per SteamDB.</figcaption></figure>



<p>These numbers will typically spike after a large update, whether that be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-cs2-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a change to the map pool</a> or a return of the Major pass. While these larger updates feel more sparse when compared to other popular multiplayer titles, players are still logging back in to play. Valve is also still (slowly) releasing updates regarding some of the major issues.</p>



<p>CS2 is still the most played game on Steam at any given time, and likely will remain that way for a long time.</p>



<p>Thoughts on CS2 as whole? Let us know in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Grand Theft Auto</strong> is arguably the most legendary franchise in gaming, proving time and again why it’s so overwhelmingly popular. It has produced some of the most instantly recognisable protagonists in the business – and even the franchise’s side characters are just as memorable. With Grand Theft Auto 6 on the horizon, we thought it’d be appropriate to rank the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/grand-theft-auto/">Grand Theft Auto</a> protagonists, figuring out once and for all which main character in the GTA series is the best.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-grand-theft-auto-protagonists-ranked">Grand Theft Auto Protagonists Ranked</h2>



<p><em>It’s driven mostly by opinion – if you have your own ranking for the Grand Theft Auto characters, feel free to drop a comment saying who you’d put where in this list!</em></p>



<h4 id="h-10-victor-vance-vice-city-stories">10. Victor Vance (Vice City Stories)</h4>



<figure></figure>







<p>Vic Vance first appeared as a minor character in Vice City and had his own journey documented later on in Vice City Stories, which was a prequel of sorts. He becomes embroiled in the seedy, criminal underbelly of Vice City to support his family, and while his game boasted a good story, it wasn’t overwhelmingly impactful – hence the rating.</p>



<h4 id="h-9-johnny-klebitz-the-lost-and-damned">9. Johnny Klebitz (The Lost and Damned)</h4>



<p>Back when Grand Theft Auto actually had story-based expansions, players were introduced to Johnny Klebitz. As a part of the Grand Theft Auto IV saga, Johnny took centre stage in The Lost and Damned, a gritty expansion based around an outlaw motorcycle club that was strewn with themes of brotherhood, loyalty, and the constant threat of brutal death. </p>



<h6><strong>Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-grand-theft-auto-cross-platform/">Is Grand Theft Auto Cross-Platform?</a></strong></h6>



<h4 id="h-8-tommy-vercetti-vice-city">8. Tommy Vercetti (Vice City)</h4>



<p>Tommy Vercetti is an iconic PlayStation 2-era character, emerging from the very heart of Vice City as one the most ruthless and headstrong characters in the GTA series. As a former hitman for the Mafia, Vercetti has the tools needed to survive in the trade, and there are hopes he’ll resurface in Grand Theft Auto 6.</p>



<h4 id="h-7-claude-gta-iii">7. Claude (GTA III)</h4>



<figure><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/gta-5/"></a></figure>







<p>Claude was a silent protagonist who ushered in a new generation of gaming with the introduction of Grand Theft Auto III, the first 3D game in the series. It changed the paradigm for open-world adventures, and despite Claude never uttering a word, he’d become known as one of the most impactful Grand Theft Auto protagonists ever.</p>



<h4 id="h-6-franklin-clinton-gta-v">6. Franklin Clinton (GTA V)</h4>



<p>Franklin Clinton was always more of a follower than a leader – first with Lemar Davis and then with Michael De Santa – but he had remarkable talents that made him shine in Grand Theft Auto V. His struggles ultimately turned themselves around, and in a relatively short period of time, Franklin Clinton became a legend of the streets, making millions, living in Vinewood Hills, and pulling off immense heists.</p>



<h6><strong>Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-is-gta-5-still-so-popular/">Why Is GTA 5 Still So Popular?</a></strong></h6>



<h4 id="h-5-trevor-philips-gta-v">5. Trevor Philips (GTA V)</h4>



<p>Trevor Philips was as unhinged as they came, but he was one of the most entertaining Grand Theft Auto protagonists to ever grace our screens. His anger management issues made for some hilarious situations, and despite his insanely hot head, he was an overwhelmingly talented marksman with a cold and calculating mind for business, and that’s what made him such a strong GTA protagonist.</p>



<h4 id="h-4-tony-cipriani-liberty-city-stories">4. Tony Cipriani (Liberty City Stories)</h4>



<figure></figure>







<p>Tony Cipriani is one of the few GTA characters to bridge that gap between more than one game, appearing in both Grand Theft Auto III as a main character and in Liberty City Stories as the protagonist. He was a driving force in the Leone Crime Family that was based in Liberty City, and as both a fiercely loyal individual and a talented combatant, he made his mark on the franchise and proved that someone can perfect the balance between being a <strong>family man </strong>and a <strong>made man</strong>.</p>



<h4 id="h-3-michael-de-santa-gta-v">3. Michael De Santa (GTA V)</h4>



<p>In many ways, Michael De Santa was the driving force behind the Grand Theft Auto V story – he was the catalyst and the spark that triggered events and snowballed them into the grand adventure that hundreds of millions of players have enjoyed. He’s a skilled criminal, even in his later years, and he’s unbelievably talented with any form of weaponry. He’s also a master thief, a charismatic individual, and what’s more, he recognises the need to help youngsters develop themselves into something greater than what they are. </p>



<h6><strong>Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-5-source-code-partially-leaks/">Learn About The GTA 5 Source Code Leaks</a></strong></h6>



<h4 id="h-2-carl-cj-johnson-san-andreas">2. Carl ‘CJ’ Johnson (San Andreas)</h4>



<p>Carl Johnson was introduced to the world in 2004’s GTA San Andreas, and he would ultimately go on to become one of the most iconic Grand Theft Auto protagonists of all time. He’s a die-hard family man and a ruthless fighter with a heart of gold, and he wants what’s best for those closest to him. He’s multi-talented, oozes charisma, and his journey across San Andreas turns him from a back-street gangbanger to a legendary icon of the series.</p>



<h4 id="h-1-niko-bellic-gta-iv">1. Niko Bellic (GTA IV)</h4>



<figure></figure>







<p>In Grand Theft Auto IV (2008) players were introduced to a darker, more serious tone – and it was a total break away from what we’d come to know and love from the series thus far. However, it was a smash hit, and it put Niko Bellic on the GTA map. </p>



<p>As the man who sits atop the list of the best Grand Theft Auto protagonists, Niko has earned his spot for many reasons. Firstly, he’s a stalwart protector of his family and friends, which makes him honourable. He does what he does with the best of intentions in mind, and somehow, he manages to be likeable even when he’s going on a rampage to protect those he loves.</p>



<p>He’s a mysterious, storied character with a background that players simply desire to learn more about, and his journey through Liberty City is monumental. He goes from being an immigrant fresh off the deck of a cargo boat to being a respected, revered criminal presence in the city. </p>



<p>That’s why he’s the best Grand Theft Auto protagonist in the series.</p>

                <p>The newest Call of Duty weapons have been revealed online, and we are running out of ways to describe how ridiculous and over-the-top the game's guns have become. As announced previously, Black Ops 6 and Warzone are getting numerous new weapons in Season 1 Reloaded, and these include a gun that turns into a bong and a melee weapon that morphs into a rave with a cat as the DJ. Seriously.</p><p>Call of Duty has, for many years, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-best-stoner-dlc-yet-turns-you-into-a-pot-smoking-lizard/1100-6528200/" data-ref-id="1100-6528200">enjoyed and embraced pot-smoking</a>, and the new Dank Days skin bundle that turns you into a pot-smoking lizard continues that trend. The gun even lets you spark up and use your gun as a bong, as smoke clouds emerge. The "Toxic Pawsitivity Mastercraft," meanwhile, transforms the baseball bat melee weapon into a rave, with a little cat acting as the DJ. Check out the videos below to see these in action, and expect these store bundles to come to Black Ops 6 and Warzone soon.</p><p>These videos emerged from data-miners.

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>As part of its commitment to making gaming as accessible to as many people as possible, EA has pledged 23 new patents to share across the industry via its accessibility portal.</p>
<p>The new patents include tools to help developers run real-time testing for photosensitivity, as well as improvements in speech and audio generation and recognition.</p>

<p>Included amongst the patents is an Unreal Engine 5 plugin that uses EA's photosensitivity analysis tech, IRIS, to "analyse and identify, in real-time as they're running their games, frames that could potentially impact players who experience photosensitivity".</p>
<p>Among the patents added this year are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intelligent Personalised Speech Recognition</strong>: Speech recognition system that improves the accuracy and efficiency of speech recognition by using personal phoneme mappings for each user, to better understand accent and other pronunciation variations such as those resulting from speech impairments.</li>
<li><strong>Generating Expressive Speech Audio From Text Data</strong>: A system that generates expressive speech audio from text data, and provides more control and personalization of the generated speech based on desired speaking style and speaker attributes.</li>
<li><strong>Generating Speech in the Voice of a Player of a Video Game</strong>: A system that can generate speech in the voice of a player, for their avatar, based on minimal sample speech data as compared with existing techniques.</li>
<li><strong>Voice Aging Using Machine Learning</strong>: A system that can age an original input voice to a desired target age without requiring additional voice samples.</li>
<li><strong>Emotion Based Music Style Change Using Deep Learning</strong>: A system that infers a player's emotion while playing a video game and tunes the background soundtrack of the game to best fit that emotion.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamically Selecting Speech Functionality on Client Devices</strong>: A system that automatically detects and enables speech recognition technologies available on a gaming device.</li>

<p>"We believe that games should be accessible to everyone and our industry-leading teams are always looking for new ways to make this a reality," said Kerry Hopkins, SVP of global affairs at EA.</p>
<p>"By making this technology available to others, we continue to work to enhance accessibility and inclusivity for players around the world by removing unintended barriers to access."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-makes-four-more-patents-open-source-in-a-bid-to-share-its-accessibility-tools-and-help-gamers">These latest patents come after EA "opened up" its accessibility tools</a> and technology for "wider use to help gamers" in 2021. Included in the first accessibility patent pledge was <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>' celebrated "ping" system.</p>
<p>In a statement at the time, EA reiterated its commitment to inclusivity by making its accessibility tools available publicly via open source.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1562831&amp;action=edit" aria-label="“Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Marvel Rivals, Path of Exile 2 NVIDIA Game Ready Driver Now Available For Download” (Edit)">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> is an impressive ray tracing showcase on Xbox Series X and even Xbox Series S, according to a new in-depth analysis shared online today.</p>
<p>In their tech review of the action-adventure title developed by MachineGames, which is now available in early access for those who purchase one of the game's special editions, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> highlighted how the game is an impressive ray tracing showcase on both Microsoft's current-generation consoles, thanks to its main visual feature, ray-traced diffuse global illumination. This is used to calculate indirect lighting from light sources like the sun, making the lighting in pretty much every scene feel incredibly natural. In a couple of scenes shown in the video below, RTGI makes scenes with light pouring from outside look incredible, with no light bleed or gaps in the lighting. Even more impressive is how clean it looks, although there are some light image quality stability issues when moving the camera around quickly, and the fact that, on Xbox Series X, the game averages 1800p resolution and successfully targets 60 FPS gameplay. Building the lighting system of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle using ray tracing was also an excellent choice for the game's setting, as Indy explores a lot of locations that have natural lighting, enhancing the experience considerably while making the whole game a feast for the eyes.</p>
<p>MachineGames also managed to get the game running decently on Xbox Series S with RTGI. Unsurprisingly, some compromises had to be made, such as lowering the resolution to 1080p and below, but generally, experiencing Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on the system is perfectly viable, even with some image quality issues caused by a disappointing implementation of Variable Rate Shading, lower texture quality and more.</p>

<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is an impressive game not only for its gorgeous visuals but also for its gameplay and story, which is one of the best Indiana Jones stories ever made.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-early-access-server-issues-warning<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>developer Grinding Gear Games has warned that the game may run into server issues during its Early Access launch period owing to the sheer volume of players who've redeemed keys.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/pathofexile/status/1864880645228630299" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message on social media platform X</a>, Grinding Gear technical director Jonathan Rogers says that a million&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>Early Access keys have been redeemed, which counts both sales of the game and those who've received a free key for spending a certain amount on the original&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile</em>.</p>

<p>Rogers says that the sheer volume of redemptions means there are "probably going to be some queues" over the weekend, and that Grinding Gear "really didn't expect" a million players to log in at the same time.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/path-of-exile-2-server-issues-early-access-warning-combat.jpg?itok=DmR86Dzv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/path-of-exile-2-server-issues-early-access-warning-combat.jpg?itok=RlqKL3e3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Grinding Gear Games has warned that&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>may experience some server issues over the weekend.</figcaption></figure><p>In a refreshing display of honesty, Rogers says he does "have some concerns about issues with the backend" of&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2</em>, even though Grinding Gear has ordered more cloud capacity, with those servers coming online "very soon".</p>

<p>Rogers goes on to say that he and Grinding Gear "quite frankly don't know what our backend services are going to be able to handle" with regards to player numbers, and that while everything's been scaled up as far as it will go, it's not clear what "limits" could be hit during the first weekend.</p>

<p>In conclusion, Rogers says that if&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>does hit server issues over the course of the launch weekend, then the dev team will work as hard as it can to solve those issues, so if you do hit queues, be patient; fixes will be on the way.</p>




<p><em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>is the sequel to&nbsp;<em>Diablo</em>-style action RPG&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile</em>. It packs in a brand new campaign, hundreds of new monsters, and plenty of loot to gather, plus new skills to discover and more.</p>

<p>The game launches <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-early-access-release-delayed" rel="nofollow">later today</a> on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2694490/Path_of_Exile_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a>, as well as on <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/path-of-exile-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/path-of-exile-2/9ND8N4RW5GHX" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

"We knew exclusivity was the name of the game in a lot of fields, like Sky TV with sports. Just as Christmas was approaching when Xbox would launch, a few of us went out to our favourite third-party publishers and developers, and we asked them, 'How would you like a special deal if you keep your next-generation game on PlayStation exclusive for a two-year period?' And one of the deals we made was with Take-Two for the next three Grand Theft Auto games. At the time, it wasn't clear that Grand Theft Auto 3 was going to be as huge as it was, because it used to be a top-down game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It was very lucky for us. And actually lucky for them, because they got a discount on the royalty they paid. Those deals aren't uncommon in industries with platforms. Including today with things like social media."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Grand Theft Auto Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As a result of this deal, Grand Theft Auto 3 released in October 2001 as a PS2 exclusive, a month before the original Xbox came out. The game released in May 2002 on PC, and then, two years after the PlayStation launch and after this exclusivity deal ended, in November 2003 for the Xbox.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Deering mentioned, Sony’s Grand Theft Auto exclusivity deal was for three games, so included Vice City, which came out in October 2002 for the PS2 first, and San Andreas, which released in October 2004 for the PS2 first. Grand Theft Auto 3 and Vice City hit Xbox together as a pack late 2003, with San Andreas launching in June 2005.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The deal worked out perfectly for both Sony and Rockstar parent company Take-Two, as Deering suggests. Indeed, San Andreas ended up the best-selling PS2 game of all time, Vice City the third best, and Grand Theft Auto 3 the fifth best. Only Gran Turismo came close the the sales the Grand Theft Auto games posted on PS2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The exclusivity deal also helped cement Grand Theft Auto as a PlayStation-first series, and while Grand Theft Auto 4 and Grand Theft Auto 5 launched on PlayStation and Xbox at the same time, Rockstar’s open-world crime epic is still strongly associated with Sony’s consoles, even now. In fact, a number of Grand Theft Auto games made <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-100-best-playstation-games-of-all-time">IGN’s Top 100 Best PlayStation Games of All Time list</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But what about the upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>? It’s due out on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S at the same time in the fall of 2025, but marketing deals with either Sony or Microsoft have yet to be announced, if they exist at all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

			<p>Grand Theft Auto 3, Vice City, and San Andreas launched as PlayStation 2 exclusives back in the day, and the deal to bring these games exclusively to the console was signed partially because Sony was worried about Xbox.</p>
<p>Speaking during an EGX London special session hosted by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/authors/christopher-dring" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GamesIndustry's Christopher Dring</a>, Chris Deering, Sony Computer Entertainment Europe president up until the release of the PlayStation 3, commented on the many deals that made several third-party games PlayStation exclusives, saying that some of them, such as the Grand Theft Auto exclusivity deal, were signed partially as a reaction to Xbox. The company was worried when they saw the console coming, and they knew exclusivity was a big deal in other fields, so, as the first Xbox launch was approaching, they spoke with some of their favorite third-party developers and publishers, asking them if they would have liked to sign a special deal to keep their next-generation games PlayStation exclusives for two years. Take-Two was among the publishers that accepted the offer, which paid off in a very big way against expectations, as<a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/grand-theft-auto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Grand Theft Auto</a> wasn't as big as it is nowadays, with its first top-down entries not having exactly set the world on fire.</p>
<p>Besides commenting on the Grand Theft Auto exclusivity deal, other former Sony executives commented on other interesting facts about PlayStation's 30-year history, such as trade media skepticism of the PlayStation 2, the well-known PlayStation 3 development issues, London Studio complaining about the lack of a built-in camera for the PlayStation 4, and more.

<p>From the pulse-pounding gorefests to the psychological horrors, there are so many horror games for you to sink your teeth into, but which ones are worth your time – and your sanity? </p>



<p>In this list, we’re breaking down the 10 best horror games ever from days gone by. They’re some of the top horror games ever, and they’re guaranteed to have you reaching for the pause button and switching on the lights. </p>



<p>It’s okay, just pretend you’re not scared – it usually works.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-best-horror-games-ever">Best Horror Games Ever</h2>



<p>Here’s our list of the best horror games you’ll ever play – enjoy! <em>*Insert evil laugh here*</em></p>



<h3 id="h-1-resident-evil">1. Resident Evil</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>This is where it all began for so many of us. In 1996, Capcom developed and released Resident Evil, a culture-shifting, paradigm-altering game that left many of us old-timers clutching our chests with fear. As we navigated the terrifying Spencer Mansion (and beyond), we found ourselves coming face-to-face with an all-new and terrifying threat: the undead.</p>



<p>Resident Evil set a bar that horror games would try to reach in the many years that followed. It was the baseline for the horror genre, and it went on to spawn a successful movie franchise, countless follow-on titles, and a living, breathing, and thriving universe.</p>



<p>Is there anything more suited to the top spot on this list than the original Resident Evil? It’s the best horror game ever.</p>







<h3 id="h-2-silent-hill-2">2. Silent Hill 2</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Silent Hill 2 (2001) is an absolute classic – a true horror game that fans of the genre simply must play.  It’s arguably the defining game of the series that has gone on to spawn many more titles, and it’s equal parts physically threatening and psychologically taxing. It’s a solid title to play if you’re hunting for one of the best horror games ever.</p>



<h3 id="h-3-outlast">3. Outlast</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Outlast – and the follow-up titles – is a terrifying experience that’ll have you pausing to catch your breath following one of the game’s many jumpscares. It’s one of those games that leaves you incapable of fighting against what’s hunting you, and all you can do instead is run and hide, which often results in you sitting on the edge of your seat with your heart pounding in your chest.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-resident-evil-biohazard">4. Resident Evil: Biohazard</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Biohazard might not have felt like a typical Resident Evil game, but thanks to the title’s lore, it was steeped in history and embedded in the overall RE timeline. In Biohazard, players must contend with some of the most chilling enemies in RE history, fighting through a story that’s equal parts graphically violent and psychologically thrilling. It’s a top-tier RE game and one of the best horror games ever concocted. </p>







<h3 id="h-5-maid-of-sker">5. Maid of Sker</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Maid of Sker was released in 2020 and quickly became known as being one of the scariest games ever made. It features gorgeous visuals and a beautiful soundtrack but it’s easily one of the most intense games you’ll ever play. In Maid of Sker, even <strong>breathing </strong>can put you in the sights of bloodthirsty creatures roaming the stunning environment of an abandoned Welsh hotel.</p>



<h3 id="h-6-the-last-of-us">6. The Last of Us</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>If you don’t think The Last of Us is a horror game, then you haven’t played it. It is riddled with jumpscares, terrifying enemies, and heart-pounding sequences made more terrifying by the constant, looming threat of the post-apocalyptic setting. If you’ve never come face-to-face with a Clicker, you obviously haven’t played one of the best horror games ever made.</p>



<h3 id="h-7-half-life-alyx">7. Half-Life: Alyx</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>This VR game might not seem like a horror at first blush, but I was jump-scared more playing this than any other game <strong>in history</strong>. From the perspective of a VR headset, everything is incredibly detailed and in-your-face, and nothing will make you leap out of your skin more than a headcrab jumping at your face out of the darkness.</p>



<p>Special mention to Jeff, one of the most terrifying creatures I’ve ever faced in one of the scariest segments of a game I’ve ever seen.</p>



<h3 id="h-8-amnesia-the-dark-descent">8. Amnesia: The Dark Descent</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Amnesia has had a few titles spawn in the series but none have been quite as scary as the first title, which was released way back in 2010. In The Dark Descent, players must contend with some of the most unexpected, effective jumpscares ever featured in a game, and they can quite literally occur around any corner.</p>







<h3 id="h-9-the-mortuary-assistant">9. The Mortuary Assistant</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Mortuary Assistant was popularised by streamers who wanted to be scared out of their mind during a broadcast, and it did that job quite well. In this particular horror game, players are charged with working in a mortuary (obviously) and preparing bodies for what comes next, but with some of the most mind-bending jumpscares popping up in the most unexpected places, it’s a non-stop thrill ride of intensity.</p>



<h3 id="h-10-p-t">10. P.T.</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>P.T. was a demo that was supposed to advertise Hideo Kojima’s ‘Silent Hills’ game, but it was never meant to be. While the full game was never released, players spent hours poring over P.T. – ‘Playable Teaser’ – which was released with no instructions, no guide, and no direction. However, it was one of the most chilling games ever released, and it had the internet ablaze for a few days when it dropped.</p>
