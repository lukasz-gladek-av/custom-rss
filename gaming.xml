		<p>A new cinematic trailer for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dawn-of-war-iv">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War 4</a> has been released, introducing the Orks to the game in pretty much perfect fashion. Check it out:</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War 4 – Official Ork Faction Trailer | IGN First" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pF5eVltokAc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>That’s right, the Gork or Mork-ified space hulk that the Orks are cruising through space on has been kitted out with a big red button so that they can, to quote the Warboss that punches it, “crash faster” into the planet while in hot pursuit &nbsp;of the Blood Ravens Space Marines that they’re chasing after.</p>
<p>It’s the culmination of a wonderfully rendered cinematic trailer that sees the Orks attack an Imperial ship and board it to go toe-to-toe with the Space Marines, who are eventually forced to abandon ship of drop pods and Thunderhawks.</p>

<p>Of course, you probably want to see the actual game in action at this point, and King Art Games have done that too in the last few weeks with the ‘Sons of Caliban’ gameplay trailer released in December.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV - &quot;Sons of Caliban&quot; Dark Angels Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KGC_MKhAGzg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This shows off the Dark Angels chapter in action, not long after <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/05/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iv-story-trailer-reveals-a-dark-angels-team-up/">their own cinematic trailer reveal</a>. As formidable as a Space Marine Chapter is, the Blood Ravens are in dire need of help through Dawn of War 4, and the Dark Angels themselves are turning up to assist.&nbsp;You’ll get to play as both chapters, with Company Master Astoran and Chaplain Ezrael leading the Dark Angels into the fray. King Art have also teased that Dark Angels Primarch Lion El’Jonson could be playable at some point in the campaign, which would be a landmark moment for 40K in general, not just video games!</p>
<p>Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV has been entrusted to Iron Harvest developer King Art Games and publisher Deep Silver. It’s a new leaf for the franchise, which was created by Relic Entertainment way back in 2004 and defined a new style of real time strategy with less focus on resource gathering and base building, and more on controlling the map and battlefield. Dawn of War enjoyed a good few expansions before Dawn of War 2 explored a more tactical approach in 2009, and Dawn of War 3 sought to blend them all together.</p>
<p>The interest in having King Art work on Dawn of War IV was organised by Games Workshop <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dawn-of-war-4-devs-on-taking-over-from-relic-the-health-of-real-time-strategy-and-reviving-a-legend-of-the-genre">some time before Iron Harvest’s release in 2020.</a> It’s not known if GW initially wanted to stick with Relic, but that time frame would have been around the time that Relic was focussed on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/10/25/age-of-empires-4-review/">Age of Empires IV</a> and later <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/company-of-heroes-3">Company of Heroes 3</a>. Relic has since gone through the tumult of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/24/relic-entertainment-confirm-layoffs-affecting-121-employees/">layoffs while under Sega’s ownership in 2023</a>, and then <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/28/sega-cuts-another-240-uk-jobs-relic-entertainment-goes-independent/">independence with an investor buyout in 2024</a>. They had plenty of things going on, in other words, but King Art had proven themselves with their steampunk RTS and could be great new stewards for this series. We look forward to seeing more in the run up to its 2026 release.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/although-not-content-complete-yet-fall-2026-is-a-more-real-release-window-than-fall-2025-for-grand-theft-auto-vi/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong><em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em></strong> isn't just one, if not the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-action-games-of-2026-martial-artists-spies-super-heroes-and-criminals/">most anticipated game</a></strong> launching this year on consoles, but it's set to become one of the <strong>most anticipated games of all time</strong>.</p>



<p>The open-world game by <strong>Rockstar</strong> has <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/">already been delayed twice</a></strong>, and while it is reportedly <strong>not yet content complete</strong>, the <strong>Fall 2026 release window</strong> is more real than the Fall 2025 window, according to a reputable game journalist.</p>



<p>Speaking during the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1EANk4uOn68ddip6pKliqY?si=zn4dBqixRVCBcuh4t0NBYg%0A&amp;nd=1&amp;dlsi=97d1ebf012ea4933"><strong>latest episode of the <em>Button Mash</em> podcast</strong></a>, known journalist <strong>Jason Schreier</strong> commented on the current state of the game.</p>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em>"The last I've heard, it was still not content complete. They're still finishing things up, finalizing levels, missions, seeing what's going to make it into the game. They're still making stuff and will hopefully be done with that soon."</em></strong></p>



<p>Commenting on the current <strong>November 19 release date</strong> for <strong><em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em></strong>, Schreier said: <strong><em>"It’s really hard to say right now, and I don’t think anyone at Rockstar can tell you with 100% certainty that they will make it out in November."</em></strong> However, it is too early to panic as Schreier thinks <em><strong>"this [November 2026 release] feels a little bit more real than Fall 2025 did."</strong> </em></p>



<p>Still, even if the game were to receive another delay, it could be a small one of a few months as <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Take-Two</strong> would still want to hit its <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">financial targets</strong> for the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">fiscal year ending on March 31, 2027</strong>, giving <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Rockstar Games</strong> a little more time to release the game.</p>



<p>As expected, a part of the <strong><em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em></strong> community entered <strong>"Panic Mode"</strong> upon learning that the game might not be content-complete yet, anticipating an almost certain delay. However, <strong>Jason Schreier</strong> himself posted a pointed clarification based on the pattern for previous games: <strong><em>"Yes, directly after saying that with Red Dead 2 they delayed it twice and I wouldn't be shocked if that's the same pattern, and directly before saying that while with game development you can never be 100% certain, this feels more solid than previous dates did."</em></strong></p>



<h2 id="h-what-sort-of-content-then-is-already-in-grand-theft-auto-vi"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">What Sort of</strong><strong> </strong><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Content, Then, Is Already In Grand Theft Auto VI?</strong></h2>



<p>While knowing that <strong><em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em></strong> is not yet content complete doesn't tell us a whole lot, knowing what's already been implemented in the game would definitely make fans even more excited.</p>



<p>As of now, very little is currently known about the game, as the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-gets-surprise-second-trailer-as-rockstar-shares-first-info-and-many-gorgeous-images/">two trailers</a></strong> released to date have not shown a lot in terms of gameplay. However, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1q72olz/gta6_gamerolls_leak_basically_confirmed/"><strong>the recent firing of Rockstar Games employees</strong></a> due to their supposed leaking of information regarding the game has essentially confirmed an older list of leaked information shared by <a href="https://x.com/GameRoll_"><strong><em>GameRoll</em></strong>.</a></p>



<p><strong>Among the leaked features that will supposedly be in Grand Theft Auto VI are:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>A six-star wanted system</strong>,</li>



<li><strong>A relationship bar</strong> that works like the <strong>honor system</strong> in <strong><em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em></strong></li>



<li><strong>Weight mechanics</strong></li>



<li><strong>Underwater exploration</strong></li>



<li><strong>Greeting and antagonizing NPCs</strong></li>



<li><strong>A Dual Protagonist system</strong> that allows players to control both <strong>Jason and Lucia</strong> at the same time</li>



<li><strong>A Dead-Eye-like ability for Jason</strong> that slows down time to reveal enemy's weak spots (which devs reportedly don't feel too keen on at the time of the leak)</li>



<li><strong>NPCs reacting to characters holding weapons</strong></li>



<li><strong>Gore and dismemberment systems</strong> based on <strong><em>Red Dead Redemption 2's</em></strong> systems</li>



<li><strong>Limited weapon system</strong></li>



<li><strong>Male strippers</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>With the timeline of the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Rockstar Games' employees firing</strong> lining up almost perfectly, another <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Grand Theft Auto VI</em></strong> leak posted a few months back on the <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1q775cn/potential_gta_6_plot_leak/"><strong>Gaming Leaks and Rumors subreddit</strong></a> is also gaining some traction, revealing details on the game's plot and some mechanics, including a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"new mechanic for detecting threats and valuable items around you,"</strong> and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"very detailed mechanics of searching places,"</strong> inspired by <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Red Dead Redemption 2</em></strong>.</p>



<p>Although these leaks should still be taken with a massive grain of salt, it's undeniable that they paint an exciting picture, complemented by the many <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-patents-revolutionize-open-world-forever/">patents filed by Rockstar Games over the years</a></strong> and the opinion of experts which believe the game could even <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/gta-6-could-evolve-into-an-mmorpg-as-many-of-its-planned-features-belong-to-the-genre-developer-has-heard/">evolve int</a></strong><strong><a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/gta-6-could-evolve-into-an-mmorpg-as-many-of-its-planned-features-belong-to-the-genre-developer-has-heard/">o</a></strong><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/gta-6-could-evolve-into-an-mmorpg-as-many-of-its-planned-features-belong-to-the-genre-developer-has-heard/"> an MMO with some of its mechanics.</a></strong></p>



<p>Even if just a fraction of these features and mechanics make it into <strong><em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em></strong>, the next entry in the series will be a <strong>massive step forward</strong> compared to both its predecessor and <strong><em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em></strong>, which continues to be one of the best open-world games ever made also thanks to technology advancements such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-5-in-quality-mode-delivers-better-image-quality-than-native-resolution-in-red-dead-redemption-2/"><strong>NVIDIA DLSS 4.5</strong>.</a></p>

            <p>The world could certainly do with another game about slapping up Swastika-wearers right now. Thankfully, having finished off <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones And The Great Circle</a>, Machine Games are reportedly working on the previously teased Wolfenstein 3.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>That's according to reports from <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-in-2026-what-to-expect-from-team-green-this-year-and-beyond">Windows Central</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/wolfenstein-3-in-development-machinegames-bethesda-2000657758">Kotaku</a>. The former also claim the studio have a mysterious multiplayer game in the mould of Rainbow Six Siege on their plate.</p>
<p>Wolfenstein 3 being a thing Machine have moved on to post-Indy isn't all that surprising. Just <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/indiana-jones-devs-machinegames-tease-another-wolfenstein-game-we-have-a-story-to-tell">last year</a>, a documentary about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wolfenstein-the-new-order">Wolfenstein: The New Order</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wolfenstein-ii-the-new-colossus">Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus</a>, saw studio head Jerk Gustafsson mention having plans for a third entry which rounds out B.J. Blazkowicz's Nazi-blasting tale.</p>
<p>"That journey for B.J., even during those first weeks at id, when we mapped out New Order, we still had the plan for at least [B.J.], what would happen in the second one and what would happen in the third one," he said. "I think that's important to say, because - at least I hope - we're not done with Wolfenstein yet. We have a story to tell."</p><p>How a game developed by a studio <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-culture-of-intimidation-retaliation-and-oppression-how-microsofts-gaza-stance-fuelled-an-industry-spanning-boycott">owned by Microsoft</a> and tasked with satirising Fascism as real-world far-right regimes continue to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/08/ukraine-war-briefing-allies-no-cast-iron-security-guarantees-yet">wage expansionist wars</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/03/trump-venezuela-oil-industry">kidnap the leaders of nations</a> that happen to have oil in order to swiftly establish control, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/02/the-us-complicit-genocide-israel-gaza">support genocides</a> will fare is something that'll be intriguing to see. That said, not shying away from such challenges is the duty of any good satirist.</p>
<p>The same challenge'll be faced by the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wolfenstein-series-in-development-at-amazon-with-fallout-show-team-attached">Wolfenstein TV Series</a> that's currently in the works at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/05/way-past-its-prime-how-did-amazon-get-so-rubbish">Amazon</a>, which this next Wolfenstein will probably go hand-in-hand with in the name of corporate synergy. That's assuming the folks behind the adaptation are interested in taking it on.</p>

            <p>Netease has finally released a gameplay trailer for its pirate Adventure RPG Sea of Remnants, which showcases a variety of features including ship combat, open area exploration, drinking competitions, and Mahjong.</p>
<p>The trailer, published on the official Sea of Remnants YouTube account, has reached over 1.3m views in less than 12 hours. Just under six minutes in length, it highlights what players will actually be able to do in the wood-carved puppet world entirely with early in-game footage.</p>
<p>According to the game's Steam page, it'll feature a dynamic weather system based, over 300 companions, and a mix of sea combat and turn-based party fighting. It's also free-to-play, with a 2026 release window.</p>

<p>Sea of Remnants is being developed by Joker Studio, which previously worked on an asymmetrical horror game also featuring a distinct gothic art style with doll characters. That game, also free, featured crossovers with a variety of popular franchises like Dangenrompa, Persona, and even KFC.</p><p>Sea of Remnants <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-state-of-play-june-2025-everything-announced">was first revealed to the world at a Sony State of Play last June</a>. For those who like the look of this interesting new venture into open waters, a testing period is kicking off this month <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3633680/Sea_of_Remnants/">that you can sign up for on the game's official Steam store page</a>.</p>
<p>Sea of Remnants is of course just one Netease game set to come out in the near future. While Sea of Remnants appears to be tackling the free-to-play market, the Chinese gaming giant <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blood-message-reveal-trailer-netease">is also tackling the AAA single player space with the upcoming Blood Message</a>. Though, in that game's case, no release date has been revealed.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/08/most-wanted-games-of-2026-20-toi-16/</link>
            <guid>1400260</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Having rattled off a multitude of our most wanted video game releases of 2026, let’s keep the train rolling. As we enter our top 20, we see the return of some familiar faces as well as some exciting new IP fresh out of Japan. Why don’t we kick off with our first Capcom game on the list?</p>
<h2>20 – Pragmata</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, NSW2, PC – 24th April 2026</em></p>
<p>Originally thought to be a PlayStation 5 exclusive, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pragmata">Pragmata</a> is a new sci-fi action adventure from the Monster Hunter and Street Fighter publisher. You play as Hugh and Diana, an astronaut and his android companion looking to uncover the mysteries of a lunar research station that has been overrun by hostile artificial intelligence. The protagonists have a symbiotic relationship that weaves its way into Pragmata’s combat, navigation, and puzzle-solving gameplay with Hugh doing the heavy lifting as Diana employs her hacking abilities right in the middle of battle.</p>
<p><iframe title="Pragmata World Premiere Trailer from The Game Awards 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A6YCL6UW1lI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>To explain what that’s all about, we went <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/26/hands-on-pragmata-exploring-the-enigmatic-lunar-hacking-shooter/">hands on with Pragmata</a> last year, writing in our preview of the curious blend of hacking and shooting gameplay, “Hacking enemies becomes a vital part of combat right away, as it’s used to open up their armour and expose weaknesses for you to blast away at with Hugh’s guns. This is far from a simple button tap, or even a button hold, but rather throws up a minigame for you to complete to launch the hack at the targeted enemy.”</p>

<p>There’s a demo currently available on PC, which will hopefully make its way to consoles ahead of its launch this Spring.</p>
<h2>19 – Romeo Is A Dead Man</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 11th February 2026</em></p>
<p>The latest game to come from the wonderfully wacky mind of Suda51 and the Grasshopper Manufacture studio, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/romeo-is-a-dead-man">Romeo Is A Dead Man</a> knows its audience. Seriously, just go and watch the announcement trailer. For those who love the ultra-violent, super-stylish No More Heroes series, this feels like somewhat of an evolution, dialling the strangeness factor up to 11 as players assume the role of Romeo Stargazer, a reanimated space-time FBI agent tasked with hunting fugitives across the cosmos. The game already looks to have a memorably twisted cast of fun characters – let’s just hope that, amidst the on screen carnage, there’s a decent action game in there too.</p>
<p><iframe title="ROMEO IS A DEAD MAN - Story Introduction Trailer / 『ロミオ・イズ・ア・デッドマン』ストーリー紹介編トレーラー" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EryjLSG0x_Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h2>18 – The Duskbloods</h2>
<p><em>Nintendo Switch – TBC 2026</em></p>
<p>For the umpteenth time, no, this isn’t <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/bloodborne">Bloodborne 2</a>. Nintendo and FromSoftware certainly had us going there for a minute during their announcement of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-duskbloods">The Duskbloods</a> for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a> Direct showcase. The gothic, Yharnam-like setting and haunting atmosphere seemed to suggest that Nintendo had somehow swept Bloodborne out of Sony’s clutches, but this wasn’t the case.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="The Duskbloods – Nintendo Direct | Nintendo Switch 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/niKHDEKQ7xA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As a FromSoftware joint, The Duskbloods will naturally inherit some of that Bloodborne DNA, though there are some key distinctions. Firstly, there are vampires. Secondly, it’s a primarily multiplayer game, featuring online PvPvE. Following the success of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a>, it will be interesting to watch FromSoftware continue to pursue its live service gaming ambitions alongside its more traditional brand of action RPG.</p>
<h2>17 – Fable</h2>
<p><em>XSX|S, PC – TBC 2026</em></p>
<p>Oh, to have the patience of a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fable">Fable</a> superfan. It’s been 15 long years since the last main entry in this once-beloved Xbox series and while Fable wasn’t perfect (missing many of the lofty features promised by zany franchiser frontman, Peter Molyneux) it felt like a mainstay in the RPG. Until it completely vanished, of course, leaving behind a trail of half-baked spin-offs and the wisp of dream that one day we might see a Fable 4. The wait is finally almost over, hopefully, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/26/fable-delayed-2026-new-gameplay-clips/">a sequel or reboot scheduled to launch sometime this year.</a></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Fable - Release Window Trailer | Xbox Showcase 2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I6sREGbfzRg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Besides some pre-alpha footage we’ve seen very little of the game in action, though it looks to retain that familiar high fantasy vibe with plenty of witty humour and monster-slaying as players return to Albion.</p>
<h2>16 – Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – TBC 2026</em></p>
<p>It’s hard to imagine that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/09/10/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider-review/">Shadow of the Tomb Raider</a> will be celebrating its eighth anniversary later this year. It’s also hard to imagine that 2026 will see yet another reincarnation of gaming’s favourite gunslinging archaeologist, first appearing in a remake of Lara Croft’s original adventure.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n6JxVxSHjqE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/12/tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis-reimagines-laras-original-adventure/">Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis</a> will offer a complete modernisation of the first game, rebuilt in Unreal Engine 5 and starring new lead actress, Alix Wilton Regan, who will also take lead in next year’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/12/tomb-raider-catalyst-legacy-of-atlantis/">Tomb Raider: Catalyst</a>.</p>

<p>StarRupture has plenty of secrets hidden away on the map, and finding the Stabilizer Blueprint is a key part of progression, though it’s hard to pinpoint the exact location if you don’t know where to look.</p>



<p>Creepy Jar has plenty planned during early access of StarRupture, as shown by the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starrupture-early-access-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">detailed roadmap</a>, and there’s lots to enjoy before the eventual 1.0 release further in the future.</p>



<p>If you’ve reached a sticking point in StarRupture and don’t know where to find the Stabilizer Blueprint, Insider Gaming has all the important details.</p>

<p><strong>The Stabilizer Blueprint in StarRupture is hidden away in a specific location a long way from the game’s starting point, so travelling to the location requires preparation.</strong></p>



<p>The exact spot, shown in the image above, is northeast of the starting point in the game. If you have a map and have already travelled near the location, it will be shown as a dark blue area on the map.</p>



<p>Before starting your travel, stock up on food, water, and weapons, as the trip can be perilous and weapons are required to defeat the arachnids that are waiting at the location.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-the-stabilizer-blueprint-in-starrupture">How to Get The Stabilizer Blueprint in StarRupture</h2>



<p><strong>Visiting the location where the Stabilizer Blueprint is found is merely the starting point to earn the reward, as there are a few steps to tick off before you can add it to your collection.</strong></p>



<p>The location is covered by a blue cloud, which needs to be cleared by destroying the blue spores scattered around the buildings, and you’ll also need to fend off the alien species that call the area home, which is why bringing a weapon was crucial.</p>



<p>Here’s a breakdown of the steps to take to claim the Stabilizer Blueprint in StarRupture.</p>



<ol>
<li>Destroy the blue spores around the location, found attached to buildings, and eliminate hostile aliens.</li>



<li>Loot all the buildings to collect valuable resources.</li>



<li>Head to the broken stairs and clear out more of the blue spores.</li>



<li>Follow the path of broken platforms and stairs around the tallest area in the location, clearing out the blue spores as you encounter them.</li>



<li>At the top, clear out the final blue spores and loot everything you can.</li>



<li>The Stabilizer Blueprint is waiting in a nearby Storage Box.</li>
</ol>

<p>Forget SBMM, the grittier competitors in the CoD community want Ranked and nothing but Ranked. The competitive mode is the usual hunting ground for more serious Call of Duty players, making a Black Ops 7 Ranked Play game mode a necessity—and release date info is known.</p>



<p>A casual game of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-discount-by-50-percent-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7</a> is great (with or without SBMM), but Ranked is where the strong and the weak are separated. Ranked Play is a whole different bullet-filled beast. You can literally taste the sweat of try-hards and the feeling of isolation as players lose access to the meta gear they’d normally dominate a non-Ranked game with.</p>



<p>Whether you’ve been looking forward to BLOPS 7 Ranked since day one or feel you’re ready to make the step up, this guide has everything you need to know about Ranked Play.</p>







<h2 id="h-ranked-play-release-date-for-black-ops-7-explained">Ranked Play Release Date For Black Ops 7, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s going to get sweaty. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Ranked Play is dropping with Black Ops 7 Season 2’s start date, and this is expected to be February 5.</strong></p>



<p>Using <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-season-1-reloaded-starts-thursday/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7 Season 1 Reloaded</a> and basic data from previous seasons (and the Battle Pass), it’s almost certain that Season 2 is kicking off on February 5. There are rumors that Season 2 could be just as big as Season 1 in terms of content, but it could even eclipse the game’s debut season!</p>



<p>Maps are great, new guns can change the meta, and you’ll never say no to a fresh game mode. However, the hardcore fanbase just wants Ranked Play, and Season 2 should be delivering it to your doorstep on launch day.</p>



<p>We’ll update you if there are any changes to this timeframe.</p>







<h2 id="h-why-isn-t-ranked-mode-in-black-ops-7-from-launch">Why Isn’t Ranked Mode In Black Ops 7 From Launch?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The body and mind are ready. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 didn’t launch with Ranked as it’s presumably a bid from Treyarch to get players used to the game first before launching a fully fledged Ranked Mode.</strong></p>



<p>Pros and elite-level CoD players can jump into Ranked and not struggle, for the most part. But if you give casuals the chance to hop straight into Ranked, it could be a humbling and even sour experience for those wanting to enjoy Call of Duty. It could put people off altogether.</p>



<p>This is why every Call of Duty title doesn’t get Ranked until a few weeks into launch. It also allows the meta to settle—so people aren’t abusing broken guns in Ranked—and gives Treyarch time to adjust accordingly, instead of on the fly.</p>



<p>Black Ops 7 Season 2 should finally bring Ranked Play. It’s time to find your ideal loadout, team up with trusted partners, and prepare for the joy and agony of promotion and relegation in Ranked leagues.</p>

			<div data-nosnippet="">
		
		<ul>
			<li>0-20%: Unlikely - Lacks credible sources</li>
			<li>21-40%: Questionable - Some concerns remain</li>
			<li>41-60%: Plausible - Reasonable evidence</li>
			<li>61-80%: Probable - Strong evidence</li>
			<li>81-100%: Highly Likely - Multiple reliable sources</li>
		</ul>
	</div>


			
			
			
			<p>The rumor smoke surrounding <strong>the third The Witcher 3 DLC</strong> gets even larger today, as two prominent Polish websites confirm <a href="https://wccftech.com/ready-to-return-to-the-continent-analysts-expect-a-big-the-witcher-3-dlc-expansion-to-drop-next-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the previous report from the analyst firm <strong>Noble Securities</strong></a>.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, <strong>IGN Poland</strong> <a href="https://pl.ign.com/wiedzmin-3/69405/news/wiedzmin-3-nowe-dlc-zabierze-nas-na-pustynie-ujawniamy-nasze-informacje-sprzed-lat-i-rzucamy-nowe-sw?fbclid=IwY2xjawPKJn1leHRuA2FlbQIxMQBzcnR" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote an article about this</a>, revealing that they have known about the potential new expansion for 'a very long time'. They didn't report anything until now because, albeit credible, the information only came to them from a singular source. </p>



<p>Anyway, they have now revealed that, at least back then, they heard <strong>CD Projekt RED</strong> was looking into expanding the game toward a brand new region: the desert of <strong>Zerrikania</strong>. This would provide a much-needed contrast with the existing regions of <strong>Velen</strong>, located in northern <strong>Temeria</strong> and featured in the base game, and <strong>Toussaint</strong>, the small autonomous duchy added with the second The Witcher 3 DLC, <strong>Blood and Wine</strong>. However, IGN Poland concedes that things may have changed since they first got a hold of the rumor, and as such, the addition of <strong>Kovir and Poviss</strong> is also possible, especially as it would set the stage for the upcoming <strong>The Witcher IV</strong> game, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-wont-launch-until-2027-says-cd-projekt-red/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won't launch until at least <strong>2027</strong></a>.</p>



<p>Today, the Polish website <strong>PPE</strong> also <a href="https://www.ppe.pl/news/395072/trzeci-dodatek-do-wiedzmina-3-rozegra-sie-w-zerrikanii-ujawniono-mase-konkretnych-szczegolow.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared another confirmation that a new DLC is indeed on the way</a>:</p>



<p><em>We, at PPE, can also confirm these revelations – we heard about the new Wild Hunt project from our sources a year ago. We were clearly told in the first half of 2025 that The Witcher 3 would receive new, major content "that we will love."</em></p>



<p>As the saying goes, where there's too much smoke, there's also likely to be fire. Before these reports, nobody expected the <a href="https://wccftech.com/cd-projekt-red-celebrates-the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-10-year-anniversary/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ten-year-old masterpiece</a> to receive new content so late, given that CD Projekt RED was very busy working on the new installment. They must have partnered with another developer to offload most of the work, as according to the studio's latest report, only 22 employees were working on 'other', unspecified projects, while everyone else was doing something other than a new The Witcher 3 DLC.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/G6sZHd-XwAAhDiX-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<p>One potential partner is <strong>Fool's Theory</strong>, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-remake-announced-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already working with CD Projekt RED</a> on the <strong>remake of the first The Witcher</strong>, though this is just speculation. Anyway, if there really is a third The Witcher 3 DLC coming this year, an official announcement may not be so far away. Until then, stay tuned to hear the latest rumors and leaks.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>A preliminary employment tribunal hearing has seen the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB) request that a judge grant interim relief to the 31 UK-based GTA 6 developers fired by Rockstar, reportedly following <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-fired-unionising-gta-6-devs-following-discord-chat-about-new-company-slack-policy-claims-report">discussion of changes to Rockstar's company Slack policies</a> by staff on Discord. The union, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/iwgb-union-file-legal-claims-against-rockstar-due-to-gta-6-maker-allegedly-refusing-to-negotiate-over-firings">filed legal claims</a> against the company over the dismissals last year, continue to assert that they were a form of union busting. Rockstar, meanwhile, have released a fresh statement claiming that the root of this is simply stopping info about GTA 6 from leaking.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>If this interim relief requested by the IWGB as they represented the fired devs during the preliminary hearing at Scotland's Glasgow Tribunals Centre on January 5th is granted, the workers would receive support designed to prevent them running into financial problems while both sides wait for the date of a full hearing to be set. In this case, if the relief's granted, the staff will be put back on Rockstar’s payroll and have any necessary work visas reinstated during the time it takes the full hearing date to be penned in.</p>
<p>As outlined on <a href="https://www.acas.org.uk/interim-relief">the website</a> of the UK's Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS), deciding whether to grant interim relief involves an employment tribunal looking into the facts of what the fired employee claims and making a judgement as to whether they're likely to win at the full hearing. "Likely to win means having a 'pretty good chance', not just 'more likely than not'. Interim relief applications are usually about complex issues, so meeting the 'pretty good chance' threshold can be difficult," ACAS write.</p>
<p>The preliminary hearing's also see both the IWGB and Rockstar share their versions of the story again in statements to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/union-asks-judge-to-grant-fired-gta-6-devs-interim-relief-at-preliminary-tribunal-hearing-rockstar-denies-claims">IGN</a>. "No matter the outcome of this interim hearing, we remain confident in the strength of the case we have brought against Rockstar Games," the IWGB said, once again accusing Rockstar of union busting. "We reiterate our firm belief that Rockstar broke the law when it summarily dismissed 31 of our members, and we look forward now to the day we face them in court for a full and substantive tribunal hearing."</p><p>Rockstar, meanwhile, once again denied the union's union busting accusations, asserting that this has all been about preventing GTA 6 leaks. In this case, the company specified to IGN that it believes that info about GTA 6's features, comments about how its development is progressing, and timelines to its launch were at risk of going public and potentially affecting Take-Two's share price.</p>
<p>"We regret that these dismissals were necessary; however, confidentiality is fundamental to everything Rockstar Games does. Global interest in our games is unparalleled," Rockstar said. "Even the smallest leak of any information relating to our products and practices can cause major commercial and creative damage — as we have seen in the past — and damage the experience of our loyal players and dedicated team. This was never about union membership. We have always taken a zero-tolerance approach to unauthorized releases of information — and we always will."</p>
<p>Amid that slightly flex-heavy chatter, the studio also denied firing any staff who "posted union-supportive messages, but who did not breach confidentiality policies" and said they don't keep a "blacklist" of union members.</p><p>

We'll see whether the fired devs request for interim relief's granted, as this story which has attracted attention from UK politicians - including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-firings-are-a-deeply-concerning-case-thatll-be-looked-into-says-uk-prime-minister-keir-starmer">Prime Minister Keir Starmer</a> - rumbles on.

Back in May 2024, Rockstar <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-grand-theft-auto-6-of-grand-theft-auto-6-likes-aka-grand-theft-auto-vi-is-coming-next-fall">narrowed</a> an initial GTA 6 2025 launch window to fall 2025, with Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-release-date-wont-slip-to-2026-take-two-assure-theyre-highly-confident-about-fall-2025">commenting</a> in November that “we are highly confident in that timing”, despite mounting rumours that the new GTA would slip back.</p>
<p>Zelnick <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grand-theft-auto-6-is-still-hitting-consoles-in-autumn-says-take-two-boss-promise">reiterated that confidence</a> in February 2025. Three months later, Take-Two and Rockstar <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-has-been-delayed-even-though-take-two-boss-kept-telling-everyone-it-wouldnt-be">delayed GTA 6</a> to May 26th 2026. Then in November 2025, the publishers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hi-everyone-gta-6-has-been-hit-with-delay-number-two">shoved it back to November this year</a>.</p>
<p>None of this is massively surprising – videogames are messy productions and GTA games are both vast in scope and burdened by radioactive levels of expectation. Still, pour one out for the other developers who’ve been dancing back and forth with their own release dates, in a bid to avoid getting sat on by Rockstar’s glossy crime bonanza.</p><p>Schreier thinks GTA 6 might run into another delay, based on his most recent conversations with sources (he didn't give an exact timeframe). “I mean, this is how Rockstar works, or at least has worked in recent decades, I suppose in the last decade with Red Dead 2,” he observed in an interview with <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1EANk4uOn68ddip6pKliqY?si=JIwZIRXoTgWdYv4d1D14OA&amp;pi=EqnPagS3R0iu_&amp;nd=1&amp;dlsi=aabde7b92a5d4dbe&amp;flow_ctx=9ae1964a-027a-44b9-b7f0-fa9bc4e75989%3A1767884945#login">The Ringer-Verse Button Mash podcast</a>. “If you look at the history there, they announced it for fall 2017, then it slipped the spring 2018 and then it slipped again to fall 2018 and there it landed October of that year.”</p>
<p>“So I wouldn't be super shocked if that is what happens again this time around,” Schreier continued. “This is a big and complicated game and the last I heard it was still not content complete. That is to say that people were still finishing things up, still finalising levels and missions, and seeing what's going to make it into the game. Typically the way that game development works, you have your feature complete, your content complete, your bug-testing phases.</p>
<p>“And there's a lot of boundaries blurred along the way, in all of those different stages, but they are still still making stuff. And we'll hopefully be done with that soon and just have a whole bunch of time for fixing bugs. But even during those phases, there's always someone who wants to sneak in some last minute stuff. So it's really hard to say.”</p>
<p>Schreier added that “I don’t think anyone in Rockstar could tell you with 100% certainty that they will make it out in November, but I think this feels a little bit more real than fall 2025 did.
That was never real and even more real than May [2026] did.”</p><p>In discussion of GTA 6’s release delays, Zelnick has repeatedly lauded Rockstar for chasing “perfection”. It’s a bit of a double-edged compliment, needless to say. Perfection may be undefinable, but any perceptible imperfections here are going to have steep financial consequences.</p>
<p>“With a game like this, the stakes are so high, they really can't settle for anything less than perfection with this release, because there's so much riding on it,” Schreier continued on the podcast. “The stock of Take Two lives or dies on this game - every time this game slips, their shares drop 10%, I should say. So yeah, it's not something that they will release in any sort of compromised state. So even if it comes to like October and they're like, you know, the game is not 100% ready, I suspect they would rather slip than release it.”</p>
<p>Schreier added that by picking a November date, Rockstar and Take Two have given themselves a little breathing room to get the game out before Take-Two’s fiscal 2027 earnings report in March 2027. “Obviously they would want to be out for the holiday season and Black Friday and all the beautiful Christmas sales that they always do. But I think they have a little bit of buffer to next March if they still want to release the game within the fiscal year.”</p>
<p>All of this risks being academic to us Rock Paper Shotgunners, because GTA 6 has still yet to be formally confirmed for PC. Schreier had little to say about possible PC dates, but did observe that GTA 6 is a particularly big game for PlayStation, with sales on Xbox “almost a non-factor” by comparison. “In some ways it's kind of like a PlayStation exclusive, in that most of the sales will be on PlayStation and it will sell a lot of PlayStation 5s alongside it. So I suspect that Sony is planning its entire calendar around GTA and will not release anything within the blast zone.” This is useful intel, inasmuch as we can deduce Rockstar’s thinking from Sony’s movements.</p><p>Even as other developers, publishers and players gear up for this November’s GTAppening, Rockstar North face a legal challenge in the UK from former GTA 6 developers, who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ah-shit-here-we-go-again-gta-6-developers-speak-from-the-picket-line-about-rockstar-north-union-busting">say they were ousted for forming a union</a>. Rockstar <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-firings-are-a-deeply-concerning-case-thatll-be-looked-into-says-uk-prime-minister-keir-starmer">contend that the fired developers were leaking confidential information</a> on a Discord forum. In a rare display of having an opinion publicly, UK prime minister Keir Starmer has called it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-firings-are-a-deeply-concerning-case-thatll-be-looked-into-says-uk-prime-minister-keir-starmer">"a deeply concerning case"</a> that deserves further government investigation.</p>

            <p>A new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a> game, titled Life is Strange: Reunion, has been rated in Europe. Since being discovered by fans, the game's presence on the PEGI website has since been removed.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/life-is-strange-reunion-rated-in-europe">Still viewable on Gematsu</a>, Life is Strange: Reunion, was rated 16 like every entry in the series since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange-true-colors">Life is Strange: True Colors</a>. According to the rating, the filing was published back in March of 2025.</p>
<p>There was a description of Life is Strange: Reunion too, outlining that Chloe Price would come to Caledon University to seek out Max Cauldfield's help, haunted by nightmares and "impossible memories". However, with an inferno set to destroy the campus in three days, Max is already in crisis.</p>

<p>The rating states that Life is Strange: Reunion is set to feature the use of illegal drugs, and that purchasable outfits are available for real money, as well as a digital deluxe upgrade. Aside from that, there's little else in terms of information about the release.</p><p>The previous entry in the Life is Strange series, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange-double-exposure">Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a>, was released in November of 2024. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-double-exposure-was-a-large-loss-for-square-enix-report">Reportedly a loss for Square Enix</a>, the game teased the return of franchise favourite Max Caufield. Following its release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-double-exposure-studio-deck-nine-makes-more-cuts-to-staff">developer Deck Nine suffered layoffs</a>. CEO Mark Lyons stated at the time: "This was an extremely difficult decision and reflects the challenging times our industry is currently facing."</p>
<p>Life is Strange: Double Exposure itself received mixed reviews from players and critics alike. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-double-exposure-review">In Eurogamer's review</a>, Tom Phillips wrote: Like its own hero's dabbling with time travel, Life is Strange: Double Exposure highlights the troubles of trying to revisit old memories, while raising unanswered questions about the future."</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/sea-of-remnants-open-world-rpg-reveals-new-gameplay-sets-february-test/</link>
            <guid>1400221</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today, publisher <strong>NetEase</strong> and developer <strong>Joker Studio</strong> (previously known for the F2P asymmetrical multiplayer survival horror game <strong>Identity V</strong>) unveiled a six-minute gameplay video of <strong>Sea of Remnants</strong>, the 'ocean-fantasy' open world RPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/sea-of-remnants-is-an-f2p-ocean-adventure-rpg-coming-next-year-to-pc-ps5-and-mobile/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced back in June</a> during that month's <strong>State of Play</strong>.</p>



<p>The new footage also came with the announcement of the '<strong>Wanderer Test</strong>', a small-scale Closed Alpha test that will run from <strong>February 5 to 12</strong> on PC. From today until <strong>January 23</strong>, players can apply for the test by following the <a href="https://x.com/seaofremnants" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official Sea of Remnants X account</a>, engaging with the trailer post, or joining the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vtbh6WE9DS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official Sea of Remnants Discord</a> and completing the application questionnaire. Questionnaires will also be available on platforms including Steam and Reddit. Places to participate in the test are extremely limited, according to the developers, and eligible captains will be notified if they are selected to receive test access.</p>



<p>The press release ends with the confirmation that the game will debut later this year on <strong>PC</strong> (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3633680/Sea_of_Remnants/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via <strong>Steam</strong></a>) and <strong>PlayStation 5</strong>. The previous news also mentioned mobile, which is, however, missing now. Perhaps it's simply that it will arrive later than the main versions.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Anyway, Sea of Remnants aims to blend simulation, survival-building, and turn-based strategy. <strong>You play an amnesiac puppetfolk sailor</strong> navigating the sea toward a cursed, mysterious realm rumored to grant riches at the cost of memories.</p>



<p>The game features <strong>over three hundred recruitable NPCs</strong> across rival factions, whose allegiances shift based on your choices, reshaping the pirate hub city of <strong>Orbtopia</strong> dynamically. You'll recruit specialized crews, upgrade modular ship components, and engage in <strong>strategic turn-based land combat</strong> with mechanics like Reinforcement Points (dice rolls determining damage scaling) and a Posture gauge system, alongside real-time naval combat with responsive controls.</p>



<p>Open-world exploration takes place across volcanic islands, lush rainforests, and eerie ruins, while the progression is anchored to Orbtopia, where you can craft, cook, fish, play mahjong, train hidden professions, and run NPC-partnered shops. The experience <strong>incorporates roguelike elements</strong>: death or sinking results in the loss of non-waterproofed loot, although couriers allow for safe material transfers. The player's decisions are also said to ripple across faction dynamics and story outcomes, <strong>ensuring divergent experiences across playthroughs</strong>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fallout’s Most Iconic Feature Was Almost Scrapped Before Launch]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-feature-almost-scrapped-before-launch/</link>
            <guid>1400209</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’ve ever played a Fallout game (since Fallout 3), you’ll know what we mean by ‘VATS’. It’s the Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System, the handy mechanic that allows users to pause or slow down time, target their enemies more specifically, and wreak accurate havoc mid-battle.</p>



<p>The iconic feature is a staple of the Fallout franchise and has been featured in every game since 2008’s Fallout 3. However, there was a time before the game launched all those years ago that the mechanic was doubted, and it was almost <strong>canned </strong>before it would have had a chance to thrive.</p>







<h2 id="h-fallout-might-never-have-had-vats">Fallout Might Never Have Had VATS</h2>



<p>In a recent interview, Bethesda Game Studios’ Istvan Pely, who provided lead artistic services across Fallout 3 and Fallout 4, dropped a bombshell. He said that before Fallout 3 came out, the concept of VATS surfaced and was almost scrapped before it made it into the final product.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The studio had to provide that we could pull off a totally different genre, the opposite of fantasy.</p>



<p>We had to work out how your characters abilities would factor into your ability to shoot. Your skills aren’t good, so when you shoot at things, you’re missing – but does that feel good?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He then leaned into the topic of VATS:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>There was a long period where it was like, ‘Is this even fun? Is this worth doing at all? Is anyone even going to use this?’</p>



<p>Bethesda only just got it working in time to ship the entire game.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was revealed in the interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fallout/fallout-3s-iconic-vats-system-almost-didnt-make-it-into-the-rpg-in-time-and-bethesda-was-worried-no-one-would-even-want-to-use-it-is-this-even-fun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">EDGE magazine</a> that the biggest issues were camera positioning and avoiding clipping and object disruption when VATS was triggered in-game. It all came together in the end, but it wasn’t without intense effort.</p>



<p>Today, VATS is part and parcel of the Fallout experience. In Fallout 76, the popular MMORPG released in 2018, VATS ‘builds’ are hugely important for players, and there are several advantages to basing your entire character layout on the targeting mechanic.</p>







<p>Do you think Fallout would feel better or worse without the VATS mechanic? Let us know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Elder Scrolls Online Gets Paid Battle Pass System 12 Years After Launch]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/elder-scrolls-online-battle-pass-system-after-launch/</link>
            <guid>1400206</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Elder Scrolls Online players everywhere are digesting the recent news regarding the imminent arrival of the game’s <strong>first paid battle pass systems </strong>in more than <em>a decade</em>. The recent revelation regarding ‘Tamriel Tomes’ follows the developers admitting the popular MMORPG had become stale and too ‘predictable’.</p>



<p>The answer to that is to shake up the delivery of content, cosmetics, unlocks, and exclusive rewards via ‘Tamriel Tomes’. This new battle pass system follows the traditional model of having both a free and paid-for version, and it seems like each is bursting with rewards, but not all players are happy.</p>











<p>In a recent<a href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/69141" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> super-sized blog post</a>, the team at ZeniMax Online Studios explained the major changes coming to Elder Scrolls Online. The multi-million-user fantasy MMO surfaced in 2014 and has become a cash cow of a product since then, but that concept is about to be broadened by this new battle pass mechanic.</p>



<p>On April 2, 2026, the first Tamriel Tome (read: battle pass) will arrive, dubbed the <strong>Tome of Dawn and Dusk</strong>.</p>



<p>There will be a paid and free version of the Tome, and ZeniMax has promised that plenty of goodies, including free in-game currency, will be unlockable via the <strong>free version</strong>. The premium version of the Tamriel Tome will unlock more exclusive rewards but won’t offer players any advantage beyond better cosmetics.</p>



<p>As you can imagine, you’ll pass through the pages of the Tamriel Tome, unlock rewards as you go, and eventually complete every tier by ticking off in-game events, challenges, and special, seasonal LTMs.</p>



<p>In addition to cosmetics, the Tamriel Tomes grant players:</p>



<ul>
<li>Consumables (research scrolls, gear upgrade kits…)</li>



<li>Currencies (Gold Coast Bazaar Trade Bars, Seals…)</li>



<li>Collectibles (weapon and skill styles, furnishings…)</li>
</ul>



<p>Endeavours and Daily Login Rewards are being <strong>removed </strong>from Elder Scrolls Online in ‘Season Zero’, with most of those rewards being ported into the battle pass system. For those unclear on the topic, the ‘Gold Coast Bazaar Trade Bars’ mentioned above are also new. It’s a type of currency that you can earn and spend in an exclusive Gold Coast Bazaar Store to purchase <strong>only </strong>Tamriel Tomes items.</p>



<p>ZeniMax was quick to outline how ESO Plus members benefit further from the battle pass system. This premium subscription service has run for several years, and it’s not being forgotten with this new feature.</p>



<p>Those with ESO Plus can earn Tome Points at a boosted rate, plus they’ll earn Tome Points and Premium Tome Tokens <strong>for free </strong>based on their membership purchases. With a long enough membership, ESO Plus users can effectively get free Premium Tamriel Tomes.</p>







<p>How do you rate these changes coming to Elder Scrolls Online? Let us know what you’re thinking about Tamriel Tomes on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>Fallout 4 arrives on Switch 2 this year</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="0c85c603070bc"><a title="Fallout 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0c85c603070bc/fallout-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Bethesda</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fallout-4-anniversary-edition">Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition</a> is on its way to the Switch 2 this year, and it might not be the only Fallout game returning in the future. This information comes from the <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-in-2026-what-to-expect-from-team-green-this-year-and-beyond">same Windows Central report</a> about "what to expect" from Xbox "this year, and beyond".</p>
<p>According to the site's executive editor Jez Corden, Fallout fans can "eventually" expect to see a "<strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/fallout_3">Fallout 3</a></strong> remake in the vein of <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/elder_scrolls_iv_oblivion_remastered">Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>", with <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-360/fallout_new_vegas">Fallout New Vegas</a> to also apparently receive the same treatment.</p>
<p>A separate story on Windows Central provides a little more detail:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Nothing else is known about these Fallout remasters beyond the fact that they exist and are planned, though the news that they'll be similar to Oblivion Remastered suggests they may be designed in the same way. This would mean the use of Unreal Engine 5 for an extensive graphical overhaul, with Bethesda's Creation Engine predecessor Gamebryo still serving as the core of the gameplay systems."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As our <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2026/01/starcraft-wolfenstein-3-and-fallout-new-vegas-remake-could-all-be-in-the-works-over-at-xbox">colleagues at Pure Xbox note</a>, this isn't the first time fans have heard about the possibility of these older entries in the series returning, and late last year, company legend Todd Howard said Bethesda was <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/12/bethesda-boss-hints-at-fallout-remasters-says-the-team-is-working-on-a-bunch-of-stuff">working on a "whole bunch of stuff"</a> for the series.</p>
<p>Of course, as nothing has been officially announced or confirmed yet, there are no details about the platforms these games would target. However, Microsoft is now releasing more games on other devices than ever before, and this includes releases for Nintendo's platforms.</p>
<p>Bethesda has also shown its support for Nintendo's Switch 2 in recent times with not only the announcement of Fallout 4, but also the news <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> is coming to the new hybrid system this year. Over the holiday period it also released a Switch 2 Edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-anniversary-edition">Skyrim</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders is ‘Worse Than Call of Duty’ For Cheaters, Streamers Say]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-worse-than-call-of-duty-cheaters/</link>
            <guid>1400191</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders has a nasty issue that’s bubbling in the shadows, and it concerns cheaters finding their place in the game and ruining the fun for legitimate players. It’s not a widespread issue at present, but it’s bad enough that the game’s biggest streamers have voiced their concerns in the last few days.</p>



<p>If you’ve ever run around outside Speranza and found yourself the victim of a dubious death, you’re likely not alone. While Embark Studios has promised to work on these issues in the short-term, the PR damage is being done by streamers slamming the game on social media.</p>







<h2 id="h-does-arc-raiders-have-a-cheater-problem">Does ARC Raiders Have a Cheater Problem?</h2>



<p>The recent spate of complaints regarding ARC Raiders’ apparent cheater problem was kicked off in earnest by Nadeshot. He posted something of an essay on social media complaining about the deep-rooted cheater-based plague impacting ARC Raiders, one of his favorite games in recent years.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/Nadeshot/status/2007926647295492467" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">He wrote</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The egregious amount of cheating genuinely might be worse than peak Call of Duty. I’m not trying to bring negativity to the game because I know this type of dialogue can spread on socials like a disease but I genuinely cannot get through an entire raid without a Steam profile that is level 0 or an account that has multiple game bans and VAC bans on record.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He turned dramatic when he tried to convey his losses to readers:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’m at war and I’m getting absolutely pummeled for 8 hours straight every day. Hours and hours of looting, crafting and investment of time and resources wiped out raid after raid, over and over again.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Days later, Shroud surfaced <a href="https://x.com/CDLHater/status/2008378029462925744" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a clip</a> and declared that ‘50% of each lobby is cheating’ and asked, ‘What’s the point in playing?’</p>



<p>Embark Studios implemented a feature before launch that allows users to claim back their lost resources when killed by ‘confirmed cheaters’, but it’s a band-aid over a gunshot wound when it happens regularly enough to get under your skin.</p>



<p>Many have commented on social media claiming that, even after hundreds of hours in the game, they’re yet to see a single cheater or suspicious player. It’s a mixed bag right now, and it’s hard to say one way or another, but it’s no big secret that cheating has become an epidemic in recent years.</p>



<p>It was only a matter of time before cheaters found ARC Raiders, especially as there’s money to be made from RMT (real-money trading). On social media, blueprints and rare weapons can sell for a fair amount of cash, and that’s what’s fuelling a lot of the cheating issues in ARC Raiders.</p>

<p>One aim, as noted, would be to make the tactical RPG more accessible to a "wider audience". Specifics about how the development team would make the game "more enjoyable" (or content that might be added) weren't revealed, but again, these updates are still just being considered.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles was released in September 2025 on Switch, Switch 2 and multiple other platforms.</p>

                <p>The physical edition of one of the best third-party games for Nintendo Switch 2 is on sale for the first time at Amazon. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F64Q8C97?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</a>, which launched alongside the Switch 2 last June, is available for $60 (was $70). And unlike most third-party Switch 2 games, Cyberpunk 2077 comes with the full 60.6GB of game data on the card, so it won't consume 25% of your storage space like the digital edition.</p><p>It is worth noting, however, that the digital version was recently available for $40 during the eShop Holiday Sale--though Switch 2 users who shopped during the first day of the sale only paid $17.49 due to a pricing error that was honored by CD Projekt Red. Unfortunately, the digital price is back up to $70.</p><div data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="5377" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6537268 - Cyberpunk 2077 Switch 2 Deal" data-collection="" title="6537268 - Cyberpunk 2077 Switch 2 Deal">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F64Q8C97?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0F64Q8C97?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F64Q8C97?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition (Switch 2)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F64Q8C97?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0F64Q8C97?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F64Q8C97?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$60 (was $70)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The Ultimate Edition comes with the base game and the excellent Phantom Liberty expansion that launched on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC in 2023.</p><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 port of CD Projekt Red's beloved open-world action-RPG is exceedingly impressive. Naturally, it's not as visually stunning as it is on PS5 and Xbox Series X. In a showdown against the Steam Deck, however, the Switch 2 edition offers a better experience as a portable game.</p><p>The graphics, animations, and overall picture clarity are impressive thanks to the Switch 2's DLSS upscaling tech, ray-tracing and HDR support, and VRR. You can pick between Quality and Performance Modes. In Quality Mode, Cyberpunk 2077 runs at a mostly smooth 30fps with 1080p resolution on handheld and docked. Performance Mode targets 40fps with 1080p resolution when docked and 720p resolution on the Switch 2's display. In handheld mode, Cyberpunk 2077 takes advantage of the screen's Variable Refresh Rate tech to maximize performance.</p><p>Cyberpunk 2077 also supports Joy-Con 2 Mouse Mode as well as motion controls if you want to try gyroscope aiming while using the wide variety of weapons and abilities you uncover in Night City. And if you already have a save file on a different platform, the Switch 2 version supports cross-progression.</p></div>                      </div><p>CD Projekt Red's open-world RPG had an infamously poor launch back in 2020, but the studio gradually improved the experience over the next few years. The 2.0 update, which was implemented days before Phantom Liberty's launch, turned Cyberpunk 2077 from a pretty good game to an incredible one--and roughly 20-hour expansion is arguably the best piece of story content in the whole experience.</p><p>All told, Cyberpunk 2077 offers around 40-50 hours of mainline quests. With side content included, you can easily spend over 100 hours in Night City--and that's not even considering the prospect of replaying story with a different archetype and life path. Each archetype offers drastically different gameplay experiences, and your chosen backstory influences how NPCs interact with you.</p><h2>More Nintendo Switch 2 Game Deals</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4632384-nintendoswitch2gamesfive.png" data-ref-id="1300-4632384" data-ratio="0.35416666666667" data-width="1200" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4632384-nintendoswitch2gamesfive.png" data-ref-id="1300-4632384"></a><figcaption>Discounted third-party Switch 2 games from big studios.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4632384-nintendoswitch2gamesfive.png"></figure><p>Nintendo Switch 2 owners can save on a bunch of other third-party and first-party games at Amazon, Woot, and other major retailers.

<p>Decision apparently unrelated to recent unionisation</p>

<figure data-uuid="e7be31c8b9303"><a title="Ubisoft" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e7be31c8b9303/ubisoft.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Ubisoft has started its new year with the closure of its Canada-based studio Ubisoft Halifax. According to a company spokesperson, more than 70 positions are impacted as part of cost-cutting and restructuring measures.</p>
<p>Staff were informed about the closure on Wednesday. Here's the official comment (via VGC):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Over the past 24 months, Ubisoft has undertaken company-wide actions to streamline operations, improve efficiency, and reduce costs. As part of this, Ubisoft has made the difficult decision to close its Halifax studio.</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="yv59MOA4ebw" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yv59MOA4ebw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytyv59MOA4ebw" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yv59MOA4ebw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yv59MOA4ebw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed773c0emkohlz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div><blockquote>
<p>“71 positions will be affected. We are committed to supporting all impacted team members during this transition with resources, including comprehensive severance packages and additional career assistance.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The studio was mostly focused on mobile development, but also assisted other Ubisoft teams and had worked on major Ubisoft IP including <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/tom_clancys_rainbow_six_siege">Rainbow Six</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed</a>.</p>
<p>This closure has taken place a month after about 60 workers at Ubisoft Halifax formed a union, signing up to the "Game &amp; Media Workers Guild of Canada". Ubisoft says the decision to close the studio was made "well before" this, and respects rights of employees to unionise.</p>
<p>The union has also issued a response saying it will "pursue every legal recourse" to defend union members impacted by the closure.</p>
<p>In the past year, Ubisoft opened a new subsidiary backed by Tencent to focus on Assassin's Creed and other IP. It's been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/ubisoft-kicks-off-raymans-30th-anniversary-says-new-project-is-in-good-hands">celebrating the 30th anniversary of <strong>Rayman</strong></a>, and also launched <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> on Switch 2 in December last year. Although this version didn't get off to the best start, updates have now been rolled out to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/assassins-creed-shadows-update-to-resolve-switch-2-crashes-and-stability-issues">resolve crashes and stability issues</a>.</p>

<p>Windows Central's Executive Editor Jez Corden says he's heard <strong>Wolfenstein III</strong> is "on the cards" to coincide with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/wolfenstein-tv-series-amazon-kilter-patrick-somerville-1236469609/">Amazon's new Wolfenstein television series</a>.

<p>"<em>Kotaku</em> can confirm it’s true from our own sources.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>The creative director of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-unity/" data-ref-id="5000-253830">Assassin's Creed Unity</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-revelations/" data-ref-id="5000-103545">Assassin's Creed Revelations</a>, Alexandre Amancio, hasn't been shy about his belief that AAA game development is broken. Although Amancio has since left Ubisoft to serve as a senior vice president at FunPlus, he does have ideas about the future of AAA games and he believes that smaller dev teams are the way to go.</p><p>Amancio told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/former-assassins-creed-director-alexandre-amancio-explains-how-to-fix-aaa-development" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesIndustry.biz</a> that a lot of AAA studios "think that you can solve a problem by throwing people at it. But adding people to a problem stagnates the people that were already being efficient on it. It just creates a lot of variable noise ... So I think the future lies in smaller teams."</p><p>As an example of how smaller teams can collaborate on bigger projects, Amancio used <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag/" data-ref-id="5000-172624">Assassin's Creed: Black Flag</a> as a hypothetical example.</p><p>"Let's say you're working on the naval system on Assassin's Creed: Black Flag," said Amancio. "That's an amazing feature you can give to a co-dev studio because it's self-contained: with good direction, you can give the co-dev studio autonomy over making it as fun as possible, as long as all of the points where it connects with the main game remain stable."</p><p>Amancio went on to say that "constraints are the secret behind any good art. And whether they're artificial or they're real constraints, they have to be imposed. Our brains are all pretty much structured the same, so given the same inputs, we'll output similar ideas ... I think ideas are important, don't get me wrong ... It's constraints that force you not to use that first idea. Sometimes it's financial or it's technical, but that forces you to find something different, and mastery and excellence exists in those decisions."</p><p>Ubisoft has yet to announce which Assassin's Creed game will be released next, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-tv-show-all-the-casting-announcements/1100-6537004/" data-ref-id="1100-6537004">the cast of the Netflix TV series</a> is starting to come together. There have been several reports that a remake of Black Flag is in the works, and it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rumored-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-has-a-really-silly-title-according-to-rating/1100-6536787/" data-ref-id="1100-6536787">reportedly called Resynced.</a> Additionally, a mobile game called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-jade-is-a-free-to-play-mobile-ac-game/1100-6515133/" data-ref-id="1100-6515133">Assassin's Creed Jade</a> is in development, as well as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-codename-hexe-will-let-you-possess-and-control-a-cat-report/1100-6522899/" data-ref-id="1100-6522899">Assassin's Creed Codename Hexe</a>, and a multiplayer game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-invictus-is-reportedly-fall-guys-inspired-will-support-16-players/1100-6526637/" data-ref-id="1100-6526637">that may be called Assassin's Creed Invictus.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fortnite"><u>Fortnite</u></a> South Park trailer is (officially) here, revealing an all-new short as Butters, Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny all drop in for five-player battle royale matches – a.k.a. Quints.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Epic Games published the full trailer for its South Park crossover content following <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/south-park-fortnite-gameplay-trailer-leaks-showing-cartman-and-the-gang-in-action-and-yes-you-can-buy-towelie-as-a-pet"><u>a leak</u></a> that wormed its way online earlier today. While the low-quality, unofficial version of the footage did show the Fortnite content in its entirety, there were a few key details saved while players wait for the event to launch this Friday, January 9.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Epic’s official trailer comes in at about two-and-a-half minutes longer than the leaked trailer, with the vast majority of that runtime filled with fresh scenes set in that iconic animated South Park style. The short sees the show’s main quartet back at their computers to play some video games while leaving Butters to sit alone in a lobby, all because he “lowkey” sucks at Fortnite.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Actually, you just suck at Fortnite,” Cartman quips. “It’s not even lowkey.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Butters, donning his tinfoil Professor Chaos costume, then uses the power of the Stick of Truth to transform the South Park school bus into a proper Battle Bus that whisks the group away into the world of Fortnite (and Cartmanland). It’s here the group is forced to add Butters to their squad, making for a pretty natural segway for Epic to introduce its big new feature: Quints.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the fourth graders have proper battle royale mech suit skins built around them, Epic has used the trailer’s description to confirm that Quints is a five-player playlist for players to enjoy until the event concludes February 5. It’s an update that finally brings bigger party sizes to Fortnite after years of calls for increases, though additional details currently remain under wraps.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Fortnite x South Park Trailer - Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for other changes the Fortnite x South Park event brings to the table, the studio has confirmed the crossover’s Born in Chaos pass will be free. This departure from previous mini passes, which typically cost players and included new skins, will now not include the new South Park outfits, instead allowing players to purchase them in the Shop.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Fortnite South Park event comes to Chapter 7 for one month starting this Friday. While we wait to see how Towelie fits in as a Sidekick and what Easter Eggs Cartmanland has in store, you can see <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/top-five-most-played-games-on-playstation-and-xbox-in-2025-in-the-us-were-the-same-as-in-2024"><u>where Epic’s long-running battle royale landed in the list of top-played PlayStation and Xbox games in 2025</u></a>.

<p>Evan Wells, an industry veteran and pillar of the Naughty Dog brand, is slated to be inducted into the prestigious Hall of Fame at this year’s at this year’s D.I.C.E. Awards. The Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences announced the impending induction <em><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2026/01/former-naughty-dog-boss-evan-wells-to-receive-highest-honour-at-dice-awardshttps://www.pushsquare.com/news/2026/01/former-naughty-dog-boss-evan-wells-to-receive-highest-honour-at-dice-awardshttps://www.pushsquare.com/news/2026/01/former-naughty-dog-boss-evan-wells-to-receive-highest-honour-at-dice-awards" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">via a press release on January 7th, 2025.</a></em></p>



<p>Evan Wells began his career in the ’90s at Sega. During his time there, he worked on the ToeJam &amp; Earl series. He later moved to Crystal Dynamics, where he worked on the Gex series as the lead designer on Gex: Enter the Gecko. </p>







<h2 id="h-evan-wells-history-at-naughty-dog">Evan Wells’ History at Naughty Dog</h2>



<p>Then, he joined Naughty Dog in 1998 and spent most of his career there, working on games in the Crash Bandicoot and Jak and Daxter series. He would become co-president of Naughty Dog in 2004 and ultimately retired in 2023 after overseeing the success of franchises such as Uncharted and The Last of Us. He would retire in 2023.</p>



<p>He will be inducted into the Hall of Fame by the studio’s current head, Neil Druckmann. In a press release, Druckmann praised Evans’ leadership and the trust he placed in the team.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Naughty Dog was able to create some truly incredible games and leave a lasting mark on the industry because of Evan’s unwavering leadership and the trust he placed in all of us. I know I speak for many across the industry when I congratulate Evan on this well-deserved recognition. It’s a profound honor to present him with this Hall of Fame induction.”</p>
</blockquote>







<p>Past AIAS Hall of Fame inductees include Hideo Kojima, Ed Boon, Shigeru Miyamoto, and Todd Howard. Insider Gaming will be in attendance at the 29th Annual D.I.C.E. Awards on Thursday, February 12, in Las Vegas.</p>

            <p>
You know what South Park feels like to me? It feels like randomly waking up in the middle of the night, looking around your bedroom as you think "cripes, it's still not morning yet?" A feeling of waiting for the inevitable, the end, or the beginning. Not so much the contents of the show, none of that needs all that much thought, more so its very existence, which is now apparently transplanting itself into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>.
</p>
<p>
This latest collab came with, much like collabs with The Simpsons, Family Guy etc., a trailer that kicks off with an animation set within the world of the show. Stan, Kyle, Eric, and Kenny are all playing Fortnite together, Butters left out as he always as the pre-pubescent worst boys in the world chat all sorts of gamer nonsense. The ostracisation of Butter leads him to find the stick of truth - yes, like the one from the South Park game, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/south-park-the-stick-of-truth">The Stick of Truth</a>, admittedly quite cute - warping them all into Fortnite itself.
</p>

<p>
As is standard for the Forted Nite these days, because all of the skins you can get - which includes all four main boys and Butters - are all actual children, so they've got makeshift robotish bodies to prance around in. On top of that, there's a whole new bit of the map to explore, Cartmanland, a theme park which harbours the aforementioned stick of truth which can do… something, you'll figure it out when you play.
</p><p>
There's also a new Quints 5-person playlist, convenient for those of you that have a Butters in your life (if you're the kind of person that has a Butters in their life, be kind to them). This all drops later this week on Friday, January 9th, and it'll be live until February 5th. Happy South Parking!
