            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/netease-releases-statement-on-western-marvel-rivals-team-layoffs/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A few hours ago, the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-rivals-support-studio-director-shares-that-he-and-his-team-were-just-laid-off.1112481/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">news</a> that one of the teams working on Marvel Rivals for NetEase suffered major layoffs struck the industry like thunder. After all, this is arguably the biggest success of the last few months, <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-sets-new-concurrency-record-on-steam-earns-over-135-million-overall-in-its-first-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earning an estimated $135 million in the first month alone</a> with a user base of more than 20 million players across all platforms.</p>
<p>Needless to say, fans of Marvel Rivals and just regular gamers in general did not understand what was happening. We immediately reached out to NetEase to get their statement on the matter, which just arrived. Here it is in full:</p>
<p><em>We recently made the difficult decision to adjust Marvel Rivals’ development team structure for organizational reasons and to optimize development efficiency for the game. This resulted in a reduction of a design team based in Seattle that is part of a larger global design function in support of Marvel Rivals. We appreciate the hard work and dedication of those affected and will be treating them confidentially and respectfully with recognition for their individual contributions.</em></p>
<p><em>We want to reassure our fanbase that the core development team for Marvel Rivals, which continues to be led by Lead Producer Weicong Wu and Game Creative Director Guangyun Chen in Guangzhou, China, remains fully committed to delivering an exceptional experience. We are investing more, not less, into the evolution and growth of this game. We’re excited to deliver new superhero characters, maps, features, and content to ensure an engaging live service experience for our worldwide player base.</em></p>
<p>Somewhat ironically, earlier in the day, NetEase had sent out a press release and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMPCzylKgc8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video update</a> with new details on the next Marvel Rivals patch, launching with Season 1.5: Eternal Night Falls. This will kick off on February 21, introducing The Thing and Human Torch from the Fantastic Four as playable heroes. Additionally, a new redemption system will be implemented, allowing players to convert excess Chrono Tokens into Units. The second part of Season 1 will also include a new map, 'Empire of Eternal Night: Central Park,' along with updates to competitive mode, tournament plans, and more.</p>
<p><iframe title="Human Torch: Hottest Hero In Town | Character Reveal | Marvel Rivals" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6ORBFXYlQ3U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Human Torch will be a Duelist type of character in the game, adding an intense flare to every battle with scorching flames. When he's not busy burning Dracula's legions with flames brighter than the sun itself, he's soaring across the city to gather Chronovium and scavenge for parts of the Timestream Reintegration Device.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Thing: You Know What Time It Is | Character Reveal | Marvel Rivals" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l44udAAD3Yc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Thing, on the other hand, will predictably be a Vanguard character. His story is well known: Ben Grimm originally signed up to be a pilot for his friend Reed, but he returned from the mission as a monster called The Thing. However, while beaming cosmic rays transformed his flesh, Ben's heart of gold still beats in his rocky body. As New York City plunged into eternal night, the Thing made it his mission to selflessly protect his home and lead missions to collect Chronovium by putting his piloting skills to the test.</p>
<p>NetEase also announced today that the recent in-client tournament, the Marvel Rivals Championship (MRC), maxed out its Faction registrations in North America. After the upcoming update in the second half of Season 1, this limit will be increased. There will be a series of Marvel Rivals Invitationals (MRI) set to kick off at the end of February and continue into March, paving the way for the upcoming championship.</p>

<p>Niantic Inc. is closing in on a deal to sell its games division, which includes Pokemon Go, to Saudia Arabia-backed Scopely Inc. for $3.5 billion. This, according to a new report from Bloomberg.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-19/-pokemon-go-maker-nears-3-5-billion-deal-to-sell-games-unit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg says</a> a deal on the sale could be announced “in coming weeks”, and would include Niantic’s video game business and gaming properties. In addition to Pokemon Go, Niantic games also include Ingress, Pikmin Bloom, and Monster Hunter Now, among others.</p>



<p>Despite talks being close, the report states that there’s “no assurance an agreement will be reached.”</p>

<p>Founded in 2011, Scopely was acquired by Savvy Games Group in 2023 for $4.9 billion. Savvy Games Group is a gaming subsidiary funded by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund.</p>



<p>In August 2024, Niantic and Savvy Games Group <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/savvy-games-group-signs-memorandum-of-understanding-with-niantic-for-mena-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">signed a deal</a> for Niantic to help with planned expansion into Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and United Arab Emirates. </p>



<p>“Our collaboration with Niantic marks a significant milestone in our efforts to bring cutting-edge games and esports experiences to the MENA-3 region,” Savvy Games Group CEO Brian Ward said, at the time, via PocketGamer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Neither Scopely nor Niantic would comment on the potential sale when contacted by Bloomberg.</p>

But the stuff I want to talk about in more detail today is the game's conversation system, and how it has been built to support both the weight of the universe's lore as well as the needs of a large and varied playerbase.</p><p>Up top is a screenshot of the conversation screen in action. Looks normal, right? A character talks, you select some responses, a conversation happens. But look at the two buttons down the bottom. The one of the left toggles subtitles on and off. Normally this is a main menu kind of thing, something you're supposed to toggle once based on preference then never touch again. Here, though, you can do it on the fly, which is amazing! I'm normally a subs off guy, but this game has some wild accents and creatures, so the button lets me turn them on for some (when I need to understand them) and off for others (so I can enjoy the game's gorgeous characters and environments unobscured).</p><figure><figcaption>Sometimes it's nicer to just appreciate this beautiful video game, without half the screen being obscured by text</figcaption></figure><p>I'm even more impressed with the button on the right. <em>Avowed</em> basically shipped with a wiki attached to its conversation system, so whenever a character or location or even concept from the <em>Pillars of Eternity</em> universe is mentioned, you can stop, check the conversation's logs and get a great little explainer on just who or what was mentioned. This has been life-changing to me, a guy who wanted to play this game in particular but isn't really a <em>Pillars of Eternity</em> guy, because now I'm fully up to speed about this universe's lore in ways I wasn't with, say, <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em> even after 60-70 hours.</p><figure><figcaption>Other times, you need to LEARN<span></span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Favowed-i-hope-you-guys-are-into-your-lore-dumps-and-enjoy-a-v0-ecelbta3q3je1.png%3Fwidth%3D1080%26crop%3Dsmart%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3Da6ea29331194b9c25a85b9620c5bc235eb0e2cb4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit</a></figcaption></figure><p>Accessibility is an important word in video games, and it's one that we usually--and rightfully--associate with making games more accessible to those who would otherwise be unable to play them. Here, though, it also means making a game more accessible generally, right down to people's tastes for subtitles and lore. I think it's been a huge success here, and I will really feel its absence next time I try and play you, <em>Yakuza</em>, yes you, I'm looking at you.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/gamestop-stonks-shares-closures-store"><h3>GameStop Is A Very 21st Century Company</h3></a><p>And also has the most predictable trajectory</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Nvidia's PhysX offerings to developers didn't always generate warm feelings. As part of its broader GamesWorks package, PhysX was cited as one of the reasons <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/05/amd-says-nvidias-gameworks-completely-sabotaged-witcher-3-performance/"><em>The Witcher 3</em> ran at notably sub-optimal levels</a> at launch. Protagonist Geralt's hair, rendered in PhysX-powered HairWorks, was a burden on some chipsets.</p>
<p>PhysX started appearing in general game engines, like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/03/unity-5-game-engine-brings-enhanced-graphic-tools-new-cloud-services/">Unity 5</a>, and was eventually open-sourced, first in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181205103131/https://developer.nvidia.com/physx-sdk">limited computer and mobile form</a>, then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230528035837/https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/open-source-simulation-expands-with-nvidia-physx-5-release/">more broadly</a>. As an application wrapped up in Nvidia's 32-bit CUDA API and platform, the PhysX engine had a built-in shelf life. Now the expiration date is known, and it is conditional on buying into Nvidia's 50-series video cards—whenever they approach reasonable human prices.</p>

<h2>The real dynamic particles were the friends we made…</h2>
<p><a href="https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5615">Nvidia noted in mid-January</a> that 32-bit applications cannot be developed or debugged on the latest versions of its CUDA toolkit. They will still run on cards before the 50 series. Technically, you could also keep an older card installed on your system for compatibility, which is real dedication to early-2010's-era particle physics.</p>
<p>Technically, a 64-bit game could still support PhysX on Nvidia's newest GPUs, but the heyday of PhysX, as a stand-alone technology switched on in game settings, tended to coincide with the 32-bit computing era.</p>
<p>If you load up a 32-bit game now with PhysX enabled (or <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/geforce-graphics-cards/5/557125/rtx-5090-missing-physx-support/">forced in a config file</a>) and a 50-series Nvidia GPU installed, there's a good chance the physics work will be passed to the CPU instead of the GPU, likely <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJGf0-tGaf4">bottlenecking the game and steeply lowering frame rates</a>. Of course, turning off PhysX entirely raised frame rates above even native GPU support levels.</p>
<p>Demanding <em>Borderlands 2</em> keep using PhysX made it so it "runs terrible," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/1irs8xk/comment/mdauwh3/?utm_name=web3xcss">noted one Redditor</a>, even if the dust clouds and flapping cloth strips looked interesting. Other games with PhysX baked in, as listed by ResetEra completists, include <em>Metro 2033,&nbsp;</em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/10/assassins-creed-iv-review-enormous-but-ultimately-empty/"><em>Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag</em></a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_(2013_video_game)">the 2013&nbsp;<em>Star Trek&nbsp;</em>game</a>.</p>
<p>Commenters on Reddit and ResetEra note that many of the games listed had performance issues with PhysX long before Nvidia forced them to either turn off or be loaded onto a CPU. For some games, however, PhysX enabled destructible environments, "dynamic bank notes" and "posters" (in the&nbsp;<em>Arkham</em> games), fluid simulations, and base gameplay physics.</p>
<p>Anyone who works in, or cares about, game preservation has always had their work cut out for them. But it's a particularly tough challenge to see certain aspects of a game's operation lost to the forward march of the CUDA platform, something that's harder to explain than a scratched CD or Windows compatibility.</p>

That’s fun enough, but if you move too fast you also add noise cubes to a bag, making it more and more likely that it’ll be you who wakes a sleeping dragon and suffers its wrath, adding a great element of tension to ever step. And that’s fun enough, but Catacombs ups the ante by having a modular map for maximum variety and a real feeling of exploration. All of them work well with three: two players feels like too much of a head to head, and four takes a little too long. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you like the style of this game, we also recommend you check out our guide to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dungeon-crawler-board-games">best dungeon-crawler board games</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization</h2></div><div catalogid="2b626ccd-e241-48af-adbb-5e28cf9d4d99" id="215446"><div id="215446" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">An odd but brilliant civilization game without a map, this sees you shepherding your nascent culture from its roots in the Bronze Age all the way up the technology tree to the present day. All the resource management and population pleasing you’ve come to expect from the genre is there, enlivened by a tense conveyor belt of upcoming upgrade cards that you’re always tempted to overpay for in order to snaffle them before your opponents. There are also plenty of military engagements that face off one player’s forces directly against another, and the lack of a map not only makes these fast and easy to resolve but prevents dogpiling, ensuring that it’s a great game for three, staying a well-balanced test of tactical and strategic decision making.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Star Wars: Outer Rim</h2></div><div catalogid="2b626ccd-e241-48af-adbb-5e28cf9d4d99" id="215447"><div id="215447" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Star Wars: Outer Rim</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">From its weird crescent-shaped board to its striking art, you know that this is going to be a great re-creation of the Star Wars universe.

You’ll gain skills, upgrade your ship and, likely as not, run into some famous faces from the franchise during your epic escapade to become (in)famous across the wider galaxy. It plays perfectly with three, giving you enough interaction to enrich your shared adventure, but not dragging this admittedly random and narrative-rich game past its welcome point.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you are interested in more from the franchise, there are actually quite a few <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-star-wars-board-games">great Star Wars board games we recommend</a> outside of this one.</p><h2 data-cy="title2" id="gloomhaven">Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion</h2></div><div catalogid="2b626ccd-e241-48af-adbb-5e28cf9d4d99" id="215448"><div id="215448" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Gloomhaven has really created a stir the last several years.

This fantasy adventure game has players cooperating to work through dungeons and defeat an array of enemies. Each character possesses a unique deck with a distinct playstyle.

We are fortunate that one of the most beloved board games of the past few years is set in this universe. This game has players balancing military strength with political power by building a personal deck of cards from a public market. You must also acquire resources and build alliances by placing your workers on a myriad of spaces on the board. Both of these systems combine to create a powerful game loop of improving your engine to yield greater rewards. The payout is tremendous in this nuanced game that rewards strategic play and deeper exploration. Three players works wonderfully as it creates just the right amount of competition over spaces on the board and forces you to adapt to an ever-changing landscape.

Each bird offers a unique ability which interfaces with the rest of your sanctuary to create an emerging combination of effects. This is a very inviting and warm game visually, but it also has some heft to it as a game, offering a satisfying strategic foundation for players to repeatedly return to. Three players is the ideal count, as it creates some healthy competition by pushing each other to thoughtfully expand your group of birds without hurting the tempo of play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more information about this board game, you can check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wingspan-board-game-review">my hands-on review of Wingspan</a> as well as the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wyrmspan-board-game-review">dragon-themed Wyrmspan spin-off</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2" id="anachrony">Anachrony</h2></div><div catalogid="2b626ccd-e241-48af-adbb-5e28cf9d4d99" id="215451"><div id="215451" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Anachrony: Essential Edition</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">An asteroid is going to hit the Earth and you have a limited amount of time to prepare to save humanity – but you want to be the one who’s in charge when the dust settles.

Each player is working to form the most beautiful mosaic by drafting tiles from the central market to place on their board, scoring points based on how many you can connect. Full rows, columns and sets of the same type of tile earn big bonus rewards. The beautifully detailed pieces are satisfying to play with as you slide them into place, carefully considering the best move of the moment but also what other players are likely to pick so you don’t lose points from getting stuck with tiles you can’t use.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more information about the game, check out my <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/azul-board-game-review">hands-on review of Azul</a>.

Each session is different thanks to the variety of scoring goals, which reward points based on the relative placement of animal tokens. In one game you may try to ensure red tailed hawks are flying solo and in another that they have an unobstructed view to their potential mate. The tiles you draft not only represent where each type of animal can live but different terrain types, and building unbroken expanses of mountains, wetlands and forests can be worth just as much points at the end of the game as having the right animal patterns. Add in pinecones that can be used to mix up the token and tile pairs during drafting and you’ll have plenty to think about each turn.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more information about this game, make sure to check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cascadia-board-game-review">my Cascadia board game review</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2" id="cthulhu">Cthulhu: Death May Die</h2></div><div catalogid="2b626ccd-e241-48af-adbb-5e28cf9d4d99" id="215454"><div id="215454" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Cthulhu: Death May Die</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Most games based on Lovecraftian horror are about preventing Elder Gods from setting foot on Earth, but it’s already too late for that in Cthulhu: Death May Die. Instead your goal is to arm yourself well enough to be able to shoot the monster in the face. There’s a high level of replayability to the cooperative game thanks to the variety of investigators players can control and the threats of the different Elder Gods and their minions, who are represented through impressively detailed miniatures. Three players gives you a nice variety of character archetypes without making the game take too long, which can happen when there are five people choosing the best way to take their actions. You still need to be careful though, since the game ends if a single investigator is eliminated before the Elder is summoned.</p><h2 data-cy="title2" id="waterdeep">Lords of Waterdeep</h2></div><div catalogid="2b626ccd-e241-48af-adbb-5e28cf9d4d99" id="215455"><div id="215455" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Lords of Waterdeep</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Lords of Waterdeep provides an excellent introduction to the worker placement genre and is especially fun for D&amp;D players who will recognize the references to the Forgotten Realms. Players take on the roles of secret Lords of Waterdeep, each with their own strengths, and will try to establish influence over the City of Splendors by recruiting various types of adventurers to send on quests. Some quests provide powerful boosts that will make it easier for you to gain more resources throughout the game while others are worth a huge amount of points, so you’ll have to think carefully about your priorities as the rounds progress. Players can also build new locations on the map that they can use themselves and they’ll rake in rewards when a rival takes advantage of them.

There are so many ways to earn points that it’s a real challenge to figure out which is best to pursue, especially since you’re directly competing with your opponents to be the first to nab bigger rewards. You can focus on exploring new areas and fighting fearsome guardians, conduct research, try to improve your deck, or recruit assistants that will make your work easier. The game board is tailored based on the number of players so it’s as well balanced for three as it is for two or four. There’s a solo variant if you want to play alone or are looking for a good way to practice strategies.</p><h2 data-cy="title2" id="raiders">Raiders of the North Sea</h2></div><div catalogid="2b626ccd-e241-48af-adbb-5e28cf9d4d99" id="215457"><div id="215457" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Raiders of the North Sea</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Be a Viking with this worker placement game, where you’ll need to put together a crew and gather enough resources to successfully raid increasingly well-protected settlements. You’ll collect silver to hire crew members, who will help determine your strategy since they can give you bonuses when attacking specific targets. They can also die and become Valkyrie that will earn points you need to win. You also have to take the time to convert your plunder into offerings for the chieftain, though the amount of favor you’ve earned is kept a secret until the end of the game. Choose your actions wisely as the game can end quickly as players rush to make offerings and launch their boats deeper into the territories at the bottom of the board.</p><h2 data-cy="title2" id="splendor">Splendor</h2></div><div catalogid="2b626ccd-e241-48af-adbb-5e28cf9d4d99" id="215458"><div id="215458" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Splendor</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This fast game is easy enough for kids to learn but satisfying for players of all ages, making it a good <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games">board game for families</a>. Compete to build a thriving jewelry business by gathering gem tokens which can be used to purchase developments and win the favor of nobles. You’ll want to try to take actions as efficiently as possible, keeping track of what resources your opponents are gathering and when they are likely to purchase a development so you don’t miss the opportunity or get stuck waiting for them to stop hoarding a key resource. You also should plan long term, looking at the bonus gems needed to attract each noble since you can only pick up one per turn and their high point values can be the difference between winning or losing.</p><h2 data-cy="title2" id="viticulture">Viticulture</h2></div><div catalogid="2b626ccd-e241-48af-adbb-5e28cf9d4d99" id="215459"><div id="215459" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Viticulture</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ve inherited an unimpressive Tuscan vineyard and you have to build it up into something to be proud of in this charming strategic game that takes place over a series of seasons. In summer you’ll deploy workers to plant vines, build structures and sell grapes, while in winter you’ll harvest crops and start aging your wines. You can develop more complex and valuable varieties based on the types of grapes you grow and how much work you’ve done in your cellar, which you can then use to fulfill orders and earn more money to make additional improvements to the vineyard. Pop open a bottle of wine and settle in to learn a bit about how it’s produced as you play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Thrower is a contributing freelancer for IGN, specializing in tabletop games.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> Chapter 6 Season 2, aka <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-6-season-2-start-date-theme-battle-pass-leaks-and-rumors/1100-6529339/" data-ref-id="1100-6529339">Lawless season</a>, starts on Friday, and it's bringing us an early dose of something we thought we'd have to wait until at least the fall for: a new Grand Theft Auto. Not literally, of course. Epic is not collaborating with Rockstar Games here--they're just adding a new urban location on the map called Crime City, and we'll be spending much of our time this season stealing stuff from vaults, armored cars, and the train, and each other. Yep, sounds like GTA to me.</p><p>It's amusing timing, given that the very long awaited Grand Theft Auto 6 looks like it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-is-still-on-track-for-fall-2025-release/1100-6527618/" data-ref-id="1100-6527618">might actually come out this year</a>, a decade and two console generations since GTA 5 launched back in 2013. But even with a proper new GTA title finally peeking its head above the horizon, Epic beat them to the punch with Lawless season.</p><p>Not convinced by the comparison? Let's take a look at the season trailer.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66eAN56g7D8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/66eAN56g7D8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The cinematic part at the beginning puts a heavy emphasis on breaking into vaults and stealing stuff, but it's a little different than it was in past heist seasons--in addition to the vaults that are in buildings, we've got armored security vans, and even the train will now be a moving vault you have to blow open and which is defended by turrets. In other words: we'll have some GTA Online-style missions to do in the middle of our battle royale matches.</p><p>But the big tell, for the purposes of the GTA comparison here, is the tone. While Fortnite loves its heist seasons, they've usually been a bit classier about it with more of an Ocean's 11 feel--whereas Lawless season is more grungy and down in the dirt the way GTA has always been. And because it's Fortnite, it doesn't have any problem matching GTA's irreverence--these two brands have a similar lack of respect for everything.</p><p>After last summer's controversial Wrecked season, the thought of another vehicle-focused season might be a little scary for some. But this appears to be a middle ground, meaning there appears to be a more measured increase in emphasis on vehicles this time--there's no sign of upgrades or mounted weapons for the vehicles, for one thing, so you'll have to stick your head out the window and shoot your guns as usual. That said, I actually thought Wrecked season was delightful, so you wouldn't hear me complain about a potential new focus on cars anyway.</p><p>Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 2 kicks off on Friday, February 21, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-6-season-2-start-date-theme-battle-pass-leaks-and-rumors/1100-6529339/" data-ref-id="1100-6529339">we've got a rundown of everything we know so far about the new season right here.</a></p>

Reading the document on the support beam of the cabin will give you hints as to which symbols you need to use for the door's lock, so it isn't terribly hard to figure out, but there are a few things that can be misleading and make this look much harder than it actually is. I spent way too long thinking the symbol at the bottom of the ladder was the one I needed, when actually it's the symbol at the top of the stairs in the attic that I overlooked.

<h2>What now?</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2383614433">a follow-up stream on Monday</a>, Nico called his latest gaming achievement "by far the most difficult run I have ever completed. We did the same run leveled, but it is not even close to as difficult as the level 1 run. The level 1 run, the difficulty level is just insane."</p>
<p>Aside from being an incredible individual achievement, Nico's level 1 God Run helps put FromSoft's reputation for difficulty into perspective. While these games can punish failure very harshly—and require lots of arcane knowledge to play well—Nico shows that they're also designed to be fair to players with the steely nerves to attack and dodge with perfect timing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">After almost 2 years of attempts!<br>
IT'S FINALLY DONE!<br>
7 Games, 0 Hits, Character Level 1!</p>
<p>WE DID IT!</p>
<p>Here is the last fight! (and sorry that it is cinder again) 😅<a href="https://t.co/0g24MY4wRy">https://t.co/0g24MY4wRy</a></p>
<p>— Nico (@dinossindgeil) <a href="https://twitter.com/dinossindgeil/status/1891230190291788237?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote>
<p>With his ultimate FromSoft achievement now complete, Nico said he's "going to take a vacation now. And by vacation, I mean I'll continue doing hitless runs, I will continue being live every day... but we're going to do some smaller ones for now." In the longer term, Nico hinted that he is "going to work on one really big project again," but wasn't willing to provide details just yet.</p>
<p>If you want to follow in Nico's hitless FromSoft footsteps, he puts out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svsAMPM9Pzc">instructional videos</a> laying out the specific paths and strategies needed to get through specific games (Pro tip: It involves a lot of well-timed rolling and memorizing attack and stagger patterns). Nico also took the time to recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzQ2o0pejVQ">rank how hard he finds each game in the God Run</a>, putting <em>Elden Ring</em> in the easiest tier and <em>Dark Souls II</em> in the hardest.</p>

Free-to-play hero shooter Marvel Rivals has been a huge success for publisher NetEase, smashing through the 20m player barrier just weeks into its launch and still regularly attracting over 250K daily concurrent players on Steam. But that hasn't been enough to stop NetEase from making lay offs across the US development team that helped land it a hit.
</p>
<p>
Marvel Rivals game director Thaddeus Sasser broke the news of job cuts at NetEase's Seattle-based studio in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7297672154060361729/">post shared on LinkedIn</a>. "This is such a weird industry," he wrote. "My stellar, talented team just helped deliver an incredibly successful new franchise in Marvel Rivals for NetEase Games... and were just laid off!"
</p>
<p>
Sasser didn't say how many people have lost their jobs following NetEase's decision - Eurogamer has reached out to the publisher for clarification - but Marvel Rivals level designers Jack Burrows and Garry McGee both confirmed they'd been affected in separate posts.

"Welp, just got laid off from my job working on Marvel Rivals with NetEase," Burrows <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7297445172118724608/">wrote</a>. "Was an enormous pleasure to work with my American coworkers who join me in this sad culling. Just couldn't dodge that big boot I guess, no matter how big the success of the gig."
</p>
<p>
McGee <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7297717165019803649/">shared a similar sentiment</a>, writing, "My team recently helped develop and launch Marvel Rivals, which turned out to be a bigger hit than any of us expected! Unfortunately my team was also laid off. Strange times all across the industry indeed."
</p>
<p>
As unexpected as NetEase's decision might seem in context of Marvel Rivals' breakout success, the move follows layoffs across a number of its western studios. In November, for instance, BioWare veteran Mac Walters announced a "pause" in operations at his NetEase-backed Worlds Untold. Similarly, Jar of Sparks - a first-party NetEase developer founded by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo-infinite">Halo Infinite</a> head of design Jerry Hook in 2022 - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-infinite-head-of-designs-netease-studio-halting-work-on-first-game-as-it-searches-for-new-publisher">halted work on its currently-unannounced debut title</a> in January, laying off staff and began searching for a new publishing partner.
</p>
<p>
This week also saw an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/just-cause-creators-new-studio-suffers-layoffs-before-launching-first-game">unspecified number of layoffs</a> at Swedish developer Liquid Swords, which was formed in 2020 by Avanlanche Studios' Christofer Sundberg with NetEase funding.
</p>
<p>
Today's layoffs continue a devastating few years for the games industry, which has seen over 25,000 employees lose their jobs since the start of 2023. Less than two months into 2025, another 900 layoffs have <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2025">already been recorded</a>, affecting workers across the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unity-slashes-jobs-tells-employees-theyre-unemployed-via-5am-email">Unity</a>, HiRez Studios, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/layoffs-look-likely-at-sumo-digital-as-company-ditches-plans-to-work-on-its-own-ip">Sumo Digital</a>, Ubisoft, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splash-damage-cancels-transformers-reactivate-says-roles-at-risk-of-redundancy">Splash Damage</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/drdisrespect-studio-midnight-society-announces-closure-four-months-after-significant-layoffs">Midnight Society</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/final-fantasy-magic-gathering-crossover-brings-classic-art-and-new-mechanics<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has released new details on the upcoming <em>Final Fantasy</em> <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> crossover. The crossover will showcase various iconic characters in the Commander decks alongside new gameplay mechanics.</p>



<p>In an official press release, Wizards of the Coast showcased both new cards and gameplay features coming in the <em>Final Fantasy</em> <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> crossover.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-starter-deck-cards.jpg?itok=WCJV8Nn9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-starter-deck-cards.jpg?itok=wNEe7TSz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As discussed in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/final-fantasy-commander-decks-coming-to-magic-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">initial announcement</a>, this new set, much like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/cutest-cards-we-pulled-from-magic-gathering-bloomburrow" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Bloomburrow</em></a> and <em>Lord of the Rings</em>, will include boosters, four Commander decks, and a starter set. Each Commander deck will act as adaptations of a specific iconic <em>Final Fantasy</em> games:<em> Final Fantasy VI</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/final-fantasy-vii" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Final Fantasy VII</em></a>, <em>Final Fantasy X</em>, and the <em>Shadowbringers</em> arc of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></a>.</p>

<p>The release will feature over 100 iconic <em>Final Fantasy</em> characters with over 55 in special booster fun versions. These will be showcasing the influential artwork of several artists in the series including Yoshitaka Amano and Tetsuya Nomura. Those characters will feature in Borderless Character Cards, Borderless Woodblock Cards inspired by Japanese woodblock paintings, and Borderless <em>Final Fantasy</em> Artist cards.</p>

They include the prodigal knight Cecil. the existential threat known as Sin, the goofy Cactuar, and the iconic Moogle merchant.</p>

Examples include <em>Yuriko, the Tiger's Shadow</em> as <em>Yuffie Kisaragi</em> and <em>Ancient Copper Dragon</em> as <em>Final Fantasy I's</em> <em>Dragon of Mount Gulg</em>. Both of these cards feature the acclaimed work of Final Fantasy series' artists Yoshitaka Amano and Tetsuya Nomura. The Final Fantasy Through the Ages is a bonus sheet, so will be included in boosters in some form or another that is not yet specified.&nbsp; We have previously seen it in only collector boosters (planeswalkers in collector's boosters for <em>Bloomburrow</em>), multiple types in each play/draft booster (<em>Wilds of Eldraine</em>, and <em>March of the Machine</em>) as examples, and more.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-double-faced-cards.jpg?itok=cK-gx3Wf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-double-faced-cards.jpg?itok=YCiCCWWg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In addition, the <em>Final Fantasy</em> <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Commander decks will introduce new and returning mechanics. First is the return of Double-Faced Cards. Pay the mana cost on the front to play the card, then flip it when the required conditions are met.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-shiva-artwork.jpg?itok=ppQUNyD- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-shiva-artwork.jpg?itok=_BXZtkOh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Second is the introduction of Saga Creatures, which are depictions of <em>Final Fantasy</em> Summons. They cost a bit of mana and leave the battlefield after a fixed number of turns, but the investment may be worth it with the right combo.</p>

<p>Lastly, Wizards of the Coast will be releasing three <em>Final Fantasy</em> Secret Lair drops alongside the release of these Commander Decks. As for what those Secret Lairs will include, that remains to be seen.</p>

<p><em>Magic: The Gathering - Final Fantasy</em> will release on June 13, with the pre-release happening a week earlier.</p>

According to the report, the developer is having discussions with <em>Fortnite, Roblox</em>, and <em>GTA</em> creators about making “custom experiences” inside what’s shaping up to be the biggest gaming release since the last <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> game launched way (<em>way</em>) back in 2013.</p><p>That Rockstar has made user-generated content part of its strategy for <em>GTA VI</em> should come as no surprise. Despite the last <em>GTA</em> launching over ten years ago (same with <em>GTA Online</em>), interest in the game <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/23/20880410/twitch-gta-nopixel-role-play-best-grand-theft-auto-v">has stayed fresh with the help of mods</a> like FiveM that allow users to host and join their own multiplayer servers. </p><p>Rockstar <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/rockstar-responds-to-grand-theft-auto-mod-ban-complaint/">initially banned some of the creators of FiveM</a> back in 2015, citing that their mod was “an unauthorized alternate multiplayer service that contains code designed to facilitate piracy.” However, as the popularity of the kinds of games and role-playing enabled by FiveM and similar mods grew, Rockstar reversed course. In 2023, the company acquired Cfx.re, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/11/23828431/rockstar-cfx-re-mod-tools-roleplay-server">the team that developed FiveM</a>.</p><p>Games like <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Roblox</em>, and <em>Minecraft</em> remain at the top of US sales charts years after their release thanks to the popularity of user-generated content. Arranging deals with creators prior to its launch will help <em>GTA VI</em> hit the ground running in a crowded marketplace.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The Thing also has a support-focused ability, which allows him to leap to a nearby teammate, giving himself bonus health when he reaches them. The bonus health comes from rocks that float around The Thing and give bonus health when destroyed by enemies. This was paired with his team-up with Wolverine, which allows him to throw Wolverine as part of the fastball special, a team-up already in the game with Hulk. His ultimate is a large ground pound, which deals damage in an outward cone, knocking up enemies hit, leaving them vulnerable to other attacks.</p><p>The Thing is the first Vanguard to be added to the roster since launch, likely making him a popular pick when the Marvel Rivals Season 1 mid-season update launches on February 21.

And while Sony continues to fight on with its PlayStation despite the war being over, Xbox CEO Phil Spencer recently confirmed that, yeah, it’s all over, and the company is no longer trying to steal users away with exclusives. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196181" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="180" data-playlist="196181,196230,197298" data-current="196181"><div><p>The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21718.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://xboxera.com/2025/02/15/xboxera-interviews-phil-spencer/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://xboxera.com/2025/02/15/xboxera-interviews-phil-spencer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Over the weekend, Spencer sat down for a lengthy interview with <em>XboxEra</em></a></span><em> </em>in which he discussed his favorite games, talked about what various Xbox studios are working on, and dished on the industry at large. And he was also honest about Xbox no longer being part of any console war, as it shifts to selling Xbox games on other consoles, like PlayStation. </p><p>“I would love to make all of the money for all of the games that we ship, right? Like, obviously we make more on our own platform,” said Spencer. “It’s one of the reasons that investing in our own platform is important. But there are people, whether it’s their libraries on a PlayStation or Nintendo, whether it’s they like the controller better, they just like the games that are there.”</p><p>“I’m not trying to move them all over to Xbox anymore,” added Spencer. </p><p>That last quote, about not trying to bring everyone over to Xbox anymore, is a very telling one. And for sure, Xbox hasn’t <em>really </em>been competing with Sony or Nintendo for a few years now—<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-boss-spencer-halo-ps5-switch-exclusive-no-red-line-1851697549?_gl=1*1n51jqf*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczOTg4NjcwMy40ODYuMS4xNzM5OTEwODE3LjUwLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-boss-spencer-halo-ps5-switch-exclusive-no-red-line-1851697549?_gl=1*1n51jqf*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczOTg4NjcwMy40ODYuMS4xNzM5OTEwODE3LjUwLjAuMA..">that kinda stops when you start selling your games on their platforms</a></span>—but this is confirmation from Spencer that Xbox was once fighting in the console wars  and that it no longer is part of that battle, as the entire point of the console wars was to sell more boxes and steal away other players with exclusives. </p><p>Elsewhere in the interview, Spencer further explained that Asia is one of Xbox’s “fastest-growing regions,” and it’s thanks in large part to Cloud Gaming via Game Pass and PC. And according to Spencer, the users driving this are players who were never going to buy an Xbox. </p><p>“We were never going to catch that person with our console,” said Spencer. <br>So let’s find them in a way that works, and it’s better for <em>Indiana Jones</em>. It’s better for Xbox.”</p><p>If it wasn’t obvious before, this is the ultimate confirmation that the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/console-wars-are-over-ps5-xbox-forza-switch-2-sony-1851752956&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/console-wars-are-over-ps5-xbox-forza-switch-2-sony-1851752956">console wars have indeed ended.</a></span>&nbsp;</p><p>Nintendo doesn’t care anymore and just releases consoles whenever it works best for itself rather than trying to directly compete with the other big players in the space via powerful hardware. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-5-ps5-playstation-xbox-fans-react-angry-1851752763&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-5-ps5-playstation-xbox-fans-react-angry-1851752763">Xbox is happy to sell you a game on PS5 or Switch</a></span> or even just let you stream it via the cloud.

It also sees the return of loot boxes, updates to Overwatch 2's competitive mode, and more. You can see the full patch notes below.</p><p dir="ltr">The addition of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-injects-more-moba-energy-into-overwatch-2-with-new-perks-system/1100-6529410/" data-ref-id="1100-6529410">Perks is by far the biggest feature of Season 15</a>. There are basically no balance changes, aside from the game-altering addition of four perks for each hero. Over the course of a match, players will earn XP from dealing damage, earning eliminations, and healing allies. As players level up, they'll get to choose between one of two minor Perks at level two and one of two Major Perks at level three.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZR6lbjMFnk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mZR6lbjMFnk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Minor Perks augment existing abilities in smaller ways, while Major Perks are designed to be a game-changing moment that can massively change how an ability works or even grant a hero an entirely new one. Blizzard says the feature will add more player choice and strategy to matches. For a full breakdown of all the new Perk abilities for each hero, check out the patch notes at the bottom of this article.</p><p dir="ltr">As for other changes, Season 15 also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-is-bringing-back-loot-boxes-very-soon-with-some-changes/1100-6529450/" data-ref-id="1100-6529450">brings back loot boxes</a>, which can be earned through weekly challenges and the game's free and premium battle pass. They are not available for purchase separately. Players can earn three free loot boxes each week, with players getting a guaranteed Legendary item after opening 20 boxes and a guaranteed Epic item after opening five. At least one Rare item is guaranteed to drop in every loot box.</p><p dir="ltr">On the competitive side of the update is a rank reset, as well as the removal of two maps, Hanaoka and Throne of Anubis, from the rotation. Players can also earn new Galactic weapon skins with their competitive points.</p><p dir="ltr">Overwatch 2 Season 15's addition of Perks may be a big change, but an even bigger ones will be coming as part of Season 16 with the introduction of the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2s-round-based-stadium-mode-looks-to-reinvent-blizzards-shooter-in-a-big-way/1100-6529416/" data-ref-id="1100-6529416">third-person Stadium mode</a> and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-latest-hero-is-the-crossbow-wielding-bounty-hunter-freya/1100-6529451/" data-ref-id="1100-6529451">new hero, Freya</a>.

Warlock Ashe, Greek Gods skins, etc).</li><li>Custom ultimate lines are now enabled for several Mythic skins, with more to come in future patches.</li><li>Previously unused custom ultimate lines are now available for several other skins.</li></ul><p>Developer Comment: Going into Overwatch 2, we took into account player feedback that skin-specific ultimate lines from enemy heroes created gameplay difficulties for many players. As such, we restricted any custom hostile ultimate VO to special game modes, but we were not able to implement them into the broader game.</p><p>By changing the way we trigger ultimate voice lines, we can now play a player-specific custom line without affecting the line heard by enemy players. This means that we'll have much more flexibility for changing ultimate voice lines in the future.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Emotes</strong></p><ul><li>Emotes can now be cancelled mid-animation shortly after they are activated.</li></ul><h4>Introducing Perks</h4><p>Take your gameplay to the next level with Perks—Overwatch 2’s dynamic new mid-match upgrade system for Quickplay and Competitive. As the action heats up, unlock and choose game-changing abilities to amplify your hero’s power and evolve your strategy in real time. Adapt to every challenge, counter your enemies, and turn the tide of battle in your favor.</p><ul><li>Perks are now enabled in Quick Play and Competitive modes.</li></ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>How to gain Perk progress</strong></p><p>• Perk progress is gained by dealing damage, securing eliminations, and healing your allies. • Throughout the match, the rate at which you gain Perks will gradually increase. • When you eliminate an enemy who is at a higher perk level than you (full level), that elimination is also worth more Perk progress.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Swapping Heroes</strong></p><ul><li>When you swap heroes, your new hero will be set to level 1 with zero perk progress.</li><li>Your progress will be saved on any heroes that you play throughout the round though. So, if you played Tracer to Level 3 and got her Major Perk, when you switch back to Tracer you will be at Level 3 with your perks equipped.</li></ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>Selecting Perks</strong></p><p>There are multiple options available to select your perks into fit your personal play style.</p><ul><li>Standard Selection: Hold down Left Alt on keyboard or up on the directional pad for controller, then aim at the left or right perk or press your shoulder buttons on controller to select.</li><li>Quick Selection: You can also set your own bindings to select your perks without bringing up the Perk selection user interface, which is great for once you've really gotten your perks down and don't need the menu.</li><li>You can also bind your perk selection to be a toggle instead of holding by default.</li></ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>Celebrate In Our Perked-Up Event</strong></p><p>Celebrate the debut of Overwatch 2’s game-changing Perks system with the Perked Up Event, available all season long. Take on challenges to snag weekly rewards, including up to 10 Loot Boxes per week and Rainy Day Mercy! Plus, team up with the community via Twitch Drops and Support a Streamer to unlock Rainy Day Mei and Tracer. This limited time event runs from February 18 to April 22.</p><ul><li>For season 15 only, players can earn up to an additional 10 loot boxes each week by completing up to 15 games with wins counting as double.</li><li>Challenges for Loot Boxes reset every week, so any loot boxes not earned in that week are missed out.</li></ul><h4>Hero Perks</h4><p>Instead of hero balance updates, we're opening up Season 15 with adding Hero Perks to all 41 heroes. Our intention is to give you some time to adapt to such a large shift for the game, but we'll be monitoring to see if any perks need immediate tuning. So, check out each new perk and plan out new strategies and playstyles that can benefit your playstyle.</p><h4>Tanks</h4><h5>D.Va</h5><p dir="ltr">Bunny Stomp</p><ul><li>Call Mech's damage radius is increased by 50%.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Ejection Suit</p><ul><li>Eject grants 75 temporary overhealth.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Shield System</p><ul><li>Convert 150 health to shields.

                <p>Silksong, the highly anticipated sequel to Hollow Knight that has the player take control of the mysterious Hornet, has been removed from Nintendo's eShop. While the game is still listed on the PlayStation Store, Xbox, Steam, and the Nintendo eShop in the EU, the circumstances of why it was removed from Nintendo's North American eShop is a mystery.</p><p>A strong theory is that it's being moved to a Switch 2 launch and not outright canceled. Just last month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-developer-gives-hopeful-update-says-game-is-real/1100-6528905/" data-ref-id="1100-6528905">developer Team Cherry assured fans</a> that development was going smoothly and that the game would indeed be released at some point.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/griffinmatta/status/1880523110816051696" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Yes the game is real, progressing and will release. &lt;3</p>  — Matthew Griffin (@griffinmatta) <a href="https://twitter.com/griffinmatta/status/1880523110816051696?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 18, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>"Yes the game is real, progressing and will release," said Team Cherry marketing and publishing lead Matthew Griffin, in response to a fan asking about Hollow Knight: Silksong's development. Unfortunately, no other details were given. Since being announced six years ago, updates have been sparse and sporadic at best.</p><p>In fact, in 2022, Hollow Knight: Silksong won a "Most Anticipated Game" award from Unity. Team Cherry thanked the community for their support and said "It can't be too much longer, surely!" It won again last year but without any word from the developers.</p><p>Nintendo will be hosting a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-launch-date/1100-6528762/" data-ref-id="1100-6528762">Direct presentation on April 2</a> focusing on the Switch 2, so the game may make an appearance there.</p>

			<p>Relic Entertainment, the Vancouver-based developer behind games like the first two Homeworld, Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War, Company of Heroes, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/age-of-empires-iv-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Age of Empires IV</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sega-sells-relic-entertainment-cuts-another-240-jobs-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">returned</a> to independence last year after SEGA decided to sell it. Earlier this month, the developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/relic-entertainment-announces-ambitious-plans-for-the-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a roadmap for its future, including support of existing titles like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/company-of-heroes-3-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Company of Heroes 3</a> and the development of smaller titles.</p>
<p>Today, Relic unveiled Earth vs Mars, one of this new indie-style breed of games. These 'Relic Labs' games will allow the studio to explore new sub-genres, experiment, and release games more frequently. Earth vs Mars is a single player turn-based strategy game where a group of commanders must lead Earth's military as they face an overwhelming Martian invasion of high-tech saucers, grav tanks, and elite alien warriors in a battle for the survival of the planet.</p>
<p>Players have the opportunity to combine human "volunteers" with Earth creatures to create powerful hybrid super soldiers to fight alongside Earth's regular military. As they go through the campaign, new creatures, powerful unit upgrades, and game-changing commander abilities can be unlocked. But the enemy will evolve as well, deploying everything from the sentient organic weapon known only as The Creep to the Martians' own mutant creations.</p>
<p>Many of the units featured in Earth vs. Mars will have their own unique abilities, adding new strategies and gameplay depth to this style of play. There will also be multiple commanders in the game, each bringing passive and active abilities to enhance the way you play.</p>

<p>Earth vs Mars will feature an expansive, narrative-driven campaign consisting of over thirty hand-crafted missions. There's also a VS mode where players can fight against the AI on custom maps.</p>
<p>In online multiplayer, the game pits you against other commanders as either the armies of Earth or the forces of the Martian invaders. Moreover, a full-featured map editor allows players to create custom maps and scenarios. There's no release date yet, but you can wishlist the game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3269230/Earth_vs_Mars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a> right now.</p>
