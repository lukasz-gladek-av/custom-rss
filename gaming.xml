            <p>
Righto, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a> season 8 is starting next week, and today <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/blizzard">Blizzard</a> have <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24189530/combat-deception-in-season-8-belials-return">dropped a whole bunch of details on it</a> ahead of its release on April 29th, so let's see what they are! First up, there's that Belial guy who the season is named after. He's back, but his "motive is unknown", and you'll eventually be able to face off against him in a new quest which introduces a couple of new NPCs. That's all well and good, but the big thing this season is its new main mechanic, boss powers.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
These are abilities based on 24 bosses across Sanctuary, and they all come with a couple of effects, a main one and a modifier. One boss power is Avarice's Explosive Ore, the main ability allowing you to spawn a piece of ore when you acquire excess primary resource. After 2.5 seconds that ore blows up dealing a whopping 700% fire damage, so it sounds like these'll be pretty useful. Some powers can be acquired at any level, but a few of them you'll need to be Torment 1 or higher.
</p>

</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUlRtsPBg-w" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>
There's a new event on too, with Belial's "apparition monsters" showing up around Sanctuary. These apparitions pop up every few minutes so just have a walk about and I'm sure it'll be easy enough to take part. You can earn reputation from taking these guys down too, alongside any bosses you beat, which you can then exchange for "long-forgotten caches containing uncommon items" like Resplendent Spark and Hoard Keys. Lair bosses have had a big rework too, though the details for that are lengthy, so you can read that on the blogpost.
</p>
<p>
That <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/berserk">Berserk</a> collab that was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/diablo-4s-first-big-collab-is-berserk-yeah-ok-that-ones-pretty-good-i-guess">announced last week</a> has a release date now too, May 6th, and as detailed in a <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24189531/become-the-black-swordsman-with-diablo-iv-x-berserk">separate blog post</a>, it's just a cosmetics thing. Barbarian's will be able to dress up as Guts in his pretty iconic armour, whereas Rogue's will get the Hawk of Light and Struggler outfits (that first one being based on Griffith). 
</p>
<p>
Necromancers can also equip the Skull Night outfit, and there's a pet bundle which gives you that nose creature you've probably seen memes of. I've included his image below because if I had to see this, so did you. These cosmetics are only available until the end of season 8, so don't dilly dally if you're desperate to virtually cosplay.

Almost every chase card from 151 is cheaper as a single.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve been eyeing the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deals-for-april-22-2025">Scarlet &amp; Violet: 151 set</a> — one of the most nostalgia-fueled Pokémon TCG releases in years — chances are you’ve come across the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QpX010?object_uuid=b735faa7-3b50-473f-b54f-d56d0f7913ad&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">151 Booster Bundle on Amazon</a>. At $66.65 for just six packs, it might seem like a harmless splurge. But that price? It's more than double the MSRP.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A standard six-pack bundle should cost around $29.99 to $34.99, making Amazon’s markup not just steep, but straight-up bad value. Despite the flashy marketing and glowing reviews, there's no guarantee you’ll pull anything even close to worth that price. You’re basically paying premium for the privilege of disappointment.</p><p id="151-booster-bundle"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="151 Booster Bundle">Pokémon TCG 151 Booster Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="e029409f-0020-43ce-95ac-88650ab348d6" id="219043"><div id="219043" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet - 151 Booster Bundle</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Current pricing is over twice the MSRP</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The upside? Prices for singles from the 151 set are dropping fast. So instead of gambling on blind packs, you can pick up exactly the cards you want — from heavy hitters like Charizard ex to stunning collector pieces like the alt-art Pikachu — for way less.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re after nostalgia, go ahead and crack some packs from the wallet-busting 151 bundle. But if you're building a competitive deck or just chasing standout cards like Blastoise ex, the smart move is investing in singles. Sites like <a href="https://zdcs.link/zj4OA2?object_uuid=b735faa7-3b50-473f-b54f-d56d0f7913ad&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TCGplayer</a> offer great value, and buying directly means no dud pulls, no wasted cash, and just the cards you care about.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Best 151 Illustration Cards to Collect</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aoXAqe?object_uuid=b735faa7-3b50-473f-b54f-d56d0f7913ad&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Blastoise ex (200/165)</a> is currently the crown jewel of the 151 illustrated rares, and for good reason. Priced at about $66, it features a serene riverside scene of Blastoise at rest, a far cry from typical action poses. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The artwork feels more like a Ghibli frame than a trading card, which is why collectors are paying top dollar for it. It’s a grail card that you’d be extremely lucky to pull from a booster pack, let alone multiple copies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QWwV8d?object_uuid=b735faa7-3b50-473f-b54f-d56d0f7913ad&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Venusaur ex (198/165)</a> isn’t far behind. Retailing around $60, it showcases the Grass-type legend lounging among blooming flowers in a dreamy forest scene. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">These Illustration Rares are printed with unique texturing and alternate art styles, offering depth and color palettes that set them apart from standard ex cards. If your collection leans toward display-worthy art, this is an easy pickup.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there’s <a href="https://zdcs.link/QmX4qn?object_uuid=b735faa7-3b50-473f-b54f-d56d0f7913ad&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Charmander (168/165)</a>, a fan favorite that combines cuteness and nostalgia in one of the most beloved alt-art designs in recent memory. Despite its popularity, you can currently snag it for under $50, which is less than the price of the booster bundle and a far better emotional return than pulling a non-holo Caterpie.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Best 151 Cards for Competitive TCG Decks</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">While the illustrated rares turn heads, the set also includes powerful cards for players looking to improve their competitive decks. <a href="https://zdcs.link/aM6Zb4?object_uuid=b735faa7-3b50-473f-b54f-d56d0f7913ad&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Charizard ex (183/165)</a> can cause a massive 160 damage with just one fire energy thanks to Brave Wing, just make sure it gets knocked around a bit first. It’s one of the few viable Charizards in standard play and it’s only about $39 as a single card.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Blastoise ex (184/165) also deserves a second mention, not just as a collector card but a solid battlefield tank. Its Solid Shell passive reduces incoming damage and Twin Cannons can hit for 140 per Water energy discarded, making it lethal in the late game. And if you don’t need the full-art version, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QbxKqj?object_uuid=b735faa7-3b50-473f-b54f-d56d0f7913ad&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Alt Art ex is going for just $13</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, <a href="https://zdcs.link/98LXld?object_uuid=b735faa7-3b50-473f-b54f-d56d0f7913ad&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mew ex (193/165)</a> offers unmatched versatility. Its Restart ability gives you a once-per-turn card draw boost and its Genome Hacking attack can copy an opponent’s attacks with ease. That makes it ideal for control decks and rogue strategies. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For under $27, it’s a tactical addition that gives you flexibility without wrecking your wallet. <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxXDjO?object_uuid=b735faa7-3b50-473f-b54f-d56d0f7913ad&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mew ex - (205/165</a>) has the same moveset but is only $13.49 at the time of writing, so you can slide double the Mews into your Psychic deck for the same price.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

			<p>Today, following <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-will-be-officially-showcased-tomorrow-bethesda-announces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a series of increasingly intense rumors and leaks</a>, Bethesda has finally unveiled The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered. Bethesda's Todd Howard explained what the original game meant when it launched in 2006 and then introduced a series of developers who discussed the improvements of the new version, which are rather extensive.</p>
<p>The game's visuals runs on the latest version of Unreal Engine 5, which gives it a massively improved look over the original, but the underlying logic still runs on the Gamebryo engine. However, there have been improvements in several areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>HUD, menu, and map reworks</li>
<li>Improved UI for systems like Persuasion, Clairvoyance, and more</li>
<li>Modifications to levelling, encumbrance, non-combat perks, and other mechanics</li>
<li>Improved enemy scaling</li>
<li>Enhanced accessibility features</li>
<li>Additional autosaves</li>
<li>Revised first-person and third-person camera</li>
<li>Improved combat feedback and controller support</li>
</ul>
<p><iframe title="The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered - Official Reveal" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kk5cymSWmqo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>To top it all off came the confirmation that, as rumored, the game is available now on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. It's also on Game Pass, as you'd expect from a Bethesda game. If you're not a subscriber, you can purchase the regular edition for $49.99 or the Deluxe Edition for $59.99, which comes with some new content, specifically new quests for unique Akatosh and Mehrunes Dagon armors, weapons, and horse armor sets, as well as the following DLCs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fighter’s Stronghold expansion</li>
<li>Spell Tome Treasures, Vile Lair</li>
<li>Mehrune’s Razor</li>
<li>The Thieves Den</li>
<li>Wizard’s Tower</li>
<li>Orrery</li>
<li>Horse Pack Armor</li>
</ul>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Oblivion_Minotaur-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered Deluxe Edition also comes with the two big original expansions, Knights of the Nine and Shivering Isles, both of which are quite large (especially the latter). Last but not least, you can find the official PC system requirements below. The game's size is around 120GB, again <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-file-size-massive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirming the earlier leak</a>.</p>

			<p>Six games added support for NVIDIA's DLSS Super Resolution today, NVIDIA <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/dlss-4-multi-frame-gen-steel-seed/">announced</a>. The complete list includes <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-will-be-available-in-steel-seed/">Steel Seed</a>, which launched with support for DLSS 4 Mult-Frame Generation, Tempest Rising, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-talos-principle-reawakened-i-know-im-a-person-but-not-a-genius/">The Talos Principle: Reawakened</a>, RuneScape: Dragonwilds, Commandos: Origins, and the upcoming title Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.</p>
<p>Clair Obscur and Commandos: Origins will launch with support for DLSS Super Resolution, while support will be added to Tempest Rising, The Talos Principle: Reawakened, and Runescape: Dragonwilds. Those titles will also add support for NVIDIA's DLSS Frame Generation.</p>
<p>While GeForce RTX 50 Series owners will be the ones able to take advantage of all the features within NVIDIA's DLSS advances, so long as you have a graphics card with performance to spare, you can enable DLAA on The Talos Principle: Reawakened, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, and RuneScape: Dragonwilds.</p>
<p>Clair Obscur is launching later this week, but Steel Seed arrived today on PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PS5. Developed by Storm in a Teacup, Steel Seed is an action-adventure game that already looks incredible, and will be able to run even better if you're able to utilize all the features confirmed today from NVIDIA.</p>
<p>In our review of Steel Seed, which was played on PC, we said,</p>
<p>"<em>Steel Seed is not going to win any awards for innovation, but a game doesn't always need to be innovative to be engaging. While the vast majority of the game's core features have already been seen, when put together, they deliver a solid experience that fans of games like Uncharted and the Star Wars Jedi series will surely enjoy. Just don't expect to find deep combat, character customization, or anything too advanced: the game is all about Zoe's journey into the mysterious world she finds herself thrown into, and every game mechanic is at the service of this story, for better or worse.</em>"</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-released</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-is-out-now-surprise-surprise.1170405/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-released<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Well, it's finally out there. Bethesda and Virtuos have finally revealed&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-oblivion-remake-images-seemingly-leaked" rel="nofollow">surprising absolutely nobody</a>, and as you'd expect, it comes complete with a full visual overhaul and more improvements.</p>

<p>Bethesda's Todd Howard says the goal with&nbsp;<em>Oblivion Remastered&nbsp;</em>is to keep the core of the game the same while updating its visuals and performance for the modern era. Howard says he still wants&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>to feel like a game "of its time", and Virtuos says the original game is "still the heart and soul" of&nbsp;<em>Remastered</em>.</p>

<p><em>Oblivion Remastered&nbsp;</em>is built in Unreal Engine 5, but the original&nbsp;<em>Oblivion</em>'s engine is still a key part of the game experience. With that said, the game's UI and UX have been improved, and "features and systems across the board" have been updated.</p>

<p>(IMAGE)</p>

<p>New character models and environments have been created for the remaster, and a new real-time lighting system "accurately simulates how light interacts with the environment". Additionally, new lip-sync technology makes the characters look a lot more real (although that's not tough when it comes to&nbsp;<em>Oblivion</em>, admittedly).</p>

<p><em>Oblivion Remastered&nbsp;</em>will also sport a brand new levelling system that's apparently inspired by both the original&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>and the system found in&nbsp;<em>Skyrim</em>, and combat has been improved too, with new effects and models giving it a greater sense of physicality.</p>

<p>New lines of dialogue have been recorded for the project as well, but you'll still recognize many of your favorite lines from the original, including the iconic "Stop! You violated the law!" of which the guards are so very fond.</p>

<p>Much of&nbsp;<em>Oblivion</em>, including minigames, core storylines, and more, has been left intact, so if this is your first time in Cyrodiil, you'll get something fairly close to what it would have felt like to play the original back in 2006.</p>




<p><em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered&nbsp;</em>is out today on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. The game is also available as part of Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass (but not Standard).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/649795/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Bethesda is making <em>The</em> <em>Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em> official just days after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/648877/oblivion-remaster-images-leaked-microsoft">the game leaked</a>. <em>Oblivion Remastered</em> is a remaster of the nearly 20-year-old game, developed by Virtuous. <em><a href="https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net/en-US/oblivion-remastered">Oblivion Remastered</a></em> is shadow dropping today, and it’s available on <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2623190%2FThe_Elder_Scrolls_IV_Oblivion_Remastered%2F" rel="sponsored">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/UP1003-PPSA21203_00-ALTARDELUXEED000/">PS5</a>, and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Fthe-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered%2F9NQR437K7PQH%2F0010" rel="sponsored">Xbox Series X / S</a> right now for $49.99, or as part of Xbox Game Pass.</p><p>“<em>Oblivion </em>was a real defining moment in the series and for how we make games as a studio,” says Todd Howard, studio head of Bethesda. The remastered version of <em>Oblivion</em> has overhauled graphics for modern hardware, and includes the <em>Knights of the Nine</em> and <em>Shivering Isles</em> expansions.</p><p>While the naming suggests this is a remaster of the original game, developer Virtuous has actually fully remade the title in Unreal Engine 5. Virtuous has produced several comparisons between the game’s original 2006 release to <em>Oblivion Remastered</em>, and the differences are huge. Every single asset in the game was remade and created from scratch, and the game has a lot more realistic shadows.</p><p>There’s even a big improvement to the lip sync parts of the game, thanks to the latest technologies in Unreal Engine 5. Gameplay has also been modernized, with audio, UI, and leveling systems all updated. The new leveling system is “the best of both worlds” of <em>Skyrim</em> and <em>Oblivion</em>, and there have also been modifications to encumbrance, non-combat perks, and other mechanics.</p><p>Bethesda and Virtuous have even modernized and updated the third-person view in <em>Oblivion </em>and added sprinting to the game. There are improved UI for systems like Persuasion and Clairvoyance, as well as HUD, menu, and map reworks and improved enemy scaling. All characters have updated animations as a result of these big changes.</p><p>“We’ve modernized a lot, but it’s still the same incredible adventure and the same carefully crafted world,” says Tom Mustaine, Bethesda’s external projects and studio director, during a reveal stream.</p><p>Bethesda is also releasing <em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered Deluxe Edition</em>, which includes bonus quests, unique armor, weapon, and horse armor sets, a digital artbook, and the official soundtrack.</p><p>Rumors of an <em>Oblivion </em>remaster <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/19/23880132/microsoft-ftc-documents-leak-oblivion-fallout-3-remaster-doom-xbox">originally appeared in 2023</a>, thanks to documents in the FTC’s case against Microsoft’s Activision Blizzard acquisition. An unannounced <em>Fallout 3</em> remaster and another game in the <em>Dishonored</em> franchise were also part of Microsoft’s documents.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Years after it was first leaked, and following weeks of increasingly loud rumours, Bethesda have finally shown off a trailer for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a> remaster. It looks very shiny, and has a few new cogs under the hood. More importantly, it's out now.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>First of all, here's the trailer.</p>

<p>It's £50 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2623190/The_Elder_Scrolls_IV_Oblivion_Remastered/">on Steam</a>. A showcase of the game that aired alongside the trailer saw various developers talking over some of the biggest changes. This includes the ability to sprint, and a new levelling system described as a blend between Oblivion and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>, which presumably replaces the divisive level scaling of the original.</p>
<p>On top of that there's a new lip-syncing system that lets the funny puppets talk better, and some re-recorded dialogue lines to better fit all the fantasy races like Khajiit and Argonians. There's also a modernied third-person perspective (no more roller-skating up the mountainside). And all the assets have been remade, clearly, with real-time lighting, a heap of fresh VFX, a redesigned user interface, and new sound effects. </p>
<p>Other stuff remains mostly untouched. The lockpicking minigames and speechcraft persuasion has been left alone, we're told, apart from a visual redesign.</p>
<p>The open world fantasy RPG has been rebuilt in Unreal Engine 5 by Virtuos, a support studio that handles a lot of different production jobs for various companies. They've been working on it alongside Bethesda's own studios. Despite all the assets being totally re-constructed using Unreal, the game is still running on some version of Bethesda's original Creation engine, we're told.</p>

<p>The remaster's existence has been a badly kept secret since 2023, when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dishonored-3-plus-fallout-3-and-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remasters-appear-on-leaked-microsoft-doc">leaked Microsoft documents</a> were spotted in during a court case, naming the game alongside <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a> 3 and a possible remake or remaster of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-3">Fallout 3</a>. More recently, various leakers and rumourmongers started getting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-official-elder-scrolls-oblivion-remake-will-release-as-soon-as-next-month-claims-report">increasingly solid information</a> about the game, such as how its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elder-scrolls-4-oblivions-rumoured-unreal-engine-remake-has-a-new-take-on-stealth-stamina-and-blocking-say-rumours">stamina and stealth will be reworked</a>. They also predicted it would be released in tandem with its announcement, you know, as a treat. </p>
<p>We'll be playing to find out just how much of a remaster it truly is. I'm interested to see how much of Oblivion's old-school charm is lost when you refurbish it and strip out what we today see as jank. Does it still crash zoom into a guard's face with alarming alacrity when you are apprehended for stealing an apple? Old games rebuilt can go either way for me. I found the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-2">Resident Evil 2</a> remake a faithful adaptation that played with an old space in both clever and silly ways. But the recent Tomb Raider remasters made both me and Katherine sad with their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tomb-raider-iv-vi-remastered-review">HD textures</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tomb-raider-1-3-remastereds-modern-controls-are-an-absolute-travesty">wonky controls</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It would later be overshadowed by 2011's <em>Skyrim</em>, but <em>Oblivion </em>has never been truly forgotten by the millions of people who sunk far too many hours into it on their Xbox 360 consoles. And now <em>Oblivion</em> is back with new visuals and other gameplay improvements. </p><p>On April 22, during a livestream dedicated to the remaster, Bethesda and developer Virtuous said they wanted to keep <em>Oblivion</em>’s<em> </em>“old charm” but wanted to evolve the RPG to bring new people into it. The original <em>Oblivion</em> is still “the heart and soul” of the remaster, but Unreal Engine is used for all the visuals. Faces look better. It makes use of modern real-time lighting techniques. It looks great, and much better than some of the early leaks led me to fear it might. </p><p>It’s not just visuals that have been remastered. Bethesda says the game’s UI, audio, and even how you level up your character have seen revisions. Combat animations have been improved. Enemies will react to hits in more specific and dramatic ways and sparks fly when swords clash. <em>Oblivion </em>now has sprint. But one thing that hasn’t changed is that the classic lockpicking and dialogue mini-games are still here. </p><p> Bethesda has also added new voices for the different races in the game, but have left in all of the weird and silly lines that people remember. Don’t worry, “Cheese for everyone!” is still in there. Bethesda also confirmed the remaster includes all DLC and expansions.</p><p><em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em> is out now on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC. The game costs $50, but there is a deluxe digital edition that includes some extra cosmetics and quests and costs $60. </p><p>It’s taken a while to reach today’s big livestream reveal and for Bethesda to finally confirm the worst-kept secret in video games. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.xfire.com/remake-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-in-development-virtuos-games/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.xfire.com/remake-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-in-development-virtuos-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In 2023, a Reddit user</a></span> was the first to share details about an <em>Oblivion </em>remake.

		<p>The long-rumoured <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion">The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion</a> remaster has been revealed, and it’s out today for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC, and with ‘day one’ tiers of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a> as well.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered - Official Reveal" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kk5cymSWmqo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>So, what do we think of that? While Skyrim is easily the biggest and best-selling entry in the long-running RPG franchise, there’s plenty out there that prefer Morrowind or Oblivion, making these earlier games ripe for a graphical remake treatment. With Oblivion now in a much more modern game engine, the hazy bloom effects that were so popular in the early days of the Xbox 360 have been dropped, and there’s more realistic and nuanced lighting being cast across significantly more detailed, revamped environments.</p>
<p>The game is now graphically running on Unreal Engine 5, but the original Oblivion engine is still running in the background to tell it what to do. According to Virtuos, every single asset has been remade by hand, and there’s a new lighting engine. The gameplay has also been tweaked, there’s updated UI and UX, and a new levelling system inspired by both Oblivion and Skyrim. They have also reworked the third person view and made it more modern, as well as adding sprinting, something that was not present in the original game.&nbsp; Each race has had their audio re-recorded so they all sound different but the mini-games such as lock picking remain unchanged, albeit with new graphics.</p>
<p>Both standard and deluxe editions of the game are available, with The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Deluxe Edition including bonuses like extra weapons and horse armour – a nod to the infamous horse armour DLC for the original game. The standard game includes all the expansions including The Shivering Isles.</p>

<p>The game has been developed in collaboration with Bethesda Dallas and Bethesda Rockville working alongside Virtuos. Unfortunately for Bethesda, this external partner was the source of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/15/the-elder-scrolls-oblivion-remake-screenshots-leak-from-developer-website/">last week’s blowout leak</a>. Sure, this had been reported on ever since it was mentioned in unredacted court documents a few years ago, but last week saw enterprising internet denizens find a batch of Oblivion remake images uploaded publicly to the backend of the Virtuos website. They include screenshots of the game, comparison shots between this version of the game and the 2006 original, and more, and were hastily copied across to other hosting platforms before Virtuos could pull their site offline.</p>
<p>So, who are Virtuos? Originally founded in Shanghai and now headquartered in Singapore, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtuos">Virtuos</a> is a huge company with thousands of employees and teams dotted around the world. The company has often provided co-development support on major projects, such as art for the Horizon series and co-dev for the upcoming Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, as well as a variety of ports and remaster projects big and small. Oblivion could be their most notable work yet, and with the game so close to being in our hands, it will be fascinating to see how it has come together and how closely it sticks to or diverges from the original.</p>

It was a brutal scene and a controversial choice in <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, but a lot of people who watch the show never touched the games and aren’t tuned into online video game discussions enough to have caught wind of this moment. So even though Abby essentially voiced her intentions directly to the audience in episode one, newcomers may have had some hope that this would be a season-long conflict that Joel might survive, rather than one that would see him taken out just two episodes into the season.</p><p>Newcomers are in shambles and posting their reactions online. After sitting with this grief for five years, I eat this shit up. I love re-experiencing the crash-out vicariously through others. By the time <em>The Last of Us Part II</em> was over, I was at peace with it and understood why the story had put us through this. The TV show is extending the game’s story <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-max-show-part-2-season-3-4-ellie-abby-1851521708&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-max-show-part-2-season-3-4-ellie-abby-1851521708">across multiple seasons</a></span>, so it might take some time before viewers get that same closure, but for now, they get to sit with all this grief, and I’m lapping up their reactions.</p><p>If you or a loved one has been personally victimized by <em>The Last of Us </em>season two, there are steps you can take to mitigate any further harm. Please remove all golf paraphernalia from your home, keep your old acoustic guitars in their cases and out of sight, and hide all instances of Pearl Jam from your Spotify playlists.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Bethesda has finally lifted the lid on The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered, shown off its shiny new gameplay - and launched it to play now. 
</p>
<p>
In a video posted this afternoon, we've got our first official look at the new Oblivion after weeks of leaks, blurry screenshots and other teases of information. 
</p>
<p>
Oblivion has been remade by port developer Virtuos' Paris studio, in collaboration with Bethesda, and this new version is a ground-up remake built in Unreal Engine 5, designed to run at 4K 60fps.

<p>Oblivion Remake includes story expansions The Shivering Isles and The Knights of the Nine, as well as various other bits and pieces from the previous Remastered edition: the Fighter's Stronghold expansion, Spell Tome Treasures, Vile Lair, Mehrune's Razor, The Thieves Den, Wizard's Tower, Orrery, and Horse Pack Armour.</p>
<p>You can purchase it now for PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2623190/The_Elder_Scrolls_IV_Oblivion_Remastered/">Steam</a> and the <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9nqr437k7pqh?hl=en-gb&amp;gl=US">Microsoft Store</a>, on <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/UP1003-PPSA21203_00-ALTARDELUXEED000/">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-gb/games/store/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered/9nqr437k7pqh">Xbox Series X/S</a>.

<p>The Deluxe Edition includes "new quests for unique Akatosh and Mehrunes Dagon armour, weapons and horse armour sets", because of course, plus access to an artbook and soundtrack app.</p>
<p>Changes include a refreshed levelling system inspired by Skyrim, additional dialogue (including unique voices for the game's various races) and more modern controls - including sprinting, which Bethesda says was something the team debated over adding, but ultimately decided was required in a modern game.</p>

<p>On PC, you'll need 125GB of storage, and 16GB RAM to run the game. Minimum specs suggest you'll want an AMD Ryzen 5 2600X or Intel Core i7-6800K processor and either an AMD Radeon RX5700 or Nvidia GeForce 1070 Ti graphics card.</p>
<p>Recommended specs ask for 32GB RAM, an AMD Ryzen 5 3600X or Intel Core i5-10600K processor, and either an AMD Radeon RX 6800XT or Nvidia RTX 2080 graphics card.</p>
<p>"Obviously we're working on the sixth chapter here," Bethesda boss <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/todd-howard">Todd Howard</a> said in today's video, "but what's great about The Elder Scrolls is being able to look back at all of the chapters: Skyrim, Morrowind, Oblivion, Daggerfall, Arena. Each of them try to define role-playing games and open-world games for their generation.
</p>
<p>"Oblivion was a real defining moment in the series and how we make games as a studio."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The closed alpha for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> is soon due to roll out to players who signed up, meaning Bungie's colourful futuristic servers are warming up. Sadly, we weren't invited - the alpha is only open to North Americans. But, aha, something went awry today and the game became available to play early for those on Xbox. And one quick-witted player streamed a full hour of the game before the servers clamped shut once again. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>Twitch user "bomberboyz130" began streaming the shooter today, after Bungie accidentally granted players on Xbox the ability to play too early. He played a handful of matches, most of them on a relatively small map called "Perimeter", getting into PvE scrapes with guard bots and robo-bugs before eventually escaping the map with some loot. He plays as a couple of the classes, including the tanky shield deploying Locus, and the smoke-bombing Void who can don stealth camouflage for a sure-to-be-nerfed 15 seconds. You can <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2439585018">watch him play on Twitch</a> if you're so inclined.</p>
<p>The stream lasted over an hour until the servers went down and bomberboyz was booted out from even the menus. There were jokes in the chat about Bungie's death squads coming out of the woodwork to shut everything down and presumably put him in a big neon plastic bodybag (alpha players signed a non-disclosure agreement) but according to the developer this was all down to a technical cock-up that they've now corrected.</p>
<p>"We have fixed an issue where some Xbox players were able to access the Closed Alpha Playtest early," said Bungie on the game's official server. "All players with Closed Alpha access will be able to join on April 23 at 10AM Pacific."</p>
<p>So yeah, hopefully nobody needs to disappear. Not a soul here at RPS has had their hands on the game so far, like I say, but from this footage it seems in line with previews I've read. It appears to trek head-bobbingly down all the well-trodden extraction shooter paths, albeit with Bungie's chunky triggerfeels. It reminds me as much of battle royale <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> as it does <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/escape-from-tarkov">Escape From Tarkov</a>. The RPS treehouse is split as to whether the art style is eye-catching and cool or plastic and dull. </p>
<p>Marathon is due out September 23rd this year. It was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-are-rebooting-marathon-as-a-pvp-focused-loot-shooter">announced in 2023</a> as a PvP reboot of Bungie's classic FPS for Macs. But its development has been troubled thanks to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/destiny-creators-bungie-lay-off-220-people-and-form-new-studio-within-sony-to-stave-off-financial-ruin">brutal layoffs</a> and a messy spat resulting from the game's former director being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-replace-marathon-director-amid-reports-of-creative-leadership-shake-up">forced to step aside</a> over <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/these-are-the-text-messages-that-allegedly-got-a-former-bungie-executive-fired-according-to-a-court-document-written-by-sony">misconduct allegations</a>. Bungie eventually broke a long silence surrounding the game to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marathon-is-real-looks-ridiculously-stylish-has-a-release-date-and-is-getting-a-closed-alpha-this-month">reveal what it actually looked like</a> earlier this month. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Subtitle and background customization adds 11 new colors to help with dialogue visibility, and a fully customizable high-contrast mode will also help distinguish the HUD and UI from the rest of the game.</p><p> There’s also UI narration and my personal favorite tweak: audio cues for helping players locate the game’s 240 collectibles. The option to auto-complete quick-time events has been made available in all difficulty modes as well, not just while playing on easy. It’s a nice suite of accessibility upgrades and follows a trend of Sony using next-gen ports and remasters to modernize gameplay customization features and introduce quality-of-life improvements across some of its older games. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/days-gone-remastered-coming-to-ps5-in-april-1851762060?_gl=1*frsg3j*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NTMyODQxMC4xMjAuMS4xNzQ1MzMxNjM4LjQ0LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/days-gone-remastered-coming-to-ps5-in-april-1851762060?_gl=1*frsg3j*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NTMyODQxMC4xMjAuMS4xNzQ1MzMxNjM4LjQ0LjAuMA..">The new version of<em> Days Gone</em></a></span> is $50, but anyone who has the game already can upgrade for $10. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance developer Warhorse hasn't announced any future projects, but game director Daniel Vavra has ideas. He said in an interview that he has "a couple of projects" in mind that could, he estimates, have "as big potential as Kingdom Come: Deliverance." The developer added that he's hopeful the "AI revolution" gets here soon so he can make more games before retiring.</p><p>Vavra didn't go into detail on what these ideas might be, but he did tell <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-director" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a> that he hopes the "AI revolution" can help him and his staff make games faster. He said new AI technologies will not replace human developers but will help them build faster.</p><p>"It really annoys me that the games take so much time, because I have more ideas than I have time," he said. "There are a couple of projects that I would love to do. And I would love to prepare them properly, so it's not as chaotic. I hope that the AI revolution will help with this, where in the future we will not be replaced by AI, but we will be helped by AI. So a lot of the things could get easier and faster."</p><p>A recent study found that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/study-finds-majority-of-game-dev-companies-use-generative-ai-already-despite-worker-concerns/1100-6528919/" data-ref-id="1100-6528919">most developers worldwide are already using AI technologies</a> to help make games, despite concerns from workers about it. It's not immediately clear if AI was used in the development of Kingdom Come: Deliverance II.</p><p>While Vavra isn't ready to discuss any new projects from Warhorse, he did dig into the state of the AAA gaming market, saying publishers are understandably risk-averse when they fund a game for $200 million. Instead, he said it might be smart to relatively make smaller bets on games with $50 million budgets, so that some could flop but others that might succeed could make up the difference.</p><p>"So being faster, cheaper, and with more risk would probably could solve some of those issues," he said.</p><p>He also mentioned how the recent wave of mass layoffs in the video game industry might "clean the waters" and help inspire people to come up with new creative ideas. "Hopefully some people who lost the spirit because of how industry works will return or start new companies, and do new stuff. I would really welcome some fresh air and new stuff," he said.</p><p>Whatever Warhorse makes next, it'll likely be made under Warhorse owner Embracer. Vavra said Embracer has not been affected by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/embracer-ceo-says-he-deserves-criticism-after-mass-layoffs-and-game-cancellations/1100-6522874/" data-ref-id="1100-6522874">Embracer's deep cuts in recent times</a>, noting that Embracer gives Warhorse "a lot of trust."</p><p>"There was almost zero outside influence on the creative decisions on the game. Which is great if it works, and when you are not insane. I understand that the corporation wants to have some control over the final product when it invests a lot of money, but generally we had a lot of freedom and it worked," he said.</p><p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II launched in February and has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-studio-reports-its-approaching-2-million-sales/1100-6529486/" data-ref-id="1100-6529486">sold more than 2 million copies</a>, in addition to <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earning strong reviews.</a> The game has multiple paid expansions planned for 2025, but fans don't have to wait for something new, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-patch-1-2-4-brings-hardcore-mode-to-the-medieval-rpg/1100-6530882/" data-ref-id="1100-6530882">a Hardcore mode was just recently added.</a></p>

L-l-l-lava. Ch-ch-ch-chicken. Steve's Lava Chicken is tasty as hell. 
</p>
<p>
And with that, you've heard a good portion of the lyrics to A Minecraft Movie's latest viral sensation - Steve's Lava Chicken -  which has now entered the UK's official music chart.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, at 34 seconds long, the track is the shortest ever entry in the official UK top 40, according to the UK's <a href="https://x.com/ERALTD/status/1914607904235147588">Digital Entertainment and Retail Association</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/steves-lava-chicken-from-a-minecraft-movie-the-shortest-song-ever-to-debut-on-uks-official-chart">IGN</a>).

The ditty, not suitable for vegetarians, explains what happens when you add lava to a chicken in Minecraft. In A Minecraft Movie, Jack Black's Steve sings the refrain as he cooks a chicken, to the nonplussed reactions of the rest of the cast.
</p>
<p>
In real life, well, this is Jack Black being wheeled out to perform another viral movie moment, just a couple of years after Jack Black's Bowser went viral for Peaches, his song in The Super Mario Bros. Movie. (At 95 seconds, you get more than double the Jack Black in that one.)

After another weekend in cinemas, A Minecraft Movie is edging closer to The Super Mario Bros. Movie's overall box office record, too. The film, which also stars Jason Momoa and Emma Myers, has now passed $720m (£538m) worldwide, with Mario's total of $1.3bn (£970m) in its sights.
</p>
<p>
A Minecraft Movie may not have impressed critics, but fans have flocked to the film to see its meme-worthy antics, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movies-viral-chicken-jockey-moment-is-causing-chaos-in-cinemas">including its now-infamous Chicken Jockey scene</a> that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-now-shows-warning-following-disruptive-chicken-jockey-trend">cinemas have asked kids to stop going feral</a> while watching.
</p>
<p>A sequel now seems assured, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-sequel-discussions-are-already-happening">director Jared Hess has already discussed what he thinks A Minecraft Movie 2's focus will be</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/final-girl-series-1-ultimate-box-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>You've been doing your best to save the others, but through luck or just pure stupidity, they just kept getting themselves killed, and now you're the only one left. You've collected some gear as best you can, but now it's time to face whatever has been hunting you. Only one of you will leave. You are the final girl.</em></p>

<p><em>Final Girl</em>, by Van Ryder Games, was an acclaimed Kickstarter launched in 2020, based on their already successful <em>Hostage Negotiator</em>&nbsp;system. Since its release, it's had 2 more Kickstarters, each combined into a series of releases. In this review, we will look at the <em>Final Girl</em> Series 1 Ultimate Box, which incorporates everything from Series 1 available at retail into a single handy storage box. We'll look at how to play <em>Final Girl</em>, what's in the Ultimate Box, and what our favorite parts of it are.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-girl-series-1-ultimate-box-2.jpg?itok=mV0vQxpG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-girl-series-1-ultimate-box-2.jpg?itok=Fsajw-KV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>To play&nbsp;<em>Final Girl</em> you need to combine the Core Box with any Feature Film box.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Rules To Survive A Horror Movie</h2>

<p><i>Final Girl</i>&nbsp;is a modular system that begins with the <em>Final Girl</em> Core Box, which has the core rules and components. To play, a core box is combined with a feature film box, like Happy Trails Horror or Slaughter in the Groves. These feature film boxes include a unique killer, a unique location, and 2 final girls to choose from, which can all be mixed and matched with other feature film boxes in any combination of final girl, location, and killer to diversify your games as your collection expands.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-girl-series-1-ultimate-box-3.jpg?itok=sD7nOB_Z 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-girl-series-1-ultimate-box-3.jpg?itok=8v1aItRX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You can combine any <em>Final Girl&nbsp;</em>location board, with any killer from any set.</figcaption></figure><p>The game itself is designed for solo play only, and while there are a lot of elements to track, it follows a simple flow that means it's hard to get something wrong or miss an element, even in your early games. The core of the gameplay revolves around action cards, which your final girl can play each turn. These allow your final girl to move, collect, and try to save victims, search for useful items which give bonuses to other actions, or attack the killer. To take an action, you play the card and make a horror roll. The number of dice rolled for the action is determined by the horror track, and each action card has 3 possible results, varying from failure, which usually has bad consequences, a single success, or a double success.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-girl-series-1-ultimate-box-4.jpg?itok=pBGzfCxh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-girl-series-1-ultimate-box-4.jpg?itok=Pe1YXzBj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>During your turn in&nbsp;<em>Final Girl</em>&nbsp;you use action cards and make horror rolls using the custom dice.</figcaption></figure><p>The result of the horror roll against the action card shows how far the final girl can move, how many items you get when searching, or how much damage you can deal. The results for failing can be the final girl taking damage, the horror level rising, which means you roll fewer dice in future horror rolls, losing time, which can end your turn when the track reaches 0, or simply ending your turn immediately.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-girl-series-1-ultimate-box-5.jpg?itok=lKheYlnH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-girl-series-1-ultimate-box-5.jpg?itok=FYQkrzmH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The killer in&nbsp;<em>Final Girl</em> acts each turn with a set action and a random action from a terror card.</figcaption></figure><p>After the action phase, the killer acts with a predetermined action on their killer card, and also with a random action drawn from the terror deck. The killer will generally pick a target, either a victim or the final girl, and move and attack them. Every time the killer takes out a victim, they become more powerful, eventually unlocking a dark power. The final girl can also unlock an ultimate ability by saving victims, and saving victims also means there are fewer on the location map for the killer to attack and power themselves up.</p>

<p>Each killer and location has a unique feel, with cards specific for them with some randomization for location setup, items, the finale, and the killer's dark power, which offers some variety game to game, even with the same box. This, combined with the 2 final girls in each box, means you will get a lot of replayability.</p>

<p>The <em>Final Girl</em> Series 1 Ultimate Box contains a huge amount of content. We'll detail here what each item contains and talk about our favorite products from the Ultimate Box below.</p>

<p>The <em>Final Girl</em> Core Box contains the core components you will use from game to game, including the rulebook, action cards for the final girls, tokens, and meeples for victims, the killer (which can be replaced by the killer miniatures in the Ultimate Box) and final girl (which can also be replaced by the miniatures in the Ultimate Box). It also contains a player board and some thick cards for holding areas (which can be replaced by the higher-quality game mats in the Ultimate Box).</p>

<p>The Ultimate Box contains 5 feature film boxes, for a total of 5 locations, 5 killers, and 10 final girls (with 2 additional final girls and another killer we detail below) that can all be mixed and matched between sets. Each box also contains miniatures for the killer, to upgrade from the token in the core box and vehicles (that you can access with cards in the item and event decks), to upgrade from the tokens included in each feature film box. We'll discuss each feature film box below.</p>

<p><strong><em>Final Girl</em>: Happy Trails Horror</strong></p>

<p>Happy Trails Horror features Camp Happy Trails as the location, a lakeside area that also has a boat as an item. Hans is the killer here, a sledgehammer-wielding maniac with a pig mask. The final girls are Laurie and Reiko, whose ultimate abilities are combat-focused to take the fight to the killer.</p>

<p><strong><em>Final Girl</em>: Haunting of Creech Manor</strong></p>

<p>Haunting of Creech Manor includes Creech Manor as the location, a spooky 5-floor house with a helicopter that might appear as an event item. The Poltergeist is the killer here, and the players have to find and save a young girl named Carolyn from it. Alice and Selena are the final girls. For their ultimate abilities, Selena gets a bonus to search actions, and Alice gets to choose a specific action card that always rolls maximum dice.</p>

<p><strong><em>Final Girl</em>: Slaughter in the Groves</strong></p>

<p>The Sacred Groves are the location for Slaughter in the Groves, and they are haunted by Inkanyamba the Avenger. When using this location and killer, players also track Divine Wrath and Killer Wrath, which have additional effects on the game as they try to take out the killer. The final girls are Adelaide and Barbara. As their ultimate abilities, Adelaide gets to choose from 3 immediate effects, which gives her great flexibility depending on the situation, and Barbara, who can bring victims with her into the killer's space and sacrifice them to boost her damage.</p>

<p><strong><em>Final Girl</em>: Carnage at the Carnival</strong></p>

<p>Carnage at the Carnival takes place at the Carnival of Blood, a trap-filled location where you can find a golf buggy as part of an event. Geppetto, the puppet master, is the killer and is upgraded with puppet miniatures to replace the tokens in the box as part of the Ultimate Box. The final girls are Asami, who's ultimate makes her immune to traps and can choose between 2 item cards when she draws 1, and Charlie, who for their ultimate, can take 3 damage to draw the Critical Blow action card for a risky finsher against the killer.</p>

<p><strong><em>Final Girl</em>: Frightmare on Maple Lane</strong></p>

<p>Frightmare on Maple Lane has Maple Lane as its location, a group of houses around a suburban intersection. It features a bike as an item card and a police car miniature for an event. The killer here is Dr Fright, and games against him take place on the game board when you're awake, and in the boiler room when you're asleep. The final girls are Nancy, who, as her ultimate, can swap out her final health token with another when she takes normal damage, and Sheila, who, for their ultimate, gains 2 time when discarding action cards for time.</p>

<p>The game mat bundle includes 2 neoprene game mats that have space for all the game areas, including the killer and location boards, horror and time track, and card deck areas, and comes in a thematic VCR-style box.</p>

<p>Along with the Feature and Core boxes, the Ultimate Box includes 2 other sets, the first is the Bonus Features Box, which includes several books:</p>

<ul><li><em>Final Girl</em>: S1 Feature Films Rulebook&nbsp;- This handy book features all the killer and location looseleaf rules inserts from each of the Series 1 feature films, along with some achievement sheets for each.</li>
	<li><em>Final Girl</em>: S1 Gruesome Death Books - These 5&nbsp;books for each location contain gruesome details of kills for each terror card and some general death details, for each of the series 1 killers across all locations.</li>
	<li><em>Final Girl</em>: Lore Book Series 1 - The lore book contains background details for all of the series 1 killers and final girls, along with some detailed setup for some linked scenario games</li>
</ul><h4><em>Final Girl</em>: S1 Cast and Crew Box</h4>

<p>The other bonus set in the Ultimate Box is the The Series 1 Cast and Crew, which is a handy storage box for some additional components, and to gather up all the final girl stat cards and their secret envelopes (which you can open for a bonus card once you complete a game with that final girl). The box also contains:</p>

<ul><li><em>Final Girl </em>Miniatures - All of the killer miniatures are housed in their respective feature film boxes, but all of the final girl miniatures are here.</li>
	<li><em>Final Girl</em>: Terror From Above (vignette) - This fantastic little box contains a killer (the birds!) but doesn't include a specific location (and as with all killers, can be used with any location you wish). It also includes a new final girl (who also has a miniature in this box), Melanie, whose ultimate allows her to take damage to deal 2 damage divided as you choose to enemies in your space (handy for dealing with birds).</li>
	<li><em>Final Girl</em>: Birds Miniatures Pack - These miniatures replace the tokens in the Terror from Above vignette pack.</li>
	<li><em>Final Girl</em>: Paula Promo Card - Paula is an additional final girl (who doesn't have a miniature here, but has a miniature&nbsp;included in a larger miniatures promo pack in the Series 3 Ultimate Box). This card allows you to play&nbsp;Paula Deming of YouTube&nbsp;Things Get Dicey fame.</li>
</ul><h2>Horror Movie Death Tropes</h2>

<p>The <em>Final Girl</em> Series 1 Ultimate Box has a huge amount of content and replayability, but a few things stood out to me. Dr Fright and Maple Lane from&nbsp;Frightmare on Maple Lane are my favorite killer and location in this box. Both feel insanely thematic and capture the movie series (Nightmare on Elm Street) that they're based on very well. I tended to use the final girls from each box while playing the scenarios they came with, purely so I could get a feel for that box experience, but if I had to pick a favorite final girl, it would probably be Reiko for her combat prowess.</p>

<p>The Terror From Above and&nbsp;Lore Book Series 1 also stand out. Terror From Above for how simply and thematically well it captures the terror of bird attacks (you should also feel compelled to play Melanie in the scenario too, as she's rad), and the linked scenarios in the Lore book are my only way to play after a taster game for each killer and location. The setup and additional background for each scenario bring an already detailed experience to life, and when combined with the Grusome Deaths books, incredible.</p>



<p>If you've read the whole article above, you'll know I'm a huge fan of <em>Final Girl</em> and the sheer depth the Series 1 Ultimate Box gives you, but for a solo board game, the box is an investment, even for the sheer volume of content it gives you. If you've already tried <em>Final Girl </em>and love it, and solo gaming is your thing, then have at it, the sheer replayability you'll get out of this box is amazing. But if you've never tried it, it might be worth picking up the Core Box and a feature film to test the experience first, and either picking up all the elements separately once you know you're in, or trading them in, and picking up the Ultimate Box once you're sure.</p>

<p>Each of the feature films in the Ultimate Box is a great experience, and captures the theme very well, but when combined with the lore and scenarios book, the miniatures, and the gruesome deaths books, it all comes together to create the perfect horror gaming experience.</p>
