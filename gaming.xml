            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-23-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has announced the <i>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</i>Version 2.3 release date, and the latest update for the turn-based gacha RPG is launching later this month.</p>
<p>Titled "Farewell Penacony", the update will <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-22-release-date">follow on from May's Version 2.2</a>&nbsp;and will launch on June 19th. It'll see the crew of the Astral Express soaring into the skies above Penacony to board the Radiant Feldspar and watch the Family try to fix its issues.</p>
<p>The Trailblaze Mission in Version 2.3 will revolve around "crucial Family discussions", but the Radiant Feldspar has other delights to offer as well, including a new Origami Birds minigame and gameplay improvements courtesy of Mr. Screwllum's new "Divergent Universe" project.</p>

<p>The first, Jade, is a Quantum-type character with a unique "Debt Collector" mechanic. She can appoint one of her party members as her Debt Collector, and any attack launched by Jade or her designated Collector charges a meter. Once that meter is full, Jade launches an additional attack against all enemies.</p>
<p>The second five-star character in&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 2.3 is Firefly, who can summon her SAM armor in battle. You'll even get an internal perspective within the mech's cockpit, which is a pretty impressive extra.</p>
<p>Two extra five-star characters will also make a return in Version 2.3. You'll get another chance to grab <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-introduces-ruan-mei-new-5-star-character-coming-in-version-16">Ruan Mei</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-shows-argenti-and-zenless-zone-zero-unveils-nicole-in-hoyoverse-double">Argenti</a>, who will reappear during the first and second halves of the update, respectively.</p>

<p><em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>is a free-to-play turn-based gacha RPG from HoYoverse, the creator of&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-announced-genshin-impact-devs-hoyoverse">upcoming&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero</em></a>.</p>
<p>Like&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact</em>,&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>revolves around building teams and discovering synergies for effective combat strategies, but since the combat is turn-based, you'll need to have your thinking cap on rather than your reflex hat.</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>for free right now on <a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/honkai-star-rail/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and mobile devices.</p>

            <p>
Civilization 7 has seemingly leaked ahead of a possible reveal this weekend.
</p>
<p>
A banner for the game was spotted on the 2K website and shared on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1da8hse/civilization_vii_banner_up_early_in_2k_website/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Reddit</a> and <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/civilization-vii-leaked-in-2k-games-website.892344/">Resetera</a>, though has since been removed. The banner is little more than a logo, so no further details about the game are known.
</p>
<p>
Last month <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/2k-to-reveal-new-game-in-one-of-its-biggest-and-most-beloved-franchises-next-month">2K stated it would reveal a new game</a> in one of its "biggest and most beloved" franchises, causing fans to speculate.

<p>
Some believed a new Borderlands was on the way, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-acquires-borderlands-studio-gearbox-from-embracer-for-460m">Gearbox was acquired by Take-Two Interactive</a> from Embracer. Plus, there's the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-film-first-look-shows-red-haired-cate-blanchett-staring-into-a-manhole">Borderlands film</a> due out in August this year.

</p>
<p>
Another possible reveal was a new Mafia game, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mafia-3-developer-confirms-new-mafia-development">Mafia 3 developer Hangar 13 confirming work was underway</a> back in August 2022.

</p>
<p>
Others thought a new BioShock would be on the way, since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-in-development-at-new-2k-studio-cloud-chamber">2K confirmed a game was in development</a> years back.

</p>
<p>
Now, though, it seems these guesses were incorrect and Civilization is likely the planned reveal.
</p>
<p>
The sixth game in the Civilization series released in 2016, so it's been some time since the strategy game series made headlines.
</p>
<p>
Civ 6 was well-received, so expectations will be high for the seventh. "Civ 6 harnesses the series' great strengths and adds wonderful new features of its own in an accessible and compelling entry," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/civilization-6-review">Eurogamer Civilization 6 review</a>.

		<p><em>Over the last week, </em>Remap<em> turned one. It's shocking to realize it's been a full year since Waypoint imploded, but it was also amazing that </em>Waypoint<em> even managed to survive nearly seven years under </em>VICE<em>. But </em>Waypoint<em> arrived into a media environment that was very different from the current one. Tons of media jobs are going away, and it's unclear how many are coming back. None of us got into this line of work wanting to run a business, yet suddenly, here we are!</em></p><p><em>Is that a good thing? Is that a bad thing? How do we create pipelines for new talent? What does it mean to scale a business like this? Rob and Patrick don't have all the answers, but one year into </em>Remap<em>, they're trying to figure it out.</em></p><hr><p><strong>Rob:</strong> It’s hard to overstate how bleak I find the prospect of Ziff-Davis-owned IGN buying up all the Gamer Network websites. <em>Rock, Paper, Shotgun </em>was a formative website for me, probably the last site I read truly religiously before embarking on this as a career. <em>Eurogamer</em> has maintained the highest quality bar for consumer reviews I’ve seen in games, an accomplishment I’ve come to appreciate more having been on both sides of the editing and writing dynamic. It was hard to imagine that those websites would not be seriously diminished under Ziff management, and of course within an hour of the news breaking we saw <em>GI.biz</em>’s Brendan Sinclair and <em>RPS</em>’s Alice Bell posting that they had been laid-off. It was probably the fastest I have ever seen an acquisition transform into the process of throwing people out of their jobs.</p><p>As you always see around stories like this, you see a lot of folks wondering what they can do and talking about the importance of supporting independent outlets, or subscriber-supported media. Obviously as someone in that line of work, I’m always happy to see people have that impulse. It’s cool that people want to know how they can help at a time when we are daily witnessing the hollowing-out of media.</p><p>But I always feel a bit uncomfortable when I see people saying stuff like, “...and that’s why people should support places like <em>Remap</em>!” the face of layoffs like this. Because much as I’d like to pretend otherwise, I know how far we are from being able to replicate a fraction of what an <em>IGN</em>, or a <em>Eurogamer</em>, or even an <em>RPS </em>can do.</p><p><em>Remap </em>is three people plus some contractors and contributors, all of whom do work that almost immediately turns into outcomes that our audience can see. If I were feeling grandiose I’d say that it’s a "lean operation" where every penny goes to pay or gets reinvested in the business. However, that would be masking another reality: <em>Remap </em>does not have a ton of <em>capacity</em>. The reason we operate this way is because we don’t have the kind of margins where we can pay for work and time that doesn’t translate into some kind of immediate output. That’s not because the audience is putting us under any real pressure to deliver, but because we mostly have enough on our hands doing a handful of podcasts and streams a week, plus the odd article. When we are recording, there is no other work getting done at <em>Remap</em>. If we are investing time in looking at one game release for the podcast that week, that means there’s a bunch of others that are necessarily being ignored. To deliver any kind of meaningful journalistic or critical coverage of the industry would require having enough people available to get a lot of work done in parallel to the main stuff <em>Remap </em>does. And by the way, that kind of work is harder and frequently more time intensive.</p><p>That's where scale becomes a real challenge in subscriber-supported journalism. It’s not like it’d be “double the size of <em>Remap</em>” or “increase <em>Remap</em>’s freelance budget.” Covering an industry as a reporter is not a thing that can be done very easily on a part-time or piece-by-piece commission basis. It’s a job where someone is tasked with research and reporting every day, and that work might not generate a good story out of it for weeks, months, or ever. A lot of that work results in answers to questions about minutiae that aren’t of interest outside a fraction of the audience… but it’s important work that also enables more ambitious and widely-read pieces of journalism. Ditto a reviews desk: even if you’re relying a lot on strong freelance contributors, planning, coordinating, and editing all that coverage is a full-time job at minimum. Probably it’s more than a single full-time job to take it from “viable” to “good.”</p><figure><figcaption><span>The future if Remap gets ten thousand new subscribers. Don't worry about what happens later in the movie. Doesn't this look like fun?</span></figcaption></figure><p>If I tell people to subscribe to <em>Remap</em>, I’m optimistically hoping for some good linear growth. If we got a hundred new subscribers last month, it’d be truly <em>amazing</em> to get a hundred and ten this month. That would be an astonishing growth trend for a company like ours! But to replicate the functions of a major games website, we’d be talking about <em>thousands</em> of new subscribers funding something where it won’t always be obvious what their money is buying. “Hey thanks for subscribing, you’ve enabled us to have a reporter go beat their heads against walls five days a week, and an expensive legal insurance policy to let them actually write something, plus there’s now an accountant you’ll never hear about doing expense tracking so nobody ever has to interact with Concur, the Wage Theft Legalization Software.”</p><p>That’s a hard sell! It’s such a hard sell that it basically explains why all this stuff has historically depended on the ad model. In a nutshell, good journalism and criticism depends on people doing a lot of work that most people appreciate in the abstract or the aggregate, but would rarely purchase directly. Making the jump from “hey support this handful of creators” to “support this expensive and increasingly abstract enterprise” feels like going from building a biplane to landing on the moon for a business like ours.</p><p><strong>Patrick: </strong>I recently hosted a panel at Northwestern University, and at the end, I was chatting with a few folks who were trying to pursue jobs in games media. I found myself at a complete loss at what to describe as their path forward. “Simply be like me and spend 20+ years gaining knowledge, experience, and fans who will then pay you to continue working” is not a viable option. Go on YouTube, I guess? It’s probably the most realistic answer, because it’s probably where the future of most games commentary is headed.&nbsp;</p><p>But is commentary and analysis the same as being a member of the media? Am I just an elitist? Probably.</p><p>When the latest round of media layoffs were happening in the leadup to our own, I tried to calm my nerves with a sense of history, a history you and I have experienced over the decades. This has happened before, this will happen again. Layoffs are brutal but cyclical. People love games, so there will be publications to cover games. And that’s probably still true in the most basic senses, but in what form?&nbsp;</p><p>I don't even know what a “website” is anymore. We spent money to build one, but we’re slowly waiting for <em>VICE </em>to delete <em>Waypoint</em>’s history from the internet. The function of a website in the past was to, hopefully, become a homepage for someone. Ours is functionally an archive. I think it’s possible for us to track how often people are visiting the website, but I haven’t looked at any of that data since we launched the website. But I have to admit one of my favorite tiny little joys every day is going into our database, publishing articles for the podcasts and articles and videos we’ve done, and arranging the promotional wheel at the top. Our work is scattered across so many places because that’s just how modern media publishing works, but it’s so satisfying to see it arranged nearly. It helps me more fully appreciate our work.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Rosalind Russell in His Girl Friday</span></figcaption></figure><p>People still think of me as a reporter, I think, but the “Scoops” nickname is less and less applicable these days, because I simply do not have the bandwidth to do meaningful reporting. I still like talking to game developers, I still like unpacking the creative process. I like to think that my time in the industry has given me some insight that’s useful on Remap Radio. I do not know if the interviews we publish on the podcast are everyone’s favorite thing that we do, but it makes me really happy, and lets me pretend I’m still living in a world where reporting, my bread and butter, is also paying the bills, and so I can live with the difference.&nbsp;</p><p>I think that’s what comes to mind when I work through these meta trends, though. For all the faults of mega sites like <em>IGN</em>, <em>GameSpot</em>, and the like, they provided opportunities for new writers to learn the craft and go elsewhere. That “elsewhere” might not have even been in games journalism, but applying the lessons of writing and communication “elsewhere” in video games. We can pay freelancers and contractors good rates, but at our current scale, it's hard to be a proper funnel for the next generation of critics.</p><p>We're not the only ones in this space and maybe some of our peers have better answers to the questions around expansion. But from my perspective, outlets like ours are like life rafts to help maintain an identity that, thankfully, some find important. But that also makes it hard to grow. </p>

<p id="H5K0Uv">The silhouette of the Imperial-class Star Destroyer is an iconic part of the Star Wars franchise and an unmistakable symbol of the Galactic Empire’s reign of terror across the galaxy. The latest version of the Star Destroyer isn’t nearly as massive as some older models, with just 1,555 pieces, but it’s far more affordable. Launching Aug. 1, the $159.99 version is available to pre-order from <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=13923&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fproduct%2Fimperial-star-destroyer-75394" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?u1=[]pl[p]23935473[m]m-placeholder[s]s-placeholder[t]w[c]c-placeholder[r]r-placeholder[d]d-placeholder\u0026id=nOD/rLJHOac\u0026mid=13923\u0026murl=https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/imperial-star-destroyer-75394&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:72,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:2,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;u1&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;u1&quot;:&quot;[]pl[p]23935473[m]m-placeholder[s]s-placeholder[t]w[c]c-placeholder[r]r-placeholder[d]d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;nOD/rLJHOac&quot;,&quot;mid&quot;:&quot;13923&quot;,&quot;murl&quot;:&quot;https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/imperial-star-destroyer-75394&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">Lego</a>. </p>

<p id="GejVwt">Weighing in with just 1,082 pieces, the Lego AT-TE walker is the smaller, Clone Wars-era predecessor to the AT-AT. It may be a fraction of the size of the massive AT-AT replica, but the AT-TE still features plenty of neat details like a modeled cockpit and an array of pivoting turrets.

<p id="KNT8Kv">This is the sixth iteration of Luke Skywalker’s Red Five X-Wing, and it’s Lego’s largest and most detailed version of the fabled starfighter. The 1,949-piece model measures 21.5 inches in length, making it more than seven times the size of the original 263-piece set that came out in 1999.

<p>Slitterhead’s gameplay trailer has leaked online ahead of the official announcement at Summer Game Fest.</p>



<p>The trailer, which was accidentally made public on the developer’s YouTube channel, has since been made private. However, Twitter user @HazzadorGamin had managed to download it before the mistake was realized. You can see the trailer below:</p>

</div></figure>



<p>According to the trailer, Slitterhead is set to launch on November 8, 2024 on the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X and PC (via Epic Games Store). </p>



<p>Bokeh Game Studio first announced Slitterhead during The Game Awards 2021, with a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyUGYL9aSww" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">very brief teaser trailer</a>.</p>



<p>Slitterhead is the upcoming game from Keiichiro Toyama and Bokeh Game Studio. Toyama has been an industry giant for decades, and fans widely recognize them for creating Silent Hill.</p>

The tease instantly got fans speculating on the possibilities, with many wondering whether BioShock 4 would finally be revealed after a five year wait. Others suggested it might be Mafia 4 or Borderlands 4. It seems likely now that the tease is related to Civilization 7.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">2K plans to reveal the next iteration in one of 2K's biggest and most beloved franchises at <a href="https://twitter.com/summergamefest?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@SummerGameFest</a> on Friday, June 7. <a href="https://t.co/1vyFXE2N4z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/1vyFXE2N4z</a></p>— Summer Game Fest (@summergamefest) <a href="https://twitter.com/summergamefest/status/1791201250521825718?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 16, 2024</a></blockquote> <p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vi">Sid Meier's Civilization 6</a> was developed by Firaxis Games and published by 2K on PC in 2016, before ports for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, and mobile were released. IGN's <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/26/sid-meiers-civilization-vi-review">Civ 6 review</a> returned a 9.4. We said: "Civilization 6 is fully loaded with features and makes some very smart changes to its winning 4X strategy formula."</p><p>Given the game’s enormous popularity (Civ 6 remains in the top 20 most-played games on Steam and the franchise has sold an impressive 71 million copies to date), a seventh entry in the long-running series was inevitable. Indeed, in February last year <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/next-civilization-game-officially-announced-by-firaxis">Firaxis announced it was working on the next mainline Civ</a>, although it didn't call it Civ 7 at the time.</p><p>That’s all we have to go on for now, with more sure to be revealed during Summer Game Fest.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/06/07/5-mega-man-game-boy-titles-added-to-nintendo-switch-online<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text" typeof="schema:Article"><p>Given Mega Man’s enormous presence on classic Nintendo consoles, it’s surprising that the only game available on the Nintendo Switch Online libraries has been Mega Man: The Wily Wars…for Sega Genesis. That has been remedied somewhat thanks to the addition of five Game Boy titles starring the Blue Bomber.</p>

<p>Right now, Switch Online subscribers can enjoy the following Game Boy titles:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Mega Man: Dr. Wily’s Revenge</li>
	<li>Mega Man II</li>
	<li>Mega Man III</li>
	<li>Mega Man IV</li>
	<li>Mega Man V</li>
</ul>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yVbuHPyM3VA" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>For those unaware, the Game Boy series of Mega Man aren’t just ports of their NES counterparts. Rather, they’re a separate series of original games and are differentiated by the titles’ use of Roman numerals instead of numbers. You can more or less think of them as Mega Man’s versions of the Super Mario Land series, and while they feature their own plots, levels, and bosses, they incorporate some mechanics and enemies from the NES entries. While these aren’t the original NES games fans likely would have hoped for, it’s cool to have the lesser-known Game Boy titles accessible on modern hardware.&nbsp;</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/summer-games-fest-website-geoff-keighley-taco</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/whoever-owns-the-%E2%80%9Csummergamesfest%E2%80%9D-url-has-spent-years-doing-the-lord%E2%80%99s-work.892467/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/summer-games-fest-website-geoff-keighley-taco<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We’ve done this bit upwards of one million times here on Aftermath dot site, but it should be called Summer <em>Games </em>Fest, not Summer Game Fest. There’s more than one game! “Games” is more natural from a grammatical standpoint! As a result of this awkward lack of pluralization, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24159269/summer-game-fest-games-title-plural-why" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">many people mispronounce the name</a> of Geoff Keighley’s summer showcase, which, as it turns out, also extends to typing out its URL. And that, friends, is where the fun begins.&nbsp;</p><p>See, Keighley and company do not own summergamesfest.com. It’s unclear who does – only that they nabbed it via GoDaddy in May 2020 and will retain control until at least May 2025 – but they’ve been having a heck of a time with it. Dropping the URL <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200801000000*/summergamesfest.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">into the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine</a> shows that it initially played host to an image of a plate of cheese puffs and a Dorito-orange taco shell with a hotdog in it.&nbsp;</p><p>This is perhaps a reference to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lost-humanity-18-a-table-of-doritos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an infamous picture of Keighley</a> from 2012 in which he’s staring into the camera like a painting whose eyes never move but somehow follow you no matter where you are in a room, flanked on one side by Doritos and Mountain Dew and on the other by a Doritos-and-Mountain-Dew-branded Master Chief banner. At the time, this became a notorious meme. Keighley had yet to ascend to his rarified status of Guy Who Handles All Video Game Announcements and instead straddled the line between games journalist and PR mouthpiece, with the sweaty stink of the Spike TV Game Awards also emanating from his general direction. People didn’t know what to make of him, but they knew they felt weird about him. This image encapsulated all of that. A supposed journalist nearly drowning in product placement seems quaint compared to today’s endless parade of YouTubers who get paid directly by companies to hawk games and products, but back in 2012, this got Keighley branded as the “<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/dorito-pope" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dorito Pope</a>,” a dusty, orange stain he only managed to shed once The Game Awards took off.&nbsp;</p><p>Or it could just be an image of cheese puffs and a hotdog taco.</p><p>Over the course of the past four years, people have accidentally stumbled onto summergamesfest.com, only to leave both <a href="https://x.com/ProcyonViolet/status/1258428329004347392" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">amused</a> and <a href="https://x.com/HarrisFoster/status/1402985869439500295" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confused</a>. Others have respected the domain squatter’s commitment to the bit.</p><p>“Whoever hosts http://summergamesfest.com is a legend,” <a href="https://x.com/PSN_ElectricDC/status/1534892025992077314" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a> one frequenter of the site in 2022, “because the hotdog taco and cheese puffs are still there, and they have brilliantly chosen not to sell their domain to SGF all for the sake of a somewhat mediocre meme.”</p><p>But that’s not all summergamesfest.com has been used for over the years. In summer of 2020, it briefly redirected to a New York Magazine article titled “<a href="https://nymag.com/strategist/article/where-to-donate-for-black-lives-matter.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">142 Ways to Donate in Support of Black Lives and Communities of Color</a>” (the article has since been updated with an additional 26 ways). It then reverted to the cheese puff image, adding text that read "WELCOME BACK TOO THE PARTY, FREIND" at some point in either 2020 or 2021.&nbsp;</p><p>As of this writing, the domain’s owner is again using it for activism, this time in support of Palestine. The URL currently redirects to <a href="https://donate.unrwa.org/gaza/~my-donation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a page</a> from the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) that allows you to donate money in support of Gazans enduring and escaping Israel's assault.</p><p>It does not appear that the owner of the domain has publicly revealed their identity, but more power to them. And if they ever do decide they want to come forward, well, my contact info is below.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/best-games/22948034/steam-deck-best-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="AEA9fw">Since it launched in 2022, the Steam Deck has quickly amassed a reputation as one of the best, if not <em>the</em> best, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22949326/steam-deckreview-pc-gaming-portable">handheld gaming platforms</a> on the market today— especially when considering the benefits of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23950861/steam-deck-oled-review-valve-handheld-gaming">OLED version</a>.</p>
<p id="DNMol4">With a library of games spanning much of Steam’s vast storefront, a docking station to play games on TV and monitors, and an increasing number of titles being optimized and verified for the Deck every day, Valve’s proprietary handheld is a perfect example of the viability and promise of portable PC gaming. That’s why we’ve collected 26 titles that showcase what makes the Steam Deck so special.</p>
<p id="C3O5cs">To curate the list, we’ve pick games that benefit the most from the Steam Deck’s special features. You will find PC exclusives, Switch games that benefit here from faster load times, and games that break apart nicely into short sessions.</p>
<p id="nnkfX6">Don’t expect to see some presumed contenders on the list. Not every game is compatible with the Steam Deck, nor is every genre a perfect match — we’re looking at you, RTS games. And for now, this list also excludes emulation and cloud streaming.</p>
<p id="JvJsjU">We intentionally limit our lists to avoid overwhelming readers, so be sure to share your personal picks that didn’t make the cut in the comments.</p>
<p id="y7hgpe">Our latest update added <em>Animal Well</em>,<em> I Was a Teenage Exocolonist</em>, and <em>Stardew Valley</em>.</p>

<p id="roHVqx">For at least a few of the games on this list — like, say, <em>Elden Ring</em> — you’re going to mess with the game’s settings on Steam Deck in order to make sure you’ve got a decent frame rate and the game feels good to play. Not a concern at all for <em>Animal Well</em>, a pixel-art masterpiece that feels like it could’ve been at home on the Game Boy. With a file size of just 33 MB, it sure won’t take long to install, either. But <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24151337/animal-well-review-pc-ps5-switch"><em>Animal Well</em></a> packs quite a bit of mystery and time-intensive puzzle-solving into its very small package. What starts off as a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24156522/animal-well-metroidvania-not">compelling Metroidvania</a> soon spirals into an extensive Easter egg hunt with items hidden behind delightfully esoteric clues. You may as well play it on the go, since it’s going to take over your brain for a while and you’re carrying that around with you already. —<em>Maddy Myers</em></p>

<p id="3m0Q9F">Last weekend, on a whim, I booted up <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/4/6/11372562/hyper-light-drifter-review-PC"><em>Hyper Light Drifter</em></a> on my Steam Deck for the first time since playing it back in 2016. Nine hours later, I finally managed to wrest myself from the siren-like call of its pixelated tableaus, blistering combat, and melancholic score, having completed it again and earned the game’s secret ending. Such is the magnetic appeal and power of Heart Machine’s debut even eight years after its release. </p>
<p id="avpNKH">Game director Alx Preston and co. set out to create a 16-bit action-RPG that channeled the very best elements of the Legend of Zelda and Diablo series, with a story not so much told as it is <em>felt</em> through its dialogue-less cutscenes that play out as if they were fugue-like visions of some doomed alternate universe. <em>Hyper Light Drifter</em> achieved all of that and more, coalescing into an action-RPG that stands the test of time. <em>—Toussaint Egan</em></p>

<p id="V83Pck">The Yakuza series spans hundreds of hours across seven mainline entries, along with a handful of spinoffs. Which is to say, the portable Steam Deck provides the best chance at seeing the entirety of this Japanese gangster epic, especially in the form of short missions on lunch breaks. If you don’t have time for every game, or just need a place to start, we recommend <em>Yakuza 0</em>. A sort of prequel to the series, the adventure takes place in 1980s Japan and provides lots of colorful backstories. Don’t be fooled by all of the violent combat and seedy locales; this series (and especially this entry) has more heart and joy than 99% of games from big-budget publishers. Hero Kazuma Kiryu wants to make the world a better place, one city block at a time. <em>—Chris Plante</em></p>

<p id="A6HQqi">There are few mobile gaming experiences as serene and enthralling as <em>Dave the Diver</em>. Dave dives not just to collect fish and cooking materials for the sushi restaurant he staffs every night, but to uncover ancient secrets. Regardless of your objective, navigating the deep feels like a blend between Animal Crossing and a roguelike, where you’re amassing better tools to uncover what (and who) is lurking in the depths.</p>
<p id="3F6uT6"><em>Dave the Diver</em> is a family-friendly game (if you can look past small clouds of blood when you harpoon a fish) that is startlingly good at blending many game genres in one. You swim; manage a restaurant; farm fish, veggies and more; and are solely responsible for reversing a climate change-inducing threat under the sea. And on the Steam Deck, it’s so much easier to fit in just one more dive session. <em>—Cameron Faulkner</em></p>

<p id="5ET32I">You might not expect <em>Dredge</em> to feel at home on the Steam Deck at first glance, but it totally does. This haunted seafaring adventure tests the protagonist’s psyche, and the gameplay loop is perfect for quick pick-up, put-down sessions. Not to mention, it’s a lot of fun being set free to fish, solve mysteries, and complete objectives before the sun goes down. And if you dare, dredge the depths after dark for some spooky surprises. <em>—CF</em></p>

<p id="v7f9wX">Part coming-of-age visual novel, part exploration-heavy sci-fi RPG, part poker-esque card game, <em>I Was a Teenage Exocolonist </em>is a brilliantly captivating game that you’ll want to play again and again (and again). You take on the role of a young kid in Earth’s first planetary colony, and follow their life on a strange new alien planet over the course of 10 years. Every activity you pick impacts your personal journey and the relationships you make — and also plays a huge role in the future of the planet.</p>
<p id="ktqmtE">What really makes <em>I Was a Teenage Exocolonist</em> so compelling is the replayability — finishing a playthrough gives you knowledge that you take through to the next, allowing you to make different (and possibly better!) decisions. For instance, there’s a character who dies very early on in the first playthrough that can’t be saved at all. Their death haunts that first run.</p>
<p id="cOL6tF">But in the second one, you can save them because you have a hunch as to how things will go. It’s a game that invites you to play through another round and another and another — just to see if you can get it <em>all</em> right this time (or make things go horribly wrong! Or crack the secret as to <em>why</em> you’re living these lives over and over again!). —<em>Petrana Radulovic</em></p>

<p id="wvPtwU">My love for the Star Fox series has evaporated with each new entry, to the point that I began to wonder if I ever really enjoyed those games or if I just liked chunky ’90s 3D graphics. <em>Ex-Zodiac</em>’s creators have done what Nintendo couldn’t for the past couple of decades: bottle the original magic of the space flight franchise and add just enough tweaks to make the adventure palatable for our collective evolved tastes. (Hey, video games have come a long way since the SNES!) Developer MNKY also created bonus levels inspired by other retro classics, like <em>Space Harrier</em>, emphasizing its knack for refueling once exciting genres that have spent way too long collecting dust in the garage. <em>—CP</em></p>

<p id="UL9oUd">Stray is a game about being a cat. You don’t talk like Garfield or wink at the camera like Bubsy. You stretch, scratch, and occasionally leap between ledges at perilous heights. Your cat participates in a harrowing adventure set in a dystopian, cyberpunk underworld in which robots echo the lives of their long-dead human counterparts. But most engagement happens on your behalf through an adorable, English-speaking, artificially intelligent drone named B-12. The game’s creators keep your cat’s direct involvement ambiguous. Is the cat the savior of a dying planet? Or is the cat just a cat who happens to be the incidental shepherd of historic change? Like I said, typical cat stuff. <em>—CP</em></p>

<p id="6DRNT1">There’s a reason <em>Stardew Valley</em> is still so beloved after eight years: It’s just damn good. The latest big update adds so much to the already robust game, fleshing out Pelican Town and its inhabitants. It’s not just farming, but mining, fishing, foraging, and getting to know all the townspeople (and possibly marrying them). Rebuild your little community and get really invested in perfecting your farm’s layout! Or travel to the deepest, darkest levels of the mines. Or just spend a <em>lot</em> of time fishing.</p>
<p id="pWmA3u">There’s just <em>so</em> much to do in <em>Stardew Valley</em>. It’s clear to see why this game revitalized the farming sim genre and why every farming sim these days wants to be just like it (with a twist). —<em>PR</em></p>

<p id="jzABe1">I am proud of the work we do at Polygon, but every publication has its weaknesses. I’ve accepted that we’re not the go-to experts for old-school side-scrolling shooters and shmups. That honor goes to our pals at Eurogamer, specifically Martin Robinson, who I trust more with this genre than I do any pundit with American politics. When he proclaimed <em>Drainus</em> is “<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/drainus-review-the-most-spectacular-side-scrolling-shooter-since-gradius-5">the most spectacular side-scrolling shooter since <em>Gradius 5</em></a>,” I had to give it a try. Is it the best? I said I’m not an expert. But I can say, with confidence, it’s been a blast on Steam Deck, a delicious digestif after hours in a modern open-world game, and an unusually accommodating entry point for a notoriously impenetrable genre. <em>—CP</em></p>

I mean, I could write more reasons you should play this game, but let’s be real — either you have played a version of <em>Final Fantasy 7</em> already or you’ve been told countless times to bump this one up your queue.

<p id="BSR44u">Meet the Steam Deck’s killer app. It’s not perfect — I play on low settings and occasionally experience frame rate dips — but <em>Elden Ring</em> works, and that’s all I need to farm souls (er, “runes”) in FromSoftware’s open-world expansion of its Dark Souls formula. This is <em>the game</em> that has kept me awake past midnight. I promise myself that I’ll stop once I see what’s at the end of a moss-lined cave or over a burning horizon, but then I see some new curiosity, and suddenly, I’m pummeling my way through another dungeon. The convenience of a portable device turns what I meant to be a 15-minute grind session into a two-hour journey through a labyrinthine dungeon. <em>—CP</em></p>

<p id="RNBCHu">So you’ve dropped half a grand on a portable video game machine capable of powering the most complex and expensive 3D video games on the planet. Now prepare to burn dozens of hours on a $2.99 2D dungeon crawler that nearly plays itself. <em>Vampire Survivors</em> is the unholy union of clickers, roguelikes, and Gauntlet. Runs take 10-30 minutes and pair well with an audiobook or podcast. The developers have discovered the formula for a perfect portable game, but for the time being, you can’t find this one on Switch or smartphones. <em>—CP</em></p>

<p id="PuQG0N"><em>Jusant</em> has been my go-to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23843388/jusant-dont-nod-climbing-preview">chill-out game of choice</a> this year, and I can’t imagine playing it on anything other than the Steam Deck. The post-apocalyptic fantasy climbing game from French developer Don’t Nod (<em>Life Is Strange</em>) has a lot going for it: a mysterious and compelling world with beautiful art design, a moving orchestral music score, and tight controls that are easy to learn and gratifying to master.</p>
<p id="klLxrw">It’s that last point that makes the Steam Deck my preferred platform of choice to play <em>Jusant</em>. The satisfying sound and haptic feedback of the Deck’s left and right triggers makes the challenge of climbing the cliff faces of the game’s impossibly vast and looming tower as painless and pleasing as possible, and the visual and sound quality of the Deck is terrific at rendering the gorgeous vistas and ambient soundscapes of the world. If you’re looking for a relaxing yet exciting adventure game experience that plays great on the Steam Deck, this is the one to play. <em>—TE</em></p>

<p id="ySyznG">The best place to play <em>Dragon Quest 11</em> has changed over the years. The JRPG to end all JRPGs first launched in 2018 on Steam and PlayStation 4, only to be bested a year later by a Definitive Edition for Nintendo Switch, which included additional content and could be played on the go. The Definitive Edition then came to Steam in 2020, but, of course, it lacked the portability of the Switch version, forcing players to choose between visuals and convenience. With the Steam Deck, folks can now have it both ways. <em>—CP</em></p>

<p id="eDIVXL">My blurb for Polygon’s best games of the 2010s applies to why <em>Nier: Automata</em> belongs on every Steam Deck:</p>
<blockquote><p id="1pk1He"><em>Nier: Automata</em> is the game I most often find myself wanting to play instead of the many fine-but-forgettable shooters and open-world distractions that land on my desk. I think about it every week partly because its soundtrack is my favorite writing music, partly because its toys litter my desk, and mostly because it’s just that good. Yes, you have to beat it five times, but in hindsight, I wish I had a reason to play it another five hundred. <em>—CP</em></p></blockquote>

<p id="g2yjQn">While <em>Paranormasight</em> is available for Switch and iOS, it looks and plays best (and is often the most affordable) on Steam Deck, whether you’re using it in handheld mode or if it’s docked to your TV. This spooky, rather mature episodic visual novel is tough to put down, especially when you begin to uncover how it progresses.</p>
<p id="iHoi7a">You assume the role of multiple characters, who are all trying to survive a supernatural cataclysm that’s out for everyone’s soul. The story is told to make you care about each one of them, not knowing who’s about to bite the dust at the next turn of events. <em>—CF</em></p>

<p id="jpMBws">In 2009, Volition created an open-world terrorism simulator set on Mars. With a hammer and construction-grade explosives, a bald space bro destroys landmarks, government office complexes, and mining facilities piece by piece. Where its open-world peers focused on realism and narrative, Red Faction emphasized chaotic fun. Publisher THQ planned to convert Red Faction into a “transmedia” property, but little materialized beyond a mediocre sequel and a made-for-TV movie. The closest we’ve seen to a spiritual sequel is 2020’s <em>Teardown</em>, an indie heist game that invites players to bust through buildings made of chunky voxels. Speaking of, I should install <em>Teardown</em> on my Steam Deck. <em>—CP</em></p>

<p id="6fg5fq"><em>Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors</em> and <em>Zero Escape: Virtue’s Last Reward </em>were two of the most beloved visual novels on the Nintendo DS, 3DS, and PlayStation Vita. Unfortunately, Nintendo and Sony no longer support the DS and Vita online shops, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22937165/nintendo-wii-u-3ds-eshop-closing-date-virtual-console">the 3DS online storefront will close in 2023</a>.

<p id="nTmKwr"><em>Spelunky HD</em> kept my PlayStation Vita within arm’s reach long after Sony gave up on the cult handheld. Last year, developer Mossmouth ported <em>Spelunky </em>and its sequel to the Nintendo Switch — and I finally moved my Vita into its long-term home in my storage bin of gaming artifacts. I won’t say the Steam Deck is a better home for Spelunky than the Switch, just that it’s another portable home. And any portable that can play Spelunky should play Spelunky. <em>—CP</em></p>

<p id="qcj2R6"><em>Wildermyth</em> made <a href="https://www.polygon.com/c/22796149/50-best-video-games-of-2021-polygon-goty">Polygon’s top 10 games of 2021</a> list by reimagining the D&amp;D experience without the need for a part-time Dungeon Master. The combat is clever enough (your magic can convert any object into a deadly weapon), but I especially cherish its creator’s dedication to characters. Party members find lovers and nemeses, they acquire weapons and battle scars, they age and eventually die. Quests are broken into 10- to 15-minute episodes of story and combat, ideal for filling any gaps in your day. The controls on Steam Deck do take a little practice, but the game has benefited from an active community of modders and storytellers, so I wouldn’t be surprised if we see improved user-made control settings soon. <em>—CP</em></p>

<p id="6L1b4w">In 2004,<em> Half-Life 2</em> helped launch Steam, attracting thousands of players to Valve’s then-unproven video game ecosystem. In return for joining Steam, players could download a first-person shooter that was far ahead of its time. Today, <em>Half-Life 2</em> (and its pair of supplemental episodes) works as another example of Valve’s magic. I installed a PC game I bought nearly 20 years ago onto a portable computer, and it only took a few minutes to enter the streets of City 17. <em>—CP</em></p>

Reader, it happened! <em>Death Stranding</em> is my personal game of the decade, an astounding mishmash of everything to appear in a Kojima game: earnest critiques of capitalism and the pain points of democracy, eerie premonitions of global pandemics and a gig economy forced to carry society on its shoulders, and enough mommy issues to justify a lifetime of therapy. Plus, the game itself is fun. Like, very fun! </p>
<p id="yxBeGW">No, you don’t get to shoot much stuff, nor do you conquer the giant open-world map. But you do make the world a little more manageable for you and other players, slowly building bridges, roads, and ladders that will inevitably be destroyed by nature. Where other games ask you to become the ruler of their world, <em>Death Stranding</em> reminds you that we are all merely tourists awaiting our one-way flight off of this rock. Did I mention the poop grenades?</p>
<p id="7xbH1F">Plenty of folks didn’t give the game a shot on PlayStation 4 or PC. Maybe the Steam Deck will make the game convenient enough to win over a handful of curious people to take the plunge into <em>Death Stranding</em>’s sticky, inky depths. <em>—CP</em></p>

(You can’t effectively express your hate for me—they took away our comments.) But I’ve loved <em>The Mandalorian</em>, and thoroughly enjoyed the first two episodes of <em>The Acolyte </em>when I watched them last night.

Set an extraordinary 4,000 years before Luke first whinged across the galaxy, it was gloriously able to be its very own thing in a superbly established galaxy. And that first game had a fantastic story to boot, with a great twist ending that would serve a whole new generation were it to be repeated as a TV show. I’m pitching that Headland adapt the first game first, before getting onto Kreia. Because I want it. Me. It’s about me.</p><p>Headland’s focus is certainly on the sequel, however. She told <em>Omelete</em>, “I’ve always wanted to explore a live action version of the <em>Knights of the Old Republic</em> game and the character of Kreia.” And blimey, would it ever be great. Following Kreia’s path through both sides of the Force, and her rebellion against both sides’ conventions in what she considered “enslavement” to the insidious metaphysical nanobots, would make for an epic show. And Headland would clearly be the person to deliver it.</p><p>When <em>Omelete</em> asked if her interest in the games raised the possibility of <em>KotOR</em>’s Darth Revan showing up in <em>The Acolyte</em>, she replied, “Start writing some emails! Start crowdfunding!”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6 - Official 'The Truth Lies' Live Action Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Putting a big game like Black Ops 6 on Game Pass will no doubt be "expensive" for Microsoft, Harding-Rolls said, but it could be a smart move in the long run. The analyst outlined a number of reasons for how putting Black Ops 6 on Game Pass could lead to an uptick in revenue, starting with how it could drive upsell to the more Game Pass Ultimate from Game Pass Console to increase the average revenue per user.</p><p>Harding-Rolls also said people may opt to purchase the more-expensive versions of Black Ops 6 to play early, instead of waiting for Black Ops 6 to come to Game Pass on its traditional launch date. Activision historically lets people play the campaign early by purchasing a more expensive version of the game, and while the details remain unconfirmed for Black Ops 6, it seems like the company would do the same.</p><p>Harding-Rolls also pointed out how with Starfield, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-starfield-5-days-early-without-spending-100/1100-6515108/" data-ref-id="1100-6515108">Microsoft sold a $35 upgrade option so Game Pass subscribers could play early</a>. Harding-Rolls said this worked well for Starfield and could help "boost premium revenue streams" for Black Ops 6 as well.</p><p>Additionally, Harding-Rolls mentioned how Black Ops 6 is likely to carry forward Call of Duty's heavy microtransaction offerings. So while Microsoft might miss out on some premium full-game sales due to Game Pass, the tradeoff is a potentially larger audience to sell microtransactions to.</p><p>Regarding the effect putting Black Ops 6 on Game Pass could have on PlayStation 5, Harding-Rolls said people who play Call of Duty on PlayStation will "inevitably be disrupted to an extent," and that this will be "a concern for Sony."</p><p>That said, Harding-Rolls mentioned how Call of Duty also has the free battle-royale game Warzone, and this means "the disruption will not be as significant as it might have been in the past when all revenue from a content point of view was centered on premium sales."</p><p>For people who own both an Xbox and a PlayStation console, they might be encouraged this year more than ever to play on Xbox due to Game Pass, Harding-Rolls said. But thanks to things like multiplatform accounts, people can always switch back or move between systems easily than before.</p><p>"Indeed, there could be scenarios where PlayStation-first multi-console gamers switch to Xbox to play the premium campaign while still playing the free-to-play Warzone on their preferred console under a single Activision account," Harding-Rolls said.</p><p>Black Ops 6 is rumored to launch on October 25. The release date and other information should be announced at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-reveal-event-when-its-happening-how-to-watch-what-to-expect/1100-6523968/" data-ref-id="1100-6523968">Black Ops 6 Direct on June 9</a>, so keep checking back with GameSpot for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/cod-black-ops-6-reportedly-marks-long-awaited-return-of-theater-mode/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=cod-black-ops-6-reportedly-marks-long-awaited-return-of-theater-mode<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="372" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">First introduced in <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops</em>, Theater Mode allowed players to record clips, piece them together, and then upload them directly from the menus. In future iterations, the feature also made it possible to watch back Zombies and Blackout matches and create clips. For the first time in a few years, it appears that the beloved feature could be making a return. </p> <p data-characters="398" data-current-count="398" data-injectable="false"><em>Call of Duty</em> leaker Bob <a href="https://x.com/BobNetworkUK/status/1798771567373193379" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claims</a> that Theater Mode will return in Black Ops 6. Theater mode works similar to the spectator mode used in Call of Duty League matches. Players can save gameplay, take screenshots, fast-forward, pause, and rewind videos. The feature will make it possible to rewind a match from any perspective on the map, allowing users to take notes and learn where they made mistakes. </p> <figure data-current-count="698" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="536" data-current-count="536" data-injectable="true">In addition, the feature will be useful for the community in weeding out cheaters. Streamers already have the capability of rewinding their stream to determine if an enemy cheated or not. Theater Mode should make it easier for every player to do the same. Of course, this also comes with risks, as false accusations will inevitably be made and posted online. Treyarch is going to have its hands full sifting through so many videos, but this feature should have a positive impact and result in plenty of fun highlight reels going viral. </p>
 <p data-characters="125" data-current-count="125" data-injectable="false">We will learn more about the upcoming series installment during the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-watch-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> Direct</a> on June 9 at 1 p.m. ET. </p>

<p data-characters="228" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Nintendo is plumbing the depths of the Blue Bomber’s portable efforts this week. All five <em>Mega Man </em>Game Boy games launched simultaneously via Nintendo Switch Online, and are <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/a-mega-new-update-for-nintendo-switch-online-members/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">now available</a> for those who have a subscription.</p> <p data-characters="385" data-current-count="385" data-injectable="false">The games included in the drop are <em>Mega Man: Dr. Wily’s Revenge</em>, <em>Mega Man II</em>, <em>Mega Man III</em>, <em>Mega Man IV</em>, and <em>Mega Man V</em>. You just need the basic Nintendo Switch Online paid membership to dive in, so no worries for those who haven’t ponied up for the Expansion Pass version. You can relive all the green-tinted glory in Nintendo’s June 2024 Game Updates trailer below.</p> <figure data-current-count="685" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Game Boy – June 2024 Game Updates – Nintendo Switch Online" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yVbuHPyM3VA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="429" data-current-count="429" data-injectable="true">Starting with <em>Mega Man: Dr. Wily’s Revenge </em>in 1991—known as <em>Rockman World </em>in Japan—the Game Boy takes on Capcom’s NES platformers were actually pretty impressive efforts. Many of them can be seen as remixes of sorts, with the first challenging players to four Robot Master stages from the original <em>Mega Man</em>, followed by fights with four Robot Masters from <em>Mega Man 2 </em>within the treacherous halls of Wily Castle.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="292" data-current-count="292" data-injectable="false"><em>Mega Man II </em>mixes content from the second and third NES games, so you can see a pattern developing. The series came to a close with <em>Mega Man V </em>in 1994, featuring Super Game Boy support and, in a first for the Game Boy entries, a totally fresh story with new levels, bosses, and weapons.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="363" data-current-count="655" data-injectable="false">All of the games have their awkward aspects, but they’re absolutely worth firing up if you have a Nintendo Switch Online subscription. And hey, it beats paying exorbitant eBay prices for complete versions of these bite-sized bad boys. Now we’ll just patiently wait for Nintendo to expand Switch Online support to include the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/mega-man-3-for-dos-is-easily-the-worst-mega-man-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DOS version</a> of <em>Mega Man 3</em>.</p>

<p data-characters="299" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The current season of <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/diablo-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Diablo 4</a></em> is in full swing, providing the best endgame grind since the game came out. With it currently going on, how long do we have until season 5? Here, we’ll go over the end date of <em>Diablo 4</em> Season 4 and other tidbits of useful info regarding this season over to the next.</p> <h2 id="h-what-is-the-end-date-of-diablo-4-season-4" data-injectable="false">What is the end date of <em>Diablo 4</em> Season 4?</h2> <p data-characters="266" data-current-count="266" data-injectable="false">To start off, <strong>Season 4 of <em>Diablo 4</em> will end on Tuesday, August 6, 2024</strong>. That will most likely also be the date when Season 5 starts. When the day comes, the game’s servers will go down for a few hours as the new update with the next season’s content is deployed.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Is it too late to play Season 4 of <em>Diablo 4</em>?</h2> <p data-characters="272" data-current-count="538" data-injectable="true">It is not too late to get into Season 4. In fact, with the major improvements to leveling, farming, and looting,<a href="https://www.destructoid.com/diablo-4-season-4-is-not-even-a-day-old-and-fans-think-its-the-best-season-start-so-far/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> it’s the best time to do so</a>. You can go from level 1 to 100 for your seasonal character within a week or two, depending on skill and hours put into <em>Diablo 4</em>.</p>
 <p data-characters="274" data-current-count="274" data-injectable="false">With the streamlined experience gained from the Helltides and dungeons in general, you can quickly work up a build that’s endgame viable rather quickly. You can also easily go through the Battle Pass within that same time frame it takes to get to 100, if not, a bit after.</p> <figure data-current-count="574" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="324" data-current-count="324" data-injectable="false">The only things that you may not fully get through are <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-access-the-pit-in-diablo-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the incredibly difficult </a>Pit tiers that go beyond level 60 and onward, the Tormented versions of Uber bosses, and the revamped Uber Lilith fight. This is where that true endgame lies. With the right build invested into and with time, you can eventually conquer these.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="141" data-current-count="465" data-injectable="true">Even the Nightmare Dungeons feel a lot better and are just as rewarding. You can easily get to or close to Tier 100 with a semi-decent build.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">When did Season 4 start?</h2> <p data-characters="190" data-current-count="190" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/diablo-4-season-4-loot-reborn-exact-release-time-global-launch-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 4 started on May 14, 2024</a>. While we’re a month into it already, as mentioned earlier, if you want to hop in, you can still get a majority of the season’s offerings in a few weeks.</p> <p data-characters="149" data-current-count="339" data-injectable="false">Loot Reborn sparked the interest of many who dropped the game because of an unrewarding endgame grind, and things have only gone up since then.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>An astonishingly rare Xbox console given to a UK charity shop is expected to sell for thousands at an upcoming auction.</p>
<p>The lime green original Xbox console – designed to commemorate the 2003 release of the movie Hulk – is a limited edition original given out as a cinema scratchcard prize.</p>
<p>While 50 Hulk editions were made, just 36 were claimed, 16 of which are considered missing, lost, or scrapped.</p>

<p>"This one really caught my eye," tester Paul Smith told the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce440j9gdl5o">BBC</a>. "I'm a games enthusiast myself, but the rare green colour combined with the Hulk and Pepsi logo really stood out."</p>
<p>With eight days to go on the auction, the console has already attracted over 20  bids and is expected to fetch up to £9000. It appears to include all the original cables, five original Xbox games – Tony Hawk's Underground, Tony Hawk's Underground 2, Marvel vs. Capcom 2, what I think is Bilbo's The Hobbit, and one other game I can't quite make out – and the original controller.</p>
<p>"This Green Hulk/Pepsi Xbox was a special promotional Xbox made to commemorate the release of the Universal Pictures movie Hulk in 2003 for the UK release," explains the item description. "The console featured a jewel on top with a promotional image of the Incredible Hulk's eye and the Pepsi logo. These special editions were only available by having a winning scratch card when you purchased a popcorn and Pepsi meal in participating UK UCI Multiplex cinemas.</p>
<p>"We believe there are only 36 of these consoles were ever won and only around 20 that have been found. We believe only 50 were made. but like we mentioned, only 36 were won.</p>
<p>"In the USA, a green Xbox was created for the brand Mountain Dew, they made 5000 of those and they are highly sought after, so this is even rarer."</p>
<p>The auction advises that there are no other such consoles on eBay and "none have been sold in the past", "so these are rare, the likelihood of finding another is slim, so a rare chance to own this item".</p>
<p>All proceeds go to the British Heart Foundation charity.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wallace-and-gromit%E2%80%99s-penguin-nemesis-returns-in-teaser-for-new-netflix-short.892407/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24173526/wallace-and-gromit-short-penguin-vengeance-most-fowl-release-2025<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="xsMfUq">I always breathe a sigh of relief after the announcement of a new Aardman Animation project. The studio behind some of the most imaginative stop-motion projects of the last 50 years has never been a household name or box-office titan like Walt Disney Animation, but founders Peter Lord and David Sproxton’s quirky claymation company remains just as vital to the art. So you can imagine how loudly I yelled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RmT094XH9g">“cheeeeeeese!”</a> when Netflix announced a new outing for Aardman’s unofficial mascots, Wallace and Gromit. </p>
<p id="bPuQVd">Due out “this winter” (but positioned as a 2025 release in Netflix’s news release), <em>Wallace &amp; Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl</em> picks back up the well-mannered bumbling inventor Wallace and his vigilant dog Gromit standing on the edge of our current techpocalypse. Wallace, it seems, is fully Silicon Valley-pilled, and “Gromit’s concern that Wallace is becoming too dependent on his inventions proves justified,” per a synopsis. The tipping point: Wallace’s invention of an AI “smart” gnome that goes rogue. But there’s another familiar face pulling the strings: Feathers McGraw. </p>
<p id="cmXdJN">Introduced in the 1993 Oscar-winning short <em>The Wrong Trousers</em> — one of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/2/26/21152552/wallace-and-gromit-best-chase-scene-wrong-trousers-aardman-streaming-amazon">the all-time great chase movies</a>? — Feathers is a silent criminal mastermind known to masquerade as a chicken using a red rubber glove worn as a hat. He has appeared in blink-and-you’ll-miss-it cameos in other Wallace and Gromit shorts, the pair’s lone feature film, <em>The Curse of the Wererabbit</em>, and even the woefully under-discussed 2003 video game <em>Wallace &amp; Gromit in Project Zoo</em>, but <em>Vengeance Most Fowl</em> is expected to give the penguin his true sequel moment, as seen in a brief teaser for the film.</p>

<p id="BTvQlS">While the distinctly British output from Aardman has struggled to connect with American  audiences — films like <em>The Pirates! Band of Misfits</em>, <em>Shaun the Sheep</em>, and <em>Early Man</em> were hits around the world and blips in the States — the streaming era has been kind to the studio. Along with producing <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23924148/chicken-run-dawn-of-the-nugget-netflix-preview-animation-mission-impossible">last year’s sequel to <em>Chicken Run</em></a> for Netflix, the studio also collaborated with Disney for the first time in 2023, producing <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/23713171/star-wars-visions-season-2-show-interview">a segment for the <em>Star Wars: Visions </em>anthology series</a>. And last December, Aardman even produced a Wallace and Gromit VR game <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYJuoDhPDfE">for Meta Quest</a>, reminding us there is no place these two can’t go.</p>
<p id="TdgZDI">A new Wallace and Gromit short on Netflix is a no-brainer, and a sign of respect: if <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23900570/wes-anderson-roald-dahl-netflix-short-films-order-to-stream">Wes Anderson could do it</a>, obviously so can Aardman.</p>
<p id="UMSYgW"><em>Wallace &amp; Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl</em> is once again directed by longtime Aardman creative Nick Park. Actor Ben Whitehead returns as the voice of Wallace, after taking over Peter Sallis starting with <em>The Curse of the Were-Rabbit</em>. The short is set for this winter, teeing it up right up for Oscar season.</p>

  <p id="iLXjk0">I first saw <em>Hit Man</em>, the new Richard Linklater movie now streaming on Netflix, at an early morning press screening at the London Film Festival. The film played really well and the audience was into it, but I was still shocked when one late scene drew huge peals of laughter from the audience and an actual applause break at its climax. An applause break! At 9:30 in the morning! From film critics! <em>British </em>film critics! (Something you may not know about British people: We don’t applaud in movie theaters. Ever.)</p>
<p id="h35hmd">Just as surprising: the content of the scene that drew that response. Given the movie’s premise — a professor poses as a contract killer to help the police arrest people for soliciting murder, but gets lost in the role — you might guess the audience was hooting at a Tarantino-esque slapstick bloodbath. But the scene was, in fact, the most cleverly conceived and delightfully played piece of pure romantic comedy I’d seen in years.</p>

<p id="Hqc0Cp">As a filmmaker, Linklater is fluent in genre conventions, but he often finds his own space in the cracks between them. In that sense, <em>Hit Man</em> is true to form. Written by Linklater and its star (and frequent Linklater collaborator, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23068332/top-gun-maverick-review-tom-cruise"><em>Top Gun: Maverick</em></a> heavy) <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24046802/hit-man-netflix-trailer-glen-powell-comedy">Glen Powell</a>, it’s an easygoing movie that doesn’t break a sweat as it flits between comedy, romance, suspense, philosophical musing, and a quiet tinge of noirish darkness. Under a straightforward, pleasing exterior, the movie is elusive and prone to shape-shifting — a bit like its main character.</p>
<p id="X6MFy7">That character is Gary Johnson (Powell), a placid, nerdy professor of philosophy and psychology with a talent for electronics. That talent leads him into a side hustle running recording equipment for the New Orleans police department, and helping with a sting operation where a cop named Jasper (<em>The Walking Dead</em>’s Austin Amelio, in venal mode) poses as an assassin to catch people in the act of soliciting murder. When Jasper gets suspended and Gary is parachuted into the sting at the last minute, he discovers a new talent for role-play. He takes to being a fake hitman like a duckling takes to water.</p>
<p id="dbfWuo">Gary, student of human nature that he is, pours himself into researching his marks and constructing identities that will work for each of them. Contract killers are a myth anyway, he reasons, so why not lean into the fiction and play into the expectations formed by decades of cinematic assassins? Powell has a lot of fun donning wigs and voices to imitate a comical range of stereotypical killers. At one point, he does an absolutely uncanny impression of Christian Bale in <em>American Psycho</em>.</p>

<p id="IpgFPx">Up to this point, <em>Hit Man</em> is a <a href="https://time.com/6313456/hit-man/">more-or-less true story</a>. There was a real Gary Johnson, in Houston, Texas, a mild-mannered cat-lover who moonlighted for the police as a fake hitman in the 1990s and 2000s. For the movie, Powell and Linklater adapted a <a href="https://www.texasmonthly.com/true-crime/hit-man-2/">2001 Texas Monthly article</a> about the real Johnson, who might not have donned so many disguises, but certainly got the arrests.</p>
<p id="GrDnY6">It’s a good yarn about a resonant character — the unassuming everyman who can take on another identity to slip into a netherworld. In the process of fictionalizing this story, Powell and Linklater spin it out in two directions: a philosophical inquiry into the mutability of the self, and a light romantic thriller. Gary adopts the role of cucumber-cool hitman “Ron” to meet Madison Masters (Adria Arjona), a wife who wants her abusive husband killed. He’s smitten — but is it with Madison, or with Ron, the super-smooth, confident, uninhibited version of himself he has invented for her?</p>
<p id="lMcu9W">For its first half, <em>Hit Man</em> ambles along pleasantly in a typical Linklater mode: the anecdotal shaggy-dog story that takes plenty of time to muse about its own implications. (Quite literally: Gary quotes Nietzsche and ponders questions of identity and morality with his college class. Also, his cats are named Ego and Id.) </p>

</p>
<p id="FAss8L">The stakes for a hitman movie where real hitmen don’t exist seem pretty low, but the dual-identity setup with Gary/Ron and Madison is a classical Hollywood comedy gambit, like something out of a 1940s Preston Sturges movie. It kicks the movie into an uptempo second half that is more constructed, plotty, and commercial than Linklater’s usual extremely chill work. It’s easy to imagine it done in a more heightened, screwball mode — maybe something like Jonathan Demme’s quirky, snowballing 1980s comedies <em>Something Wild</em> and <em>Married to the Mob</em>.</p>
<p id="yPWiUr">That isn’t Linklater’s vibe, though, and that isn’t this movie. Powell and Arjona make a powerfully sexy, charming pair, and Powell and Linklater find clever ways to enmesh the characters’ simmering romance in a tightening web of compromise, danger, and deceit without tipping into the crime movie clichés the movie is spoofing.</p>
<p id="7Zbi1w">The payoff is that perfect rom-com moment, the one that drew applause from a crowd of sleepy London critics. It’s a spectacularly conceived, written, and performed scene that plays out on two levels simultaneously: one in the fiery, hard-bitten dialogue, one in the flashing eyes, frantic gestures, and crackling chemistry of the two leads. In this moment, <em>Hit Man </em>joyously (and pointedly) unites the thrill of connection with the thrill of danger, and operates harmoniously as two films at once — the same way Gary is perhaps becoming two people at once.</p>

<p id="OmEcYj">It’s such a satisfying scene that it more than makes up for some slackness in the script elsewhere. Arjona’s part is underwritten, and as willing as Powell and Linklater are to ponder the big questions, they gloss over some of the moral implications of the storyline: Gary’s arguable gaslighting, Madison’s culpability and agency, and whether the police operation was wholesale entrapment in the first place.</p>
<p id="cnvK5l">There’s a darker side to this story and these characters, strongly hinted at by one surprisingly cruel late turn in the plot. Powell and Linklater nod to that darkness, but ultimately decide not to go there. Just as Gary can decide to turn himself into Ron, they can decide to steer this slippery movie into a sunnier place. <em>Hit Man </em>could have been a lot of different movies, and part of the joy of the film is in how playfully it gestures toward all those different potential versions of itself. But ultimately, that one perfect scene defines it as a great romantic comedy with a delicious bite. </p>

You’d have to feed and care for them regularly throughout the day, and they’d suffer if you left them for too long. It was a nightmare for teachers and parents across the globe (my mom would have to take care of mine while I was at school), but a core memory for many millennials—I will never forget my yellow and green Tamagotchi, and how excited I was when one of my pets lived for 20 real-world days (they typically lived for about a week).<br></p><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>Tamagotchi have since become a nostalgic bit of plastic <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bestbuy.com/site/tamagotchi-original-90s-theme/6540757.p?skuId=6540757&amp;extStoreId=1895&amp;utm_source=feed&amp;ref=212&amp;loc=20437790615&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw34qzBhBmEiwAOUQcF6sshUMMf3MCg4M35PKnmYSg32ZE9pBzI3COlTd2sMCo7cMhsZn7nhoCCKsQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/tamagotchi-original-90s-theme/6540757.p?skuId=6540757&amp;extStoreId=1895&amp;utm_source=feed&amp;ref=212&amp;loc=20437790615&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw34qzBhBmEiwAOUQcF6sshUMMf3MCg4M35PKnmYSg32ZE9pBzI3COlTd2sMCo7cMhsZn7nhoCCKsQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you can still technically buy</a></span>, but its most diehard fans are still discovering the nearly 30-year-old mysteries locked in the tiny plastic eggs, including the ability to play as previously unplayable NPCs that the community has wondered about for years.<br></p><p>As reported by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.404media.co/a-27-year-old-tamagotchi-mystery-has-been-solved/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.404media.co/a-27-year-old-tamagotchi-mystery-has-been-solved/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>404</em> <em>Media</em></a></span>, a Tamagotchi player with the Discord handle rhubarb_pie <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.404media.co/content/images/2024/06/CleanShot-2024-06-06-at-07.14.49.png&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2024/06/CleanShot-2024-06-06-at-07.14.49.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted a lengthy guide</a></span> on how to unlock twin characters Moll and Lora in the Mothra-themed Tamagotchi, which debuted in Japan in 1997 as a tie-in product for the release of the <em>Rebirth of Mothra II</em> movie. Moll and Lora were exclusive to the Mothra Tamagotchi, and until rhubarb_pie’s post, were just NPC nurses who would heal your little guy whenever it got sick—unless you used a “battery glitch” to play as them. Rhubarb_pie discovered how to unlock them naturally through gameplay.<br></p><p>“The way to get them is extremely obscure so I am not at all surprised they were never found until now,” they wrote in a post in the “Tamatown Forum” Discord. “Looking at it now, this looks like a bad schoolyard video game urban legend. But it is real.” In order to do it, you’ll need to raise a character called “Mothra Leo” with no “care mistakes” (like allowing its hunger or happiness bar to hit zero and ignore their calls for attention/help for more than 15 minutes), keep it to a specific weight, and wait about 80 hours. When Mother Leo dies, it will lay an egg that contains the twins Moll and Lora.<br></p><p>Rhubarb_pie described the process as “absolutely brutal,” saying that it took “about three weeks” IRL to successfully birth the twins. But the prospect of discovering new playable characters has the Discord incredibly excited, even if it’ll take some serious work to unlock them. Rhubarb pie wrote: “This pretty much blows open all other Tama devices for possible other extremely-well-hidden secrets,” they said. “I think this is the first time there’s been an actual raisable character that is completely undocumented, its existence not even hinted at. Something Tama fans always thought was possible, whispered about in hushed tones, but dared not dream of…”<br></p><p>The post also mentions another “undocumented secret character” they unearthed while digging through Mothra Tamagotchi’s source code: a Mothra grave, or the in-game sprite that pops up after a Mothra dies. RIP.<br></p><p>Tamagotchi enthusiasts, rejoice.

<p>As spotted by users <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/newworldgame/comments/1da1tgx/what_the_hell_it_on_my_ps_store_page/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Reddit</a>, New World: Aeternum appeared to show up on the PlayStation Store today, signaling a release on consoles.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming understands that the game will be releasing in mid-October on the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. </p>



<p>Amazon Games’ New World is an open world MMORPG that launched in 2021. In 2023, the game eventually <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-world-season-model/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pivoted to a seasonal model</a>. Aeternum is the name of the central location that players explore in New World. The existing New World title is only available on PC.</p>



<p>New World: Aeternum’s appearance on the PlayStation Store included a sponsored promo image.  This gave fans a small glimpse of the potential art design. </p>



<p>Fans also reported today that Amazon quickly removed its brief appearance on the PlayStation Store. So, fans speculate that it slipped ahead of a major reveal at Summer Game Fest. </p>



<p>The Summer Game Fest event begins today, June 7, 2024, starting at 5 pm EST / 2 pm PT / 10 pm GMT. It will feature <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/summer-game-fest-2024/">2 hours of gameplay showcases</a>. </p>



<p>A new report surfaced this week suggesting that a trailer for Summer Game Fest costs <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/summer-game-fest-trailer-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$250,000 for one minute</a>. However, it would be an ideal place for Amazon Games to invest in a big reveal like New World: Aeternum coming to consoles.</p>



<p>At this time, Amazon Games has not officially confirmed anything about New World: Aeternum.</p>

The exit will be on your right, but don't leave through that archway yet.</p><p dir="ltr">Instead, listen for the notification sound your Ghost makes when there's something scannable nearby. If you pull your Ghost out and you're near what you're looking for, the Ghost will turn toward the object you're searching for.

Stand on the plate to summon a mess of Dread enemies. You'll fight four different waves as the plate charges up, culminating with a Subjugator. Once you damage it enough, Bound Dread enemies will appear, so you'll need to stand on the nearby Prismatic well to charge up Transcendence and break their shields and make the Subjugator vulnerable again.

To see where you need to take the crystal, you need to look through the opening near where the crystal appears and count the pedestals to find the corresponding one. Shadow Thralls will appear to bother you as you do so, but they're not too big of a deal.</p><p dir="ltr">Each time you place the crystal, you'll have to fight a bunch of enemies, culminating in a couple of Ogres and Dread enemies. As usual, some Bound forces will appear to lend shields to the bosses, so you'll need to use Transcendence to clear them out in order to finish everything off.

You need to stand next to and shoot the Darkness seed near the entrance to the cave to gain a buff that protects you from the toxic air, and keep refreshing it while you're in the cave whenever the timer runs out.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314398-20240606231908_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314398" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314398-20240606231908_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314398"></a><figcaption>Seek out and destroy these Eyes of Suffering to drop the shields on the enemies so you can take them out.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314398-20240606231908_1.jpg"></figure><p>Push all the way to the back of the cave to find the Prismatic chest. Find the triangular splinter object in the middle of the room and activate it. Enemies with invulnerable shields will spawn in. Avoid them since they're invulnerable, and instead, look for the round Taken Acolyte Eyes scattered throughout. You need to find the eyes, which are a bit hidden, and destroy them all to make the enemies become vulnerable so you can kill them.</p><p>Repeat the process of finding and killing the Eyes three times. Each time, more shielded enemies will spawn, making the sprint to find the Eyes a little more frantic each time. When they're all dead, a bunch of Dread enemies will appear, along with a Tormentor. You'll need to use Transcendence to make the Tormentor vulnerable, but once that happens, you can take it down to get your Prismatic chest key.</p><p>Check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-guides-hub/1100-6523936/" data-ref-id="1100-6523936">Destiny 2: The Final Shape guide hub</a> for tons more information about everything to find in the game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/super-earths-heartfelt-thank-you-to-helldivers-2-players-inadvertently-revealed-yet-another-harrowing-cost-of-the-galactic-war/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=super-earths-heartfelt-thank-you-to-helldivers-2-players-inadvertently-revealed-yet-another-harrowing-cost-of-the-galactic-war<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="294" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The <em>Helldivers 2</em> universe is a satirical take on our own, asking what things would be like if we took spreading managed democracy and the values that come with that lifestyle to the extreme. However, Super Earth has just revealed an in-universe fact that’s more harrowing than hilarious. </p> <p data-characters="464" data-current-count="464" data-injectable="true">When you play a mission in <em>Helldivers 2</em>, your squad has a set number of reinforcements. It’s pretty standard because we all know that at least a few of our soldiers are going to be killed, churned up by the endless onslaught of Terminids and Automatons. What you might not consider is how much those deaths cost. Not how much the bill Super Earth foots is, but the bill the poor Helldiver’s family pays to see whatever’s left of their loved one. </p>
 <h2 id="h-dead-helldivers-are-just-another-revenue-stream-for-the-relentless-super-earth" data-injectable="false">Dead Helldivers are just another revenue stream for the relentless Super Earth</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Sony</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="231" data-current-count="531" data-injectable="true">Following perhaps the most impactful event in <em>Helldivers 2</em> history, the collapse of Meridia into a black hole, <a href="https://x.com/helldivers2/status/1798363487258710165" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Super Earth put out a message</a> commemorating those brave soldiers who had lost their lives fighting to make this happen. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>The Terminid Supercolony could not have been destroyed without the brave sacrifice of many, many Helldivers.</p><p>In their honor, this personalized memorandum has been issued to their designated next-of-kin. We will always remember [Helldiver Name]. <a href="https://t.co/fHLljtbKTo">pic.twitter.com/fHLljtbKTo</a></p></div>— HELLDIVERS™ 2 (@helldivers2) <a href="https://twitter.com/helldivers2/status/1798363487258710165?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 5, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="366" data-current-count="666" data-injectable="true">The message is perfect because it’s filled with sections with options that are obviously meant to be chosen from instead of sent in this form. The point that stuck out to me is the customary fee for a Helldiver corpse, helmet, or limb that’s usually charged. This is most likely because every body on Meridia was ionized when the black hole was created. </p>
 <p data-characters="423" data-current-count="423" data-injectable="true">In this one and only case, Super Earth is waiving the transportation fee so families can see the scraps of their loved one return from the front lines. The rest of the time, these families are charged for this service, though, meaning your spouse might get a fair pay packet for fighting for Super Earth, but all your savings will need to be spent bringing pieces of them back from a hostile alien world just to bury them. </p>
 <p data-characters="454" data-current-count="454" data-injectable="true">This is incredibly dystopian and fits the <em>Helldivers 2</em> universe incredibly well, but it just stood out to me as something we can point to that shows how capitalism really has gone too far in this universe. <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-viper-commandos-warbond-adds-throwing-knives-and-the-very-first-vehicle-customizations-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Charging Helldivers for new equipment by using a currency they can only earn from battling aliens</a> for Super Earth is one thing, but it feels like you’re taking the piss with an already captive market when you start charging for repatiration. </p>
 <p data-characters="431" data-current-count="431" data-injectable="false">I couldn’t tell you how much delivering a Helldiver’s had across the galaxy costs, but I looked it up, and repatriation to the UK is about £3,600 and that’s without space travel, so it’s probably a lot more. Considering that Super Earth potentially <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-players-may-have-been-given-an-impossible-major-order-to-boost-recruitment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">set Helldivers an impossible objective to boost recruitment numbers</a>, this all feels a lot like a tactic to boost income instead of spreading more democracy. </p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-mega-man</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-online-adds-five-classic-mega-man-games.892386/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-mega-man<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has added five classic&nbsp;<em>Mega Man&nbsp;</em>games to the Nintendo Switch Online library, and they're available to enjoy right now if you're a subscriber.</p>
<p>The first five numbered&nbsp;<em>Mega Man&nbsp;</em>games for the Game Boy, which were originally released between 1991 and 1994, are now on Nintendo Switch Online as part of a basic subscription, so you won't even need the Expansion Pack to enjoy them.</p>
<p>What's more, these games aren't available as part of any of Capcom's&nbsp;<em>Mega Man Legacy Collection&nbsp;</em>compilations. They were available on the Nintendo 3DS eShop, but since <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wii-u-and-nintendo-3ds-eshops-are-being-discontinued">that service has been discontinued</a>, Nintendo Switch Online is pretty much the only (entirely legal) way to enjoy them on modern hardware.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-online-classic-mega-man-game-boy.jpg?itok=NznUuzOx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-online-classic-mega-man-game-boy.jpg?itok=-xWi1eNc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Five - count 'em, five - classic&nbsp;<em>Mega Man&nbsp;</em>games are now available with Nintendo Switch Online.</figcaption></figure><p>The Game Boy&nbsp;<em>Mega Man&nbsp;</em>titles generally offer stages, bosses, and enemies that also feature in the main NES&nbsp;<em>Mega Man&nbsp;</em>series, although&nbsp;<em>Mega Man 5&nbsp;</em>features a set of original bosses.</p>
<p>Four of the Game Boy titles were developed by Minakuchi Engineering, which also worked on the SNES version of&nbsp;<em>Mega Man X3</em>, as well as the Game Boy version of&nbsp;<em>Bionic Commando</em>, another Capcom platformer.</p>
<p><em>Mega Man 2</em>, on the other hand, was given to&nbsp;<em>Sokoban&nbsp;</em>publisher Thinking Rabbit, although Capcom would return to Minakuchi for the following three games in the Game Boy series after&nbsp;<em>Mega Man 2</em>'s quality didn't quite come up to par for the studio.</p>
<p>In any case, if you're already a Nintendo Switch Online subscriber, you can give all five games a try right now, and if you've never played a&nbsp;<em>Mega Man&nbsp;</em>game before, they'll certainly make for an interesting introduction to the series.</p>

<p>These&nbsp;<em>Mega Man&nbsp;</em>games are part of a long list of Game Boy titles available on Nintendo Switch Online. That list also includes classics like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-game-boy-launch"><em>Super Mario World</em></a>, Capcom's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-zelda-july"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Oracle&nbsp;</em>games</a>, and more.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can also enjoy SNES and NES games if you're a subscriber, and if you fork out for the Expansion Pack, you'll also get access to a range of Sega Genesis, Game Boy Advance, and N64 titles.</p>
<p>You can grab a Nintendo Switch Online subscription right now via the Nintendo eShop.</p>

    <p><span>Firefly and Jade join the fray.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 2.3 update for <em><a title="Games > Honkai: Star Rail [27 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/honkai-star-rail">Honkai: Star Rail</a></em>, dubbed “Farewell, Penacony,” will launch on June 19, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [162 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-888606"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>This update introduces the highly anticipated Stellaron Hunter, Firefly, as well as a significant figure from the IPC, Jade. Additionally, under the guidance of Mr. Screwllum, the new update in the Simulated Universe, “Divergent Universe” will be unveiled as well.</p><p>With the abrupt termination of the Charmony Festival, The Family’s reputation is in tatters, with numerous delicate issues urgently demanding attention. In response, aside from the Oak Family, the major lineages are preparing their strategies to address the aftermath. In the Version 2.3 Trailblaze Mission, the Express Crew will be invited aboard the Radiant Feldspar, soaring into the skies above Penacony to witness crucial Family discussions firsthand.</p><p>Meanwhile, aboard the Radiant Feldspar, a new project within the Simulated Universe, “Divergent Universe” will be conducted under the guidance of Mr. Screwllum, utilizing technology from his home planet to bring gameplay improvements. For instance, the “Arithmetic Mapping” function in the Divergent Universe testing removes character download limitations. If a character’s level is below the current Equilibrium Level Cap, it will automatically increase to meet the cap. The update also introduces the “Equation” feature, where combining buffs from two different Paths grants corresponding combat abilities once the required amount is achieved. Additionally, when facing defeat in the Divergent Universe, Trailblazers can now restart challenges without needing to force-stop the game. With the new Restart Challenge option, players can regroup and give it another shot, allowing for more strategy and playability, as well as providing a richer, more fun gaming experience.</p><p>In Version 2.3, Origami Birds will also make their way onto the Radiant Feldspar, bringing a new mini-game. In this arcade challenge, Trailblazers must achieve eliminations within a set number of moves to boost the birds’ Combat Power. During the “Origami Bird Clash” event, Trailblazers can not only participate in Story Challenges, but also freely battle friends from across the universe!</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Aside from gameplay updates, the 5-star character Firefly will also join the team as a playable character, fighting alongside the Trailblazers. Firefly is a member of the Stellaron Hunters, originating from the long-destroyed world of Glamoth. Once a prosperous and expansive empire, Glamoth was annihilated by the Swarm. Firefly, a young girl encased in mechanical armor known as “SAM,” was created as a weapon and suffers from Entropy Loss Syndrome due to genetic modification. Driven by the quest to find meaning in life and to defy fate, she joined the Stellaron Hunters.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_888611"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>As a 5-star Fire-Type character, Firefly possesses an immense power. After using her Technique, she can summon her SAM armor and leap into the air, moving freely, with SAM attacking all enemies within a set range to enter battle. Each wave of enemies can have Fire Weakness forced upon units without Fire Weakness, lasting for a set number of turns. In the heat of battle, SAM will be operating in two forms. In the initial form, using her Skill consumes HP but simultaneously replenishes her Ultimate energy. The less HP Firefly has, the less damage she sustains. Furthermore, when activating her Ultimate, SAM transforms into its second battle form — the dazzling Complete Combustion state! Alongside more potent Basic Attacks and Skills, her Speed and Weakness Break efficiency are also heightened. The Break DMG dealt by SAM is increased until the countdown for Complete Combustion ends. An aspect worth mentioning is that this state provides players with an immersive perspective from within Sam’s mech, showcasing Firefly’s unwavering gaze and embodying the fiery spirit capable of setting the seas ablaze.</p><p>Another Quantum-Type 5-star character, Jade, is set to make her distinguished debut. As a senior manager in the IPC Strategic Investment Department and one of the Ten Stonehearts, she is recognized by her Cornerstone, “Jade of Credit.” Cold and elegant, Jade is a skilled moneylender with a keen understanding of the human heart. Her personal hobby, “Bonajade Exchange,” highlights her patience in waiting for high-value acquisitions through accepting pawning of assets and her ability to extract value from seemingly destitute clients.</p><p>Jade’s Skill allows her to forge a binding agreement with a single ally, making them her “Debt Collector” and bestowing upon them enhancement. Each attack launched by Jade or her Debt Collector accumulates Charges for Jade. Once fully charged, Jade unleashes a follow-up attack against all enemies. Her Ultimate, however, enforces the terms of the agreement with unyielding precision, dealing damage to all enemies while also enhancing her follow-up attack.</p><p>It’s worth noting that the limited 5-star characters — Ruan Mei and Argenti — will make their appearances in the Warps during the first and second halves of Version 2.3, respectively. Their formidable strength ensures they will remain powerful allies in your future adventures. Finally, please stay tuned for the upcoming Summer Game Fest 2024. At this grand mid-year gaming carnival, Honkai: Star Rail will make an appearance alongside numerous top-tier global games, giving players an exclusive preview of the next chapter in the galactic adventure.</p></blockquote><p><em>Honkai: Star Rail</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [7,174 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [20,281 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">client download</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/honkai-star-rail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/honkai-star-rail/id1599719154" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HoYoverse.hkrpgoversea&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a>.

<p>A Civilization VII banner has appeared on the 2K Games website ahead of its Summer Game Fest announcement.</p>



<p>The information that Civilization VII would be announced at Summer Game Fest was provided to content creators and media earlier this week. The <a href="https://www.2k.com/en-US/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a> does direct users to a trailer and wishlist, which are currently not live.</p>



<p>In mid-May, 2K Games announced it would announce the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-announcement-soon-june-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next iteration of one of its ‘biggest and most beloved’ franchises</a> during Summer Game Fest. Many speculated that the series could be Marfia, Bioshock, or Borderlands, but those rumors have seemingly been squashed. </p>



<p>In 2016, it was reported that the Civilization series had sold over 33 million copies, with over 1 billion hours played. However, more recent numbers are yet to be provided, but sales are expected to be well over 50 million.</p>

The MMO set in an alternate 1600s America saw huge concurrent player numbers on Steam, and is currently the eighth most-played game on Valve’s platform all-time with a whopping 913,634 peak concurrents. Player numbers have declined since that peak, however, with Steam concurrents hovering around the 10,000 mark in recent weeks.</p><p>A console release would certainly provide a boost, and a confirmation seems imminent after the official New World X/Twitter account teased “an exciting announcement” for Summer Game Fest, which kicks off today, June 7, at 2pm Pacific / 5pm Eastern / 10pm UK.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— New World (@playnewworld) <a href="https://twitter.com/playnewworld/status/1798784534584152243?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 6, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Questions remain, however. The PlayStation Store insert is for a game called New World Aeternum, whereas the Steam version is simply called New World. Perhaps the console version is a different game entirely, or Aeternum is the name of a new expansion that will replace the original name across all versions.</p><p>Or, New World Aeternum may mark a new beginning for the MMO, similar to Final Fantasy 14 A Realm Reborn. Fans are also wondering whether New World is also set for Xbox Series X and S, given the insert was spotted on the PlayStation Store.</p><p><em>Image credit: OMG_R3A11Y / Reddit.</em></p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
