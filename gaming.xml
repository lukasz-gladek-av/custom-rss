After the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/super-mario-bros-movie-nintendo-box-office-jack-black-1850343976&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-bros-movie-nintendo-box-office-jack-black-1850343976">astronomical success</a></span> of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/super-mario-bros-movie-review-chris-pratt-jack-black-1850309488&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-bros-movie-review-chris-pratt-jack-black-1850309488"><em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em></a></span>, why wouldn’t it? But <em>Mario</em> actor Chris Pratt is dreaming even bigger—He wants the company to think beyond just having an adaptation in theaters every few years and consider an extended film universe.<br></p><p>In an interview with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://screenrant.com/super-mario-bros-2-movie-nintendo-cinematic-universe-plan-chris-pratt-explained/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://screenrant.com/super-mario-bros-2-movie-nintendo-cinematic-universe-plan-chris-pratt-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Screen Rant</em></a></span>, Pratt said there’s material in all of Nintendo’s big franchises to create a “Nintendo Cinematic Universe” to rival something like Marvel’s interconnected films. He’s not wrong. There’s a reason <em>Super Smash Bros. </em>exists. Nintendo has so many beloved characters and worlds to draw from that it sustains one of the biggest crossovers in video game history.</p><p>But it does leave one to wonder what a Nintendo Cinematic Universe looks like. <em>Mario </em>was an origin story for the titular plumber, and if Nintendo is looking to make introductory movies for its heroes, there’s a surprising amount of genre variety the company could pull from leading into a hypothetical <em>Super Smash Bros. </em>movie. Grab your popcorn and Switch, Nintendo fans. Let’s speculate about what some other Nintendo movies might look like.</p></div></div><div><p>Imagine this: Fox McCloud is a rookie arwing pilot in his first year of flight academy. He’s cocky, but that’d be a dude he’s compensating for a life lived under his father James’ shadow. His dad is a legendary pilot and everyone clearly has a lot of expectations for Fox as his son. At school he meets his friends Falco and Slippy, and under the guidance of his teacher Peppy Hare, they undergo their training to become the titular Star Fox team. But can he overcome the pressures (internal and external), and save the galaxy from an incoming threat? He’s only a beginner on paper, but inside, he has the blood of a legend. He was born to be a pilot. Come on, tell me you aren’t itching to see Nintendo’s take on <em>Top Gun</em>?<br></p></div><div><p>When I proposed an animated <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fire-emblem-three-houses-the-kotaku-review-1836675912&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fire-emblem-three-houses-the-kotaku-review-1836675912"><em>Fire Emblem</em></a></span><em> </em>film would be a political fantasy drama, <em>Kotaku </em>staff writer Moises Taveras said “<em>Fire Emblem</em> as <em>Game of Thrones</em> for kids goes so hard.” Which is true, because that’s basically what <em>Fire Emblem </em>is in video game form—a lot of politicking, intrigue, catty interpersonal relationships, and big fantasy battles. You don’t even need me to spell out how a <em>Three Houses</em> movie would play out because it’s basically <em>Game of Thrones </em>without the on-screen sex.<br></p></div><div><p>Sony was able to make a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gran-turismo-movie-review-playstation-harbour-polyphony-1850781739&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gran-turismo-movie-review-playstation-harbour-polyphony-1850781739"><em>Gran Turismo </em>movie</a></span>, a series without characters, into a live-action film that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl3788079873/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl3788079873/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">did pretty alright for itself</a></span>. So if Nintendo wants to get in on the toy car market by putting out an <em>F-Zero </em>movie, they’re even more primed for success. Kids love a racing movie, and more than anything else, they love to buy toy cars based on racing movies. How do you think we ended up with three <em>Cars </em>films despite that whole franchise being mid as hell? <em>F-Zero </em>at least has a colorful cast of weirdos to put behind the wheel. And you know they’d put in a scene where Captain Falcon straight up Falcon Punches a car on the tracks. The crowd goes wild.<br></p></div><div><p>Nintendo’s life simulator is probably better for an animated television series than it is a movie, but imagine it: a workplace comedy starring Tom Nook, Isabelle, and all the other villagers. Isabelle <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamespot.com/articles/isabelle-could-show-up-in-animal-crossing-new-hori/1100-6467762/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/isabelle-could-show-up-in-animal-crossing-new-hori/1100-6467762/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has already been compared to workplace comedy royalty</a></span> <em>Parks and Recreation</em> Leslie Knope, and putting all those other colorful characters in the workplace documentary format of that or <em>The Office</em> is a great way to adapt the spirit of a video game into a new medium. You spend dozens to hundreds of hours in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-the-kotaku-review-1842321314&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-the-kotaku-review-1842321314"><em>Animal Crossing</em></a></span><em> </em>dealing with the thorny-but-endearing aspects of coexisting with others. Just put Isabelle in front of a camera and let her bitch about her work day.<br></p></div><div><p><em>Punch-Out </em>is another example of a game so well-suited to a specific film genre that you can easily envision its plot beats. The <em>Rocky </em>movies are the blueprint for boxing films, and <em>Punch-Out </em>could be easily mapped onto something along those lines. Little Mac coming up the ranks in his local boxing tournament is primed to teach kids not to give up in the face of struggle. The matches would be flashy and action-packed, and so long as Little Mac doesn’t find himself on the wrong side of a corner stool <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxCGmCQYnEM&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxCGmCQYnEM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">like a million-dollar baby</a></span>, it should be a feel-good experience for the whole family.<br></p></div><div><p>For this one, we won’t have to speculate for too long, as Nintendo already has a <em>Legend of Zelda</em> movie in the works. However, it will <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/legend-of-zelda-movie-kingdom-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-1851448204&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/legend-of-zelda-movie-kingdom-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-1851448204">be live-action</a></span>, unlike the <em>Mario </em>movie. Director Wes Ball has stated he wants the film to prioritize those live-action elements instead of relying on CGI, so it sounds like we’ll likely get a more realistic take on the series with more practical effects. That probably throws out stuff like <em>Wind Waker</em>’s sea-faring travel or <em>Twilight Princess</em>’ wolf transformations. But it would be refreshing if it was more inspired by the original NES game, which doesn’t delve into the complex lore of future games.<br></p></div><div><p>Samus Aran’s story is probably the darkest of any of the games we have listed here, which makes adapting it into a hypothetical animated feature film a bit more complicated. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metroid-dread-the-kotaku-review-1847823602&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-dread-the-kotaku-review-1847823602"><em>Metroid</em></a></span><em> </em>games are often isolating, with its heroine off on some space-faring mission by her lonesome. A movie that captures that essence would likely be more along the lines of <em>Alien</em> than something comparable to <em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em>. Damn, I’m actually really into this idea but it will never get approved by Nintendo.<br></p></div><div><p>Though I played plenty of <em>Kid Icarus </em>as a kid, it was overshadowed by NES games with a bit more oomph: your <em>Mario</em>s, your <em>Zelda</em>s, your <em>Metroid</em>s. (Well, there was only one NES <em>Metroid </em>but you get my point.) But now, whenever I revisit it, I appreciate the inviting, distinctly Nintendo charm of its take on Greek mythology, a hot topic these days days thanks to Supergiant’s super-successful roguelike <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hades-the-kotaku-review-1845204803&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hades-the-kotaku-review-1845204803"><em>Hades</em></a></span><em> </em>(and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hades-2-gameplay-technical-test-crafting-incantations-1851420083&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hades-2-gameplay-technical-test-crafting-incantations-1851420083">its sequel</a></span>). But <em>Hades </em>features overtly sexy gods and their sexy sex lives; Nintendo, ever the family-friendly company, may want something that capitalizes on the appeal of a world of gods and adventure, but that’s squarely aimed at the younger set. That makes this precisely the moment for a big <em>Kid Icarus </em>comeback.</p><p>With its cherubic hero Pit and its charming take on a Greek-inspired land of myth and monsters, a <em>Kid Icarus </em>film could walk that line of being entertaining to both kids and their parents, with plenty of charm and humor the little ones can enjoy, but also moments of genuine thrills and peril. I mean look, the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://kidicarus.fandom.com/wiki/Eggplant_Wizard&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kidicarus.fandom.com/wiki/Eggplant_Wizard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eggplant Wizards</a></span>, who literally turn you into an eggplant, scared the <em>hell </em>out of me as a kid. Hmm. “Eggplant Wizards” may play a bit differently today. Ah well, that’s a problem for Nintendo to deal with. In any case, <em>Kid Icarus </em>would be fantastic source material for an upbeat, crowd pleasing, comedic adventure film for the whole family that leans into Greek mythology in a lighthearted way but still fires the imaginations of children with its sense of magic and possibility. If the <em>Zelda </em>movie is going for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/legend-of-zelda-movie-kingdom-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-1851448204&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/legend-of-zelda-movie-kingdom-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-1851448204">a more grounded approach</a></span>—and it sounds like it is—then let <em>Kid Icarus </em>fill the more breezy, kid-friendly fantasy adventure niche in Nintendo’s cinematic offerings. And put out a great new <em>Kid Icarus </em>game alongside it, too!—Carolyn Petit</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Madden NFL 25 will have two editions: Standard and Deluxe; the former will retail for $69.99, while the latter will cost $99.99. </p><p>A proper reveal for Madden NFL is supposedly happening on May 16 — the same day the publisher is set to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/college-football-25-deluxe-edition-cover-leaked-online">reveal the official covers for College Football 25</a>, its first entry in the college football video game series since 2013. </p><p>The report also claims that Madden NFL 25 will improve the FieldSense technology. This feature originally debuted in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/madden-nfl-23-review-ps5-xbox-series-x">Madden NFL 23</a>, with the physics engine being reworked for the newest entry to provide more "realistic animations with fluid gameplay." </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The news comes the same day Prime Video announced new content for its streaming service, including <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/entertainment/prime-video-new-tv-series-movies-announcements-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a four-part docuseries</a> focusing on the history of the Madden video game franchise. </p><p>In <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/madden-nfl-24-review">our review of Madden NFL 24</a>, IGN wrote: "New animations and improved AI make Madden NFL 24’s on-field action the best it's ever been, but everything that happens off the field is a slog of dated modes and laggy menus that brings everything around it down." </p><p><em>Taylor is a Reporter at IGN.

<p>On the Derail map, this newest patch fixes an issue that allowed players to access the blue train car when they should not have been able to. For the Enhanced Vision Goggles field upgrade, players no longer need to unequip the goggles when the battery dies. Instead, player vision is blurred.</p><p>There are weapon changes, too. The DG-58 LSW machine gun has its hand-damage multipliers reduced from 1.1x to 1x. The COR-45 handgun has now been fixed so players cannot fire faster than intended.</p><p>For Warzone, weapon prestige camos are now supported for Modern Warfare II weapons. There are bug fixes, too. In particular, players previously could not enter a vehicle when using the biometric scanner, but now they can. The Call of Duty Endowment challenge has been fixed, too, to address snapshot grenade issues.</p><p>You can see the full patch notes for Warzone and Modern Warfare III below, as shared by Activision on the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/04/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-season-3-patch-notes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Call of Duty patch notes website.</a></p><h2>Call of Duty: Warzone patch notes</h2><h2>PROGRESSION</h2><ul><li>Weapon Prestige Camos can now be unlocked for MWII Weapons.</li></ul><h2>WEAPONS</h2><h4>MARKSMAN RIFLES</h4><p>WEAPON</p><h3>LOCKWOOD MK2 (MWII)</h3><ul><li><b>JAK Wardens Conversion Kit</b><ul><li>Resolved an issue causing incompatible Attachments to remain equipped in the Gunsmith.</li></ul></li></ul><h4>HANDGUNS</h4><p>WEAPON</p><h3>COR-45</h3><ul><li>Implemented measures to prevent exploits that allow firing faster than intended.</li></ul><h4>» ATTACHMENTS «</h4><ul><li>Adjusted Pros and Cons for multiple Optic Attachments to reflect their true statistics.  <ul><li>Corio Enforcer Optic</li><li>Dragon’s Eye Optic</li><li>KR Marauder 9 Riser</li></ul></li></ul><h2>BUG FIXES</h2><ul><li>Fixed an issue preventing the Call of Duty Endowment challenge to track 20 operators using a Snapshot Grenade from tracking properly.</li></ul><ul><li>Fixed an issue allowing players to enter a vehicle while using the Biometric Scanner.</li></ul><h3>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 multiplayer patch notes</h3><h3>UIX</h3><ul><li>Equipment Skins can now be previewed in the Store.</li><li>Bug Fixes  <ul><li>Tracked Challenges widget now accurately reflects progress toward Weapon Prestige Camos.</li><li>Locked Calling Cards earned via the current Season’s Battle Pass are now displayed in the Customization menu.</li><li>Locked/Unlocked filter for Calling Cards in the Customization menu now functions as expected.</li><li>Restored functionality of the Select / Deselect All button in the Quick Play menu.</li><li>EMP HUD effects no longer persist upon Wheelson-HS destruction via Stormender.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>GAMEPLAY</h3><ul><li>Resolved an issue causing Akimbo Weapons to be given less reserve ammo than intended following a map infiltration sequence.</li></ul><h3>PROGRESSION</h3><ul><li>Weapon Prestige Camos can now be unlocked for MWII Weapons.</li></ul><h3>MAPS</h3><ul><li>Derail  <ul><li>Added collision to prevent an exploit that allowed players to get in the blue train car near the Crossing area.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>MODES</h3><ul><li>Arcade  <ul><li>EOD Padding no longer reduces incoming explosive damage by power Weapons.</li></ul></li><li>Infected  <ul><li>Blank Perk icons are no longer shown on the HUD upon spawning as a survivor.</li></ul></li><li>One in the Chamber  <ul><li>Weapon Match Stats section of the After-Action Report is no longer empty upon completing a match.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>WEAPONS &amp; ATTACHMENTS</h3><p>Light Machine Guns</p><ul><li>DG-58 LSW  <ul><li>Decreased neck, torso, arm, and hand damage multipliers from 1.1x to 1x.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Marksman Rifles</p><ul><li>Lockwood Mk2  <ul><li>JAK Wardens Conversion Kit  <ul><li>Resolved an issue causing incompatible Attachments to remain equipped in the Gunsmith.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>Handguns</p><ul><li>COR-45  <ul><li>Implemented measures to prevent exploits that allow firing faster than intended.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Attachments</p><ul><li>Adjusted Pros and Cons for multiple Optic Attachments to reflect their true statistics.  <ul><li>Corio Enforcer Optic</li><li>Dragon’s Eye Optic</li><li>KR Marauder 9 Riser</li></ul></li></ul><h3>PERKS</h3><ul><li>High-Gain Antenna (Gear)  <ul><li>Addressed an issue causing Equipment detected by allies with Signal Jammer not to appear indicated on the compass.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>EQUIPMENT</h3><ul><li>Scatter Mine (Tactical)  <ul><li>In Hardcore mode, players equipped with EOD Padding are no longer immune to stun effects.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>FIELD UPGRADES</h3><ul><li>Enhanced Vision Goggles  <ul><li>Player is no longer forced to unequip upon a dead battery, instead, vision is blurred until the goggles are manually removed.</li></ul></li></ul>

<p data-characters="360" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">After more than a decade of celebrating Eorzea,<em> Final Fantasy XIV</em> has accumulated a lengthy calendar of recurring, limited-time events and a few that may be worth timing your sub renewals around. While they aren’t all bangers, with some <em>FFXIV</em> events more akin to an in-universe Fyre Festival, there’s far more good than bad on the yearly schedule. </p> <p data-characters="343" data-current-count="343" data-injectable="false">If you’re trying to prioritize which celebrations to hit, I’ve got a few favorites as personal picks for a top 10 list of best <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> seasonal events. Some are for lore reasons, others are for glam or exclusivity. Regardless, it’s a place for Warriors of Light to begin planning out their own <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ffxiv-event-calendar-seasonal-ongoing-and-announced/"><em>FFXIV </em>event calendar</a>.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">10. The Maiden’s Rhapsody</h2> <figure data-wp-context="{ &quot;core&quot;: 				{ &quot;image&quot;: 					{   &quot;imageLoaded&quot;: false, 						&quot;initialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;hideAnimationEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;preloadInitialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxAnimation&quot;: &quot;zoom&quot;, 						&quot;imageUploadedSrc&quot;: &quot;https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/FFXIV-FF14-FFXI-FF11-Crossover-Event.png&quot;, 						&quot;imageCurrentSrc&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;targetWidth&quot;: &quot;2563&quot;, 						&quot;targetHeight&quot;: &quot;1455&quot;, 						&quot;scaleAttr&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;dialogLabel&quot;: &quot;Enlarged image&quot; 					} 				} 			}" data-wp-interactive="" data-current-count="643" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Memoro de la Ŝtono (Screenshot by Destructoid)</figcaption> <div data-wp-body="" data-wp-bind--role="selectors.core.image.roleAttribute" data-wp-bind--aria-label="selectors.core.image.dialogLabel" data-wp-class--initialized="context.core.image.initialized" data-wp-class--active="context.core.image.lightboxEnabled" data-wp-class--hideanimationenabled="context.core.image.hideAnimationEnabled" data-wp-bind--aria-modal="selectors.core.image.ariaModal" data-wp-effect="effects.core.image.initLightbox" data-wp-on--keydown="actions.core.image.handleKeydown" data-wp-on--touchstart="actions.core.image.handleTouchStart" data-wp-on--touchmove="actions.core.image.handleTouchMove" data-wp-on--touchend="actions.core.image.handleTouchEnd" data-wp-on--click="actions.core.image.hideLightbox" tabindex="-1"> <p> <figure><figcaption>Memoro de la Ŝtono (Screenshot by Destructoid)</figcaption></figure> </p> <p> <figure><figcaption>Memoro de la Ŝtono (Screenshot by Destructoid)</figcaption></figure> </p>  </div></figure>
 <p data-characters="375" data-current-count="375" data-injectable="false">While <em>FFXIV’s</em> Version 1.0 disaster launch remains talked about to this day, there’s a better, happier origin story for <em>Final Fantasy’s</em> roots in the MMO space thanks to <em>Final Fantasy XI</em>. In honor of that legacy, the <em>FFXIV </em>event for its older online sibling, The Maiden’s Rhapsody, revisits the<em> Final Fantasy XI: Rhapsodies of Vana’diel</em> scenario. </p> <p data-characters="450" data-current-count="825" data-injectable="true">The <em>FFXI </em>questline bookends Vana’diel’s story with chief priestess Iroha, and in the <em>FFXIV </em>collaboration event, we learn more about her adventures and how she stumbled into Eorzea. You aren’t going to stuff over a decade’s worth of history from the eleventh game into a brief crossover, but it’s packed with nods to the classic MMO that make it a poignant, even nostalgic, event for those both familiar and unfamiliar. </p>
 <p data-characters="238" data-current-count="238" data-injectable="false">It’s not often this one rolls around, so check it out when you see The Maiden’s Rhapsody pop up on the<em> FFXIV</em> schedule. If not for the beautiful ode to online<em> Final Fantasy</em> of yore, then at least do it for the Amatsu gear set. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">9. A Nocturne for Heroes</h2> <figure data-current-count="538" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Great Value Noctis. (Screenshot by Destructoid)</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="340" data-current-count="340" data-injectable="false">Alright, for the sake of honesty — I don’t<em> like </em>this event or the tasks involved. Noctis desperately needs that <em>Dawntrail</em> facelift, he looks a little too much like just some Hyur wearing the ‘fit. That said, I love the horrendous car mount, the Regalia Type-G, that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ffxiv-ffxv-crossover-event-returns-february-28-with-regaila-car-mou/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>FFXIV’s </em>A Nocturne for Heroes</a> crossover event rewards.</p> <p data-characters="387" data-current-count="727" data-injectable="true">Regardless of how you or I feel about <em>Final Fantasy XV</em> and its bizarre we-have-Noctis-at-home NPC, the mount is a neat, limited-time ride that seats you and three friends. It could really use an obnoxious horn for full effect, but the Regalia and the other <em>FFXV</em>-inspired goodies (Noctis glamour and Orchestrion rolls) make for a fairly generous affair as far as <em>FFXIV’s</em> events go. </p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">8. Make it Rain Campaign</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>The /Gratuity emote. (Screenshot by Destructoid)</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="117" data-current-count="417" data-injectable="true">There has never been a better time to monotonously slap the Cuff-a-Cur machine than during the Make it Rain campaign.</p>
 <p data-characters="413" data-current-count="413" data-injectable="true">There’s one other event on this list that’s probably more efficient for grinding MGP, but I won’t say no to another opportunity. With every year’s celebration of the<em> FFXIV</em> Gold Saucer, the mini-game hub gets a +50% increase to MGP rewards earned through the usual activities. The event also discounts some items that typically cost way more in MGP, so you can make the most of your gains. </p>
 <p data-characters="469" data-current-count="469" data-injectable="true">Even if not for the MGP grinding, it’s a favorite of mine just for the exclusive rewards. I’ve regularly used the Show Left and Show Right emotes to celebrate friends’ in-game achievements for the last couple of years now, and the event also introduced another beloved hairstyle, the Rainmaker. Ask your post-<em>Stormblood </em>era friends about how annoying it was they missed out on that one, until Square Enix mercifully added the up-do again years later. </p>

The Path Infernal is <em>FFXIV’s </em>crossover with <em>Final Fantasy XVI,</em> and not only does it give you Torgal as a big ole boy to use a mount, but it also rewards a tiny, sweet baby Torgal as a minion. That’s two good boys for maybe a half-hour of work.</p>
 <p data-characters="317" data-current-count="317" data-injectable="false">There’s also the Clive glamour set, and it’s cool and all, but it doesn’t get much better than giving my catgirl two dog best friends.

 <p data-characters="389" data-current-count="389" data-injectable="false">Depending on when you ask me, the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-get-every-ffxiv-yokai-watch-reward/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>FFXIV</em> and <em>Yo-Kai Watch</em> </a>collaboration event is either the bane of my existence, or it’s the coolest crossover the game has ever had. Since I’m done with it, and only had to grab the new Framer’s Kit this time around in <em>Endwalker</em>, I’ve got a more tame response. It’s good; it’s not my favorite event, but it’s good.</p> <p data-characters="400" data-current-count="789" data-injectable="true">Before the days of an abundance of rampaging Blue Mages, I ground out its original offerings and<em> hated</em> it. In hindsight, I didn’t have to go that damn hard, and offering so many glamour weapons, minions, and mounts from one seasonal event is not <em>FFXIV’s</em> usual affair. It’s definitely one of the things that make the<em> FFXV </em>and<em> Yo-Kai Watch</em> events better than they would be otherwise. </p>
 <p data-characters="452" data-current-count="452" data-injectable="true">Ultimately, if you’re like me and all done or you just don’t care, it’s still a benefit. The hordes of folks always FATE-grinding in the event zones is nice if you’re working on older Relic weapons or even just achievement hunting. I managed to clean up the last of my <em>Heavensward</em> relic checklist thanks to this round of participants, and I’m hoping it’ll return again in <em>Dawntrail</em> with weapons for Sage and Reaper. </p>

I’ve played FFXIV 2.0 since beta, but this one is among the few seasonal events that I’ve never missed thanks to a brief break or just forgetting. </p>
 <p data-characters="473" data-current-count="473" data-injectable="true">And while I do love suiting up in a swimsuit before loading into the cutscene where it’s the Scions versus God, I’m really all about the Moonfire Faire because of the Eorzean Nimble Warrior obstacle course. It first debuted in 2018, but ever since then, I’ve jumped at every opportunity to race friends and strangers to the top. Perhaps it’s the limited nature, but it’s the only puzzle like it in the game that doesn’t make me see red. </p>
 <p data-characters="275" data-current-count="275" data-injectable="false">Also, the 2023 Moonfire Faire, referenced in the image above, gave us Sicard and Emmanellain bickering on the side of the obstacle course.

 <h2 data-injectable="false">4. Starlight Celebration</h2> <p data-characters="505" data-current-count="505" data-injectable="true"><em>Final Fantasy XIV’s </em>first expansion introducing the city-state of Ishgard ushered in an era of ‘peace’ with the conclusion of the Dragonsong War, and the nation’s citizens learning to live alongside dragonkind. But the war was just one front of the country’s real cruelty, and the Starlight Festival —<em> Final Fantasy’s</em> equivalent of the winter holidays — is borne from a handful of Temple Knights’ decision to ignore authority and do what they see as right. </p>
 <p data-characters="483" data-current-count="483" data-injectable="true">In an era of Eorzea long before our own and in the midst of war, all of the violence left a staggering amount of Ishgard’s children orphaned. While the Holy See forbade its knights from caring for them, some soldiers began hiding orphans in their oversized uniforms and sneaking them into their barracks. It kept the children safe during harsh months of deadly cold. Those who survived thanks to a brave few, celebrated the knights from then on with the Starlight Celebration. </p>
 <p data-characters="349" data-current-count="349" data-injectable="false">The seasonal event spends most of its time handing out Santa-inspired outfits or cutesy mounts, but the backstory still comes up in its yearly celebration. You can also find references to those involved in the Firmament questline and lore book series. It’s one of my favorite little lore tidbits that seems to pay off a little more every year.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">3.

 <p data-characters="416" data-current-count="416" data-injectable="true">Halloween is my favorite real-life celebration, and that easily translates into<em> FFXIV </em>with the yearly All Saints’ Wake festivities. I’ve always enjoyed just about every mount, minion, glamour, and spooky-themed furnishing Square Enix releases for the occasion, but I’m mostly here for the opportunity to take <em>a lot</em> of screenshots of Estinien, Aymeric, and Y’shtola doing Hydaelyn-knows-what. </p>
 <p data-characters="417" data-current-count="417" data-injectable="true">If you’ve got no idea what I’m talking about, then, man, you’ve been missing out on what is arguably the best feature in this whole shindig. I’m only half-kidding, but the All Saints’ Wake celebration typically includes access to an instanced area, The Haunted Manor, where players can transform into their favorite <em>FFXIV</em> characters and control them just as they would their own avatar. </p>
 <p data-characters="250" data-current-count="250" data-injectable="false">Look, I’m not gonna make generalizations about everyone with the Gpose icon above their heads inside the Haunted Manor, but also, the NPC that transforms you is called “The Unsavory Imp.” There’s no good that comes from that. </p> <h2 id="h-2-the-moogle-treasure-trove" data-injectable="false">2.

 <p data-characters="404" data-current-count="404" data-injectable="true">The Moogle Treasure Trove is <em>FFXIV’s</em> usual filler activity between big patches, and every iteration brings a new, lengthy list of rewards that are (typically) a little harder to score. It’s a good time to avoid old Extreme Trial mount grinds and just earn the respective mount through here. Plus, there’s often an exclusive glam reward, like the Mameshiba Neckerchief or Inferno Jacket.</p>
 <p data-characters="496" data-current-count="496" data-injectable="true">All of that’s cool and all, but I’m just here for the MGP. “You should wait for the Moogle Treasure Trove event,” remains my guiding principle for Gold Saucer currency grinding. I know I wrote a whole guide on <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-way-to-get-mgp-ffxiv/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">farming MGP</a> without it, and it’s all solid advice, but I typically just wait for The Moogle Treasure Trove’s unlimited MGP Platinum Card rewards. It’s 50,000 MGP per card, and if you’re diligent, one cycle of this event can net millions. </p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">1.

It’s the big cutscene featuring the Battle of Cartenau, where Louisoix Leveilleur and countless others gave their lives to protect Eorzea from Dalamud’s cataclysmic collision with the continent. I’ve teared up every time I’ve watched that scene. </p>
 <p data-characters="504" data-current-count="504" data-injectable="true">And if there’s one thing to always know about me, it’s that I’m gonna cry. Just like the Starlight Festival and the <em>Final Fantasy XI</em> tribute, The Rising gets me sniffling and snotting. The 2022 and 2023 events, in particular, had me blubbering, as the Warrior of Light welcomed a brand new adventurer to Ul’dah, offering a more meta look at the beginning of someone else’s journey in the MMO. I laughed, I cried, and, more importantly, made that screenshot button work hard.</p>
 <blockquote data-current-count="493" data-injectable="true"> <div><p>Your life is a riddle, to bear gladness and grief,<br>‘Neath stars and through storms, the answers to seek.</p><p>Your footprints are threads, to be gathered and woven,<br>A song of dawn resplendent, dancing high to heavens.</p><p>From the embrace of the gods though mankind has been torn,<br>Upon winds eternal lives and memories are borne.</p><p>The future is unwritten, bring it rapture or sorrow,<br>Our journey shall continue, unto tomorrow and tomorrow.</p></div> <cite>The Wandering Minstrel in The Rising, 2022</cite></blockquote>
 <p data-characters="524" data-current-count="524" data-injectable="false">For me, The Rising gets personal as a chance to reflect on some of the special connections and friendships I’ve made thanks to more than a decade in <em>FFXIV</em>. It’s also a moment to think on how much I’ve changed since I started playing, how much my life has changed. The wink-wink nature of the Wandering Minstrel, Yoshida’s in-universe avatar, is always ready to deliver a gut punch. As a Bard, he’s always got a new tale to share through song, plus a few words of wisdom for your next adventure.</p>

<p data-characters="278" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">One trio – Shifty, DiazBiffle, and Sage – dominated <em>Warzone’s</em> competitive scene in 2023, until the departure of Sage earlier this year. The remaining duo might have already found their third though, adding one of the most decorated players in <em>Warzone</em> history. </p> <p data-characters="321" data-current-count="321" data-injectable="false">On April 11, Sage <a href="https://x.com/aqSage/status/1778275186455765345" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stepped away</a> from OMiTGG and stopped competing in <em>Warzone</em>, leaving Shifty and DiazBiffle without a teammate despite previously winning the 2023 WSOW Global Final in dominant fashion. In Sage’s absence, the remaining duo went out and made a huge splash by landing Tommey as a potential replacement.</p> <p data-characters="397" data-current-count="718" data-injectable="true">Tommey is currently the <a href="https://warzoneearnings.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">highest-earning<em> Warzone</em> player of all time</a>, and previously spent 10 years as a professional <em>CoD </em>player. Last season, Tommey placed third at the 2023 WSOW Global Final, won the Stage 2 Final, and placed second in the Stage 1 Final. Looking at their stacked resumes, it should come as no surprise that this new squad found immediate success in its first official tournament. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Activision</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="252" data-current-count="552" data-injectable="true">In the Oh Mama $30,000 tournament, the trio finished second and received an extra cash prize for getting the highest kills game. Ironically, the squad that came in first was Tommey’s former teammates Almxnd and Newbz, with replacement HisokaT42. </p>
 <p data-characters="426" data-current-count="426" data-injectable="false">This won’t be the last time these two stacked trios go head to head at the top of leaderboards, and it sets up a compelling rivalry moving forward. Based on previous years, the WSOW usually tends to start in June. If the competition uses the same format for 2024, and this new trio of Tommey, Biffle, and Shifty decide to stick it out, we could be in store for an electrifying head-to-head matchup on the biggest stage. </p>

<p data-characters="401" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">As you progress through the Arcana system in <em>Hades 2</em>, you may want to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-activate-arcana-xiii-the-centaur-in-hades-2/">get more out of certain Arcana</a>. While getting a single Death Defiance is nice, having more would be great, especially for some of the later, much more difficult levels. Thankfully, there is a way to do just that. Here’s a full guide on the Moon Dust resource in <em>Hades 2</em>, and how you can use it to get more out of your Arcana.</p> <h2 id="h-what-is-moon-dust-in-hades-2" data-injectable="false">What is Moon Dust in Hades 2?</h2> <p data-characters="388" data-current-count="388" data-injectable="false">Moon Dust is a resource unlocked via completing the Consecration of Ashes Incantation at the Incantation Cauldron. If this Incantation isn’t unlocked for you, you should progress through runs until it is mentioned by Hecate when fighting her. Once you unlock it and spend the resources, make your way to the Meditation location in the equipment room (where you select Arcana cards).</p> <figure data-current-count="688" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Destructoid.</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="459" data-current-count="459" data-injectable="true">Here, you should see a new button you can press in the bottom-right of your screen to reveal Insights. Doing this changes the board and lets you upgrade individual Arcana using this Moon Dust resource. For example, upgrading The Titan Arcana card costs two Moon Dust, and increases the Max Life and Max Magick values from 20 to 30. Each Arcana card has a different Moon Dust cost, with later Arcana upgrades requiring additional resources alongside Moon Dust.</p>
 <h3 id="h-how-to-get-moon-dust" data-injectable="false">How to get Moon Dust</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Destructoid.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="758" data-current-count="1058" data-injectable="true">There are three main ways to get Moon Dust in <em>Hades 2</em>. The first, and easiest, is to <strong>visit the Wretched Broker</strong> in the Crossroads. Here, you can purchase one Moon Dust for 80 Bones, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-farm-bones-in-hades-2/">which are earned either through</a> completing Locations with Bone rewards or by bringing weapons with Grave Thirst applied to them (refer to the Incanatation Gathering of Ancient Bones). Alongside the Wretched Broker, you can spend Obol Points with the <strong>Gold Rewards chest </strong>next to the Wretched Broker. Spending four Obol Points will grant eight Moon Dust in 80 Whiles. The final method won’t come until much later but is the <strong>Moonlit Essence from Shadow recipe</strong> in the Incantation Cauldron. This costs one Shadow and one Cinder but will grant five Moon Dust after eight Whiles.</p>
 <p data-characters="225" data-current-count="225" data-injectable="false">If you want to hard focus one of these, then focusing the Bones for the Wretched Broker is your best bet. It’ll also give you the chance to try out more of the weapon roster, and who doesn’t like a little variety?</p>

                <p>The PS5 might be outselling its chief competitor, but it seems that its overall sales have slowed in recent months. In a <a href="https://www.irwebmeeting.com/sony/fast/20240514/qF9kBTC8/202403_4q_02_en/index.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">recent financial report</a>, Sony said that PS5 sales are down 29% year-over-year in the last fiscal quarter, and it further expects PS5 sales to decrease to 18 million for the fiscal year 2024.</p><p dir="ltr">Sony narrowly missed its revised PS5 sales target of 21 million units sold for fiscal year 2023, with 20.8 million units sold. Needless to say, this means that Sony expects PS5 sales to continue to slow, a stark contrast from the pandemic-era shortages that defined the early years of the console.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Overall, Sony said that cumulative PS5 sales reached 59.2 million units, with 4.5 million units coming in the last quarter. It also noted the success of Helldivers 2 on both PC and PS5, as it sold 12 million copies.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition, Sony recently named two PlayStation CEOs in the wake of Jim Ryan's departure. Hideaki Nishino and Hermen Hulst will serve as joint CEOs, with Nishino heading up Sony Interactive Entertainment's Platform Business Group and Hulst leading the Studio Business group. The former is responsible for technology, products, the platform experience, and third-party developer relations, while the latter is responsible for all PlayStation game content and film/TV adaptations.</p><p dir="ltr">In February of this year, PlayStation cut <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-cutting-900-jobs-in-video-game-industrys-latest-round-of-big-cuts/1100-6521383/">roughly 900 jobs</a> as part of the ongoing wave of mass layoffs in the gaming industry, resulting in the cancellation of multiple projects, including a Twisted Metal live-service game (which wasn't actually greenlit yet). Sony recently named the unlikely smash hit Helldivers 2 as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-fastest-selling-playstation-game-ever/1100-6523423/">fastest-selling PlayStation game</a> ever after changing course on the game's PSN account requirement, which triggered a wide backlash.</p>

<p data-characters="389" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Getting <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-rhino-prime-build-in-warframe/">that right build</a> for a piece of gear in <em>Warframe</em> is challenging. Since there are at least eight mod slots you’re dealing with alongside <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-get-the-shotgun-vendetta-arcane-in-warframe/">an Arcane or two</a>, there’s a lot to consider when it comes to putting a mod setup together. Because of that, you may want a little help to alleviate the endless trial and error. Here’s the best Phantasma Prime build in <em>Warframe</em>.</p> <h2 id="h-the-best-mods-for-the-phantasma-prime-in-warframe" data-injectable="false">The best mods for the Phantasma Prime in Warframe</h2> <p data-characters="270" data-current-count="270" data-injectable="false">The Phantasma Prime is a shotgun with a <strong>high base Status Chance</strong>, the best reload speed of all shotguns, and some great base damage. With this in mind, you should build for Status Chance and Crit, while having a few other mods complementing this. These mods do just that:</p> <ul data-found-items="9" data-current-count="630" data-injectable="true"> <li>Galvanized Acceleration (Exilus)</li> <li>Galvanized Savvy</li> <li>Galvanized Hell</li> <li>Shotgun Barrage</li> <li>Toxic Barrage</li> <li>Primed Chilling Grasp</li> <li>Primed Charged Shell</li> <li>Critical Deceleration</li> <li>Primed Ravage</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="423" data-current-count="423" data-injectable="true">Alongside supporting the Status Chance and Crit, Galvanized Acceleration helps make that beam connect with targets just a little easier. Galvanized Hell and Shotgun Barrage also helps give the weapon a little more staying power and raw DPS. If you don’t have the Galvanized or Primed versions of these mods, feel free to use their regular versions. Just be mindful that this will result in reduced power of the build.</p>
 <h3 id="h-which-arcane-is-worth-using" data-injectable="false">Which Arcane is worth using?</h3> <p data-characters="440" data-current-count="440" data-injectable="false">If you’re looking for raw DPS with the Phantasma Prime, the best Arcane by far is <strong>Primary Deadhead</strong>. Since this shotgun is a beam rather than a spread, targeting headshot kills isn’t too bad. With it only needing to stack three times, and those stacks lasting 24 seconds each, it’s a lot of damage for very little work. While some other Arcanes like Shotgun Vendetta aren’t bad, they aren’t nearly as effective.</p>

  <p id="8rKijb">Choosing the <strong>best class</strong> in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/diablo-4-guides"><em>Diablo 4</em></a> isn’t as simple as choosing a class you think sounds cool. </p>
<p id="3rLELX">Blizzard’s isometric dungeon-crawler features five classes: <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23654868/barbarian-best-build-skills">Barbarian</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/diablo-4-guides/23656235/necromancer-best-build-skills">Necromancer</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/diablo-4-guides/23653283/sorcerer-best-build-skills">Sorcerer</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/diablo-4-guides/23650988/rogue-best-build-skills">Rogue</a>, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/diablo-4-guides/23656236/druid-best-build-skills">Druid</a>. Each class has a unique class mechanic along with a skill tree equipped with a variety of spells. All of their playstyles are different — and compounded by <em>Diablo 4</em>’s complex game of numbers — but which one is the best class for you? </p>
<p id="d5W1z0">In this <em>Diablo 4</em> guide, we’ll explain each of the classes to help you decide <strong>how to pick the best class</strong>. We’ll also tell you the best <em>Diablo 4</em> class for solo players, and the best class for beginners.</p>

<hr id="cAMkQs">

<p id="2sqNqh">There are five <em>Diablo 4</em> classes, and all of them have their own unique playstyle. But before you dive into the game and pick your class, you may be wondering: Which class is the <em>best</em> class in <em>Diablo 4</em>?</p>
<p id="X3AF3F">You may be surprised to learn that this is an impossible question to answer — at least in such simple terms. </p>

<p id="ddThKK">The best class changes season to season. And while Blizzard typically doesn’t make big balance changes during the season itself, it will rebalance classes that are overperforming too much. <strong>So it’s best to avoid picking a class for a specific build and instead try and pick based on the class that interests you most</strong>. Plus, the power levels between the classes really only start to matter at the highest levels of play, which is something most players will never even get close to.</p>
<p id="po1hHj">All that being said, if you do want to know what the current “best class” is and which you should choose, we’ve got some advice for you below.</p>
<hr id="xEK8a0">
<h2 id="e44dYx"><strong>What is the best class to pick for Diablo 4 season 4?</strong></h2>
<p id="YmO3yD">Based on Blizzard’s very first public test realm for <em>Diablo 4</em> season 4, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24147550/diablo-4-d4-season-loot-reborn-patch-notes">Loot Reborn</a>, is debatably the game’s most-balanced season to date. All five classes are looking very good in season 4, so you shouldn’t worry too much about <strong>what the “best” class is</strong> unless you want to compete with your friends. </p>
<p id="OE1Y41">However, it’s worth keeping in mind that all of this is based off of the public test realm, which is only representative of the start of the season. These rankings could change over the coming days, weeks, and months.</p>
<p id="jErwfK">At a glance, here’s our ranking of the classes, from worst to best, for <em>Diablo 4</em> season 4. </p>
<p id="b6noYi">5. Druid<br>4. Rogue<br>3. Barbarian<br>2. Sorcerer<br>1. Necromancer </p>
<div id="9KyyP7"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y9yKl9LI9Qo?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="KnY5XJ">If you’re looking for additional resources and breakdowns on the best builds, <em>Diablo 4</em> content creator <a href="https://youtu.be/Y9yKl9LI9Qo">Raxxanterax</a> has a great video ranking the <em>Diablo 4</em> classes going into season 4. And while his order varies slightly from ours, he’s got some interesting perspectives from his time on the public test realm that are worth checking out.</p>
<p id="3pZoa0"><strong>Druids </strong></p>
<p id="gYfWQv">Druids have one of the strongest builds in season 4, with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/diablo-4-guides/23656236/druid-best-build-skills">Werewolf Tornado</a>. That’s how even the balance is looking for Loot Reborn, that our “worst” class of the season could be one of the strongest if you get a specific build going. However, Druids are still very slow, which can make them hard to stick with, as they’re pretty rough to play before you get your build going.</p>
<p id="uwZkoP"><strong>Rogues</strong></p>
<p id="k2dcIC">Rogues are still extremely good in<em> Diablo 4</em> season 4. However, as always, they take the most effort to play. This is especially true in season 4 when you consider that Necromancers and their partially passive minion build are number one this season. That’s a lot of power for not much effort, which inherently makes something more “high-skilled” like the Rogue fall in value.</p>
<p id="sOB18y"><strong>Barbarians </strong></p>
<p id="QAdkn4">Barbarians are always going to be the best or worse class in the game, just by nature of having four weapons equipped at a time. For season 4, Blizzard nerfed not only some of the Barbarian’s best builds from previous seasons, but also the best build from the test realm version of season 4, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23654868/barbarian-best-build-skills">Double Swing Dust Devils</a>. However, the Dust Devils build still looks very powerful — just not “delete everything on screen and crash your computer” powerful — so Barbs should still be in a great spot.</p>
<div id="VYn0g7"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RnHPr7aCBqk?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="f0WY8x"><strong>Sorcerers </strong></p>
<p id="7VD3YS">Sorcerers are always low health, high damage characters in <em>Diablo 4</em>, but the new item systems and simpler affixes coming to the game in season 4 should help push them into an even cleaner spot when it comes to mixing defense and offense. Plus they’re getting a new <a href="https://www.polygon.com/diablo-4-guides/23653283/sorcerer-best-build-skills">Frozen Orb</a> build in Loot Reborn that looks very fun, and extremely powerful. </p>
<p id="jUtkA2"><strong>Necromancers </strong></p>
<p id="epQZST">Necromancer players have been waiting since <em>Diablo 4</em> launched to have a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/diablo-4-guides/23656235/necromancer-best-build-skills">good minion build</a>, and season 4 finally has one. Blizzard gave massive buffs to Necromancer minions in season 4, allowing you to run around the battlefield and summon a horde of undead monsters to kill stuff rather than having to do it yourself. This season, Necromancers get the double whammy of a relatively simple build to play paired with a ton of strength, making them the best class in the game.</p>
<hr id="f6CRaQ">
<h2 id="RSZH6B"><strong>What is the best class in Diablo 4 for solo players?</strong></h2>
<p id="yb44GT">The <strong>Rogue is likely the best solo class for skilled players </strong>looking to bring themselves through the game — even if you’ll eventually have to work harder in the endgame to compete with Barbarians.</p>
<div id="L8acr5"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nqGKjAfMNYE?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="58R9AU">As a Rogue, you’re highly mobile, stealthy, and are able to fight from both range and melee. You’re also the most versatile class with a huge variety of builds. You are easy to kill, which can make your class difficult to master, but once you’re practiced, you can take on an army of monsters by yourself without slowing down. </p>
<p id="UZpLet">Of course, like the “which class is best for you” section, there is no right answer. You can play all five classes solo, and there is no support class in <em>Diablo 4</em>, only support builds. </p>
<hr id="loaqjN">
<h2 id="lq6JCl"><strong>What is the best class in Diablo 4 for beginners?</strong></h2>
<p id="8dOhAE">The easiest class for beginners is<strong> either the Necromancer or the Barbarian</strong>, and there are pros and cons to each.</p>
<p id="nAturi">The obvious boon for <strong>Necromancer </strong>players is the army of skeletons you have at your disposal. These minions will attack things alongside you and, depending on your build, they can deal very high damage. As a new player, being able to lean on some AI allies all the time is a huge stress reliever. If you mess up your abilities or aren’t sure how to attack and stay alive, you can just focus on keeping yourself safe while your buddies clean out the dungeon. </p>
<div id="a8qHV0"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/olFtCvxi3gk?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="9Udk8x">The con here is that Necromancers technically have two resources to manage, as they cast spells using Essence as well as their unique Corpse mechanic. This can make things a bit overwhelming for new players, as Corpses complicate certain skills and can also visually obscure the ground in dungeons.</p>
<p id="kllx4D"><strong>Barbarians</strong>, on the other hand, are just big, smashy folk trying to do their best to rid Sanctuary of demons. The fantasy and (some of) the playstyles for Barbarians are similarly simple. You’re going to spend a lot of time just running up to monsters and punching them in the face until they die. There are no tricks here. You’re not turning yourself invisible or transforming into a bear. You’re taking a big hammer and you’re smashing stuff. </p>
<div id="KIMcT3"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tDUHT2TxcWA?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="1WjtIl">However, there are two big cons to the Barbarian: one on each end of the play experience. Barbarians are one of the weaker early game classes, and you can die fairly easily when you don’t know what you’re doing. For your suffering, you’ll get to be very powerful in the endgame. But even that comes with a complexity cost, as the reason Barbarians are so strong later in the game is because they are the only class that can wield four weapons at once. This means that you have to find more gear than other classes and you have more powerful Legendary powers to combine together. That’s exciting, but also overwhelming.</p>
<p id="5O4jd6">The great news about<em> Diablo 4 </em>is all the classes — including Druid, Sorcerer, and Rogue — all have simple builds and complex builds. While Barbarian and Necromancer are probably the easiest for most players, they might not be the best first choice for you.</p>

<p id="iIkhB7"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/23654868/barbarian-best-build-skills">Barbarians</a> in <em>Diablo 4</em> are fierce warriors who leap into the fray. As a Barb, your main mechanic is the <strong>Weapon Arsenal</strong>, which allows you to hold four weapons at once. Some of your abilities will require you to have a specific weapon type such as slicing, two-handed, dual-wield, or bludgeoning to use. But for some skills, you can manually <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23508568">switch weapons</a> for different effects. You’ll gain expertise the more you use a certain weapon, which will provide you with buffs like increased critical hit chance or more damage against vulnerable enemies.</p>
<p id="1T49Rl">Not only are you capable of mastering offensive weapons, Barbarians are meant to be bulky bruisers who can take a hit from any foe. With a plethora of shouts and damage reducing abilities, you’ll be spending a lot of time up close and personal due to your survivability.</p>

<p id="hPr2Fn">The Necromancer is a staple for the Diablo series. As a summoner, you’re able to conjure hordes of undead enemies to do your bidding or sacrifice your minions to empower yourself.</p>
<p id="8JesUB">Your unique mechanic is called the <strong>Book of the Dead</strong>, which<strong> </strong>allows you to customize your undead army by selecting what type of skeletons you’ll summon (along with a specialization). You can give your pawns more health, increased damage output, or the ability to deal AoE damage. If you don’t want to manage your minions, you can choose to sacrifice either some or all of your minions to gain a permanent buff. </p>
<p id="xB2PWU">Necromancers have a unique resource that other classes do not have: <strong>corpses </strong>— which, you guessed it, are left behind when enemies die. You also have Essence, which functions similarly to mana, allowing you to cast your regular abilities, but in order to raise minions, you’ll need a corpse. If you’re going the solo show route, you can also detonate the deceased instead.</p>

<p id="6CdsLU"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/diablo-4-guides/23650988/rogue-best-build-skills">Rogues</a> are versatile duelists who can specialize in either ranged or close quarters combat. (If you played the Demon Hunter in <em>Diablo 3</em>, this is the most similar class for <em>Diablo 4</em>). </p>
<p id="i77wCW">Your unique class mechanic is <strong>Specialization</strong>,<strong> </strong>which changes your fundamental abilities and your playstyle. There are three different specializations: <strong>Combo Points</strong>, <strong>Inner Sight</strong>, and <strong>Preparation</strong>.</p>
<p id="hTPhSx">Combo points will increase the damage output of some of your abilities and change how they function by increasing the number of arrows fired or adding a chance to knock down your opponents. Inner Sight will provide you with unlimited energy for a short amount of time when attacking a marked enemy. Preparation allows you to use your ultimate abilities more frequently after spending a lot of your main resource.</p>
<p id="hNNgKd">The Rogue is a mobile class that gives you access to stealth, traps, and imbuements, allowing you to take on any kind of content. You’re able to dart in an out of combat with combination of ranged, melee, and stealth attacks.</p>

<p id="ay6VFZ">The <a href="https://www.polygon.com/diablo-4-guides/23653283/sorcerer-best-build-skills">Sorcerer</a> is your typical ranged caster or fantasy mage. By using the powers of <strong>fire</strong>, <strong>lightning</strong>, and <strong>ice</strong> magic, you can obliterate your opponents. Whether you want to spawn fire hydras or spam chain lightning, you’ll easily take down anyone in your path.</p>
<p id="HNOgYD">Your unique class mechanic is <strong>Enchantment</strong>,<strong> </strong>which will provide your abilities with powerful passive effects that — when slotted into your Enchantment slots — will trigger without you needing to put them on your bar or spend mana. For example, you can cast Fireball using mana to shoot a giant flaming blasts at enemies. But you can also place Fireball into one of your Enchantment slots, which will cause all enemies to explode when you kill them.</p>
<p id="KyD62Z">As a Sorcerer, you’re slightly more frail than the other classes, but you do have a bundle of defensive abilities that can make you (temporarily) unkillable. Encase yourself in ice, surround your body with fire, or simply zip away from danger.</p>

<p id="lRGBgY">Druids missed out on <em>Diablo 3</em>, but have been in the <em>Diablo </em>universe since <em>Diablo 2</em>. As a Druid, you’re are shapeshifters who can transform into a savage werebear or a vicious werewolf while also unleashing nature’s wrath to defeat your foes. Your unique class mechanic is<strong> </strong>the <strong>Spirit Animal system</strong>, which grants your character a boon such as new passives and stat increases.</p>
<p id="n9ckQp">Necromancers are not the only summoners in <em>Diablo 4</em>, as you can also call companions to your aid as a Druid. Summon wolves, ravens, and vines to assist you in defeating the demons scattered around Sanctuary. You’ll also be able to bring forth some of nature’s deadliest calamities such as a hurricane to sweep away your enemies.</p>

  <p id="DQaXKo"><strong>Rogues </strong>are one of the most complex classes in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/diablo-4-guides"><em>Diablo 4</em></a>. With three unique specializations and the ability to fight from any range, putting together a Rogue build is extremely complex.

<p id="foDNN6">Rogues have three weapons on them at all times: a bow and two knives. With these tools, the Rogue can quickly swap between stabbing an enemy at close range and shooting an arrow across the screen.</p>
<p id="qQ6wAk">In this <em>Diablo 4</em> guide, we’ve gathered and simplified <strong>the best </strong><em><strong>Diablo 4 </strong></em><strong>Rogue builds for season 4</strong>.

<p id="cfQSwL">This build is based off <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/lexyu/">Lexyu</a>’s Rogue leveling guide at <a href="https://www.icy-veins.com/d4/guides/rogue-leveling-guide/">IcyVeins</a>, and is purely for leveling: i.e., allocating your 58 skill points between levels 1 and 50. If you want more detailed information about the item affixes you want to look for on your gear, or which other Legendary powers are great for your build, check out the original <a href="https://www.icy-veins.com/d4/guides/rogue-leveling-guide/">IcyVeins guide</a>.</p>
<h3 id="3uBOW7"><strong>Best skills for leveling</strong></h3>
<p id="Bm17wV">Rogues specialize in both ranged and melee, but this leveling build focuses entirely on knife skills. This build specifically utilizes <strong>Twisting Blades</strong> as your primary skill. In this build, you’ll also use <strong>Puncture</strong>, <strong>Dash</strong>, <strong>Shadow Step</strong>, <strong>Concealment</strong>, and <strong>Shadow Imbuement</strong>.</p>
<p id="hSqHKY">Here are the best skills for a Rogue leveling build, organized by the exact order you should purchase them in — bearing in mind that some skills require you to allocate a number of skill points in the tree in order to unlock them. As such, you’ll need to unlock new skills before enhancing existing ones:</p>
<ol>
<li id="WfPQzV">Puncture / Enhanced Puncture</li>
<li id="Qfo1lF">Twisting Blades</li>
<li id="DoAP46">Fundamental Puncture</li>
<li id="uevQAK">Enhanced Twisting Blades / Improved Twisting Blades</li>
<li id="NZt7fQ">Dash</li>
<li id="bgc7jl">Shadow Step</li>
<li id="oPTFr4">Twisting Blades (rank 2-4)</li>
<li id="oi1UTz">Concealment / Enhanced Stealth / Countering Stealth</li>

<li id="5OdzPZ">Trick Attacks (rank 1-3)</li>
<li id="Q1WrFf">Concussive (rank 2)</li>
<li id="3o1UfK">Close Quarters Combat</li>
<li id="J7tRCW">Concussive (rank 3)</li>

<li id="bl2wKO">Impetus (rank 1-2)</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="WzlfSe"><strong>Best Specialization setup for leveling</strong></h3>
<p id="tbYrO7">Once you unlock your first Specialization at level 15 — <strong>Combo Points</strong> — you’ll stick with it through the leveling process. The only exception here is that, if you know you’re going up against a big boss, you can swap to <strong>Inner Sight</strong> to help increase your damage. </p>
<h3 id="vgooTx"><strong>Best Legendary Aspects for Rogues leveling build</strong></h3>
<p id="wzErla">When you first start your new character, complete these three dungeons first in order to collect their <a href="https://www.polygon.com/diablo-4-guides/23768833/aspects-dungeons-locations-list-codex">Aspects</a>. Then place them on a piece of gear (ideally jewelry, when possible). Just keep in mind that you should replace these Legendaries with new versions using the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/diablo-4-guides/23654101/aspects-codex-power-occultist-extract-imprint">imprint system</a> every few levels.</p>
<ul>
<li id="kBLhHJ">
<strong>Bladedancer’s Aspect</strong> (Jalal’s Virgil in Scosglen) — Twisting Blades orbit for a short time after they return to you, dealing 10-15% of Twisting Blades’ return damage per hit. Based on the distance the blades returned, the orbit damage increases up to 20-30% of the return damage.</li>
<li id="SKeC2z">
<strong>Edgemaster’s Aspect</strong> (Oldstones dungeon in Scosglen) — Skills deal X% increased damage based on Primary Resource when cast, receiving the maximum benefit while you have full Primary Resource</li>
<li id="8bONxs">
<strong>Aspect of the Expectant</strong> (Underroot dungeon in Scosglen) — Attacking enemies with a Basic Skill increases the damage of your next Core Skill cast by X% up to X%</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="uKGcKu"><strong>Paragon Boards for Rogue Shadow Step build</strong></h3>

<li id="NsCfXP">Tricks of the Trade / Closer Glyph</li>
<li id="M3MYWu">No Witnesses / Versatility Glyph</li>
<li id="9EkKYD">Cheap Shot / Control Glyph</li>
<li id="MFfD2i">Deadly Ambush / Ambush</li>
<li id="FdGtX5">Eldritch Bounty</li>
</ol>
<p id="bsj6oK">You should level your Glyphs to 21 in this specific order:</p>
<ol>
<li id="SCnoL6">Ambush</li>
<li id="Rh3CGQ">Closer</li>
<li id="MkyYQD">Control</li>
<li id="SoMhuV">Exploit</li>
<li id="5Hrt2S">Turf</li>
<li id="7ZnpCj">Versatility</li>
</ol>
<p id="nsYJP8">You can path your own way through the Paragon Boards following these basic guidelines. However, for the best results, follow <a href="https://maxroll.gg/d4/build-guides/shadow-step-rogue-guide">M1PY’s path</a> exactly.</p>

<p id="91X17S">Rogues are the classic bow-wielders in <em>Diablo 4</em>. But they’re also much more than that. Instead of just slinging arrows, they also utilize stealth, traps, and knives. This makes them one of <em>Diablo 4</em>’s most versatile classes, and also gives them several different build paths to take:</p>
<ul>
<li id="TQuMBT">Momentum</li>
<li id="fNsMb4">Melee</li>
<li id="uf2HQH">Precision</li>
<li id="p030jH">Vulnerable</li>
<li id="NBQ9U1">Trap</li>
</ul>
<p id="c6pXrK"><strong>Melee</strong>-specific builds have a few options. They can use the <strong>Momentum Key Passive</strong> to deal additional damage and gain bonus effects when backstabbing enemies or attacking those impacted by certain crowd control effects, like Stunned Dazed, or Frozen. Similarly, the <strong>Close Quarters Combat Key Passive</strong> gives you bonuses for using certain skills on enemies that are nearby.</p>
<p id="wi20SW">For <strong>ranged </strong>builds, <strong>Precision </strong>is your best bet. Hitting a critical hit on an enemy with Marksman skills increases your crit chance drastically over time. </p>
<p id="pPCMRA">Then there are Rogue’s <strong>status </strong>builds. The <strong>Victimize Key Passive</strong> causes hits on Vulnerable enemies to create an explosion. The <strong>Exposure Key Passive</strong> gives a small chance for some massive buffs when the Rogue deals damage with a trap.</p>
<p id="H5oR7p">The important thing to remember when building your own Rogue build is that mobility and versatility are your friends. The Key Passives here aren’t entire identities on their own the way some other classes are. Instead, they’re huge bonuses that can fit into multiple playstyles. While making your Rogue, figure out which skills you want to use and which Specializations you want to use first, then pick out your Key Passive once you reach the end.</p>

<p id="kAtIMU">Necromancers are able to summon Skeletons and Golems. But they’re also able to cast Sorcerer-like spells dealing in the creepier sides of magic. They can sling bones and drain blood from foes. They can even project poison blight on the ground. And, yes, they can sacrifice minions for incredible bonuses with the Book of the Dead.</p>
<p id="wDeXqI">In this<em> Diablo 4</em> guide, we’ve gathered and simplified <strong>the best </strong><em><strong>Diablo 4</strong></em><strong> Necromancer builds for season 4</strong>.

<p id="cfQSwL">This build is based off <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/GhazzyTV/">GhazzyTV</a>’s Necromancer leveling guide at <a href="https://www.icy-veins.com/d4/guides/necromancer-leveling-guide/">IcyVeins</a>, and is purely for leveling: i.e., allocating your 58 skill points between levels 1 and 50.

<h3 id="3uBOW7"><strong>Best skills for leveling</strong></h3>
<p id="Bm17wV">Necromancer leveling guides use the absolute powerhouse of a skill: <strong>Bone Spear</strong>. Bone Spear is both extremely versatile and deals massive damage, hence why we rank it up so quickly. In this build, you’ll also use <strong>Bone Splinters</strong>, <strong>Corpse Explosion</strong>, <strong>Blood Mist</strong>, and <strong>Decrepify — </strong>as well as both Golem and Skeleton skills.</p>
<p id="hSqHKY">Here are the best skills for a Necromancer leveling build, organized by the exact order you should purchase them in — bearing in mind that some skills require you to allocate a number of skill points in the tree in order to unlock them. As such, you’ll need to unlock new skills before enhancing existing ones. </p>
<p id="P4a6Fn"><strong>Note</strong>: GhazzyTV’s guide recommends starting with <strong>Blood Surge</strong> and transitioning to <strong>Bone Spear</strong> after level 15.</p>
<ol>
<li id="WiZ6Zb">Bone Splinters / Enhanced Bone Splinters </li>
<li id="xZ8fs9">Blood Surge (rank 1-5) — <strong>Replace with Bone Spear (rank 1-5) after level 15</strong>
</li>
<li id="vS4ku7">Corpse Explosion / Enhanced Corpse Explosion</li>
<li id="6N0fb4">Hewed Flesh (rank 1-3)</li>
<li id="aW2ETb">Grim Harvest (rank 1-3)</li>
<li id="C9hT5K">Enhanced Bone Spear / Supernatural Bone Spear</li>
<li id="6BTNuw">Corpse Explosion (rank 2-5)</li>
<li id="N2Y9Po">Skeletal Warrior Mastery (rank 1-3)</li>

<li id="pLEpO7">Evulsion (rank 1-3)</li>
<li id="RYZHk5">Unliving Energy</li>
<li id="nW5BTv">Ossified Essence</li>
<li id="Al7n4F">Unliving Energy (rank 2-3)</li>
<li id="d9VkT5">Fueled by Death (rank 1-3)</li>
<li id="RfhYPD">Blood Mist</li>
<li id="OgttNm">Compound Fracture (rank 2-3)</li>
<li id="P9ZEV7">Imperfectly Balanced (rank 1-3)</li>
<li id="YUWzGE">Decrepify / Enhanced Decrepify</li>

<li id="sRRKPo">Amplify Damage (rank 1-3)</li>
<li id="qZnYUw">Decrepify (rank 2-3)</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="WzlfSe"><strong>Best Book of the Dead setup for leveling</strong></h3>
<p id="tbYrO7">While sacrificing your minions is the common play for endgame builds, most builds actually use minions while leveling, and this build is not different. Here are the minions you should use for this build:</p>
<ul>
<li id="HLcS2Z">Melee Skeletons – <strong>Reapers</strong>
</li>
<li id="Wb6ujL">Mage Skeletons – <strong>Cold</strong>
</li>
<li id="5e4Ig1">Golem – <strong>Bone </strong>(change to <strong>Iron </strong>as you get closer to 50)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="vgooTx"><strong>Best Legendary Aspect for Necromancer leveling build</strong></h3>
<p id="wzErla">GhazzyTV’s build only recommends a single Legendary Aspect while leveling.</p>
<p id="QDzUsu">When you first start your new character, complete one dungeon first in order to collect its <a href="https://www.polygon.com/diablo-4-guides/23768833/aspects-dungeons-locations-list-codex">Aspect</a>. Then place it on a piece of gear (ideally jewelry, when possible). Just keep in mind that you should replace this Legendary with a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/diablo-4-guides/23654101/aspects-codex-power-occultist-extract-imprint">new version using the imprint system</a> every few levels.</p>
<ul><li id="kBLhHJ">
<strong>Splintering Aspect</strong> (Guulrahn Slums dungeon in Dry Steppes) — Bone Spear’s primary attack makes enemies hit beyond the first Vulnerable for 1.5 seconds. Bone Shards from Bone Spear deal 50% bonus damage to vulnerable enemies and pierce them.</li></ul>
<hr id="uoNF7p">
<h2 id="GDU6xB"><strong>Best Necromancer endgame build for season 4 — Minions</strong></h2>
<p id="3GEiw1">This build is based off of <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/chronikztr">Chronikz</a>’s Necromancer endgame guide at <a href="https://maxroll.gg/d4/build-guides/minion-necromancer-guide">MaxRoll.gg</a>, and is a general endgame guide capable of finding success in all activities. This guide assumes that you’re over level 50, have access to all 58 skill points, and are making progress on your Paragon Boards.

<h3 id="2fMRf4"><strong>Best skill points for Necromancer Minion build for endgame</strong></h3>
<p id="Ajy4fL">This build utilizes <strong>Raise Skeleton </strong>as its core skill and main means of dealing damage. It also utilizes <strong>Golem</strong>, <strong>Decrepify</strong>, <strong>Bone Prison</strong>, <strong>Corpse Tendrils</strong>, and <strong>Army of the Dead</strong>.</p>
<p id="7wk9vR">Since you need all 58 points for this build, the order you select these skills in doesn’t matter as long as you have the pre-requisite points in the earlier skill tree tiers. Here is how you should spend your skill points for this build:</p>
<ul>
<li id="rNgfii">Reap / Enhanced Reap</li>
<li id="lThLqt">Blight / Enhanced Blight / Supernatural Blight</li>

<h3 id="ZlH0wB"><strong>Book of the Dead setup for Necromancer Minion build</strong></h3>
<p id="mU4L6l">For this build, <strong>do not sacrifice your minions</strong>. Here are the specializations you want to pick for all three minions in your Book of the Dead:</p>
<ul>
<li id="vFAIM6">Defenders</li>
<li id="fJJj88">Cold</li>
<li id="4wVrcD">Iron</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3KGghz"><strong>Legendary Powers and Uniques for Necromancer Minion build</strong></h3>

<strong>Helm</strong>: Juggernaut’s Aspect</li>

<p id="9y7fhE">If you want to get into the nitty gritty of stat priorities, refer to <a href="https://maxroll.gg/d4/build-guides/minion-necromancer-guide">Chronikz’s original guide</a>.  </p>
<h3 id="kMSNCX"><strong>Paragon Boards for Necromancer Minion build</strong></h3>
<p id="hM6DRX">The Paragon Board system is very complex, and you’ll want to carefully pair your Glyphs with specific boards for your class:</p>
<ol>
<li id="MGhKwJ">Starter Board / Amplify Glyph</li>
<li id="4y2ekE">Cult Leader / Deadraiser Glyph</li>
<li id="NsCfXP">Hulking Monstrosity / Golem Glyph</li>
<li id="M3MYWu">Bone Graft / Essence Glyph</li>
<li id="wrCL8X">Flesh-eater / Corporeal Glyph</li>
<li id="9EkKYD">Scent of Death / Exploit Glyph</li>
<li id="J5thzJ">Wither / Territorial Glyph</li>
</ol>
<p id="bsj6oK">You should level your Glyphs to 15 in this specific order:</p>
<ol>
<li id="SCnoL6">Golem</li>
<li id="bXQZsm">Corporeal </li>
<li id="fXWOzY">Exploit</li>
<li id="pBWIcA">Territorial</li>
<li id="ZkCkRO">Essence</li>
<li id="nTIuOx">Deadraiser</li>
<li id="HgsKMg">Amplify</li>
</ol>
<p id="nsYJP8">You can path your own way through the Paragon Boards following these basic guidelines. However, for the best results, follow <a href="https://maxroll.gg/d4/build-guides/minion-necromancer-guide">Chronikz’s path</a> exactly.</p>

<p id="wzYlJX">Necromancer’s are <em>Diablo 4</em>’s main summoning class — although Druids, ironically, had better summons during the game’s launch window. But aside from their army of minions, Necromancers also act as a darker caster, sharing a lot of playstyle DNA with the Sorcerer.</p>
<p id="JZGvYm">Like all classes, most Necromancer builds boil down to a few Key Passives:</p>
<ul>
<li id="MySBk1">Bone</li>
<li id="ryE2Z8">Blood/Health</li>
<li id="xbByST">Shadow</li>
<li id="OfYHi6">Minion</li>
</ul>
<p id="ZoxX03"><strong>Bone</strong> skills — like Bone Spear — hit extremely hard for Necromancers, and are great for chunking down enemies. The <strong>Ossified Essence Key Passive</strong> modifies that damage even further for players that successfully pool their Essence. <strong>Blood </strong>builds utilize Blood skills to both keep the Necromancer healthy while dealing big damage. These builds typically end with the <strong>Rathma’s Vigor Key Passive</strong>.</p>
<p id="WjxVLZ"><strong>Shadow </strong>builds use Shadow skills to poison enemies with dark essence. Interestingly, the <strong>Shadowblight Key Passive</strong> not only benefits the Necromancer, but also their minions, making it a more diverse build path. <strong>Minion </strong>builds are Necromancer’s main bread and butter, but are entirely dependent on how good minions are in the current meta. When they’re useful, these builds end with the <strong>Kalan’s Edict Key Passive</strong>.</p>
<p id="VYSleq">Like all classes, Necromancer builds have other identities to them — like <strong>Thorns </strong>— but most will converge on one of the four identities highlighted above. What really determines build viability on Necromancer is how you use your minions and the <strong>Book of the Dead</strong>. If you want to make your own build, decide early on if you want to sacrifice your minions or use them in battle. This will not only determine which skills you’ll want to use, but which of the four Key Passives you want to angle toward.</p>

<p id="cfQSwL">This build is based off <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/lexyu/">Lexyu</a>’s Sorcerer leveling guide at <a href="https://www.icy-veins.com/d4/guides/sorcerer-leveling-guide/">IcyVeins</a>, and is purely for leveling: i.e., allocating your 58 skill points between levels 1 and 50. If you want more detailed information about the item affixes you want to look for on your gear, or which other Legendary powers are great for your build, check out the original <a href="https://www.icy-veins.com/d4/guides/sorcerer-leveling-guide/">IcyVeins guide</a>.</p>
<h3 id="3uBOW7"><strong>Best skills for leveling</strong></h3>
<p id="Bm17wV">This Sorcerer build guide is going to see you harness the awesome power of Lightning to speed through the leveling process.

<p id="hSqHKY">Here are the best skills for a Sorcerer leveling build, organized by the exact order you should purchase them in — bearing in mind that some skills require you to allocate a number of skill points in the tree in order to unlock them.

<h3 id="WzlfSe"><strong>Best Enchantment setup for leveling</strong></h3>
<p id="ti9SOs">The Enchantment slot is key to a ton of your damage as a Sorcerer. You’ll gain two slots as you level, here’s which spell you want to put in each slot:</p>
<ul>
<li id="YYmZKK">Level 15: <strong>Fireball</strong>
</li>
<li id="ljD1kU">Level 30:<strong> Chain Lightning</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="vgooTx"><strong>Best Legendary Aspects for Sorcerer leveling build</strong></h3>
<p id="wzErla">When you first start your new character, complete these three dungeons first in order to collect their <a href="https://www.polygon.com/diablo-4-guides/23768833/aspects-dungeons-locations-list-codex">Aspects</a>. Then place them on a piece of gear (ideally jewelry, when possible). Just keep in mind that you should replace these Legendaries with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/diablo-4-guides/23654101/aspects-codex-power-occultist-extract-imprint">new versions using the imprint system</a> every few levels.</p>
<ul>
<li id="kBLhHJ">
<strong>Recharging Aspect</strong> (Zenith in Fractured Peaks) — Each time Chain Lightning bounces off you, gain X Mana</li>
<li id="8bONxs">
<strong>Aspect of Control</strong> (Sunken Library in Kehjistan) — You deal X% more damage to Immobilized, Stunned, or Frozen enemies</li>
<li id="SKeC2z">
<strong>Edgemaster’s Aspect</strong> (Oldstones dungeon in Scosglen) — Skills deal X% increased damage based on Primary Resource when cast, receiving the maximum benefit while you have full Primary Resource</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li id="DiizRM">Frozen Orb</li>
<li id="7HR4ij">Fire Bolt</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3KGghz"><strong>Legendary Powers and Uniques for Sorcerer Frozen Orb build</strong></h3>

<h3 id="kMSNCX"><strong>Paragon Boards for Sorcerer Frozen Orb build</strong></h3>
<p id="hM6DRX">The Paragon Board system is very complex, and you’ll want to carefully pair your Glyphs with specific boards for your class:</p>
<ol>
<li id="MGhKwJ">Starter Board / Elementalist Glyph</li>
<li id="4y2ekE">Enhancement Master / Reinforced Glyph</li>
<li id="NsCfXP">Icefall / Control Glyph</li>
<li id="M3MYWu">Burning Instinct / Destruction Glyph</li>
<li id="9EkKYD">Ceaseless Conduit / Flamefeeder Glyph</li>
<li id="IwIOPQ">Frigid Fate / Tactician Glyph</li>
<li id="ifLBhO">Searing Heat / Exploit Glyph</li>
</ol>
<p id="bsj6oK">You should level your Glyphs to 15 in this specific order:</p>
<ol>
<li id="SCnoL6">Control</li>
<li id="DFi8LT">Elementalist</li>
<li id="ItJDdn">Destruction</li>
<li id="OX4X4p">Flamefeeder</li>
<li id="lY1Lc6">Exploit</li>
<li id="tvwDpS">Reinforced</li>
<li id="uQo5PT">Tactician</li>
</ol>
<p id="nsYJP8">You can path your own way through the Paragon Boards following these basic guidelines. However, for the best results, follow <a href="https://maxroll.gg/d4/build-guides/frozen-orb-sorcerer-guide">Northwar’s path</a> exactly.</p>

<p id="91X17S">Sorcerers are <em>Diablo 4</em>’s pure caster class, and use elemental magic to differentiate from the  spells of the Druid and Necromancer. The Sorcerer has six Key Passives, but only three elements, which is what you’ll base your build around:</p>
<ul>
<li id="7TI4Ky">Lightning</li>
<li id="nQ5vv2">Fire</li>
<li id="Wlq3y2">Ice</li>
</ul>
<p id="lvQbFf"><strong>Lightning</strong> builds utilize Lightning skills to deal with large groups of enemies at once. When making a Lightning build, you’ll end up using the <strong>Overflowing Energy Key Passive</strong> or the <strong>Vyr’s Master Key Passive</strong>, depending on if you’re in melee range or not.</p>
<p id="y2SMwp"><strong>Ice</strong> builds specialize in slowing enemies down, making it easier to survive their attacks. Ice builds will take advantage of either the<strong> Avalanche Key Passive</strong> or the<strong> Shatter Key Passive</strong>, depending on how much your build relies on crowd control</p>
<p id="Q9honF"><strong>Fire</strong> builds are all about big explosions and burning your enemies. For these builds, you’ll typically use either the <strong>Combustion Key Passive</strong> for burning enemies or the <strong>Esu’s Ferocity Key Passive</strong> for chunky critical strikes.</p>
<p id="eGofyn">When making your own build for a Sorcerer, you’ll likely end up sticking to one element for your main damage sources. But that’s not the most important thing you need to remember. Sorcerers die very, very easily in<em> Diablo 4</em>, and they have the weakest defensive stats by far — however, they can deal a massive amount of damage when built correctly. If you don’t want to end up dead more often than not, make sure to invest heavily in defensive skills while making your way toward one of the six Key Passives we listed above.</p>

  <p id="DQaXKo"><strong>Barbarians</strong> are a relatively simple class in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/diablo-4-guides"><em>Diablo 4</em></a>: They smash stuff. However, <em>Diablo 4</em> is underscored by math that’s so complex that even the simple act of smashing stuff becomes a dizzying equation. That’s where we come in, with our suggestions of the best Barbarian builds for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24147550/diablo-4-d4-season-loot-reborn-patch-notes"><em>Diablo 4</em> season 4</a>. </p>
<p id="eFKRQo">Barbarians are big, muscular, and powerful. They excel at using Bleed to kill their enemies over time. And their unique weapon-swapping system means they get to have more Legendary powers at their disposal than any other class.</p>
<p id="KIZEyS">In this <em>Diablo 4</em> guide, we’ve gathered and simplified <strong>the best </strong><em><strong>Diablo 4 </strong></em><strong>Barbarian builds for season 4</strong>. If you need even more information on item affixes or other more complex ideas, we’ve been sure to link out to the more detailed versions of these builds, as well as where to find their original creators. </p>

<p id="cfQSwL">This build is based off <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/lexyu/">Lexyu</a>’s Barbarian leveling guide at <a href="https://www.icy-veins.com/d4/guides/barbarian-leveling-guide/">IcyVeins</a>, and is purely for leveling: i.e., allocating your 58 skill points between levels 1 and 50.

<h3 id="3uBOW7"><strong>Best skills for leveling</strong></h3>
<p id="Bm17wV">Most Barbarian leveling guides you’ll find make use of <strong>Hammer of the Ancients</strong> as your primary skill, as it deals massive damage while remaining very cheap to cast. In this build, you’ll also use <strong>Frenzy</strong>, <strong>Death Blow</strong>, <strong>Rallying Cry</strong>, <strong>Leap</strong>, and <strong>Wrath of the Berserker</strong>.</p>
<p id="hSqHKY">Here are the best skills for a Barbarian leveling build, organized by the exact order you should purchase them in — bearing in mind that some skills require you to allocate a number of skill points in the tree in order to unlock them. As such, you’ll need to unlock new skills before enhancing existing ones:</p>
<ol>
<li id="xZ8fs9">Frenzy / Enhanced Frenzy</li>
<li id="SMZh9d">Hammer of the Ancients / Enhanced Hammer of the Ancients / Furious Hammer of the Ancients</li>
<li id="jmtKHZ">Combat Frenzy</li>

<li id="9QeWh7">Leap / Enhanced Leap / Power Leap</li>
<li id="U56dKQ">Hammer of the Ancients (ranks 4-5)</li>
<li id="qNrubq">Death Blow /<strong> </strong>Enhanced Death Blow / Warrior’s Death Blow / Death Blow (rank 2-5)</li>

<li id="KrN50z">Pit Fighter (ranks 1-3)</li>
<li id="mzMBmt">Tempered Fury</li>
<li id="Q4o2QJ">Furious Impulse (ranks 1-3)</li>
<li id="bx2OeZ">Walking Arsenal</li>
<li id="bSP7sS">Hamstring</li>
<li id="ABkerJ">No Mercy</li>
<li id="bDTTou">Expose Vulnerability (ranks 1-3)</li>

<li id="Q2xJl0">Aggressive Resistance</li>
<li id="hZYHjN">Prolific Fury </li>
</ol>
<h3 id="WzlfSe"><strong>Best Weapon Expertise setup for leveling</strong></h3>
<p id="tbYrO7">Once you unlock the <strong>Weapon Expertise</strong> system for your Barbarian, you’ll want to place the  <strong>two-handed sword</strong> in your <strong>Technique </strong>slot. This will cause all of your Hammer of the Ancients damage to make enemies <strong>Bleed</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="vgooTx"><strong>Best Legendary Aspects for Barbarian leveling build</strong></h3>
<p id="wzErla">When you first start your new character, complete these three dungeons first in order to collect their <a href="https://www.polygon.com/diablo-4-guides/23768833/aspects-dungeons-locations-list-codex">Aspects</a>. Then place them on a piece of gear (ideally jewelry, when possible). Just keep in mind that you should replace these Legendaries with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/diablo-4-guides/23654101/aspects-codex-power-occultist-extract-imprint">new versions using the imprint system</a> every few levels.</p>
<ul>
<li id="kBLhHJ">
<strong>Aspect of Ancestral Force</strong> (Sunken Ruins dungeon in Scosglen) — Hammer of the Ancients quakes outwards, dealing X% of its damage to enemies</li>
<li id="8bONxs">
<strong>Aspect of the Expectant</strong> (Underroot dungeon in Scosglen) — Attacking enemies with a Basic Skill increases the damage of your next Core Skill cast by X% up to X%</li>
<li id="SKeC2z">
<strong>Edgemaster’s Aspect</strong> (Oldstones dungeon in Scosglen) — Skills deal X% increased damage based on Primary Resource when cast, receiving the maximum benefit while you have full Primary Resource</li>
</ul>

<p id="91X17S">Barbarians are <em>Diablo 4</em>’s only <em>pure </em>melee class, with the other classes having hybrid builds for multiple ranges. There are four main ideas that all Barbarian builds stem from:</p>
<ul>
<li id="wzYlJX">Fury dumping</li>
<li id="ISvBBB">Weapon swapping</li>
<li id="8HMtjz">Bleed</li>
<li id="R1fy6W">Berserk</li>
</ul>
<p id="ZoxX03"><strong>Fury dump </strong>builds make use of the <strong>Unbridled Rage</strong> Key Passive, which causes your Fury spenders to cost double the Fury but deal more than double the damage. These kinds of builds obviously require very steady Fury generation, as it’s easy to starve yourself. <strong>Berserk </strong>builds that use the <strong>Unconstrained Key Passive</strong> are all about keeping your Barbarian in the Berserk stage at all times, which nets you a hefty bonus. All Barbarian builds will likely use some skills that make them go Berserk, the Unconstrained Key Passive just enhances the effect.</p>
<p id="3w74VS"><strong>Bleed builds</strong> use the <strong>Gushing Wounds</strong> Key Passive to create a critical strike heavy build that’s great for whittling down groups of enemies with damage over time and explosions. <strong>Weapon swapping builds</strong> offer what is almost certainly the most unique playstyle for Barbarians and takes advantage of the<strong> Walking Arsenal</strong> Key Passive. The idea here is that you’re constantly swapping between your skills and weapons to give yourself massive damage buffs.</p>
<p id="YgQaS9">When making a build, you want to have one of these Key Passives in mind and choose your skills accordingly. Thankfully skills that share certain aspects (like Bleed) are color-coded on the skill tree, and you can even use the in-game search function to find them all. Other Barbarian builds let you take advantage of mechanics like <strong>Thorns </strong>or <strong>Shouts</strong>. But they still typically end with one of these Key Passives.</p>

<p>It looks like NFL fans are going to get a double-dose of big news this week. In addition to the league’s schedule release, Madden 25 appears to be set for a reveal.</p>



<p>According to reliable <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/on-connait-la-date-de-sortie-du-prochain-madden-nfl-25-50251" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">data minter billbil-kun</a>, EA Sports is set to reveal Madden 25 on Thursday, May 16. The game is scheduled to be released on August 16 with four days early access starting August 12.</p>



<p>As far as the game is concerned, billbil-kun says that it will have a reworked physics engine among other updates. The updates to this year’s game — such as improvements to Franchise and Superstar Mode — are expected to be a part of the reveal on May 16 along with pricing and the various editions of the game. </p>



<p>The report says that the game’s cover athlete isn’t expected to be revealed during the initial announcement. </p>



<p>“We believe the identity of the player on the cover of the game will be revealed at a later stage, unlike the first announcement of&nbsp;Madden NFL 24&nbsp;last year,” the report says.</p>



<p>One feature that is expected this year is the inclusion of new broadcasters. Current commentator Charles Davis revealed back in December 2023 that Madden 25 will feature <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/madden-25-to-have-new-announcers/">multiple announce teams</a> for the first time.</p>



<p>Madden 25 will be the second game of the same name. Back in 2013, EA Sports celebrated the 25th anniversary of the franchise by renaming Madden 14 to Madden 25. </p>



<hr>



<p>What do you expect to see when the game is likely revealed this week?

This includes an official reveal of a new game mode, details on the previously teased D&amp;D chapter, and updates on its upcoming spinoff projects. </p><p>But if you missed it, don't worry. We break down every announcement from the Dead by Daylight 8th Anniversary Stream below: </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2><strong>Dead by Daylight's 2V8 mode officially announced</strong></h2><p>Dead by Daylight fans, your wish has been granted: a 2V8 mode is coming. As the name implies, this game mode will have two killers facing off against eight survivors, and will include a larger map to accommodate the increase in players. However, this won't be a rehash of the previous game mode, as the developer confirmed that Perks will not be available in 2V8; instead, it will be replaced with a Class system. </p><p>Because the community has highly requested the 2V8 mode, Behaviour revealed that its initial launch would be a building block for tweaks and adjustments based on community feedback. Behaviour plans to share more details on 2V8 mode in July, with a late summer release window. 
</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2><strong>Dungeons &amp; Dragons chapter coming to Dead by Daylight next month</strong></h2><p>After <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-by-daylight-teases-dungeons-and-dragons-themed-chapter">teasing a D&amp;D-themed crossover in Dead by Daylight last week</a>, Behaviour Interactive has finally made a proper reveal for the next licensed chapter. </p><p>This new chapter, which launches on June 3, will introduce Vecna as a new killer, who will have four spells available to his playstyle: Fly, Flight of the Damned, Mage Hand, and Dispelling Sphere. At the same time, the two survivors are male and female Bard characters: Baermar Uraz, a human male, and Aestri Yazar, a female elf. Regardless of which gender you choose, this new survivor has three unique perks: Mirror Illusion, Bardic Inspiration, and Still Sight. Alongside new playable characters, the next chapter will introduce a new map inspired by the D&amp;D franchise. The Forgotten Ruins is a new dungeon-themed map that serves as a home to Vecna after he finds himself mysteriously transported into The Fog. Alongside an expansive main floor is an extensive underground component filled with horrific experiments and secrets to discover. </p><p>For those interested in trying the new chapter early, it is available on the Dead by Daylight Public Test server today. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2><strong>Dead by Daylight spinoff The Casting of Frank Stone gets new trailer, but no release date</strong></h2><p>Last year, Behaviour announced it was expanding the Dead by Daylight franchise by announcing two new games set in the same universe. One of them was The Casting of Frank Stone, a new narrative-driven game from Until Dawn developer Supermassive Games. </p><p>An <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-by-daylight-supermassive-games-spinoff-revealed">official reveal</a> came last December during The Game Awards, and today's anniversary stream provided another look at the game. The new trailer reveals that the game is set in 1980 and focuses on a group of friends who are on a quest to make their own horror film. </p><p>Though we still do not have a firm release date, today's trailer doubles down the fact that The Casting of Frank Stone is still targeting to release sometime this year. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2><strong>Dead by Daylight's upcoming PvE shooter, codenamed Project T, is launching an Insider Program</strong></h2><p>The second of two previously announced spinoffs, Behaviour shared new details about its unannounced PvE game, codenamed Project T. Developed by Midwinter Entertainment, Project T is an action-horror co-op shooter, set in a set in a region called The Backwater, up to four players can join together and fend off the monsters inhabiting the area. </p><p>Project T still doesn't have a release window. Still, Behaviour revealed that it is launching an Insider Program, allowing players interested in the spinoff to become active in its development cycle. The insider program will include incentives, such as access to closed playtests.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2><strong>What the Fog is a new rougouelite Dead by Daylight spinoff for PC</strong></h2><p>While fans previously knew about the other two spinoff games, Behaviour added a third one to the mix: a 2-person co-op roguelite game called What the Fog. Developed in-house by Behaviour, What the Fog has  players control Dead by Daylight survivors Claudette Morel, Dwight Fairfield, or Feng Min as they run, jump, and shoot their way through a swarm of monsters.</p><p>What the Fog is exlclusive to PC, with the first 2 million copies available, free of charge, if you sign into or create a Behaviour account. After the promotion, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2139020/What_the_Fog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What the Fog, will cost $4.99</a>. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2><strong>Behaviour teases Castlevania</strong> <strong>as the next chapter for Dead by Daylight</strong></h2><p>As a final "and one more thing"-type announcement, Behaviour announced that the next chapter coming to Dead by Daylight is Konami's popular action-adventure series Castlevania. Not a ton of information was shared during the stream, but Behaviour promised that fans will get more details on August 6. </p><p><em>Taylor is a Reporter at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/stardew-valley-console-update-will-be-ready-as-soon-as-possible/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=stardew-valley-console-update-will-be-ready-as-soon-as-possible<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="359" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">It’s no secret that <em>Stardew Valley</em> is the responsibility of a small developer. Eric “ConcernedApe” Barone was busy trying to get the hotly anticipated <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/stardew-valley-patch-1-6-adds-new-crops-mastery-system-new-neighbors/">1.6 update out for PC</a>, which finally went live in March. Since then, they’ve been promising patches for the console and mobile ports of the game, though they haven’t emerged yet.</p> <p data-characters="277" data-current-count="277" data-injectable="false">Patience is very much appreciated from Barone, and a recent post on Twitter/X is keeping us in the loop on <em>Stardew Valley</em> 1.6 for console and mobile. The latest is that the developer is “doing everything within my power to have the ports ready as soon as possible.”</p> <figure data-current-count="577" data-injectable="true"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I know that the console and mobile players are eager to play 1.6, and I am doing everything within my power to have the ports ready as soon as possible. The ports require extra work beyond the PC version. There is also another patch for PC underway which is mainly some bug fixes</p>— ConcernedApe (@ConcernedApe) <a href="https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/1790396655054848363?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 14, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure>
 <p data-characters="289" data-current-count="289" data-injectable="false">There’s still no release date yet, but the fact of the matter is: “the ports require extra work beyond the PC version.” The important thing is that it’s being worked on, but being a small outfit, it’s understandable that it takes time to deliver huge updates.</p> <h2 id="h-also" data-injectable="false">Also…</h2> <p data-characters="239" data-current-count="528" data-injectable="true">In the meantime, PC users will have another patch coming their way soon. The post above goes on to say that more bug fixes are in the pipeline. The game is already on version 1.6.6, so it sounds like 1.6.7 is hopefully being sent out soon.</p>
 <p data-characters="304" data-current-count="304" data-injectable="false"><em>Stardew Valley</em> is one of the most successful games on the indie scene. Released in 2016, and with a current <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/413150/Stardew_Valley/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a> review score of “Overwhelmingly Positive,” Barone’s life simulator has been a breath of fresh air, offering a chill gameplay environment in an idyllic and colorful setting.</p> <p data-characters="245" data-current-count="549" data-injectable="false">The 1.6 update does add a huge amount of new content and some changes to the game, which is why console and mobile players are so keen to get their hands on it. Rest assured, Barone is on the case, and it’ll be ready when it’s ready.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/epic-says-it-will-appeal-fine-over-unfair-commercial-practices-in-fortnite/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=epic-says-it-will-appeal-fine-over-unfair-commercial-practices-in-fortnite<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="399" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">There have been efforts in some parts of Europe to impose <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/european-countries-back-report-against-loot-box-gacha-controversy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stricter regulations on games with microtransactions</a>, with loot boxes in particular singled out as being a form of gambling. The Netherlands, for example, has pushed for loot boxes to be outright banned, and now it’s slapped <em>Fortnite</em> company Epic Games with a hefty fine for “unfair commercial practices” aimed at children.</p> <p data-characters="448" data-current-count="448" data-injectable="true">The Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets (or ACM for short) imposed the fine on May 14, having conducted an investigation into <em>Fortnite</em>‘s monetisation and advertising practices. You can read the full report for yourself on <a href="https://www.acm.nl/en/publications/acm-imposes-fine-epic-unfair-commercial-practices-aimed-children-fortnite-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the ACM’s website</a>, but the long and short of it is that it believes the game exploits children with aggressive advertising, such as using phrases like “Get it now” or “Buy now.”</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="699" data-current-count="999" data-injectable="true">“Ads that directly exhort children to make purchases are an illegal aggressive commercial practice,” argues the ACM, which is why it’s fined Epic Games €562,500. However, the ACM has also deemed countdown timers for certain items to be “misleading.” Such timers obviously aim to convince customers to purchase an item before it expires by invoking scarcity and FOMO. The ACM claims to have found that some of these time-limited items never actually left the item store even after their timer expired. Deeming such timers misleading, the ACM has imposed a second fine of €562,500, meaning Epic has to fork over a total of €1,125,000, which is roughly $1.2 million.</p>
 <p data-characters="425" data-current-count="425" data-injectable="true">The ACM has given Epic a deadline of June 10, 2024 to end such violations, though its report states Epic has already removed all countdown timers from the <em>Fortnite</em> shop. The company has also informed the ACM of its plans for other such changes, and will “present to players up to the age of 18 years in the Netherlands only items in the Item Shop that will be available for 48 hours or more” starting from May 24.</p>
 <p data-characters="392" data-current-count="392" data-injectable="false">Despite sounding like it was willing to play ball in the report, Epic has said it intends to appeal the decision, in a statement to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/epic-11m-fined-for-breaking-eu-consumer-law-in-netherlands" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesIndustry.biz</a>. What’s more, it’s said the ACM’s findings contain “significant factual errors about how <em>Fortnite</em> and the Item Shop operate,” arguing that it’s mandating for changes that would hamper the player experience.</p> <p data-characters="584" data-current-count="976" data-injectable="false">According to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/disneys-epic-deal-shows-sharp-cut-fortnite-makers-valuation-the-information-2024-02-08/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reuters</a>, Epic Games is valued at $22.5 billion, following a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/disney-invests-1-5-billion-in-epic-to-create-persistent-universe-connected-to-fortnite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$1.5 billion investment by Disney</a>, so a $1.2 million fine feels like chump change for the company. Then again, it’s not too surprising Epic’s so quick to push back against the ACM. This is the same company who, after violating Apple’s terms and services and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/update-epic-just-goaded-apple-into-removing-fortnite-from-the-app-store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">getting <em>Fortnite</em> booted from the Apple store</a>, immediately kicked off a years-long lawsuit. It even turned the whole affair into a business opportunity, with an in-game #FreeFortnite event and advertising made to rally fans to its side.</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/supergiant-hades-2-dash-chronos-difficulty</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-things-you-don%E2%80%99t-like-about-hades-2-are-good-actually.870555/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/supergiant-hades-2-dash-chronos-difficulty<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>While <em>Hades 2</em> is a game where weapons, boons, arcana cards, and a multitude of other elements can tug runs in different directions for every player, it’s likely that many <em>Hades 1</em> players had roughly the same first experience with the game: They tried to dash, and then they tried to dash again. They discovered, to their chagrin, that they could not immediately dash a second time, but would instead begin sprinting if they kept the button held down. Something, they began to suspect, had gone horribly wrong.</p><p>This has led to calls for the return of the original game’s dash, as well as broader observations that <em>Hades 2 </em>doesn’t feel as good to play. Other pervasive complaints are similar: New main character Melinoë starts out too weak compared to original main character Zagreus. The new final boss is too hard compared to Hades himself from the first game. The new boons aren’t as good. Selene, the moon incarnate, is a poor replacement for the ability to call for aid from specific gods.&nbsp;</p><p>In response to all of this, I’d like to echo a sentiment shared by players who – like myself – are probably freaks with close to 50 hours in <em>Hades 2</em>: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HadesTheGame/comments/1cqtj0q/two_things_are_true_on_the_comparisons_between/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Give it time</a>. Just like the original <em>Hades</em>, <em>Hades 2</em> is an onion you peel back over the course of countless runs. It’s not really fair to compare early or mid-game Melinoë to late- (and non-early access) game Zagreus. And again, as in the original, the secret best part of the process is learning to love mechanics and items that you disliked or even hated at first blush.</p><figure><blockquote><p>It’s not really fair to compare early or mid-game Melinoë to late- (and non-early access) game Zagreus.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Let’s use the dash as an example. Though double-dash was not unlocked from the <em>very </em>beginning of the original <em>Hades</em>, being able to dash a whole, whole, whole lot was a cornerstone of the game. Zagreus was a fleet-footed blur. He was so prone to darting every which way that they ought to have called him Zig-Zagreus. There was comfort in this blazing hyperactivity. As long as you remained on the move, you felt almost untouchable. Dash spam was more than just an option; it was Zagreus’ mid-battle identity. He was a berserker, dashing and slashing to relieve years of pent-up rage at his dear old dad, Hades.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s understandable that players have felt distraught upon discovering that <em>Hades 2 </em>is more judicious with its dashes. I remember when I first realized the game had snatched away my comfort zone like a thief in the night. I thought “Oh no, am I gonna be bad at this game? Will I even be able to beat a single boss?” But as I embarked on run after run and dug deeper into Melinoë’s kit, I came to appreciate just how much she has at her disposal to compensate for her inability to fight like several competing car accidents.&nbsp;</p><p>Casts and specials can take on so many interesting forms. Omega abilities – especially once powered up – feel like unleashing a tidal wave on your enemies. All of this emphasizes distance and positioning, as well as a more aware playstyle. In the game’s early goings, you can’t afford to take your eye off the ball or go on autopilot. You have to stay focused. Enemy types are designed to both get you up to speed with Melinoë’s unique capabilities and punish you for plunging in like you’re Zagreus 2.0. Instead of charging in and hammering away until anything you perceive as even vaguely nail-shaped is firmly in the ground, you have to stick and move. If enemies keep swarming you, you’ve got to remember to throw down a circle to glue their feet to the floor for a few seconds. When in doubt, hop on your (figurative) bicycle, reposition, and try again. Don’t get me wrong: This is still very much <em>Hades</em>. You’re still solving a series of ever-shifting puzzles one piece at a time. It’s just a different type of puzzle.&nbsp;</p><p>This, in turn, fits with Melinoë’s character: She was raised almost from birth to complete her task. Poise and focus are pillars of her personality, to the point that she and others in her life worry that maybe she’s a little <em>too </em>locked in to enjoy life’s bounties. In that regard, <em>Hades 2</em> is about peeling back both mechanical layers and those of Melinoë herself. Slowly but surely, she emerges from her shell and learns how to stop and smell the roses – or weird Chaos alien flowers – every once in a while.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Supergiant</figcaption></figure><p>Melinoë’s playstyle similarly expands over time. At first I struggled to employ her arsenal holistically. I’d focus on attacks one run, specials another, or circles during a third, depending on which weapon I was wielding. Then, dozens of runs down the line, everything clicked. Using specific abilities and placing circles depending on which enemies were in front of me became second nature. Different weapons and boons, meanwhile, allowed for – and, depending on what I encountered during a run, sometimes <em>forced </em>– different playstyles. When I first started playing, I was laser-focused on achieving roughly the same build every run. I got mad when boons didn’t align just so. I felt like the game was wasting my time. Now, dozens of hours in, I love that there are instances where my favorite builds prove impossible, forcing me to improvise. Runs have a lot more actual variety than they did in the first game. You’ve just got to be willing to roll with the punches.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, I initially thought the sprint felt a bit clunky, especially once I reached more hectic boss fights, like Scylla and the Sirens. But over time I’ve come to appreciate the ways sprinting opens up the game’s map design – allowing for larger, more multifaceted areas like the Fields of Mourning and the City of Ephyra – and, once sufficiently powered up, lets me literally run circles around bosses like Cerberus (and even Chronos, on a good day). I feel like Sonic The Hedgehog, zipping behind bosses’ big attacks before they even finish firing them off. But even with a wimpy vanilla sprint, there’s a thrill to the moments where you just barely outpace, say, Cerberus’ giant gout of flame. It might be a predictable attack pattern, but <em>the way</em> you evade it – sprinting at top speed as it practically singes the hairs on the back of your neck – feels like something out of an action movie. There’s something to be said for those tiny thrills. They keep runs interesting, even when everything seems to be going according to plan.</p><p>Supergiant’s greatest masterstroke in all of this, if you ask me, is having Chronos sporadically teleport you into Asphodel, a location from<em> Hades 1</em>, and forcing you to survive against enemies designed around the first game’s move set. It really drives home just how different Melinoë is from Zagreus, how much she struggles when surrounded on all sides by hazards that her older brother would have just crashed over, under, or through. But it’s also a very clear and clever wake up call. <em>Hades 2</em> forces you to stay on top of a small, circular space for a sustained period of time – rather than just kill a bunch of enemies – to prevail in this encounter, and maintaining space is what Melinoë does best. So Supergiant is spelling out for you, very explicitly, how Melinoë would navigate a situation that you previously overcame hundreds of times in Zagreus’ shoes. Supergiant is demonstrating her unique strengths in addition to her weaknesses.</p><figure><blockquote><p>I <em>enjoy </em>the process of warming up to some of those things, of believing something might just not be for me, only to be proven wrong a dozen hours later.</p></blockquote></figure><p>After nearly 50 hours, the sprint is far from the only divisive element of <em>Hades 2</em> I’ve come to appreciate. I actually love that Chronos is a titanic pain in the ass to beat. It makes his snarling snark that much more menacing, and when you finally do take him down, it’s a giant exhale. You feel shaky but triumphant. You, like Melinoë, can barely believe you did it. Comparatively speaking, beating Hades in <em>Hades </em>began to feel trivial after a while. I enjoy Chronos as a more mechanically credible threat. That said, to those with doubts, I would again say: Give Chronos, the Titan of time, time. <em>Hades 2</em> will eventually provide you with the tools you need to beat him, even if it might feel like it’s taking a little longer than in the original game. Also, <a href="https://kotaku.com/hades-2-early-access-god-mode-autofire-timer-1851461987" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">there’s always God Mode</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Obviously, <em>Hades 2</em> is in early access, and I have no doubt that Supergiant will tweak some of these things: damage, balance, boon effects, and even <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/4175477072251730219" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sprint responsiveness</a>. But the core of the game – its many overlapping loops – feels very intentionally designed, down to the detail. I <em>enjoy </em>the process of warming up to some of those things, of believing something might just not be for me, only to be proven wrong a dozen hours later. That’s key to the experience, as far as I’m concerned.&nbsp;</p><p>Put another way, when I first unlocked the Moonstone Axe, I thought it was hot garbage. Too slow to wind up and cool down. Too many openings. Just a big, clumsy liability. A couple nights ago, I pulled off a run in which I used it to down the first boss in a single-digit number of hits. I never should have doubted it. I was a fool. &nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-crossovers-spinoffs<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>is eight years old this year, and developer Behaviour Interactive is celebrating with a slew of new announcements surrounding the game.</p>
<p>During an anniversary celebration stream today, Behaviour revealed a number of new things coming to&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight</em>, including more details about the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-dungeons-dragons-crossover">upcoming&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;</em>crossover</a>, a new game announcement, and another tantalizing crossover.</p>
<p>First up, the&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;</em>crossover content has been revealed, and if you guessed that everyone's favorite lich Vecna would be the killer joining the roster from the popular tabletop RPG, you'd be absolutely correct.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dead-by-daylight-eighth-anniversary-vecna-screenshot.jpg?itok=ZCtaTYib 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dead-by-daylight-eighth-anniversary-vecna-screenshot.jpg?itok=pk28Awuw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Say hello to&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight</em>'s newest killer Vecna. Then run away from him screaming.</figcaption></figure><p>Along with Vecna, the crossover is also bringing a new survivor (well, technically two) in the form of the Bard. You can choose between elven female Aestri Yazar and human male Baermar Uraz for your Bard.</p>
<p>A new map, the Forgotten Ruins, is being introduced. It's Vecna's domain, but it's scattered with chests in which you can find gear to help you fight his spells. In a cute&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>-themed twist, you'll have to roll to see what item you get.</p>
<p>All of this&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>-themed stuff is coming to&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>on June 3rd, but if you're of a mind, you can check it out right now on the PTB (public test build) via Steam. You can do that by selecting the "public-test" branch in the game's Properties window within your Steam library.</p>

<p>As well as learning about the&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;</em>crossover, we also got a glimpse of some of&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight</em>'s upcoming spinoffs.</p>
<p>None of them are perhaps quite as out there as&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hooked-on-you-dead-by-daylight-dating-sim-is-out-today"><em>Hooked On You: A Dead by Daylight Dating Sim</em></a>, but they should whet your appetite for more&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>content.</p>
<p>First up,&nbsp;<em>Project T&nbsp;</em>is a third-person co-op shooter in which you will explore the Backwater, a hitherto-unexplored region controlled by the Entity. The game is in its early development stages right now, so you'll have to wait for a bit more info in the coming months.</p>

<p>The game will revolve around a group of teens who head to a small town in order to make a movie. It sounds like a pretty typical Supermassive setup, but with the extra spice added by the&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>connection.</p>
<p>Finally, a brand new game,&nbsp;<em>What the Fog</em>, was announced.

<p>Abilities in this mode will be rebalanced around co-operative play, and a class system will be introduced to replace&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight</em>'s usual Perks. Behaviour says it'll reveal more about this mode later this year.</p>
<p>Last but not least, Behaviour also revealed a brand new crossover:&nbsp;<em>Castlevania&nbsp;</em>is coming to&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight</em>.</p>
<p>We don't know too much else about this crossover yet, but it'll be interesting to see how it pans out. If Dracula is the killer, surely none of the Belmonts can be survivors? After all, Belmonts don't flee from Dracula.</p>
<p>That's all for today's jam-packed&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>anniversary show, anyway. Stay tuned for more on everything you've heard about here!</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/dead-by-daylight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dead by Daylight</a> is turning eight years old, and Montreal-based series creators Behaviour Interactive had certainly a lot to announce <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIwtIGmevQE&amp;ab_channel=DeadbyDaylight" target="_blank" rel="noopener">during their big anniversary broadcast</a>. Plenty of new detail was provided about the new Dungeons &amp; Dragons update, although we also learned that a Castlevania chapter is on the way later this year. Players can also look forward to the introduction of a mode with two killers instead of the usual one.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there are plenty of spinoffs on the way. We got a new trailer for the Supermassive-Games-developed narrative adventure The Casting of Frank Stone, and some information on “Project T,” a new PvE shooter spinoff set in the Dead by Daylight universe. Perhaps most exciting and unexpected, Behaviour shadow dropped What the Fog, a new cartoony Dead by Daylight action platformer.</p>
<p>Before we jump into anything else, let’s check out the cinematic trailer for Dead by Daylight: Dungeons &amp; Dragons.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dead by Daylight | Dungeons &amp; Dragons | Official Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dcizzog5WBo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Dead by Daylight: Dungeons &amp; Dragons’ new killer is the lich king Vecna, who brings the following unique abilities to the table:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Fly</strong> grants him flying speed for a short time, letting him pass over obstacles in his path.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Flight of the Damned</strong> conjures flying spectral entities that can pass through obstacles and cause harm to all they hit.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Mage </strong>Hand creates a ghastly, phantasmic hand that can complete tasks such as holding and blocking the use of Pallets.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Dispelling Sphere</strong> creates a moving AOE sphere that reveals Survivors and disables their Magical Items.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile, the new survivors are a pair of bards, Aestri Yazar and Baermar Uraz (you’ll have the same perks and abilities regardless of who you pick).</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Mirrored Illusion</strong> spawns a static copy of the Survivor in front of a Totem, Chest, Generator or Exit Gate for a limited time</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Bardic Inspiration</strong> inspires others through a stirring performance. Roll a d20 and fellow Survivors get a Skill Check buff depending on the result of the roll.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Still Sight</strong> lets you briefly see the auras of all close by Generators, Totems, and Chests.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>A new dungeon-esque map, the Forgotten Ruins, featuring treasure chests you’ll need to roll a 20-sided die to open, will also be part of the D&amp;D chapter.</p>
<p>Moving on to the 2v8 mode, Behaviour is promising it will take place on larger maps, the replacement of perks with a new class system, and a new cage mechanic instead of hooks. Behaviour is promising to reveal more about the mode in July.</p>
<p>Next up, here’s a first gameplay trailer for The Casting of Frank Stone.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Casting of Frank Stone | Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O1xixINNd6I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>And here’s an early look at Project T, which is clearly very much a work in progress at this point.</p>
<p><iframe title="Project T | A First Look" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b1_DhOrH4Ds?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>And here’s What the Fog, which is available to download… right now! Those with a Behaviour account can get the game for free, although Behaviour is only giving away 2 million copies. If you miss out, the game is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2139020/What_the_Fog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available on Steam for 5 bucks</a>.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="What the Fog - Official Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dZGSG0CihE8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Finally, here’s your first peek at the Dead by Daylight Castlevania chapter. Apparently, more will be revealed on August 6.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Dead by Daylight | Castlevania | Teaser" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9YEfRYKRr8s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Phew! That was a lot of stuff! Dead by Daylight can be played on PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, PS5, Switch, and mobile devices. The Dungeons &amp; Dragons will be available on June 3, although it’s available on PC test servers now.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lonely-island%E2%80%99s-jorma-taccone-couldn%E2%80%99t-stop-adding-jokes-to-knuckles%E2%80%99-dream-musical.870528/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24155657/lonely-island-jorma-taccone-knuckles-musical<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="P79yI1">The nonsense was all there on the page — <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24140560/knuckles-cast-adam-pally-kid-cudi-interview">Adam Pally</a> in an echidna costume, Julian Barratt rocking out in an owl headdress, an enormous puppet hell demon, a black-box-theater-worthy interpretation of a Sonic stage — but when director Jorma Taccone began orchestrating the hallucinatory musical tucked inside <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24140560/knuckles-cast-adam-pally-kid-cudi-interview"><em>Knuckles</em>’</a> fourth episode, his impulse was to pile on even more. </p>
<p id="ZjmMHX">“Toby [Ascher, the showrunner], right from the jump was like, <em>Look, I was raised on Adult Swim, I want to make this weird and push boundaries and make this as interesting and different and unexpected as possible</em>,” Taccone tells Polygon. “And obviously, that’s up my alley.”</p>
<p id="1nyBY0">The episode, “The Flames of Disaster,” is not just up Taccone’s alley — he built the dang alley. After breaking out with Digital Shorts on <em>Saturday Night Live</em>, the Lonely Island member applied his go-hard-or-go-home comedy stylings to feature work like <em>MacGruber</em> and <em>Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping</em>. While, on paper, a spinoff of the Sonic the Hedgehog movies may not have immediately called for his established skill set, his longtime collaborator Brandon Trost, the director of photography on <em>Popstar</em> and <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em> who pivoted to directing on <em>Knuckles</em>, convinced Taccone to step in for a one-off. </p>
<p id="tH8jct">Thanks to a lo-fi approach to executing on the musical concept, Taccone could basically do whatever he wanted, and with the resources of a major motion picture crew; <em>Knuckles</em> employed most of the same crew from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23021865/sonic-2-knuckles-director-interview"><em>Sonic the Hedgehog 2</em></a>, that would eventually go straight from the series into <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24131363/keanu-reeves-shadow-the-hedgehod-sonic-3"><em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em></a>. </p>
<p id="Q4yZr2">“My goal for the episode was honestly to have this be something that you watch and are like, <em>Whoa, what was that?</em> — it’s so packed for 21, 22 minutes,” Taccone says, still sounding as giddy as he was on set. “When I showed it to my wife, her response was, ‘I don’t even know what to say about that.’” </p>

<p id="EODsil">“The Flames of Disaster” picks up the morning after a raucous Shabbat dinner, as bounty hunter Jack Sinclair (Barratt) kidnaps deputy sheriff Wade Whipple (Pally) off the porch of his mom’s house. Knuckles declines to save him — Wade needs to become a true warrior, and this is his shot. Even if he’s being carted across Idaho in an electrified steel cage. As Wade reels from shocks to the brain, the action shifts to his subconsciousness, where Pachacamac (voiced by Christopher Lloyd), the elder of Knuckles’ tribe, appears to him at a bowling alley of the mind to send him on a spiritual journey — of interpretive dance and puppetry.</p>

<p id="SKdOvd">The first thing Taccone did when he received the script for “The Flames of Disaster” was call his brother Asa Taccone, who has played an instrumental role in writing the songs for Lonely Island over the years. Working with another of their go-to collaborators, composer Matthew Compton, the trio wrote a power ballad for Barratt to wail as Pally swayed, kicked, ran, and twirled his way around the bowling alley set. At this point, Taccone can’t even tell if he’s parodying anything with “The Flames of Disaster” — “honestly it feels very Lonely Island to me?” he says, realizing he had created his own musical subgenre — but when the song was wrapped up, it made sense to call in a favor with one of his leading creative inspirations: Michael Bolton. </p>
<p id="n8MVKd">The Lonely Island gave Bolton a late-career resurgence with their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI6CfKcMhjY"><em>SNL</em> video “Jack Sparrow.” </a>Now Taccone can text him when he needs a little of that Bolton magic on a new project.</p>
<p id="aZk7DZ">“It’s been bizarre in my life to say that I can consider Val Kilmer a friend [after <em>MacGruber</em>], and it’s been bizarre to say that Michael Bolton is definitely a dear friend,” Taccone says. “We call him Lord Boltron, which I would really like to spread as much as possible. We really want people at concerts to be yelling out ‘LORD BOLTRON!!’”</p>

<p id="SY8ilh">“The Flames of Disaster” checked two boxes for the <em>Knuckles</em> production: An episode with very little of its main star, a pricey CG creation, and an episode that could lean even further into the lo-fi to contrast with anything the audience would expect from the series. Taccone approached it as a “community theater production,” despite working with many of the most sought after production heads working in Hollywood.</p>
<p id="TwsJXk">When Taccone met the episode’s choreographer — Ellen Kane, whose credits include West End productions and the recent <em>Matilda</em> movie — he remembers her being super game for any wacky idea. He could only be self-deprecating. “I was like, ‘Just know... this <em>is</em> beneath you.’”</p>
<p id="37rHdt">But Taccone sells himself short: The ultimate production is astounding. The director says his personal comedy mantra is “comedy is contrast” and there are examples everywhere. Pally spends most of the episode in a dingy Knuckles costume dancing through Kane’s precision choreography like he’s in <em>Fame</em>. A giant demon erupts from the back halls of the bowling alley only to go on and on about browsing Facebook Marketplace (“My whole thing was: I just want him looking for mountain bikes,” Taccone says.) There are throwaway gags — watch for the puppets phasing in and out of the dream — that the director says he carved out time for just because if anyone caught them for a split second they’d get a laugh. Not every dream came true, like the floating head of Michael Bolton, but he came close. With a seasoned team, he could say “Can I get a flare gun? I want the mailman to shoot a flare gun,” and then he’d have a flare gun. </p>

<p id="DWZeVU">“I am so used to working within the margins of not a lot of time or money, and being able to shoot a lot in that amount of time,” Taccone says. “And while this is way more episode days than I had had on things like <em>MacGruber</em>, we packed it back. I was trying to get a lot of shots per day. So certain parts we almost treated it like a music video. The first thing I did was have them buy me a little Bluetooth speaker so I could even run playback [of the song] just so I could get more takes quickly and read cue things very quickly. So I could do all these lines from Julian really fast, so fast I couldn’t wait for us to even connect to the timecode.” </p>
<p id="Fr4mzu">The absurdity is technical, and for Taccone, the results are transcendent. He is the most surprised that an episode of the <em>Knuckles</em> TV show made him get… a little teary. </p>
<p id="lr28AN">“The moments I’m always proudest of are when it’s both funny and somehow musically moving. A moment where [Wade] rises up and the echidna angels are around him, bringing him up and then the music starts to soar and Bolton’s voice is soaring — you kind of feel something! It’s always my favorite to have it be both funny and insane and, like, <em>I’m kind of inspired!</em>” </p>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24155430/dead-by-daylight-dungeons-dragons-crossover-vecna</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dead-by-daylight%E2%80%99s-next-killer-is-dungeons-dragons-baddie-vecna.870525/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24155430/dead-by-daylight-dungeons-dragons-crossover-vecna<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="PeaPI9"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/dead-by-daylight/39050"><em>Dead by Daylight</em></a> is a game absolutely packed with murderous monsters, both original and licensed from other franchises. The next crossover is a little bit outside of the usual horror wheelhouse — <em>Dead by Daylight </em>is producing a chapter themed around the wildly popular tabletop game <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. Vecna, known in-game as The Lich, will be the game’s next Killer. Vecna is joined by a pair of Elven bards, one male and one female, who will serve as the new Survivors. </p>
<p id="RBE67h">Behaviour Interactive announced the crossover during the game’s anniversary stream Tuesday, which included sneak peeks of other titles in the same universe and a new 2v8 gameplay mode.</p>
<p id="g6WUOI">Vecna is a powerful mage, with access to an array of spells. He can fly, summon spectral entities, create a mage hand to manipulate items, and dispel magic. While most Killers in <em>Dead by Daylight</em> focus on throwing hatchets or swinging a blade, Vecna uses magical abilities to hunt down Survivors. Luckily, there’s an upside to facing him as an enemy. When Vecna is the Killer, he spawns chests around the map. Opening them starts a dice roll, and if the player is lucky enough, they can obtain some of Vecna’s legendary loot. </p>
<p id="clUNU0">The Eye and Hand of Vecna can be obtained from these chests. The Eye of Vecna grants invisibility to Survivors after they leave a locker, while the Hand of Vecna allows you to teleport between lockers. If you roll a critical failure, Behaviour promises something terrible happens — but we don’t know what quite yet.</p>
<p id="C8XbNo">With the runaway success of<a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2020/10/19/21519763/baldurs-gate-3-review-larian-rpg-dungeons-and-dragons"> <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em></a>, as well as the recent <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23635507/dungeons-dragons-honor-among-thieves-sxsw-review-spoiler-free">Dungeons &amp; Dragons movie</a>, it’s interesting to see Dungeons &amp; Dragons expand even further by entering the illustrious cast of the asymmetrical horror game. <em>Stranger Things</em>, a show no stranger to D&amp;D tie-ins, based its season four antagonist on Vecna, and they even share the same name — so maybe he’ll form a special bond with <em>Stranger Things’ </em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/8/19/20812070/stranger-things-dead-by-daylight-nancy-wheeler-steve-harrington-demogorgon-chapter"><em>Dead by Daylight</em> Kille</a>r, the Demogorgon, who was similarly named after a D&amp;D monster.</p>
<p id="xNGmdh">Behaviour also teased the next licensed chapter, which will be a cross-over with the Castlevania franchise. We don’t know who the Killer or Survivor will be for that, but we can expect details later this summer. The stream also shared that a third licensed chapter will arrive before the end of <em>Dead by Daylight</em>’s next anniversary.</p>
<p id="KaP1B8">For fans who prefer the original aspects of <em>Dead by Daylight</em>, Behaviour shared a look at some other games in the same universe. <em>The Casting of Frank Stone</em> is a branching narrative game from <em>Until Dawn </em>developer Supermassive, similar to <em>The Quarry</em> or the Dark Pictures Anthology. A two-player co-op title called <em>What the Fog</em> is also briefly available for free with the registration of a Behaviour account, and it looks like a much cuter and absurd take on the Entity’s Realm.</p>
<p id="5lsb9C">The <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> DLC is coming to the test realm today, and the chapter will release on live servers on June 3.</p>

Once you’re in, you’ll be standing right next to the church where Aerith and Cloud met (try not to cry!).

Walk a few steps forward and she’ll blink out of existence. </p><h2 id="h24337"><a id="bug"></a>Hey, I didn’t see her ghost. What gives?</h2><p>For reasons unknown, you can actually disable Aerith’s ghost loading into the church without even knowing it. During Cloud’s flashback, if you chat with the owner of the Inn in Nibelheim and say “Let me know the situation,” it disables Aerith’s ghost. </p><p>No one knows for sure why this happens. Unfortunately, the flashback scene takes place very early in the game, so you’d likely need to go back and play it all over again if you accidentally disabled the ghost scene.Which, hey, replaying <em>FF7</em> is hardly a bad thing anyway.</p><h2 id="h24338"><a id="truth"></a>Is that <em>really</em> Aerith’s ghost?</h2><p>There’s a spooky subtlety in the Aerith’s ghost “scene.” One of the kids you’ll find upon re-entering the church and seeing Aerith’s ghost will say “Hey, where’s the flower lady” if you chat with them.

Firstly, you can see an option titled “After Aerith’s death” in the game’s dubugging program for activating this ghost scene. Secondly, there’s a bit of scrapped dialogue from an NPC that was removed from the game who, upon talking too after re-entering Midgar, says that they saw a woman disappear and that the church is haunted. To me, that’s an indication that Square Enix was at least thinking about the idea of the church being haunted and people seeing apparitions there.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-vr-missions-review-worth-playing-1851469341&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-vr-missions-review-worth-playing-1851469341"><em>Metal Gear Solid: VR Missions</em>: The <em>Kotaku</em> Retro Review</a></span></p><p>That said, as some have found out, there is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/0vViHqNrd6E&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/0vViHqNrd6E" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unused Aerith dialogue</a></span> found in the game’s files that would play <em>after</em> her death, indicating that previous versions of the story might’ve involved Aerith living in some way after the events in the City of the Ancients.</p><p>But whether it’s an intentional spooky and sad moment, or the result of some leftover code running amok, I happen to enjoy the idea of briefly seeing Aerith’s spirit for a brief moment. Plus, it kind of makes Aerith’s ghostly depictions in <em>Advent Children</em> and <em>FF7 Rebirth</em> a little more harmonious to the original.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Midwinter Entertainment, a studio underneath Behaviour Interactive, has released a first look at its upcoming game currently known as Project T. </p>



<p>Project T is a 1-4 player PvE co-op shooter that’s in early development. The game is set in the same universe as Dead by Daylight by, according to Midwinter, expands on the world, ”&nbsp;introducing new characters, gameplay, and settings – as well as a few familiar elements for those in the know.”</p>



<p>In the first look that you can see below, Project T has you play as “trespassers” who have been taken out of their world and trapped within the Entity in a region called the Backwater. Within the game, players will have to watch out for monsters called “The Thrall” that come in various forms and have different abilities.</p>



<p>The Backwater, artistic director Risa Taneda says, will be an ever-changing landscape that will offer numerous gameplay features.</p>



<p>As of writing, there’s no set release date for the game nor are their confirmed platforms aside from PC. The studio did announce an Insider Program that will allow players to help shape the game during development as well as receive regular development updates and even playtest opportunities. You can sign up for the Project T Insider Program <a href="https://insiderprogram.bhvr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via the game’s official website</a>.</p>
