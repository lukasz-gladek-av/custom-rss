			<p>A few minutes ago, the official Twitter/X Star Wars Outlaws account <a href="https://x.com/StarWarsOutlaws/status/1808531202632044579" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that the open world game set in George Lucas' beloved science fantasy universe has gone gold well before its planned August 30 launch.</p>
<p>While it's not as much of an advance as Square Enix's Final Fantasy XVI, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-goes-gold-nearly-three-months-before-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went gold almost three months ahead of its planned debut</a>, it's still ahead of schedule compared to most recent games, which usually only reach the gold phase a few weeks before the release.</p>
<p>Traditionally, this phrase is used when a product is ready to be delivered and sent for mass disc duplication. Nowadays, some games even skip the retail release at launch, foregoing disc releases entirely in favor of digital-only stores, but the terminology has stuck and developers continue to describe this phase as such.</p>
<p>This also doesn't necessarily mean Star Wars Outlaws developer Ubisoft Massive won't continue working on fixing some potential bugs and issues with a day-one patch. However, it should inspire some confidence that the studio has started the duplication process fairly early because even this build is polished enough.</p>
<p>The game, powered by the studio's impressive Snowdrop engine, delivers seamless transitions between space and planet gameplay (although you won't be able to travel seamlessly between planets, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-wont-feature-freeform-space-travel-between-planets-reputation-system-detailed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> by the development team). On PC, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-to-support-nvidia-dlss-3-5-marvel-rivals-to-feature-dlss-3-and-rtx-remix-goes-open-source/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will support NVIDIA DLSS 3.5</a> (Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Ray Reconstruction) for optimal performance and visuals.</p>
<p>Story-wise, Star Wars Outlaws is set between the original trilogy movies The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. The setting was proposed by Lucasfilm, who felt this would be the perfect space in which to place an adventure about a scoundrel making her way through the criminal underworld of the galaxy's Outer Rim. For even more details about the game, check out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/star-wars-outlaws-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-first-open-world-game-in-the-far-far-away-galaxy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in-depth roundup article</a>.</p>

            <p>Surgent Studios, developers of this year’s fetching Afrofuturist <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-platform-games-on-pc">platformer</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tales-of-kenzera-zau">Tales of Kenzera: Zau</a>, have laid off more than a dozen staff. The cuts come just over two months on from the release of the debut video game release from the multimedia studio founded by Assassin’s Creed Origins star Abubakar Salim.</p>

<p>Before Tales of Kenzera: Zau, Surgent contributed to a number of films starting with 2021’s The Whale, through to this year’s Wild Goat Surf. The studio bill themselves as focusing on storytelling across a variety of media, from games and film to podcasts, with Zau being their first video game project.</p>
<p>News of layoffs first broke via posts from former employees on LinkedIn (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-tales-of-kenzera-zau-developer-surgent-studios-is-cutting-jobs">Game Developer</a>), including a level designer and technical artist. Surgent <a href="https://x.com/surgentstudios/status/1808216664145576284">subsequently confirmed</a> the cuts by stating that “just over a dozen people” had been affected, with <a href="https://x.com/Abzybabzy/status/1808221598983544959">Salim listing</a> producers, artists and animators as among those laid off.</p>
<p>“It’s a difficult time in the games industry, but we remain incredibly proud of our entire team’s work on Zau and of the praise it has received from critics and players alike,” they continued, before adding that the studio’s focus would be on “supporting those affected, continuing our work on Zau, and looking to the future with our next creative projects”.</p>
 <p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>Zau was revealed at the end of last year as a moving <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">metroidvania</a> inspired both by African Bantu cultures and Salim’s own experiences of grief. In <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tales-of-kenzera-zau-review">our review</a> around its release on April 23rd, Alice Bee (RPS in Peace) praised its sensitively-told story and beautiful design, while finding its platforming and combat to be a little imprecise at times.</p>
<p>Surgent are yet to announce their next project or future plans for Zau. Best of luck to those affected by the layoffs.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/more-activision-blizzard-games-are-reportedly-launching-on-game-pass-next-month/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's been eight months since Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-closes-68-7-billion-activision-blizzard-deal-after-nearly-21-month-long-odyssey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closed</a> the $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, following a lengthy legal battle with regulators worldwide.</p>
<p>Given that Microsoft had touted early on its intention to bring Activision Blizzard to its Game Pass subscription service, arguably the most important pillar of its gaming strategy, Xbox fans expected this to happen in relatively short order, but that wasn't the case. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-gaming-ceo-explains-why-game-pass-isnt-getting-activision-blizzard-games-before-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a> at the time:</p>
<p><em>Frankly, there was a lot of uncertainty in that process up until really a week before we closed, or the week of, when the CMA finally came down to their decision, that we weren't able to get on that back catalog work. So now that the deal is closed, we're starting that work.</em></p>
<p><em>But there is work. And I think the Activision Twitter handle did put out a statement that talked about 2024. I think that's accurate. I would love it if there was some kind of secret celebration drop coming in the next couple of weeks. There's not.</em></p>
<p><em>Definitely, when we think about the new games that are there, I would be straight with people. If we were going to put them in the subscription this year, I would tell people. And I know there'll be some disappointment about that.</em></p>
<p><em>This acquisition is definitely long-term for Microsoft, so the fact that we're not hitting day one with a bunch of games dropping in to Game Pass is a little bit of a downer, but I'm very excited about the future.</em></p>
<p>Eventually, Diablo IV <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-lands-on-game-pass-on-march-28/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">joined</a> Game Pass in late March. Again, Xbox users hoped that more titles would follow shortly, but that wasn't the case, and Microsoft didn't raise up the subject during its Xbox Games Showcase last month, either.</p>
<p>However, a new rumor <a href="https://forums.exputer.com/threads/exclusive-new-details-regarding-activision-games-coming-to-xbox-game-pass-emerge.222/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">started</a> by insider extas1s reveals that Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy, the remaster compilation that recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/crash-bandicoot-n-sane-trilogy-has-sold-through-over-20-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hit</a> the 20 million units sales milestone, will join Game Pass next month. According to extas1s, it won't be alone, as Spyro Reignited Trilogy and Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2 will both be added to the subscription service shortly, though the insider couldn't confirm if that would happen in August.</p>
<p>Windows Central has since <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/report-crash-bandicoot-n-sane-trilogy-is-coming-to-xbox-game-pass-in-august" target="_blank" rel="noopener">corroborated</a> the Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy rumor, adding that Microsoft plans to slowly add back catalog games from Activision Blizzard to Game Pass. As such, it may be a while before every classic hit in the publisher's portfolio makes it to the subscription service.</p>
<p>As for when exactly Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy might be added to GP, it could be a good announcement to share with fans during Gamescom Opening Night Live (slated to air on Tuesday, August 20, between 8 and 10 PM CET), though that's just speculation on our part.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/halo-infinite-myrtle-broadway-bushwick-new-york<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Even if you don’t live in Bushwick, a neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York, you’ve probably seen the Myrtle/Broadway intersection. You know <a href="https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/050/183/Screenshot_2024-06-14_at_11.44.06_AM.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that one infamous photo</a> of an unholy Dunkin Donuts-Checkers-Popeyes trifecta next to a subway stop? Yep, that’s Myrtle/Broadway. It even has <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/myrtle-broadway-jmz-subway-stop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its own Know Your Meme page</a>. Now one <em>Halo </em>player, Corey Cash, is taking the meme a step further.</p><p>Cash, a Bushwick resident, is in the process of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bushwick/comments/1dpbxxf/in_the_process_of_making_the_myrtlebroadway/?share_id=dxiEfEJ6t4GAWi7Ix4KST&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recreating Myrtle/Broadway</a> using <em>Halo Infinite</em>’s versatile Forge mapmaking tool. Why? In part to honor a deceased friend who used to live in the area, but also because “Myrtle/Broadway offers the most dynamic, multilayer play experience for a big team FPS vs other Brooklyn intersections.”</p><p>“From the street level to the station platform, you have many vantage and hiding spots to keep the fight interesting,” he told Aftermath.</p><p>Cash, who builds restaurants for a living, isn’t just eyeballing it. He’s committed to accurately realizing the spirit of the place, if not every last detail.</p><p>“I pulled a lot of Google maps, Department of Building[s] plans, Department of Environmental Protections and ConEd diagrams to reference street layouts, building plans, and electrical and sewer system layouts,” Cash said. “Not all parts of the map are 1:1 scale, but referencing all this certainly helped. You’ll be able to run under Broadway via open manhole covers and ConEd’s underground maintenance tunnels and DEP’s sewers.”</p><p>Cash feels this is important because he wants Myrtle/Broadway to transcend time and space even more than it already has.</p><p>"I have a lot of the underbelly of this map exposed due to the fact that the map is built to look as though a fragment of Brooklyn was detached from Earth and is now an asteroid floating in space," said Cash. "I did this because I didn’t want to waste memory on a cityscape in the background that wasn’t playable, and the present Brooklyn timeline doesn’t line up with <em>Halo</em>’s timeline, so making it a remnant of Brooklyn floating in space seemed on brand."</p><p>As we’ve all suspected, the Dunkin-Checkers-Popeye hydra can survive anything, even the end of the world. But that’s not the only landmark Cash is focused on nailing the look and feel of.</p><p>“I felt the JZM [subway] stop was the most important to get down correctly – and the street layout,” he said. “Then the icons; the Dunkin-Checkers-Popeyes trifecta was a must. Mr Kiwi, Market Hotel, and all the bodegas are there and open as a part of the field of play. Bars like Alaska, Jade, and Skytown are due to be built. Little nuances and the community here give Myrtle/Broadway its character. Will certainly need to script the sock vendor’s soul and funk music into the map somehow. A must.”</p><p>Right now, Cash isn’t thinking too far ahead. He just wants “both Brooklyn and Xbox to have as much fun with the map as I am.” He does, however, plan on creating other iconic portions of Brooklyn in <em>Halo </em>once he’s finished with this map. It’s gonna be a tough act to follow, though.</p><p>"It’s hard to beat Myrtle/Broadway,” Cash said.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This  “improved” version of the character hasn’t been well received online, so it’s nice to hear that Capcom is offering a different model based on the OG Frank West in the remaster. However, there’s a catch. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196790" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Why Everybody Hates This Dragon's Dogma 2 NPC" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="142" data-playlist="196790,196411,196055" data-current="196790"><div><p>Why Everybody Hates This Dragon's Dogma 2 NPC</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196790/196790_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196790/196790_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196790/196790_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196790/196790_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22347.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/dead-rising&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/dead-rising">The original <em>Dead Rising</em></a></span> was released in 2006 on Xbox 360 and later ported to other platforms. The game stars Frank West, a photojournalist who has covered wars before, and his investigation of a massive zombie outbreak in and around a small-town mall.  In June, Capcom surprised fans with an announcement that it was remastering the original game. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/xyZ7gagpgsU&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/xyZ7gagpgsU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">But that first teaser</a></span> featured a new look and voice for Frank West. Fans weren’t happy about it. And Capcom, who probably predicted such a reaction, has an offer for those fans: Pre-order the game to get classic Frank. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-has-classic-frank-and-even-chuck-skins-but-only-if-you-preorder&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-has-classic-frank-and-even-chuck-skins-but-only-if-you-preorder" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As spotted by IGN</a></span>, Capcom is now taking pre-orders for<em> Dead Rising</em> on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.deadrising.com/1/en-us/#product&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.deadrising.com/1/en-us/#product" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">its official website</a></span>. And as you might expect from a AAA video game publisher in 2024, pre-ordering <em>Dead Rising</em> comes with some bonuses. One of those perks is a skin for Frank West that turns him back into his more pudgy and younger-looking self as seen in the original 2006 version of <em>Dead Rising. </em></p><p>Now normally, a few tiny cosmetic bonuses included with a pre-order wouldn’t cause much alarm or anger. And I do think the other pre-order bonus skin—based on the main character from <em>Dead Rising 2</em>—is pretty cool! But some fans aren’t happy that the one big complaint they have with the upcoming remaster—the new, weird-looking Frank West—can only be fixed by giving Capcom some money now before reviews are out and people have had a chance to play the game. </p><p>And once the game is out, will it still be possible to get this classic skin? Will Capcom sell it to folks at a later date? Or will it get added to the game as a freebie down the line? For now, we don’t know, but the game’s official site does mention—in tiny text—that these pre-order bonuses may be “made available separately at a later date.”  </p><p>Oh, and don’t expect this classic model to sound like he did in the Xbox 360 game, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/FrankByDaylight/status/1806716618699059583?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/FrankByDaylight/status/1806716618699059583?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as the original voice actor says Capcom never even asked him to return</a></span>.</p><p>Honestly, the OG Frank West model feels like something that you should unlock after beating the game once. Or after killing a specific number of zombies. It should be a fun reward for playing <em>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster</em> and not a way to get more people to pre-order something before they even have a chance to play it or read a few reviews. </p><p><em>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster </em>launches September 19 on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It turns out that Bray was holding his Master Sword fidget toy while walking around the center of Nuneaton, a town in England. Considering the fact that the blade on the toy measures at six inches, the officers believed he was openly walking around with a weapon, and eventually arrested Bray for carrying a “bladed article” when he approached them.</p><p>According to the reports, the too-long Master Sword fidget toy was in its sheath, though it could come off with the press of a button. Bray admitted that he could understand how his toy could be mistaken for a weapon, but also protested that he would’ve ever used it as such to no avail. Per the UK’s knife laws, you cannot carry a knife with a blade longer than three inches, so you can see why the police would’ve been concerned.<br></p><p>A sergeant of the investigations unit stated, “We take a zero tolerance to bladed articles in public, and Bray has fallen afoul of this. It is possible to find fidget toys that aren’t six-inch blades. It is possible not to walk down the street holding them out in front of you.”<br></p><p>If you ask me, four months is a bit much. Not only will Bray be in prison for a third of a year, but he’s also being made to pay a fine for…walking around with a toy. I can absolutely recognize the threat of a <em>six-inch </em>blade, but at some point, it feels like intent, as well as the manufacturer’s responsibility, needs to be taken into account. If he’s a repeat offender with a history, I’d be more inclined to acquiesce, but he’s probably just a guy with anxiety who grew up liking <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>, and now he’s got a record. Though I’ve repeatedly insisted that gamers <em>should </em>pay for their crimes, this isn’t what I meant.<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Swinging into action to face off against fellow heroes and villains in the Timestream Entanglement crisis, Spider-Man does everything that you'd expect a hero possessing the proportionate speed, strength, and agility of a spider to be capable of. One fun twist here is that players can run along walls as Spidey, gaining a distinct traversal advantage in the heat of battle.</p><p>Beyond that, Spider-Man can swing around the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-will-let-you-destroy-maps-with-superpowers-just-not-completely/1100-6523370/" data-ref-id="1100-6523370">semi-destructible stages</a>, unleash a barrage of web-attacks, and ground opponents with his ultimate attack. The video also showed off some of the different outfits that Spidey can wear, as you'll be able to dress him up as the rebellious Spider-Punk or as the bombastic Bag-Man.</p>

<p>In case this Spidey sounds familiar, that's because Yuri Lowenthal--from Sony's recent Spider-Man games--is voicing him, adding another Spider-Man performance to his credits. This version isn't related to developer Insomniac's Spider-Man, and is a different webhead who finds himself caught up in the mess created by Dr. Doom and his 2099 counterpart.</p><p>First announced for PC earlier this year, Marvel Rivals will also be headed to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S in the future. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/marvel-rivals-characters-every-superhero-and-supervillain/2900-5216/#2" data-ref-id="2900-5216">Spider-Man is just one of many playable characters</a> in the game, and if you're lucky, you might get to try some of them out when the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-coming-to-consoles-ps5-beta-and-exclusive-spidey-costume-confirmed/1100-6523816/" data-ref-id="1100-6523816">Marvel Rivals PC and console closed beta</a> kicks off on July 23. This will be a "large-scale" test held in North America, Europe, and other unspecified regions, and the PS5 version will offer an exclusive Scarlet Spider costume for Spider-Man.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pvpve-extraction-rpg-dungeonborne-gets-one-last-playtest-ahead-of-launch.918240/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dungeonborne-playtest-early-access<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Gritty fantasy extraction RPG&nbsp;<em>Dungeonborne&nbsp;</em>has revealed that it's holding one final playtest before its Early Access release, although we still don't know exactly when the game is arriving.</p>
<p>If you head over to the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2448970/Dungeonborne/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam page</a> right now, you'll be greeted with the chance to request access to the game's newest playtest, which developer Mithril Interactive says will contain several improvements and updates "based on community feedback".</p>
<p>These improvements include balance changes for&nbsp;<em>Dungeonborne</em>'s various classes, as well as overhauls for three weapon sets and a new weapon to try out.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dungeonborne-playtest-gothic-city.jpg?itok=ldWzYHNF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dungeonborne-playtest-gothic-city.jpg?itok=6bu7H6TK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dungeonborne&nbsp;</em>will have some new tricks up its sleeve for its newest playtest.</figcaption></figure><p>Specifically, Mithril Interactive says&nbsp;<em>Dungeonborne</em>'s Pyromancer, Priest, Death Knight, and Fighter have been "balanced, changed, or entirely reworked", and a new class, Druid, is also set to make its debut in the new playtest.</p>
<p>The Sword and Shield, Dual Swords, and Fire Staff weapon sets have all been "rebuilt from the ground up", boasting new animations, mechanics, and moves.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Orb, a new weapon that can be paired with the Sword or the Mace, has been introduced, adding an icy twist to your melee combat.</p>
<p>All of these features are available in the new&nbsp;<em>Dungeonborne&nbsp;</em>playtest, so if you want to head in and try out the extraction RPG's newest tweaks, all you've got to do is click "Request access" on the game's Steam page.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Dungeonborne</em>, it's a PvPvE extraction RPG in a similar vein to the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dark-and-darker"><em>Dark and Darker</em></a>, although this one hopefully won't be at the center of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dark-and-darker-appears-on-epic-games-store-in-spite-of-legal-battle-against-nexon">similar legal battle</a>.</p>
<p>The game tasks players with delving into dungeons in search of treasure before deciding whether to extract early to secure their loot or to delve deeper and risk it all for more.</p>
<p>We still don't have a concrete release date for&nbsp;<em>Dungeonborne&nbsp;</em>yet, but you can request access to the game's latest (and final) closed playtest right now. Stay tuned for more.</p>

The last major cross-gen exclusive Sony released was<em> God Of War Ragnarök </em>at the end of 2022. The following year’s<em> Spider-Man 2</em> launched without a PS4 version. <em>Burning Shores</em>, 2023's expansion for the cross-gen <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em>, was also a “next-gen” exclusive. “PlayStation 4 Generation Is Well And Truly Over!” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Zuby_Tech/status/1686106539457716224&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Zuby_Tech/status/1686106539457716224" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one viral tweet</a></span> from last summer read. “Crossgen Is Over!”</p><p>Despite hinting that development <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-expects-to-be-done-with-ps4-games-by-2025&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-expects-to-be-done-with-ps4-games-by-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">would be phased out by 2025</a></span>, Sony has never officially confirmed that it’s done making games for the PS4. It’s last word on the subject came from recently minted PlayStation co-CEO Hermen Hulst in 2022.  “We certainly don’t want to forget the millions of active players on PS4, and we want to ensure there are great games for them as well,” the then-head of PlayStation Studios <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.axios.com/2022/10/04/playstation-hermen-hulst-pc-mobile-interview&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.axios.com/2022/10/04/playstation-hermen-hulst-pc-mobile-interview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>Axios</em></a></span><em> </em>at the time. “We’re evaluating it on a case-by-case basis.”</p><p>There was reason to think one or two first-party projects might still squeak out onto the older hardware. In addition to being on Nintendo Switch due to licensing demands, <em>MLB The Show 24</em> also still came to PS4 and Xbox One. Then Sony revealed <em>Horizon Lego Adventures </em>at Summer Game Fest, a kid-friendly co-op game seemingly aimed at broadening the sci-fi series appeal. </p><p>To that end the it’s coming to Switch in addition to PS5 when it launches later this year, but weirdly not PS4. That feels like an intentional business decision rather than a technical necessity. The older system can clearly handle the benchmarks set by Nintendo’s aging handheld hybrid and is no doubt active in millions of households with children that still haven’t upgraded to PS5, and perhaps still won’t since this year’s <em>Call of Duty</em>, <em>Madden</em>, and <em>EA FC Sports</em> (formerly known as <em>FIFA</em>) will all be available on the last generation machines.</p><p>But 2024 has been full of of PlayStation console exclusives and almost all of them have skipped the PS4. Earlier this year those included <em>Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth</em>, <em>Helldivers 2</em>, <em>Stellar Blade</em>, and <em>Rise of the Rōnin</em>, the latter three of which were published by Sony. <em>Granblue Fantasy: Relink </em>was the lone exception, probably because its development was originally announced back in 2016. </p><p>More recently, Sony revealed its upcoming live service hero shooter <em>Concord</em> will be a PS5 console exclusive too. It may have been technically unfeasible to bring the <em>Overwatch 2</em> competitor to a weaker system, but there certainly would have been an interest in aiming it at as big an audience of potential PS Plus subscribers as possible.<em> Astro Bot </em>skipping PS4 also doesn’t feel like it would have been a forgone conclusion given the more Nintendo-like scope of the project, though it’s easier to understand once you see how integrated the PS5 DualSense is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-ps5-hands-on-impressions-playstation-1851535387&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-ps5-hands-on-impressions-playstation-1851535387">into the fabric of what makes the game fun and compelling</a></span>. </p><p>While unfortunate for PS4 owners, it wouldn’t be surprising if Sony has indeed quietly decided to turn the page on one of the best console-generations of all-time. If anything, it’s more shocking that the cross-gen party has lasted as long as it has. We’re already in the second half of the PS5's lifecycle and platforms have traditionally ditched development on older console generations much sooner in an effort to get more people to upgrade sooner. Covid clearly disrupted the “normal” transition periods for the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. And maybe ballooning first-party budgets did too. <em>God Of War Ragnarök </em>wouldn’t have set a sales record if it had been on new hardware alone.</p><p>It’s unclear if Horizon Lego Adventures and Astro Bot are evidence that Sony’s going to start rebuilding the smaller, less expensive part of its first-party portfolio. Is so, maybe there’s still hope for one last first-party game on PS4. Somehow I doubt it. </p><p> Sony did not respond to a request for comment. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

People also complained about the game's changes to Battlefield's classic class system and match sizes, among other things. Despite these issues, it was 2021's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-vanguard-and-black-ops-cold-war-were-no-1-and-2-best-selling-games-of-2021-in-the-us/1100-6499720/" data-ref-id="1100-6499720">No. 5 best-selling game in the US</a>.

                <p>With the launch of The First Descendant, its microtransaction system has garnered mixed reactions from players. The game has also been experiencing some issues and developer Nexon is providing some in-game compensation.</p><p>The First Descendant has been compared to other multiplayer games, such as Warframe, which is also free-to-play game. One user on Reddit compared the microtransaction system in both games and claimed that The First Descendant was "20 times more expensive than Warframe."</p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheFirstDescendant/comments/1du7tcq/the_first_descendant_is_20_times_more_expensive/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit user goompas</a> used the example of character mods, which help improve character stats, such as increasing the amount of damage they do or reduce the amount of damage taken from enemies. In Warframe, players can buy Orokin Reactor's to increase character mod capacity for 20 premium currency, which comes out to about $1.50. In The First Descendant, however, a similar item costs 1,500 premium currency, which comes out to about $30. However, mods can still be earned through gameplay.</p><p>Other Descendants take time and resources to unlock, but they can be purchased immediately with premium currency. However, the issue here and with many of the microtransactions is that the bundles of premium currency don't line up with the cost of these new characters. Players are forced to purchase multiple currency bundles as they individually don't match up to the cost of characters, so players have leftover premium currency. There are also Ultimate Descendants, which are more powerful versions, and they require rarer materials to unlock. They cost even more premium currency to unlock right away, which has faced backlash by players.</p><p>Nexon is also offering in-game compensation for launch day issues in the form of a three-day 30% gold gain, Kyper Shard gain, EXP gain, and weapon mastery EXP gain boosts, as well as two matte red paints.</p><p>The First Descendant is currently available for PC, PlayStation, and Xbox. It features <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/does-the-first-descendant-have-cross-play-and-cross-progression/1100-6524665/" data-ref-id="1100-6524665">cross-play and cross-progression</a>, letting players play with other players on different platforms, as well as carry over their progress no matter with platform they play on. Despite its issues, which include <a href="https://x.com/FirstDescendant/status/1808535266929615352" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">game-connection errors</a>, The First Descendant had a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-looter-shooter-the-first-descendant-is-off-to-a-big-start/1100-6524651/" data-ref-id="1100-6524651">strong debut</a> of over 200,000 concurrent Steam players during its launch day.</p>

            <p>We've had the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification">enshittification</a> of Google, Facebook and the public internet at large, now for the enshittification of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gta-online">GTA Online</a>. What do you mean, "it was enshittified to start with"? Take it to the comments please, because first I need to tell you about the latest GTA Online update, which allows you to collect cash accumulated in safes, request vehicles and replenish ammo using your in-game phone - but only if you pay up $8 or $7 a month for a GTA+ subscription, which is currently not available on PC.</p><!--more-->
<p>The update in question is the Bottom Dollar Bounties update, which adds a Vinewood Club app to your character's mobile, providing you're a GTA+ subscriber. As <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/grand-theft-auto/gta-online-just-locked-a-quality-of-life-feature-players-have-wanted-for-ages-behind-the-gta-paywall-and-fans-worry-it-sets-a-dangerous-precedent-for-gta-6/">Gamesradar</a> points out, putting what is being called a "basic quality-of-life feature" behind a paywall has caused something of a scrum on the reddits, and has led to dire predictions about the monetisation of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a>, to say nothing of much wailing and gnashing of teeth from poor PC players who are still waiting for Rockstar to add currently PS5/Xbox Series-exclusive features such as animals to GTA Online.</p>
<p>GTA Online players have been calling for the ability to gather safe earnings without having to visit the property in question for yonks, which makes this a bit of a monkey's paw situation. As one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/1do3ipa/gta_members_can_now_claim_business_earnings_from/">redditor</a> puts it: "So many players requested this feature, yeah they're "listening to our feedback" and figuring out how to monetize it. One of the slimiest things they've done in a while." I don't have a GTA Online business empire myself, but it certainly feels rather antiquated to have to show up yourself for every payout. This isn't Goodfellas - GTA Online is set in the 21st century. Still, nothing screams "21st century" like paywalling access to a banking app.</p>
<p>To say a little in Rockstar's defence, there's more to Bottom Dollar Bounties than fury about paywalls. There are the literal walls of the new Bail Enforcement Office, where you'll get to live the morally dubious life of a professional bounty hunter. Here's a rundown of the highlights, via press release:</p>
<blockquote><p>An all-new Bail Enforcement Office, offering lucrative opportunities to track down and haul Standard and more challenging Most Wanted Targets</p>
<p>Dispatch Work: Off-the-books activities in Freemode assisting officer Vincent Effenburger to take down LSPD's corrupt cops -- all conducted from the seat of a personal police interceptor</p>
<p>New Vehicles: The Imani Tech-eligible Enus Paragon S and Bollokan Envisage, the HSW-upgradable Übermacht Niobe and Annis Euros X32, the Invetero Coquette D1, Declasse Yosemite 1500, and a trio of new Law Enforcement Vehicles (Declasse Impaler SZ Cruiser, Bravado Greenwood Cruiser, and Bravado Dorado Cruiser)</p>
<p>Drift tuning available in three newly eligible vehicles -- the Vulcar Nebula Turbo (Sports Classic), Übermacht Cypher (Sports), and Übermacht Sentinel Widebody (Sports)</p>
<p>New Exclusive GTA+ Benefits: A new Vinewood Club phone app from which players can claim Business earnings, replenish ammo, and request vehicles; a new Vehicle Workshop in The Vinewood Club enabling Club members to mod their personal vehicles; the ability to claim the new Överflöd Pipistrello (Super) a week early for free, and more</p>
<p>Experience improvements:</p>
<p>New Career Progress rewards for Bail Enforcement</p>
<p>New Creator tools allowing players to construct their own Drift and Drag Races using new props</p>
<p>Increased base GTA$ payouts for many activities, including Open Wheel Races, Taxi Work, A Superyacht Life, Lowriders Missions, and many more</p></blockquote>
<p>As for GTA 6, it's tentatively down to launch in fall 2025. Here are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-first-trailer-reactions">some things we want</a>, based on the trailer.</p>
<p><strong>Update 3rd July 2024</strong>: In the original version of this piece, I wrote that the app let you gather cash from businesses in general - in fact, it lets you gather cash from safes accumulated within specific GTA Online businesses, such as the Agency Office. Thanks to Plake for pointing out the error.</p>

<p>Several new reports have claimed that Activision games will start to come to Xbox Games Pass in August.</p>



<p>The first claim came courtesy of eXtas1s on the <a href="https://forums.exputer.com/threads/exclusive-new-details-regarding-activision-games-coming-to-xbox-game-pass-emerge.222/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">eXputer forums</a> (who has admittingly a rough track record), but WindowsCentral’s <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/report-crash-bandicoot-n-sane-trilogy-is-coming-to-xbox-game-pass-in-august" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Jez Corden has corroborated the rumor</a>.</p>



<p>According to eXtas1s, the Tony Hawk 1+2 remake and the Spyro Reignited Triology will also be coming to the subscription service in the near future. Subsequently, in Corden’s report, he also outlines that he understands Microsoft’s strategy isn’t to release all of Actvision’s back catalog at once but rather drip feed it into the platform.</p>



<p>One question for me, though, and presumably for many people, is when old Call of Duty games will come into service. It’s something that fans have wanted since the acquisition was finalized and it at the very least would reignite arguably some of the best Call of Duty games ever to release.</p>



<p>But for now, at least, fans have the Crash Bandicoot N.Sane Trilogy to look forward to. The game was the best-selling game for eight consecutive weeks in the United Kingdom following its release and has been estimated to have sold 20 million units worldwide as of June 2024.</p>



<p>What do you think of old Activision titles finally making their way to Game Pass? Let us know in the comments below!</p>

<p>The First Descendent has been out for a few days, and it’s received a mixed overall reaction from players. One issue that has been real frustrating for some are frame rate drops within The First Descendent.</p>



<p>In a post <a href="https://tfd.nexon.com/en/news/2594639?headlineId=1015" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on the studio’s website</a>, developer Nexon has acknowledged the frame rate issues, and gave players a pretty straightforward “fix” to the problem. According to Nexon, you should just delete the game…and then reinstall, of course.</p>



<p>They say most of the issues come from players who pre-downloaded the game ahead of its launch. </p>



<p>“We are currently investigating this issue,” Nexon said. “In the meantime, if you encounter this problem, please delete and reinstall the game as a temporary solution.”</p>



<p>In addition to the frame rate problems, Nexon has a full list of known issues that it is working on for the game. Due to the nature of how it launched, the studio even <a href="https://tfd.nexon.com/en/news/2596137" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announced in-game compensation</a> for players in the form of boosts to Gold, Kyper Shards, experience, and more.</p>



<p>The First Descendent is available now for PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC.</p>
