            <p>The team at Supergiant Games has released its third patch for Hades 2.</p>
<p>As with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/first-hades-2-patch-aims-to-underline-melinoes-distinct-swift-style">previous patches</a>, the developer has taken its community feedback into account when fixing up its early access release. Changes included within this patch cover everything from Keepsakes, Daedalus Hammer upgrades, and new UI icons to music and visual effects.</p>
<p>There are also numerous bug fixes within this patch. For example, the Hades 2 team has fixed Gold Purse (Charon) not displaying as having Expired when players would expect it to, and the Rod of Fishing indicator should no longer remain visible after you miss your mark.</p>

<p>Sharing these most recent Hades 2 notes on Steam, Supergiant sait it will continue to listen to its community's feedback. However, the team noted it is "now focusing on our first Major Update" for Hades 2, which will include the next part of Hades 2's story.</p>
<p>This update still does not have a release date, however Supergiant said it is aiming to have it ready for "later this year", so stay tuned.</p>
<p>You can read the full patch notes over on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/6085006571972858968">Hades 2 Steam page</a>, but please be aware of potential spoilers.</p>

<p>On its early access debut back in May, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-early-access-launch-on-steam-reaches-over-100k-concurrent-players-24-hours-after-launch">Hades 2 reached a peak concurrent player count of over 100,000 players</a> within 24 hours of release. Its launch also gave the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-hits-new-record-following-sequels-release">original Hades a boost in player numbers</a> over on Steam.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steams-new-game-recording-beta-lets-you-instant-replay-all-those-elden-ring-deaths<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>From ShadowPlay to OBS, there’s no shortage of tools and apps that can record and share your finest gaming moments and/or hilarious failures. No matter to Valve, who’ve updated the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/steam">Steam</a> beta client with a replay system of their own.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As explained in this handy <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/gamerecording">Steam Game Recording guide</a>, you can either start and cease recording clips at your command, or keep it continuously capturing up to 120 minutes of video for later snipping. I’ve given the Game Recording beta a quick whirl in a few games, and while its capture quality is decent, the real reason to use it over rival tools is the video timeline that now lives in the standard Steam overlay. This grants instant access to clips even as they’re in they’re being recorded, so you can skip back and rewatch a moment immediately. As implicitly suggested by Valve’s guide, I employed this feature to replay my perishing at the hands of some knife-spamming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a> bullshit merchant, quickly studying his moves in preparation for a more successful rematch. Neat!</p>
<p>Sharing is a big focus as well, with built-in buttons for sending clips to friends or across devices – ideal if you own both a main PC and a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a>, which, by the by, the Game Recording beta also works on. Alternatively you can just export an MP4 to plonk on your own <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-ssd-for-gaming">SSD</a>, which is a refreshingly straightforward process compared to how most other game recorders like to either railroad you into online sharing, or hide your local copies in the deepest, darkest file directories possible.</p>
<p>I still feel that Valve’s effort isn’t <em>quite</em> what I personally want from a lightweight capturing tool: I find my most clippable moments in games happen unexpectedly, with little warning to hit a 'Start recording' shortcut, and while the always-on recording option would suit better, I’m equally un-keen on traipsing through two hours of footage to find a nine-second clip of a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-darktide">Darktide</a> baddie copping a particularly funny <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-darktides-gruesome-co-op-my-greatest-ally-is-a-rock">rock throw</a>. <a href="https://medal.tv/">Medal</a>, which retroactivelycaptures the last few seconds of play on each shortcut press, is the best fit I’ve found so far, but its interface is a UX nightmare and there’s no simple 'Save as MP4' option for trimmed-down clips. Bah.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I appreciate how Steam’s recording feature is nestled so neatly into the overlay we’ve all been using for years, and that instant-replay functionality could be pretty helpful in those "Wait wuh I missed that" moments. If you fancy trying it out, just opt into Steam’s beta client via the Settings &gt; Interface menu.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/little-kitty-big-city-the-former-half-life-devs-cat-game-for-his-kids-that-became-an-overnight-success<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Without a doubt, one of May's surprise hit games has been Little Kitty, Big City<em>.</em> Released on May 9, the wholesome adventure game about a cat looking for its way home has been massively successful, selling over 100,000 units within the first 48 hours of release, and garnering over a million plays on Game Pass. As of this writing, it also continues to hold strong among the top five downloadable titles on the Nintendo eShop.</p>
<p>The remarkably warm reception has been equally surprising to its developer, the newly formed Double Dagger Studio, helmed by Matt T. Wood.</p>
<p>Wood, whose game development career began at 3D Realms in the late '90s, spent over 16 years at Valve before deciding to break away and form his own company. Double Dagger Studio arose from his desire to challenge himself in new ways as a game developer.</p>
<p>"It was a super tough decision," he says. "Valve was a really great place to be, and going out on your own was a huge risk to take, but it was worth it to be able to have new challenges and try new things. I wanted to bring something new to the industry, work with some new people, all these different things."</p>
<p>Going out on his own also gave Wood more free time to spend with his three kids, who acted as sounding boards for his game ideas. He'd done several prototypes and experiments, but one idea that seemed to strike a chord with all of them was a game concept where you played as a cat.</p>

<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/matt-wood-double-dagger.jpeg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>

</figure>
<p>"I made a really quick prototype, made a video, put it online, and it kind of blew up," he says. "I was like, 'Wow, people seem to really be interested in this. Maybe I should focus on it more.' That was kind of the start of it."</p>
<p>Expressing oneself as a cat, doing things as a cat, and seeing things through the eyes of a cat were interesting concepts, but the next question that arose was what exactly the player was supposed to <em>do </em>as a cat? What could be the game's objective?</p>
<p>"The concept could be anything," says Wood. "You can go in a direction that might be interesting game mechanics-wise, might be interesting technology-wise, but it could take away from the feel, immersion and spark of being a cat and connecting with people in that way.</p>
<p>"My main focus was to make sure that I could maintain and capture that spark and interest of playing as and relating to cats. When you watch videos on the internet about cats, that feeling that you get when you're playing with your own cat, just watching your cat – I wanted to make sure that existed."</p>
<p>Wood wanted the focus to be less on the design and more on player experience as well as the connections they made. Then, he needed to figure out the gateway based on that. "It took a while, experimenting and figuring out what is interesting, and how that translates into an interactive experience."</p>
<p>Early concepts for Little Kitty, Big Citystill had the titular cat exploring the city to find a way home, but with a stronger emphasis on survival, having to find food and resources and sleep at appropriate times. However, that gameplay style naturally brought with it certain aspects that Wood wanted to avoid.</p>
<p>"I realized that when people want to play or connect with a cat, the last thing they want is to have that cat struggle, fail, get hurt or be in distress," he says. "It's not that type of game. This is for fun and making people smile. It didn't take very long for me to realize I can't really make a good survival game interesting without putting the cat in danger. So I scrapped that."</p>
<blockquote><p>"When people want to play or connect with a cat, the last thing they want is to have that cat struggle, fail, get hurt or be in distress"</p></blockquote>
<p>Having worked on games like Half-Life 2 and Left 4 Dead<em>,</em> Wood definitely has experience with titles that put the player character in peril. However, he notes that when that character isn't a human, things are different.</p>
<p>"I can disassociate with all the things happening to humans in video games, them getting hurt or dying or whatever. It's no big deal," he says. "But you do that to animals, it's not cool anymore."</p>
<p>Keeping the kitty out of harm's way was imperative for Wood and his team, and they quickly learned that potential players shared their feelings. "As time went on… I had people reaching out to me, asking various questions. Parents especially – they'd say, 'We've played other cat games and the cat would get hurt, and we were really worried your game was going to be similar. We don't want that.' I would have to assure them that's not what we wanted the game to be.</p>
<p>"I really tried to focus on making a game that parents could play with their kids. That was a really important thing to me, to make a game that different ages could play together at the same time and enjoy. I want it to be an experience where everybody feels joy and they don't have to stress about anything. This is a positive game about the joy of playing as a cat. Not having the cat get hurt is super important."</p>
<p>As it is, the worst peril the kitty has to endure in the game is occasionally touching water or being gently carried out of a business by a disgruntled shopkeeper. Even if the cat should fall from a significant height, it will (as cats do) always land on its feet, no worse for wear. Instead of focusing on survival, the kitty gets to casually explore the city, interact with and help out all sorts of quirky animal characters, nuzzle the legs of passersby, knock potted plants off of high places, try and find find sunny spots for a quick nap, nibble on a fish here and there – typical kitty things.</p>

<p>Accurately simulating such a wide variety of catlike behavior in gameplay means getting the movement right. Judging from the feedback Wood received, he and his team succeeded – and not all of the feedback was from humans.</p>
<p>"I get videos and pictures of people's cats watching the gameplay because they're fascinated by the cat's movement," says Wood. "That was something I wanted to achieve but wasn't sure how to actually accomplish other than nailing the animations."</p>
<p>Thanks to animator Micah Breitweiser, they were able to do just that. "When I started working with Micah, she was <a href="https://x.com/__MicahB__/status/1782839038531313693">able to create these animations that were so natural,</a> more than I thought I could get out of this game," says Wood. "Now we just needed to focus more on accentuating those and bringing the animations more to the front so we can showcase her work more."</p>
<p>In fact, Breitweiser's animations for the kitty raised the bar so significantly that other aspects of the character were tweaked to better compliment them, such as how the cat turned or leaped onto ledges.</p>
<blockquote><p>"Valve was a really great place to be, but I wanted to bring something new to the industry"</p></blockquote>
<p>"We would go back and revisit those, and I would redo a lot of things to [improve them]," says Wood. "I went with a system where the spine would follow the head, so now when you turn, you're basically controlling the chest, and the head and everything else follows behind. You get very fluid turns and movements cats would do as they move around. The old way was, you move around, you're turning, and then you stop and immediately go back to idle [animation]. It's kind of jarring, but common in video games. But when you're looking up close at this cat that's beautifully animated and precise in a lot of ways, it suddenly feels not as good, so I started to invest in dynamic spine animation. I think it helped a lot with making things feel more natural and less like animation states."</p>
<p>The animation could be particularly tricky when it came to the kitty making jumps, giving the game some platformer elements. However, since the kitty wasn't your average platforming character, the team had to approach its animation differently.</p>
<p>"There's all these ideal jumping arcs, timings and stuff for platformers, and they work really well in those situations," says Wood, "but we were riding that line between trying to feel a little bit like a platformer but still grounding everything in as much reality as we could. Doing those really floaty jumps that a lot of platformers do, I tried it for a while and it just feels bad when you put it in a system like this where you're trying to do realistic animations and make things feel natural."  Undoubtedly one of the biggest fears a fledging studio has is whether or not their debut title will be well-received by the gaming community. For Wood, he strove to keep his expectations tempered.</p>
<p>"You try your best to focus on all those playtests that you had where people would say good things, the good feedback you're getting," he says. "You have to find a balance between 'My game is going to tank because of X, Y and Z' and 'No, I've been through this before. I know what the focus is going to be on. I don't have to worry about these other things.' I think in the end, it didn't matter for a lot of those areas."</p>
<p>Wood was right, perhaps far more than he expected. As mentioned at the outset, Little Kitty, Big City became an overnight success.</p>
<p>"It was surprising," he says. "I had modest projections about what I was hoping to do by the end of the year, and we hit those pretty quickly. I'm really happy to hear and see that people are connecting with it and getting out of it what I hoped they would.</p>
<p>"The other thing that was surprising: I had no idea how well it would be received on Game Pass. I assumed it would fly under the radar, but I was getting emails and messages saying, 'I'm an Xbox player, I normally play racing games, but I tried out your game on Game Pass and really enjoyed it. Thank you for making it.' That's super cool." Between the highly successful Stray in 2022, Little Kitty, Big City's recent meteoric rise, and Copycat coming out later this year, it seems like "cat simulator" games are becoming a hot commodity, and game developers are rising to meet demand. Wood finds himself fortunate that Little Kitty, Big City was able to get in on the ground floor.</p>
<p>"It feels like it's an introduction. 'Hey, you get to play as a cat.' The games that come out after won't be able to use that marketing point as much. It won't be as powerful."</p>
<p>As cat games become more common and less of a novelty, Wood notes that the challenge for developers will become finding ways to make future games in a similar vein unique from what came before.</p>
<p>"They have to do something more interesting, deeper," he says. "I think that there's a lot of potential in making games that you actually play as a cat that feels like a cat and not a cartoon character with a cat face and ears or as a human character that looks like a cat. It's just a normal platformer where you're just playing as a cat character. I think there's absolutely a lot of opportunity, focusing on an actual cat game, for sure. And I look forward to it."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/27/f1-manager-24-is-also-coming-to-nintendo-switch-in-july/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Frontier has announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/f1-manager-24">F1 Manager 24</a> will be coming to Nintendo Switch on 23rd July, day and date alongside the previously announced PlayStation, Xbox and PC versions of the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="F1® Manager 2024 | Nintendo Switch™ Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E1b8f0VhsEw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>It will be really interesting to see how F1 Manager 24 scales back down to Nintendo Switch, though the game is already pretty adaptable. Ever since the first game in 2022, Frontier has brought the game to PS4 and Xbox One, and has rather modest PC requirements as well. Naturally a big part of the game will be spent trawling through menus and management options, with the most demanding aspect to be the real time race rendering. On other platforms this is only shown at 1x and 2x speeds before switching to a track map view, so with some sensible graphics cut backs, this should hopefully be fairly performant on the hybrid console still.</p>

<p>The third year of the F1 Manager series from Frontier is bringing a new Create A Team option for the Career, letting you add an eleventh team to race alongside the ten real world teams.</p>

<p>This will let you style the team in your image, from creating the livery to negotiating sponsorship opportunities, and all the rest of the team management gameplay, as you try to chart your course through to the front of the grid. Regardless of the team you pick or create, you’ll be the Team Principal, of course, charged with managing the team’s resources, sticking to the budget cap, hiring staff to improve your performance, managing training schedules and more, and you’ll also be investing in HQ improvements to further that. You’ll have to fight to keep your best staff around as rival teams look to poach your best and brightest.</p>
<p>Alongside the career is the returning Race Replay mode, which will lift the events from the real world racing calendar and ask you to try and beat a particular challenge. The highlight in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/07/27/f1-manager-2023-review/">F1 Manager 23</a> was getting Alonso a win at a wet Monaco, while from the early races in 2024, it could be taking charge of McLaren or Mercedes during last weekend’s Saudi GP, following Lance Stroll’s crash and safety car.</p>
<p>We went hands on with F1 Manager 24 a little while ago. Read <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/15/f1-manager-24-preview-making-andrettis-dream-come-true/">our full preview here</a>, but I said, “F1 Manager is steadily growing into the role of capturing all the ins and outs of the motorsports soap opera that is Formula 1. OK, it probably won’t ever capture all the drama and snippy infighting that goes on (and that’s before Netflix comes along to cook up its own narratives), but F1 Manager 24 is bringing a good set of new features, requested changes, and general improvements to the table.”</p>

            <p>
Elden Ring player Let Me Solo Her became a legend in the game's community for single-handedly assisting others to beat Malenia a thousand times, the game's most infamous boss - even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/let-me-solo-her-receives-congratulatory-sword-from-elden-ring-publisher">receiving an official sword as a reward</a>.
</p>
<p>
Now they've returned for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Elden Ring DLC</a> Shadow of the Erdtree, with the aim of assisting others on a new boss. And with that, comes a new name.

<p>

Let Me Solo Her is now Let Me Solo Him and Messmer is the new target.
</p>
<p>
Messmer is the fiery snake guy from the trailers who resides atop the Shadow Keep. Despite being fought only halfway through the DLC, he's a tricky boss with a Malenia-esque moveset that's proving difficult for many players.
</p>
<p>
For Let Me Solo Him, though, it looks like a breeze. They've successfully learnt the moveset and rhythm of attacks and, as shown in the video in the post below, are able to beat the boss single-handedly without taking a single hit.

Let Me Solo Him is one of multiple players online who are already showing off some impressive feats of skill.
</p>
<p>
Take Shura, who's managed to defeat the second major boss Rellana without armour and without taking a single hit. Instead, they use the Buckler Parry and new Deflecting Hardtear to parry every attack - simple right?! "It's like playing Sekiro on Elden Ring," they posted on YouTube.

Another streamer, Bushy, is attempting to beat each boss in Shadow of the Erdtree with just one hit, as spotted by <a href="https://www.vg247.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-streamer-one-shotting-bosses">VG247</a>.
</p>
<p>
Bushy began with a 100 percent completed save file and spent a <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2181450323">long stream experimenting with different builds</a>. Eventually, around the six hour mark, the streamer beat Gaius in one hit with a perfume bottle build and plenty of buffing, madness spells. Then it was on to Messmer who also was defeated with laughable ease.

<p>
As for the rest of us, the Shadow of the Erdtree experience has been more like this:

Yesterday FromSoftware released an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-patch-revises-shadow-realm-blessing-balance">update for the game to rebalance its Shadow Blessings</a>, which should make the game a little easier.

            <p>Popular monster-enslaving sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworld-best-pals-ranked">Palworld</a> has a big new update, which introduces the game's long-promised PvP multiplayer Arena together with a new island, new Pals, new Pal skills, a new Raid, new buildings and construction options, new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> activities and items - new everything, basically. The island is Sakurajima, a place of pink blossoms and red Tori gates which is ruled by the Moonflower faction from the security of their tower HQ. As for the Arena, where players can have their Pals duel for supremacy, you'll find it in the Dessicated Desert. Catch a glimpse of all the wanton Pokenot abuse in the below trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>Titled Steam version v0.3.1, the update makes Palworld's landscape a lot busier and more distracting. There are new Junkyards where you might find valuable items, monster dens where you can obtain Pal eggs, and the possibility of meteorite impacts, which may supply you with additional supplies. There are also whispers of a new Pal that lives in outer space, which you might stumble across by way of those meteorites somehow.</p>
<p>You can look forward to Medal Merchants who trade rare items for new Dog Coins, and Hard Modes for Tower Bosses, "allowing you to face them in their ultimate form". Continuing its descent ever deeper into smiling puppy-eyed dystopia, the Palworld has also just discovered crude oil: you can extract the stuff from certain spots around the world, and use it to craft materials such as Plasteel. Oil may also be obtained from Oil Rigs, strongholds owned by the Rayne Syndicate, which remind me a little visually of Metal Gear Solid 2's ocean base. There's also a new Raid, featuring Blazamut Ryu - the strongest Dragon Pal in the game.</p>
<p>In amongst the additions, Pocketpair have given Palworld's building system a rework to make it "more intuitive and smooth". You can add pillars to structures so that upper storeys don't evaporate if you accidentally flatten a supporting wall. Defensive walls can be joined up, and there's a new "axis alignment function". The maximum base level is now 25, and you now own a total of four bases, though the devs note that having several (or having a lot of Pals per base) might cause performance issues.</p>
<p>There's a new glass material so that you can build terrible see-through modernist panopticons and keep your Pal labourers under surveillance while lurking indoors. Work Pals will now use defensive facilities automatically, and there's a new private lock function for chests to stop so-called friends stealing your raw materials. There are new facilities and decorations, too, including wall-mounted signs on which you might write invigorating workplace slogans, and "Pal Disassembly Conveyors" that allow you to dispose of unwanted Pals without bloodying your hands and beginning to feel like the accursed child of Old Macdonald and Lady MacBeth. Alas, it is too late to be good, for there are always more Pals to harvest. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworlds-skin-deep-pokemon-parody-is-part-of-a-bigger-horror-story">The Machine must be fed</a>.</p>
<p>Last but not least, those new Pal skills. They include passives such as Nocturnal, which lets Pals work throughout the night, and a few unique active abilities such as Raging Flame Wave for Faleris and Jumping Stinger for Menasting. It's a lot. Far too much Palworlding for one article, if you ask me - there are more tweaks and features in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1623730/view/4159718272378624292?l=english">the full patch notes</a>.</p>

            <p>
Ubisoft's decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-delists-the-crew-with-servers-shutting-next-year">shut down servers for its open-world racer The Crew</a> came as a blow to the game's community. But, rather than remaining defeated by this news, a group of dedicated modders decided to take matters into their own hands - and began recreating the server-side software necessary to play The Crew online once again. </p>
<p>
This fan-lead project, codenamed The Crew Revival (at least for now), currently has five members working on it. "We started pretty much as soon as Ubisoft announced the shutdown last December," team member whammy4 told Eurogamer. 
</p>
<p>"It's still the same game that everyone played before, except instead of connecting to Ubisoft's central server, they will connect to ours (or a local server running on their computers if they choose to play offline)," he explained. 
</p>

</div><figcaption>Newscast: For Xbox, could this year finally be the one where it all pays off?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPVhT_7O0iE" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
While whammy4 knows that many online-only games have been shut down over the years, he believes The Crew stands out for "several reasons" as being worthy of saving. Most importantly? "It can be, and often is, played solo on your own", whammy 4 said, meaning Ubisoft "artificially enforced constant online connectivity constraints" on its players. </p>
<p>"As we know, [this] resulted in this AAA full price game being completely inaccessible for the 12+ million players who own(ed) the game."</p>
<p>
Whammy4 called Ubisoft's decision to shut down The Crew's servers "completely unacceptable", adding this type of action from developers and publishers "seems to be an alarmingly rising trend" in the video game industry. In addition to shutting down servers, Ubisoft also reportedly started <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reportedly-revoking-the-crew-from-owners-libraries-following-server-shutdown">removing the game from owners' libraries</a> and revoking their user licence in the process back in April.
</p>
<p>
"If the trend continues, in a decade we'll have tons of unplayable, dead video games that people once loved and played, which is why video game preservation is extremely important, before the situation spins out of control," whammy4 continued.

<p>
This project is evidently incredibly important to the entire Crew Revival team, with whammy4 calling the original game a "unique" experience. 
</p>
<p>
"It is the only video game, even to this day, to allow the player to cruise along an open world, contiguous, scaled down yet still huge USA. To give up on such a remarkable video game would be a crime," he said. 
</p>
<p>
Whammy4 does not yet know exactly when The Crew Revival's servers will be available to the public, although he said the team hopes to have everything ready before The Crew's 10th anniversary, which is this December. When it is all sorted, however, it will be free. 
</p>
<p>
"The reception [to The Crew Revival] from people who are both familiar and unfamiliar with the game has been greatly positive, as they are happy to see the game be revived, and be preserved, like all games deserve to be," whammy4 said, telling me he believes there are "one or more" of Ubisoft's Ivory Tower developers in the revival's Discord server. 
</p>
<p>"I think Ubisoft heard enough criticisms from their customers [following the server shut down], but I have one thing to say to The Crew's community: they should absolutely not let Ubisoft keep getting away with such horrendous practices, otherwise it will just keep happening to more and more games, including The Crew's sequels, and history will just keep repeating itself," he closed. "People must not forget."</p>
<p>To stay up to date on how whammy4 and the rest of the team are getting on with The Crew's preservation project, you can <a href="https://discord.com/invite/gUczTkphGE">join the revival's Discord server here</a>. </p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-crew-review">Eurogamer's own review for The Crew</a>, Outside Xbox's racing aficionado Mike Channel came away impressed. "It's a game that requires and occasionally enforces patience, but like all great road trips it's about the journey, not the destination," he wrote.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hades-2-release-date-details-everything-we-know">Hades 2</a>'s third early access patch is of the gargantuan variety. It improves Olympian Boons, adds lots of new UI icons, reworking Keepsakes, and basically touches every aspect of the game you could possibly think of. One thing it doesn't change is how sexy the gods are, but because they're so sexy anyway, I don't think that's an issue moving forwards.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Right at the top of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/6085006571972858968">patch notes</a> there's mention of a few topline changes everyone will appreciate. Namely, many Duo Boons and Legendary Boons being offered more frequently, increases to the minimum number of Boons you'll find past Erebus, and a tweak to your Gathering Tool that grants you +1 Elemental Essence.</p>
<p>At the Altar Of Ashes a host of Grasp costs and their positions have been moved, meaning you might need to reset your Arcana loadout once you've booted up the game. As for Keepsake changes, I'm into the Silken Sash no longer meaning you lose your armour if you switch to a different keepsake. And that Olympian Keepsakes mean their respective Olympian Boons will appear more frequently, allowing for a lovely bit of synergy.</p>
<p>The Boons change log is monstrous, but there's quite a few that have been cut or are entirely new additions. Many Hexes Of Selene have also seen blanket buffs in the mana-spend department, meaning they won't hog your blue bar quite so relentlessly.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, there are loads of major and minor bug fixes, UI tweaks, and plenty more little bits and pieces. Supergiant say that now this patch is done, they'll focus on the first "Major Update" for sometime later this year.</p>
<p>Thanks to lots of other good video games coming out this year, I've not spent as much time as I'd like with Hades 2. But I do think it's been a fantastic investment, in the sense that it's practically transforming into a totally different game with these colossal patches. Do I hold off until it's out of early access? Maybe? Maybe I'll spend some time with some of the other <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">best roguelikes</a> on our list, not that I need anymore suffering in my gaming life right now. Cheers Elden Ring.</p>

			<p>Earlier today, a new CAPCOM Next event was <a href="https://x.com/CapcomUSA_/status/1806137312830800334" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> by the Japanese publisher. The broadcast will go live on all main platforms (YouTube, Twitch, TikTok, Facebook) on Monday, July 1, 2024, at 3 PM Pacific Time.</p>
<p>The studio clarified a few things in advance: this CAPCOM Next broadcast will last around 25 minutes and will not include any news about <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-summer-game-fest-impressions-surviving-the-dangerous-open-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>. It will focus instead on three specific games: the newly unveiled Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess, and Resident Evil 7: Biohazard for iPhone/iPad/Mac.</p>
<p>The first game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-gets-surprise-announcement-2024-release-and-controversial-frank-west-redesign/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> yesterday with a surprise teaser. As shown in the pictures below, it is getting a substantial visual facelift. Other than that, we'll have to wait for the broadcast to learn more details about the remaster.</p>

<p>The last game shown in the CAPCOM Next broadcast is Resident Evil 7 Biohazard. Of course, this isn't a new game; it's likely this will only take a few minutes of the presentation, with the publisher revealing some technical specifications of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-7-biohazard-coming-to-iphone-ipad-and-mac-on-july/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iPhone/iPad/iMac port</a>. The game will be available to play the day after the event.</p>

        <p>Thousands could be affected at the company's offices in Beijing, Shanghai, and Chengdu</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Chinese company Perfect World has reportedly laid off thousands of employees.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/perfect-world-cuts-staff-in-multi-unit-layoffs-reportedly-suspends-game-projects">Game Developer</a> (translating a report from Chinese publication <a href="https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_27838848">The Paper</a>), the firm has made extensive cuts across its offices in Beijing, Shanghai, and Chengdu.</p>
<p>Most departments were reportedly impacted, apart from its esports segment.</p>
<p>Concerning its games currently in development, conflicting reports have emerged: The Paper said both One-Punch Man: World and Perfect New World are still being developed, while <a href="https://pandaily.com/perfect-world-lays-off-over-a-thousand-employees/">Pandaily</a> reported that they've been "suspended."</p>
<p>Perfect World is known for being a developer and publisher, as well as the exclusive distributor of Dota 2 and Counter-Strike 2 in China. It has a film production company as well.</p>
<p>Several publications have reported that it had recently experienced a sharp decline in revenue, as per its annual financial report, with net profit dropping 64% year-on-year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/embracer-group-acquires-perfect-world-entertainment-digic">Perfect World sold the publishing branch of its European subsidiary to Embracer in December 2021</a>, which was then <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/perfect-world-entertainment-rebrands-to-gearbox-publishing">renamed to Gearbox Publishing in April 2022</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/report-embracer-layoffs-also-affect-gearbox-publishing">firm was hit by layoffs last year,</a> alongside many other Embracer studios, and its San Francisco office was <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/gearbox-publishing-is-now-arc-games">renamed again in April 2024, to Arc Games</a>.</p>

        <p>Developer set to unionise with the CWA, is the second ZeniMax studio to form a union</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Bethesda Game Studios Montreal has filed to unionise with the Communications Workers of America.</p>
<p>The BGS Montreal union announced yesterday in a thread on <a href="https://x.com/OneBGS_MTL/status/1806001296593346639">social media</a> that they filed for certification with the Quebec Labour Board.</p>
<p>"As a union, we will strive to make BGS a supportive workplace that fosters creativity and talent," it wrote. "This will allow us to keep creating some of the best video games in the industry in the jobs and studios we all love.</p>
<p>"Having a seat at the table will ensure job security as well as improve transparency, accountability, flexibility, and more. We aim to make sure everyone receives fair compensation for their work and the value they provide."</p>
<p>BGS Montreal is the second ZeniMax studio to unionise. In January 2023, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/zenimax-qa-workers-form-union">ZeniMax QA workers formed ZeniMax Workers United</a>, with a majority of 300 employees across ZeniMax's US operations voting in favour of unionisation.</p>
<p>Last month, the CWA announced that all ZeniMax studio workers were covered by Microsoft's labour neutrality agreement, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/microsoft-and-cwa-enter-labor-neutrality-agreement">which both parties entered in 2022</a>, meaning the firm is legally bound to take a neutral stance on unionisation.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/victrix-pro-bfg-controller-review.912804/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/27/victrix-pro-bfg-controller-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>When you name your controller after Doom’s most devastating weapon, you’re making a clear statement about just how powerful you think it is. With the Victrix Pro BFG, that initial statement is backed up by one of the most versatile and impressive controller packages in recent years.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Victrix Pro BFG Wireless Controller" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Unhp5o8ALoQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Victrix Pro BFG is a wireless modular controller for PS5, PS4 and PC, our review unit decked out in PS5-centric white, with a proprietary USB dongle for connections. There’s also a black Xbox-flavoured version if that’s more your thing. Alongside the wireless option, there’s a 3-metre-long USB-C braided cable, to give the reassurance of a wired connection and reduce latency as much as possible, but that’s not all that you’ll find tucked away in the box.</p>


<p>This is where the Victrix Pro BFG’s package really starts to impress, and that’s before you’ve even tried playing a game with it. There’s a sturdy, hard-shell carry case, boasting the same white and purple colour scheme as the controller. Within it, there’s everything you could need to customise the Pro BFG to exactly how you like it, or exactly what a particular game needs.</p>
<p>This is a modular controller, much like the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/19/thrustmaster-eswap-x2-pro-controller-review/">Thrustmaster eSwap</a> series, and what that means is that you can swap around some of the components to suit your tastes. The left-hand module can be unscrewed – a nifty little screwdriver is included – so you can have either symmetrical or asymmetrical analogue sticks. If you’re a former Xbox player who now dabbles in the PlayStation side of things, you can at make your controller layout feel “right”, to go with the rather Xbox-like form it takes.</p>


<p>Alongside that, the right-hand module can be swapped out entirely, and there’s a fightpad – a six-button microswitch setup that ditches the analogue stick – that you can slot into place, and is ideal if you’re trying to perfect your combos in Street Fighter 6 or Tekken 8. Personally, this is a game-changer, and while it takes a few moments to swap, it’s well worth it for the huge advantage it’ll give you if you prefer playing fighting games with a pad rather than a stick. If you like an arcade stick, you should definitely check out <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/18/pdp-victrix-pro-fs-best-arcade-fight-stick-ps5-review/">Victrix’ own Pro FS stick</a>, incidentally.</p>
<p>While you’re swapping out or switching around your buttons, you can alter the analogue sticks themselves, and there’s a choice of a tall, hyper-accurate stick or a standard-length one with a PS3-style rounded head, alongside the two standard dimpled ones. There’s only one of these domed sticks, so you can’t completely mimic the old-school Dualshock 3, but it’s great to have this level of customisation. I found using the taller stick made my Overwatch 2 accuracy much greater, though it took some getting used to before I settled in.</p>
<p>In addition to that, there’s a choice of different gate types too, which are the sections that sit around the analogue stick. Current pads have circular gates, but octagonal gates can be really useful for some fighting games and other genres that would benefit from the more definite input – also N64 and GameCube emulators. It’s a shame that these aren’t using Hall Effect sensors, but Victrix are seemingly all set to release replacement Hall Effect modules in the coming months, and they are a step cheaper than some of their rivals.</p>
<p>You can also change the D-pad, and there’s a standard cross style, a circular version with a raised cross, and then Victrix’s own diamond-shaped offering. I’ve always preferred the old-school cross, but depending on what you’re playing you might want to swap it on a game-by-game basis. This is a pad that you can truly make your own, and while it can feel a little like Frankenstein’s monster – especially with the two analogue sticks changed out and a different gate in there – I genuinely can’t fault the options that Victrix have given us.</p>

<p>The Victrix Pro BFG weighs in at 271g – lighter than Victrix’ own claims – which is 13g lighter than the DualSense, and a whole 20g lighter than the standard Xbox Series X controller. There may be a few grams to be added with different sticks and gates, but our set up it was lighter and also better balanced than its standard rivals. This meant that even during the longest, sweatiest Overwatch 2 sessions – I do play other games, I promise – I never felt any fatigue thanks to my controller, just my occasionally terrible play.</p>
<p>The Victrix Pro BFG looks sleek and futuristic, but it’s also pleasingly understated. Its pure white plastic construction is interspersed with purple highlights, and large texturised grips sit comfortably beneath your palms, while a lighter texture wraps around each arm. It’s not shifting in your hands, that’s for certain, and thanks to a much improved battery life compared to the DualSense – up to 20 hours versus 8-12 – you won’t have to.</p>
<p>From there, it’s a bevy of inputs, and while you’ll find everything you’d expect on the face of the controller, there’s also a cavalcade of extra inputs and controls hidden away around the back. There’s a tiny platform selector, which is a little fiddly, but also small and precise enough that there’s no chance you’re going to catch it mid-game. You’ve then got four programmable buttons that nestle beneath your fingers, and I found these to be the most comfortable and well-placed rear buttons I’ve come across. They’re just right there, which… is kind of the point.</p>
<p>You can then control the range of each analogue trigger, and the spring-loaded selector is easy enough to figure out, holding them as you push the trigger as far as you want it to go, before then releasing them. Alternatively, you can set them with a hair-trigger so you barely have to press them – the perfect thing for lining up an instant headshot. I found that when I started using the controller, I kept undoing the settings for my triggers, somehow catching the release mechanism, but after a short amount of time, it just stopped happening. Thankfully.</p>

<p>If the level of customisation that Victrix have placed in your palms isn’t quite enough, they’ve gone even further with the Victrix Control Hub, a PC-based (or Xbox-based) app that lets you update the controller firmware, tinker with the stick and trigger deadzones, and choose from three different EQ settings for the wired audio connection. The biggest problem? The app isn’t on mobile or native to PlayStation itself, meaning that you’ll need a PC to finetune your experience. It’s a wrinkle in an otherwise flawless package.</p>
<p>There’s clearly some serious competition out there for pro controllers, and with the Victrix sitting around £170 it’s right in the centre of that conversation. It’s cheaper than the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/01/23/dualsense-edge-review-is-sonys-first-ps5-pro-controller-essential-for-gamers/">Dualsense Edge</a> and the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/07/nacon-revolution-5-pro-controller-review-ps5/">Nacon Revolution 5 Pro</a>, and boasts wireless where the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/19/thrustmaster-eswap-x2-pro-controller-review/">Thrustmaster eSwap</a> does not – we’re considering the Xbox variants, as Thrustmaster’s eSwap doesn’t have a PS5 native controller yet. It has more customisation options than all three, barring the Thrustmaster’s tiny driving wheel, and the only clear downsides are the lack of haptic rumble, and the inability to start your console up via the PlayStation button on the pad. Sony reserve such things for their own controllers, and that’s as frustrating here as it has been elsewhere.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/defunct-xbox-cloud-console-keystone-shows-up-in-patent-filing/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The long-rumored 'Keystone' Xbox cloud console has been spotted <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/the-xbox-that-never-was-our-first-detailed-look-at-the-keystone-cloud-streaming-console-design" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by Windows Central</a> in a patent filing <a href="https://ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/D1009161" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issued</a> in the United States.&nbsp;The Xbox Keystone project was set aside over two years ago. At the time, Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-cloud-streaming-device-keystone-needs-more-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>:</p>
<p><em>We have made the decision to pivot away from the current iteration of the Keystone device. We will take our learnings and refocus our efforts on a new approach that will allow us to deliver Xbox Cloud Gaming to more players around the world in the future.</em></p>
<p>A few months later, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-keystone-streaming-box-shelved-price-99-to-129-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">returned to the subject</a>, revealing that the pricing was the main issue.</p>
<p><em>The console we built that now people have seen, Keystone, was more expensive than we wanted it to be when we actually built it out with the hardware that we had inside.</em></p>
<p><em>With Keystone, we’re still focused on it and when can we get the right costs, but when you’ve got Series S at $299, and like during the holidays you’ll see some price promotion, you’ll obviously have Series X higher, I think in order for a streaming-only box to make sense, the price delta to S has to be pretty significant. I want to be able to include a controller in it when we go do that.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>I don’t want to announce pricing specifically, but I think you’ve got to be $129, $99, like somewhere in there for that to make sense in my view, that we just weren’t there. We weren’t there with the controller. And I love the effort. It worked really, really well.</em></p>
<p>It sounded like Spencer was really into the vision. Chances are Microsoft is still working on a way to lower costs to get the price where it needs to be, thus resurrecting Keystone (or a new version of it, anyway). Meanwhile, Xbox Cloud Gaming for owned games is <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-cloud-gaming-for-owned-games-is-coming-this-year-says-spencer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scheduled to launch later this year</a>, and last month, mouse and keyboard support was <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-cloud-gaming-rolls-out-mouse-and-keyboard-support-for-26-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rolled out</a> for 26 games.</p>

			<p>As <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-clip-recording/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a> around a month ago by the creator of SteamDB, Valve has now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/gamerecording" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> the Steam Game Recording beta. It's a powerful set of tools that will allow users to record, replay, clip, and share footage from their games.</p>
<div>
<p><em><strong>RECORD - Never miss a moment</strong></em></p>
<p><em>With Background Recording mode, your gameplay is continuously saved to your preferred drive, never exceeding your specified duration and storage limits. An&nbsp; On-Demand Recording mode with manual start and stop is also available. Use the&nbsp; Steam Timeline and&nbsp; Event Markers to find key moments.</em></p>
</div>

<p><strong><em>REPLAY - Quickly jump back in time</em></strong></p>
<div>
<p><em>Useful for things like seeing what went wrong when your hero died or recalling something mentioned by an NPC earlier. Accessible in the Steam Overlay for every game.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>CLIP - Find and keep the good stuff</em></strong><br>
<em>Keep only the video that matters to you. Steam offers lightweight tools to make it easy to find and clip your gameplay footage. Share and edit local footage in the redesigned Recordings &amp; Screenshots interface.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>SHARE - Conveniently send clips</em></strong><br>
<em>Get your videos where you want them. One-click share to a friend in chat or post your finest moments for the world to see. Plus, easily send footage from your Steam Deck to your PC or mobile device. Use the new Save/Share menu during or after play.</em></p>
<p><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video id="video-1527268-1" width="1280" height="720" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Feature-1.mp4?_=1"><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Feature-1.mp4">https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Feature-1.mp4</a></video></p>
<p>Valve also explained that the Steam Timeline appears whenever you’re actively recording. Timeline-enhanced games generate event markers as relevant game events happen, though for the Steam Game Recording Beta, only Valve's own Dota 2 and Counter-Strike 2 are supported. That said, developers will be able to leverage <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/timeline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an SDK and API</a> to implement the feature. Steam achievements and screenshots automatically create markers, and players can create their own markers, too.</p>
<p>It's also important to note that Steam Game Recording, unlike NVIDIA's Shadowplay, does not offer the option to record the desktop or other programs. That said, you may include audio from other programs, such as Discord. To join the beta, you must go to Steam, Settings, Interface, Beta Participation, and select one of the two available options. Then, you'll need to go to Settings, Game Recording, and pick either Background or On-Demand Recording.</p>
<p>You'll find your recordings in the folders in View &gt; Recordings &amp; Screenshots when using the Steam desktop client. From your Steam Deck, select the Media tab from the main menu. Keep in mind that you can choose where your recordings are stored on your hard drive from Steam &gt; Settings &gt; Game Recording.</p>
<p>Last but not least, the Steam Game Recording feature takes advantage of NVIDIA and AMD graphics cards to minimize the performance hit when recording. However, Intel users are seemingly out of luck, as Valve said systems without NVIDIA/AMD GPUs would have to fall back to the CPU, causing a much larger performance hit.</p>

			<p>Capcom has rolled out a new Dragon's Dogma 2 update across all platforms, adding new graphical modes on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dragonsdogma.com/2/en-us/topics/update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new patch</a> for the hit title is available now and, aside from the above-mentioned new graphical modes on consoles, it includes adjustments and additions to the storage as well as plenty of fixes. On PS5 and Xbox Series consoles, this new update also comes with a new 120Hz option, which can either be en- or disabled. In addition, the patch aims to address issues around CPU overload on certain occasions. We highly suggest reading the <a href="https://www.dragonsdogma.com/2/en-us/topics/update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full release notes here</a>. We've included a photo of the notes down below as well:</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/dragon_s-dogma-2-update.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Dragon's Dogma 2 is available worldwide now for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.&nbsp; The game was released back in March of this year, and as covered last month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragons-dogma-2-breaks-3-million-units-sold-milestone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 3 million copies of the game have been sold since launch</a>. Here's what we wrote about the long-overdue sequel to 2012's Dragon's Dogma in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragons-dogma-2-review-more-like-one-and-a-half" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch review</a>:</p>
<p><em>"The most unlikely locations may hide the greatest treasures, rewarding players after a long and arduous trip. While this is no Soulslike game (which is a massive bonus in my book), the relatively limited fast travel means you'll often have to brave the roads for a long while to reach your objective. Also, the more you fight monsters, the more you accumulate the so-called loss gauge. This meter progressively reduces the maximum health you can recover with consumables or magic abilities, and it can only be restored while resting at an inn or campsite. The latter will be your only option for resting in the wilderness, provided there is a nearby campsite to begin with. If not, you'll be forced to go ahead and deal with the reduced health as best as possible.</em></p>
<p><em>The other major strength of Dragon's Dogma 2 lies, once again like its predecessor, with the combat system. First and foremost, it feels great and extremely fun to play, thanks to a praise-worthy combination of animation, sound, and spell effects. The abilities of each Vocation also provide an excellent sense of class identity, allowing for many different playstyles."</em></p>

In the best kind of surprise, Nintendo announced this brand-new mainline Zelda game during the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-june-2024-everything-announced">June 2024 Nintendo Direct</a>. Better yet, it’s coming soon. And it stars Princess Zelda. And it features a unique and clever gameplay hook. Preorders are currently rolling out at the usual retailers. Read on for the details.</p><h2>Preorder The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</h2><div id="202464" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/eBJr1" target="_blank">Get it at Best Buy</a> - $59.99</li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/KJwpB" target="_blank">See it at GameStop</a> - $59.99</li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/Od6nB" target="_blank">Get it at Nintendo eShop (digital)</a> - $59.99</li></ul><p>There are no special editions of the game, so the standard one is the one to get. And if you're waiting on it to go up for preorder at Amazon, you may be waiting a while. Recent Switch games have only become available at launch – not for preorder.</p><h2>What Is The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom?</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Echoes of Wisdom is the first mainline Zelda game to star Princess Zelda, which is pretty cool. Fans have been asking for that literally for decades, so it’s nice to see Nintendo finally listen. It also uses the same almost claymation-looking art style as the remake of Link’s Awakening. It looks great.</p><p>As the game kicks off, purple rifts start opening in Hyrule and swallowing people up. Link gets sucked in, but Zelda escapes. So it’s up to her to save the kingdom (because apparently her military can’t do it for her while she runs the realm? I don’t really understand how the details hash out).</p><p>The standout gameplay feature is the use of echoes. Zelda has something called a Tri wand, which lets her summon items and enemies she’s encountered previously. She can use these summoned echoes to fend off other enemies and to solve puzzles and to access previously out-of-reach areas. It looks like it will require players to be creative, which was also a big part of Tears of the Kingdom. It’s cool to see that kind of creative puzzle solving come to a 2D-style Zelda game.</p><h2>Nintendo Switch Lite Hyrule Edition</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/25/where-to-preorder-nintendo-switch-hyrule-edition-uk-1719318569585.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>In addition to the new Zelda game, Nintendo is releasing a stylish new edition of the portable-only Nintendo Switch Lite console. <strong>It's not available to preorder yet in the US, </strong><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-lite-hyrule-edition-where-to-preorder-uk"><strong>though it is in the UK</strong></a><strong> (and it ships to the US)</strong>. The casing is gold, with black buttons and sticks. It has a tiny Triforce symbol under the right stick. The back of the device sports a big version of the winged Triforce Zelda symbol thingy. It looks great.</p><p>It also comes with a free 12-month individual subscription to Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack. That lets you play a whole bunch of classic games from Game Boy, NES, Sega Genesis, SNES, Nintendo 64, and Game Boy Advance. You also get free access to massive expansions to games like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Animal Crossing, and Splatoon 2.</p><h2>Other Preorder Guides</h2><div><ul><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ace-attorney-investigations-collection-is-up-for-preorder-out-september-6">Ace Attorney Investigations Collection Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-physical-edition-of-alan-wake-2-is-officially-up-for-preorder-out-october-22">Alan Wake 2 (Physical) Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadow-release-date-collectors-edition">Assassin's Creed Shadows Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Astro Bot Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-release-date-editions">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/college-football-25-release-date-editions">College Football 25 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-ps5-pc-release-date-preorder-bonus">Concord Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-is-up-for-preorder">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-release-date-preorder-bonus">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-luigi-brothership-switch-release-date-preorder">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-release-date-preorder">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/luigis-mansion-2-hd-preorder">Luigi's Mansion 2 HD Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/madden-nfl-25-release-date-special-editions">Madden NFL 25 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-vs-capcom-fighting-collection-arcade-classics-is-up-for-preorder">Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/master-detective-archives-rain-code-plus-is-up-for-preorder">Master Detective Archives: Rain Code Plus Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Metal Gear Solid Delta Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metaphor-refantazio-release-date-collectors-edition">Metaphor: ReFantazio Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-world-championships-nes-edition-release-date-deluxe-edition">Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-shadow-generations-preorder-guide">Sonic X Shadow Generations Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-release-date-special-editions">Star Wars Outlaws Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-party-jamboree-release-date-preorder">Super Mario Party Jamboree Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li></ul></div><p><em>Chris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN.

And that’s just the console entries — there were even more on Nintendo’s handhelds throughout the years.</p><p>Jamboree is the third Mario Party game on the Switch, and it’s the biggest one yet. Announced during the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-june-2024-everything-announced">June 2024 Nintendo Direct</a>, it takes place on an island resort. It has seven boards, including new ones like a racetrack-themed one called Roll ‘em Raceway and a shopping mall one called Rainbow Galleria. It also has a few favorite boards from previous games. With over 110 minigames, it’s the biggest Mario Party game yet. It has a number of play modes, including a 20-player online Koopathlon, which has you duke it out for a high score against more players than ever before in the series.</p><h2>Other Preorder Guides</h2><div><ul><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ace-attorney-investigations-collection-is-up-for-preorder-out-september-6">Ace Attorney Investigations Collection Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-physical-edition-of-alan-wake-2-is-officially-up-for-preorder-out-october-22">Alan Wake 2 (Physical) Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadow-release-date-collectors-edition">Assassin's Creed Shadows Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Astro Bot Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-release-date-editions">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/college-football-25-release-date-editions">College Football 25 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-ps5-pc-release-date-preorder-bonus">Concord Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-is-up-for-preorder">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-release-date-preorder-bonus">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-luigi-brothership-switch-release-date-preorder">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-release-date-preorder">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/luigis-mansion-2-hd-preorder">Luigi's Mansion 2 HD Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/madden-nfl-25-release-date-special-editions">Madden NFL 25 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-vs-capcom-fighting-collection-arcade-classics-is-up-for-preorder">Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/master-detective-archives-rain-code-plus-is-up-for-preorder">Master Detective Archives: Rain Code Plus Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Metal Gear Solid Delta Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metaphor-refantazio-release-date-collectors-edition">Metaphor: ReFantazio Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-world-championships-nes-edition-release-date-deluxe-edition">Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-shadow-generations-preorder-guide">Sonic X Shadow Generations Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-release-date-special-editions">Star Wars Outlaws Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-party-jamboree-release-date-preorder">Super Mario Party Jamboree Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li></ul></div><p><em>Chris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN.

Read on for full details about what to expect.</p><h2>Preorder Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</h2><div id="202465" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/KJwnD" target="_blank">Get it at Best Buy</a> - $59.99</li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/jo322" target="_blank">Get it at GameStop</a> - $59.99</li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/xPolb" target="_blank">Get it at Nintendo eShop (digital)</a> - $59.99</li></ul><p>There aren't any special editions of the game, so this is the one to get. And if you're waiting for it to appear on Amazon, I have some bad news for you: Nintendo Switch games haven't been going up for preorder on Amazon for a while. They usually appear on the site the day they release. I don't know what's up with that, but that's what it is.</p><h2>What is Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership?</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Historically, the Mario &amp; Luigi games have been available exclusively on Nintendo’s handheld platforms, starting with Superstar Saga on Game Boy Advance. But now that the Switch covers both handheld and TV play, it makes sense that the newest entry would come there — there’s nowhere else for it to go, after all.</p><p>Brothership, announced at the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-june-2024-everything-announced">June Nintendo Direct</a>, is a turn-based RPG that finds Mario and Luigi sailing the seas in a world called Concordia. You’ll explore new lands with a variety of environments, like a rainforest and a populated city. But like its predecessors, the turn-based combat requires lots of real-time inputs. You can also have the dynamic duo team up during combat to pull off Bros. Attacks, and to overcome obstacles in the over-world using Bros Moves. It looks like a lot of fun.</p><h2>Other Preorder Guides</h2><div><ul><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ace-attorney-investigations-collection-is-up-for-preorder-out-september-6">Ace Attorney Investigations Collection Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-physical-edition-of-alan-wake-2-is-officially-up-for-preorder-out-october-22">Alan Wake 2 (Physical) Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadow-release-date-collectors-edition">Assassin's Creed Shadows Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Astro Bot Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-release-date-editions">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/college-football-25-release-date-editions">College Football 25 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-ps5-pc-release-date-preorder-bonus">Concord Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-is-up-for-preorder">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-release-date-preorder-bonus">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-luigi-brothership-switch-release-date-preorder">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-release-date-preorder">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/luigis-mansion-2-hd-preorder">Luigi's Mansion 2 HD Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/madden-nfl-25-release-date-special-editions">Madden NFL 25 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-vs-capcom-fighting-collection-arcade-classics-is-up-for-preorder">Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/master-detective-archives-rain-code-plus-is-up-for-preorder">Master Detective Archives: Rain Code Plus Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Metal Gear Solid Delta Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metaphor-refantazio-release-date-collectors-edition">Metaphor: ReFantazio Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-world-championships-nes-edition-release-date-deluxe-edition">Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-shadow-generations-preorder-guide">Sonic X Shadow Generations Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-release-date-special-editions">Star Wars Outlaws Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-party-jamboree-release-date-preorder">Super Mario Party Jamboree Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li></ul></div><p><em>Chris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN.

                <p dir="ltr">Donkey Kong Country Returns is, er, returning once again with a new, refreshed HD port on the Nintendo Switch. Donkey Kong Country Returns originally released on Wii in 2010 and was then ported to Nintendo 3DS in 2013. Now, over a decade later, DK and Diddy are swinging back into action with remastered graphics and everything offered in both previous versions of the side-scrolling platformer. <strong><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1846242598777135010%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fdonkey-kong-country-returns-hd-preorder-nintendo-switch%2F1100-6524388%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD is available to preorder now</a></strong> ahead of its January 16, 2025 release date.</p><p dir="ltr">Essentially presented as the "definitive" edition of the wonderful platformer, Donkey Kong Country Returns HD will offer the original challenge of the Wii version while also giving players the option to play with the friendlier 3DS settings. It also contains all of the extra levels from the 3DS version. Players can take on the 80-level, nine-world gauntlet as Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong in either solo or two-player co-op modes.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD Preorder Bonuses</h2><p dir="ltr">Nintendo rarely offers preorder bonus for its first-party titles, and Donkey Kong Country Returns HD is no different. However, if something is announced, we'll be sure to update.</p><p>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD is a great opportunity for fans to revisit the 2D platformer with sharper visuals and new controls, or for newcomers to try out for the first time. However, don't skip out on Donkey Kong Country Returns: Tropical Freeze HD either. Both games rank among the best 2D platformers ever made, and Tropical Freeze HD is a great way to pass the time while waiting for the new release.

Nothing has been announced on that front just yet, but we'll update this preorder guide if and when we hear more.</p><p>Super Mario Party Jamboree looks to be a nice step forward for the iconic series, offering more mini-games, five new maps, and a handful of returning maps from previous entries. Along with the traditional Mario Party experience of racing around a board and battling against friends, you can now jump online to challenge 19 other players in the new Koopathlon mode.</p><p>It sounds like there are even more new modes players will get to explore--but Nintendo is keeping them under wraps. Expect to hear more about Super Mario Party Jamboree as we get closer to its release on October 17.</p><p>Plenty of other games were highlighted during the latest Nintendo Direct, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-preorder-nintendo-switch/1100-6524359/" data-ref-id="1100-6524359">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-and-luigi-brothership-preorder-nintendo-switch/1100-6524356/" data-ref-id="1100-6524356">Mario &amp; Luigi Brothership</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-comes-to-nintendo-switch-in-january/1100-6517717/" data-ref-id="1100-6517717">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</a>.

Brothership marks not only return of the Mario Bros. role-playing series, it's also the first entry in the series for a home console--though you could play it entirely on a portable device, of course.</p><h2>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership Preorder Bonuses</h2><p>No preorder bonuses have been announced for Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership, though that could change in the coming weeks and months. Nintendo games rarely have official bonuses, but major retailers often offer exclusive collectibles while supplies last.</p><p>Aside from two 3DS remakes, the last entirely new entry in the Mario &amp; Luigi series, Paper Jam, arrived in 2015. That means fans have waited nearly 10 years for more turn-based, platforming action--and Brothership's reveal trailer makes it clear that Nintendo is embracing the legacy of the Mario &amp; Luigi RPG series. It has cool graphics that retain the aesthetic and perspective of previous entries, a turn-based combat system with Action Commands (timing-based maneuvers) and new Bros. Attacks, and an emphasis on platforming and puzzles outside of battles.</p><p>We also met a few new characters, including the Extension Corps, Snoutlet, and Connie. Of course, Bowser also makes an appearance, though aside from guiding Mario and Luigi across a series of unique islands, it's unclear how the story will unravel. Expect to learn more as we close in on its November release date.</p><p>If you haven't played Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door and Super Mario RPG yet, these recently released Switch games will give you a pretty good idea of the combat system in traditional RPGs set in the Mushroom Kingdom.

Link is one of the many Hyrulians who find themselves pulled into a mysterious rift, which means it's Princess Zelda's turn to save the day.

Other Zelda games on Switch came bundled with little trinkets at select retailer. We'll update our Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom preorder guide if bonuses become available at major retailers.</p><p>To coincide with the game's release, Nintendo is launching a Hyrule Edition Nintendo Switch Lite. It features a golden color scheme with black accents, along with a Hylian Crest on the back. It's a good-looking gadget, but if you want to get your hands on it before it sells out, consider reserving a unit as soon as you can.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4320715-switchlite.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4320715" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4320715-switchlite.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4320715"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4320715-switchlite.jpeg"></figure><p>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is a throwback to pre-Breath of the Wild Zelda that retains the colorful visuals of Link's Awakening. Unlike Link, Zelda doesn't wield a trusty sword; she uses a newly acquired power called Echoe, which lets her create items that help you traverse Hyrule, overcome enemies, and solve puzzles. Echoes allow you to replicate NPCs who will then fight on your behalf or help you solve puzzles.</p><p>Based on the reveal trailer, the new mechanics could add a lot of variance to each playthrough. Nintendo even stated players will have different experiences based on how they approach using Echoes. In this way, Echoes of Wisdom is similar to Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, especially the latter, which implemented a robust building tool called Ultrahand that encouraged players to experiment to solve puzzles, explore the world, and defeat enemies. Though Echoes of Wisdom, as a top-down Zelda game, clearly won't be as dynamic, it's cool to see the melding of classic Zelda with the modern approach to the franchise. And it's even cooler to see Zelda step into the leading role for the first time. Well, for the first time on a Nintendo platform at least. Zelda's Adventure for Philips CD-i does indeed exist.</p><p>If you're not all caught up on the major The Legend of Zelda games on Switch, you can save on the other four mainline games that have received physical editions at Walmart right now. Link's Awakening would be a good one to play before Echoes of Wisdom since it shares the same foundation.</p><ul><li><a

However, as spotted by <a href="https://xboxera.com/2024/06/26/steamworld-heist-ii-no-longer-coming-to-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>XboxEra</u></a>, social media posts mentioning a Game Pass release have since been deleted, and trailers that included the Xbox service’s branding have seemingly been modified and reuploaded without the logo. Its inclusion can still be seen in re-uploads from third-party accounts like YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0196lrXfm6g" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GN Game Trailers</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>A representative with Fortyseven PR confirmed with XboxEra that SteamWorld Heist 2 is no longer coming to Game Pass, adding that the Xbox service's logo was mistakenly added. Thunderful and Fortyseven did not reveal how the Game Pass logo managed to worm its way into an official trailer, but in <a href="https://x.com/ethangach/status/1806050824629416183" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a statement sent to Kotaku's Ethan Gach</a>, a spokesperson further clarified that distribution plans for SteamWorld Heist 2 are still being ironed out.</p><p>"We inadvertently included a Game Pass logo in our reveal trailer," the statement says. "We have not finalized our distribution plans for SteamWorld Heist 2 at this time. We'll share news about our distribution plans closer to launch."</p><p>SteamWorld Heist 2 is still planned to launch for all other previously announced console and PC platforms. The sequel follows Captain Leeway and their struggle against a new menace that threatens the Great Sea. Spicing up the turn-based combat this time around is real-time naval combat, more crew customization, more story, and more steampunk weapons.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Steamworld Heist 2 - Announcement Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Although it's looking like SteamWorld Heist 2 won’t sneak its way into Game Pass when it launches this August, the service does currently offer other SteamWorld games to enjoy. Included in the PC and console tiers today are SteamWorld Dig 2 and SteamWorld Build. Console players also have access to the original SteamWorld Dig.
