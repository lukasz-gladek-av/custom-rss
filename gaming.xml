            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/civilization-7-vr-spring-meta-quest<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Firaxis and Meta have announced that&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>is coming to VR, with a version of the upcoming 4X grand strategy game heading to Meta Quest 3 and 3S devices in spring.</p>

<p>The game is available to wishlist in VR form right now, and it marks the first time the&nbsp;<em>Civilization&nbsp;</em>series has been available in VR. Naturally, the VR version of the game will feature a redesigned interface, too.</p>

<p><em>Civilization 7 - VR&nbsp;</em>revolves around something the developers are calling the Command Table, which is a sort of zoomed-out view of the action that makes everything look as though you're playing it as a tabletop game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/civilization-7-vr-command-table.jpg?itok=v9zRev6f 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/civilization-7-vr-command-table.jpg?itok=0XJKTp4q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>will look a little different in VR.</figcaption></figure><p>World leaders will stand around the Command Table, reacting when you make decisions like forging alliances with them or declaring war on their nations.</p>

<p>You'll also be able to "bring the Command Table into your surroundings with dynamic mixed reality", according to Meta, so it sounds like you'll be able to superimpose&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>into the real world if you so desire.</p>

<p>The VR version of the game will support solo play and multiplayer for you and up to three others, although they will need to be playing the Meta Quest version of the game; you won't be able to play this one with regular&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>players, unfortunately.</p>

<p>You can check out the announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7 - VR&nbsp;</em>right here. It's set for a spring 2025 release, although no more specific release date has been revealed yet.</p>




<p>Elsewhere in&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>news, the non-VR version of the game launched into its advanced access period last week and immediately <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/civilization-7-early-access-mixed-reviews-50k-players" rel="nofollow">met with criticism from players</a>, who highlighted its user interface and a perceived paucity of game features as particular sticking points.</p>

<p>Following those criticisms, Firaxis <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/civilization-7-ui-problems-fixes-coming" rel="nofollow">promised to fix players' problems</a> with&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7</em>, highlighting three areas to address (namely UI, community-requested features, and polish) without committing to specific timings.</p>

<p><em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>is due out on February 11th for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1295660/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_VII/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/sid-meier-s-civilization-vii/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-for-xbox-series-xs/9N23HJHSC6BL" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>. The VR version arrives in spring for <a href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-vr/5781689118524197/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Meta Quest 3 and 3S</a>.</p>

<p>Disney Plus users have spotted a dedicated section for Marvel Rivals on the streaming platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://x.com/CultureCrave/status/1888862600244699555" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Culture Crave</a> (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/marvel-rivals-own-disney-plus-section/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGamer</a>), the new category on Disney Plus has been titled “Featuring Characters from Marvel Rivals”. It includes three movies: Captain America: Civil War, Thor: Ragnarok, and Doctor Strange: The Multiverse of Madness.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These three Disney movies feature a massive chunk of the Marvel Rivals roster but not all the heroes and villains. Civil War features characters like Captain America, Spider-Man, Iron Man, Black Panther, and Black Widow. Ragnarok features Thor, Loki, Hulk, and Hela. Lastly, the Multiverse of Madness has other characters from the roster, including Doctor Strange, Scarlet Witch, and Mr. Fantastic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Marvel Rivals promotion on <span>the</span> streaming platform might help the game gain more traction; however, it has been doing pretty well since its release. The hero-shooter quickly became popular with its big roster, familiar faces, and exciting gameplay. It managed to soar on the Steam charts and has retained its position as one of the platform’s <a href="https://steamdb.info/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">top 10 most-played games</a>, according to SteamDB.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Players might soon see categories like “Movies and TV shows based on Marvel Rivals game” on Disney Plus. We already know that a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-comic-book-april-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">comic book</a> is in the works, and there’s a chance we could get other adaptations, too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Ninja thinks Marvel Rivals <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-dead-ninja-marvel-rivals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has killed Overwatch</a>. Also, the developers <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-fake-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">allegedly hide fake heroes</a> in the files to catch leakers. What are your thoughts on Disney Plus having a section for Marvel Rivals?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or on our new&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

			<p>Grand Theft Auto VI skipping PC at launch could result in over 40% sales, according to Take-Two's CEO Strauss Zelnick.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-unconcerned-by-plummeting-ps5-and-xbox-sales-insists-gta-6-will-cause-a-meaningful-uptick-in-console-sales-in-2025">IGN</a> ahead of the publisher's <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-still-scheduled-to-release-this-fall-take-two-full-expects-to-support-the-nintendo-switch-2/">recent financial results</a> about the game skipping PC at launch, Zelnick essentially said that the highly-anticipated game will unsurprisingly eventually release on PC, highlighting that, historically, Rockstar has started with some platforms before moving on to others, so even a game as anticipated as the next entry in the popular series is not going to break this trend.</p>
<p>Still, PC sales make up a large amount of total sales for almost every multiplatform game, and it won't be any different for Grand Theft Auto VI, as, according to the Take-Two CEO, the PC version of any multiplatform game can generate over 40% of overall sales. On the other hand, launching on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S only is likely to drive console sales out of the current slump, as Zelnick believes this is what is going to happen this year with the release not only of GTA VI but of other games as well, even in the United States despite tariffs not making things any easier.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto VI is launching this Fall on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S worldwide. However, the game's ambitious scope could cause a delay, which wouldn't be the first for Rockstar Games.</p>

Two owners of Nvidia’s new RTX 5090 Founders Edition GPUs have reported melted power connectors and damage to their PSUs. The images look identical to reports of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/25/23422349/nvidia-rtx-4090-power-cables-connectors-melting-burning">RTX 4090 power cables burning</a> or melting from two years ago. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/18/23466974/nvidia-rtx-4090-power-cable-12vhpwr-melt-burn-plugged-in">Nvidia blamed</a> the issue on people not properly plugging the 12VHPWR power connection in fully and the PCI standards body <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/1/23488276/nvidia-12vhpwr-cable-16-pin-pci-sig-response">blamed Nvidia</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/1ilhfk0/rtx_5090fe_molten_12vhpwr/">A Reddit poster</a> upgraded from an RTX 4090 to an RTX 5090 and noticed “a burning smell playing <em>Battlefield 5</em>,” before turning off their PC and finding the damage. The images show burnt plastic at both the PSU end of the power connector and the part that connects directly to the GPU. The cable is one from <a href="https://www.moddiy.com/products/ATX-3.0-PCIe-5.0-600W-12VHPWR-16-Pin-to-16-Pin-PCIE-Gen-5-Power-Cable.html">MODDIY</a>, a popular manufacturer of custom cables, and the poster claims it was “securely fastened and clicked on both sides (GPU and PSU).”</p><p>While it’s tempting to blame the MODDIY cable, Spanish <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw7HaVRUN9k">YouTuber Toro Tocho</a> has experienced the same burnt cable (both at the GPU and PSU ends) with an RTX 5090 Founders Edition while using a cable supplied by PSU manufacturer FSP. Plastic has also melted into the PCIe 5.0 power connector on the power supply.</p><p>Nvidia originally introduced the 12VHPWR power connector on its RTX 40-series GPUs, and power supplies also debuted to support the new standard. The RTX 4090 Founders Edition was able to draw 450 watts over the 12VHPWR connector, while the new RTX 5090 draws up to 575 watts over a cable that’s rated up to 600 watts. After early issues with RTX 4090 connectors melting, PCI-SIG, the standards organization responsible for the 12VHPWR connector, has now updated it to a new 12V-2x6 connector on the GPU side and in some cases the PSU side, too.</p><p>The 12V-2x6 connector has shorter sensing pins and longer conductor terminals, to improve reliability. “This might not sound like a huge difference, but it matters in ensuring that the power cable has been properly connected to whatever device is going to be pulling power from your system’s power supply,” <a href="https://go.corsair.com/c/482924/490888/8513?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.corsair.com%2Fuk%2Fen%2Fexplorer%2Fdiy-builder%2Fpower-supply-units%2Fevolving-standards-12vhpwr-and-12v-2x6%2F%3F" rel="sponsored">explains Corsair</a>.</p><p>Nvidia uses the 12V-2x6 connector on its RTX 50-series GPUs, but you can still use existing 12VHPWR cables. “To be clear, this is not a new cable, it is an updated change to the pins in the socket, which is referred to as 12V-2x6,” says Corsair. PSU manufacturers like Corsair and MSI have adopted colored pins on their 12VHPWR cables so that if you can still see the yellow or grey pins it means the connector isn’t seated properly.</p><p>While Intel and AMD are both members of the PCI-SIG group that helped develop the 12VHPWR power connector, only Nvidia has adopted the standard so far. Even AMD’s upcoming <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24336246/amd-radeon-rx-9070-series-rdna-4-fsr-4-ces-2025">Radeon RX 9070-series</a> are using existing 8-pin PCIe connections instead. AMD even suggested the 12VHPWR connector was a fire hazard in late 2022, when the company’s gaming marketing director Sasa Marinkovic <a href="https://x.com/SasaMarinkovic/status/1593243804538372096?">tweeted</a> “Stay safe this holiday season” alongside a picture of 8-pin connectors.</p><p>12VHPWR has been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y36LMS5y34A">branded a “dumpster fire,</a>” thanks to design oversights that make it relatively easy for end users to not properly connect the cable securely. Cablemod was also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/8/24029465/after-74500-in-damage-cablemod-is-fully-recalling-its-nvidia-12vhpwr-gpu-power-adapters">forced to recall</a> its 12VHPWR GPU power adapters last year after reports of melted adapters.</p><p>We’ve reached out to Nvidia to comment on these latest reports of RTX 5090 power connector issues, but the company did not respond in time for publication.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Because the freemium model proves by far the most successful way to release games on telephones, you pay by sitting through agonizing ads with fake countdown timers, ‘x’ buttons that don’t close anything, and faux-interactivity designed to trick you into tapping through to the store. Valve has now made it abundantly clear that anything like this on their PC store means an instant ban.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="194341" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top Ten Most Played Games On Steam Deck: March 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="219" data-playlist="194341,195805,196013" data-current="194341"><div><p>The Top Ten Most Played Games On Steam Deck: March 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194341/194341_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194341/194341_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194341/194341_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194341/194341_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/19799.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>As <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/valve-ban-advertising-based-business-models-on-steam-no-forced-adverts-like-in-mobile-games/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/valve-ban-advertising-based-business-models-on-steam-no-forced-adverts-like-in-mobile-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spotted by <em>GamingOnLinux</em></a></span>, Valve’s encyclopedic Steamworks Documentation has been updated to refuse to sell any game that relies on in-game advertising for its business model. That means no games can require players to watch ads to be able to play, nor hide any elements of a game behind a commercial. And it goes further, banning the use of viewing ads to gain in-game advantages, rewards, or time.</p><p>“Developers should not utilize paid advertising as a business model in their game,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/advertising&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/advertising" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">say Valve’s instructions</a></span>, “such as requiring players to watch or otherwise engage with advertising in order to play, or gating gameplay behind advertising. If your game’s business model relies on advertising on other platforms, you will need to remove those elements before shipping on Steam.” The company suggests switching to an up-front payment, or keeping the game “free” but keeping upgrades as paid DLC. The rules then say,</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Developers should not use advertising as a way to provide value to players, such as giving players a reward for watching or engaging with advertising in their game.</p></blockquote><p>For people who never play games on mobile, these might seem quite bizarre things to need to rule out: while video games have, for decades, included in-game ads (or even existed to <em>be </em>advertising), gatekeeping actual play behind commercials has only been a very occasional, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nba-2k-just-keeps-putting-unskippable-ads-in-a-60-vide-1845443416&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nba-2k-just-keeps-putting-unskippable-ads-in-a-60-vide-1845443416">very egregious matter</a></span>. On mobile, it’s the norm.</p><p>If you’ve played a match-3, or a merger game, or any number of mock-RTS games, you’ll be very familiar with the requirement to sit through 30 seconds of a puzzle game being played infuriatingly badly, or a flashing icon begging you to tap on an army unit, or the most extraordinarily high-quality CG animation promoting a game that plays like it was made on a VIC-20. A tiny circle counts down from 30 seconds, after which the advert doesn’t end, and then it cuts to a new screen with a new timer, replaced by an ‘x’ so tiny that if you don’t tap it with a tungsten needle it’ll take you to the store page. After all that, you’ve now got enough imaginary energy to take two more turns at the game you wish you were allowed to enjoy.</p><p>This is, however, extraordinarily profitable, and while you and I might scream into the void that we just want to pay $5 to own the game outright, the moment you put a price on an unknown mobile game it’s doomed to obscurity. And while Steam may not have been plagued by the same issues, it makes a lot of sense for Valve to make these rules clear for those hoping to just port their game and business model over to PC, wholesale.</p><p>If anything, it’s very surprising that this isn’t already a fire that needs putting out, rather than some preventative measures. The mobile market proves that are squillions of people who are content to sit through countless ads to play games, so you’d think there would have already been a bigger push to see if the same could happen with PC’s free-to-play audiences. Small mercies, I guess.</p><p>Valve makes clear companies <em>can</em> still advertise in games. Those awkward billboards and real-world brand cosmetics are still fine to include, although Steam does stipulate that these must not be “disruptive” and are “appropriate within the context of the game.”</p><p>It’s worth noting this does also block previous gross behavior we’ve seen from the biggest names, the likes of 2K, filling basketball games with unskippable ads and so on.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And, given the increasing importance of the PC for a multiplatform game’s success, is GTA 6’s no-show on PC a missed opportunity or even a mistake?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN put that question to Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick ahead of the company’s recent financial results, and in his response he teased GTA 6’s <em>eventual</em> release on PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So with Civ 7 it's available on console and PC and Switch right away,” Zelnick said of Firaxis' recently launched Civilization 7. “With regard to others in our lineup, we don't always go across all platforms simultaneously. Historically, Rockstar has started with some platforms and then historically moved to other platforms.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar fans have noted the studio's historical reluctance to release other past games on PC day-and-date with console, as well as its fraught relationship with the modding community over the years. Still, some had hoped that a game as big as GTA 6 could be a turning point for the studio's PC gaming attitude.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Big Rockstar titles tend to get to PC eventually, but the question of how long PC gamers will have to wait for what could end up being one of the biggest games ever remains. Given GTA 6’s fall 2025 release window, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-still-set-for-fall-2025-take-two-ceo-insists-we-feel-really-good-about-it">which Take-Two is still confident in</a>, it seems likely PC players won’t get to play the game until 2026 at the earliest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In December 2023, a former developer at Rockstar <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ex-rockstar-dev-tries-to-explain-why-gta-6-is-coming-to-pc-after-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-and-s"><u>attempted to explain why GTA 6 is coming to PC after it hits PS5 and Xbox Series X and S</u></a>, and called on PC gamers to give the studio the “benefit of the doubt” over its controversial launch plans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But how big of a missed opportunity could skipping PC for GTA 6’s launch be? Zelnick told IGN that the PC version of a multiplatform game can generate 40% of overall sales, or even more with certain games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That stat came as part of a discussion about the current console generation, which has seen sales of the PS5 and Xbox Series X and S — the two consoles GTA 6 launches on later this year — plummet. While Nintendo has the Switch 2 waiting in the wings, neither Sony nor Microsoft have announced their next-gen consoles. How long before the industry needs the PlayStation 6 and whatever Xbox is next?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zelnick pointed to the PC platform as growing in importance, even as console sales fall, while publishers wait for Sony and Microsoft’s next moves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have seen PC become a much more and more important part of what used to be a console business, and I wouldn't be surprised to see that trend continue,” he said. “Of course, there will be a new console generation.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In any case, according to Zelnick, the release of GTA 6, which is expected to be the biggest entertainment launch of all time, will drive console sales as fans jump into the current generation for the first time in order to play the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“When you have a big title in the market and we have many of them coming, historically that has sold consoles,” Zelnick said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And I think that will happen this year. I don't think tariffs are going to be our friend, but I think there will be a meaningful uptick in console sales in calendar 25 because of the release schedule, not just coming from us, but coming from others. So I'm not concerned about that [console sales falling]. I think the trend that you'd want to focus on is this increasing share of the market that is reflected in PC.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, many see the PlayStation 5 Pro as a future 'GTA 6 machine,' in the hopes it will be the best platform to play the game when it comes out. However, tech experts believe <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/will-ps5-pro-run-gta-6-at-4k60-probably-not-say-the-experts">the PS5 Pro probably won't run GTA 6 at 4K60</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/10/jotunnslayer-hordes-of-hel-early-access-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Vampire Survivors has become a genuine cultural phenomenon by this point and continues to add to this legacy with extra characters, tie-ins and more content for startlingly low prices. Perhaps more obvious than this, though, is the legion of clones and impersonators it has spawned in the emerging ‘bullet heaven’ genre. For those who follow new releases on Steam in particular it seems like a new one is announced and/or released every couple of days. The genre as a whole is in real risk of oversaturation and most examples disappear without much fanfare. Occasionally a new one brings something to the table, such as the fun Karate Survivor and the Diablo-like Halls of Torment. Jotunnslayer: Hordes of Hel stays relatively faithful to the established bullet heaven formula, but adds a level of graphical polish that stands out.</p>
<p><iframe title="Jotunnslayer: Hordes of Hel | Early Access Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cF16KwbeXuQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In its Early Access form, there isn’t a vast amount of content in Jotunnslayer just, so it’s a little early to judge how satisfying the full game will be. In fact, I’d probably go so far as to say that you are paying for an extended demo with the promise of a fully fleshed out experience – something that is becoming a familiar story with Early Access titles. There are two maps and four characters, with four gods that offer boons in a style similar to Hades. The devs have a clear roadmap laid out for the full release which will increase the number of characters, skills, maps, and gods.</p>



<p>At the start of the game you have a choice of either melee Berserker or the midrange magic user Seeress, with Revenant (archer) and Flame Sister (magic user) unlocked as you progress. Each class has their own set of skills and unique level-ups to choose from, whilst all can benefit from the different Divine boons. At present Thor, Freya, Loki, and Odin are available and they each offer active skills and passive power-ups. Thor is all about strength and thunder spells, whilst Loki offers poison attacks and the potential for more pickups. As you might expect, these are randomly offered with every playthrough being different. There is clear potential for some powerful builds here and the fusion of Hades and Vampire Survivors is a fantastic idea.</p>

<p>Rather than room navigation of Hades, however, you fight on static maps which are far more contained than the sprawling levels in Vampire Survivors. Each run has more of an actual point than many Bullet Heaven games, with a randomised selection of miniquests to complete in order to unlock the run boss. The bosses are massive and intimidating foes that will challenge your builds and use of skills to the max. Initial runs on Easy take only 10 minutes, with the increasing difficulty levels also increasing the duration. As always, level ups and skills are restricted to the specific playthrough but you can upgrade your characters and Gods in the skill tree between runs to receive permanent improvements.</p>

<p>Jotunnslayer is perhaps the best looking Bullet Heaven game I’ve played and the core game is just as addictive and enjoyable as the genre’s best. What is needed, however is more content as the progression just isn’t rewarding enough to keep you playing right now, and the jump in difficulty requires a fair amount of grinding. I will definitely return to the game as more is added, but don’t feel compelled to complete everything that is here just yet. A very promising start and one to keep an eye on for the full release.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/valve-reveals-advertising-rules-for-steam-games/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Valve has a new dedicated page that explains what types of advertisements are supported and not supported on Steam.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Steam has always had these advertising rules. However, recently, a <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/advertising" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">new page</a> spotted by <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/valve-ban-advertising-based-business-models-on-steam-no-forced-adverts-like-in-mobile-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gaming on Linux</a> has appeared to explain these rules and clarify that the platform doesn’t contain paid advertising or models. The page also explains what constitutes “advertising” in a game, what types of ads developers can implement, and what advertisements shouldn’t be in the game.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-what-types-of-ads-are-allowed-on-steam">What types of ads are allowed on Steam?</h2>



<p>Steam allows ads with product placement, which includes “real brands, products, personalities, etc., as part of gameplay.” This advertising is accepted when it does not disrupt anything and matches the context of the game—for example, sponsor logos in sports games like football, Formula 1, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cross-promotions are also allowed, such as promoting bundles, sale events, and more. Players can also include other Steam products or products/brands outside of Steam; however, it’s not allowed “to charge other developers to participate in a bundle or to sell access to a sale page or other page on Steam.” Lastly, developers can also run paid advertising campaigns to increase traffic to their Steam product pages.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-what-types-of-ads-are-not-allowed-on-steam">What types of ads are not allowed on Steam?</h2>



<p>Coming to the ads that will lead to your game being banned on Steam. Devs are not allowed to “utilize paid advertising as a business model in their game,” meaning you can’t entice players into watching ads to play or gate gameplay behind it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If the game’s business model depends on advertising, the developers must remove those elements before releasing it on Steam. They can also create a single-purchase “paid app” or use microtransactions and DLCs by making the game free to play.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, the wrong use of advertising, such as creating value for the player, will not be allowed. This means developers can’t put rewards or unique content behind ads on Steam games. Lastly, developers cannot “charge other developers for access to Steam features. These include sale pages, bundles, store pages, franchise pages, etc.”</p>



<p>In other news, Steam now warns players <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/steam-warning-buying-abandoned-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">before they purchase an “abandoned” game</a>. Also, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wreckfest-2-early-access-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wreckfest 2 is arriving</a> on the platform on March 20. What are your thoughts on Valve’s advertising rules for Steam games? Let us know in the comments or on our new&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

            <p>The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has launched an investigation into Roblox.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-07/sec-confirms-game-service-roblox-part-of-active-investigation">Bloomberg</a>, while the investigation is ongoing, the exact focus of the SEC's probing remains unclear. The commission did however acknowledge the investigation was active, and said it could not currently share full details to ensure there was "no harm to the ongoing enforcement proceeding".</p>
<p>The SEC was established after the 1929 Wall Street crash in a bid to protect American citizens from market manipulation. It requires public companies to submit quarterly and annual reports, as well as investigate possible violations of the securities laws.</p>

<p>"We have confirmed with Division of Enforcement staff that there are responsive emails between Enforcement staff referencing Roblox and that these emails are a part of an active and ongoing investigation," an SEC spokesperson told Bloomberg, via a Freedom of Information request: </p>
<p>Bloomberg suggests - though it is not confirmed - that the investigation may pertain to November's report that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/damning-roblox-report-claims-company-inflates-player-numbers-to-investors-by-as-much-as-42">Roblox misled investors by falsely reporting player numbers, and has highlighted yet more examples of inappropriate - and allegedly, illegal - content being shared via the platform</a>.</p>
<p>In response to November's report, Roblox said at the time that it "rejects" its findings and pointed to previously-released details of its efforts to try and combat inappropriate content. It also stressed that it had previously acknowledged that "fraud and unauthorised access to [its] platform may contribute, from time to time, to an overstatement of DAUs".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-shares-drop-by-20-as-platform-misses-target-active-users">Roblox shares dropped by 20 percent last week</a> after the platform's reported daily active users fell short of analysts' estimates.</p>
<p>For the fourth quarter (ending 31st December), the number of daily active users fell by four percent to 85.3 million compared to the previous quarter. Wall Street analysts had forecasted 88.4 million. Overall player engagement also declined by 9.7 percent in the same period to 18.7bn hours.</p>

            <p>Cheery mom-and-pop computer game business Valve have created a new Steamworks page for their policy about in-game adverts and advertising in general, with a troubleshooter's list of dos and don'ts for developers.</p>
<p>As Graham pointed out to me just now, Valve's handling of such things hasn't really changed over the past few years, but I can't pass up the opportunity to chew the fat a little about the intriguingly murky, slippery-slope business of turning your virtual world into an ad platform. Also, I had already written this article by the time he pointed that out to me, and I can't bear to send all my precious words to the abyss.</p><!--more-->
<p>Briefly, Valve say it's fine to feature ads inside games if it's "appropriate within the context of the game". Not fine: the use of paid advertising as a business model, as with ports of mobile games that make you watch an advert to unlock stuff, or that dole out rewards for willingly filling your eyes with footage of, say, crypto investors pitching a new wellness diet. If your game makes use of such strategies on other platforms, explain Valve, you will need to strip them out before selling them on Steam. They suggest switching to a single-purchase model or free-to-play with microtransactions instead.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/advertising">Steamworks Documentation post</a> in question - spotted by <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/valve-ban-advertising-based-business-models-on-steam-no-forced-adverts-like-in-mobile-games/">GamingOnLinux</a> - is quite cut-and-dried on the surface, but ambiguity predictably sneaks in as you start to thrash out the use-case scenarios for a store that gets thousands of new releases a year. Here's what it says about in-game ads being fine as long as they fit the context.</p>
<blockquote><p>"Games may contain real brands, products, personalities, etc as part of gameplay, provided such portrayals are not disruptive and are appropriate within the context of the game. For example, a racing game might feature real life sponsor logos on its race cars, or a skateboard game might include characters wearing real-world brands. Note that all developers must obtain the relevant permission and/or licenses for any copyrighted content contained in their games."</p></blockquote>
<p>There's an interesting tradition of product placement within games, ranging from signboards for pirate sim <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overboard">Overboard</a>! in the otherwise galleon-deficient G-Police, to <a href="https://www.wired.com/2008/10/obama-campaign/">Obama campaign ads in Burnout Paradise</a>. You can definitely make the case for ads forming a believable aspect of the setting, but even when it's credible, I can't help but ponder what might have been sacrificed in order to meet the client spec. Publishers have, unsurprisingly, expressed qualified approval for the idea. Last year, EA's Andrew Wilson <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-are-thinking-about-inserting-adverts-into-games-but-dont-worry-itll-be-very-thoughtful">promised</a> that any such future measures undertaken by the Battlefield publisher would be "very thoughtful".</p><p>Among the more egregious examples of noxious in-game advertising is the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake">Alan Wake</a>, would you believe. Alan might sporadically style himself an arthouse novelist, but he's not above <a href="https://kotaku.com/alan-wake-remastered-is-ditching-the-energizer-batterie-1847658945">flying the flag for Verizon and Energizer</a>. Examples of doing it right include the recent reality TV sim <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crush-house">The Crush House</a>, in which you play both the producer and target audience of adverts for other Devolver games.</p>
<p>The Steamworks page adds that "cross-promotional activities on Steam, such as bundles, sale events, and more" are OK-dokey as well. Under what's not allowed, meanwhile, we find the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Developers should not utilize paid advertising as a business model in their game, such as requiring players to watch or otherwise engage with advertising in order to play, or gating gameplay behind advertising. If your game's business model relies on advertising on other platforms, you will need to remove those elements before shipping on Steam. Some options you could consider include switching to a single purchase "paid app," or making your game free to play with optional upgrades sold via Microtransactions or Downloadable Content (DLC)."</p></blockquote>
<p>While mandatory ad-watching tends to be associated with mobile, console and PC publishers have tried it too. 2K <a href="https://stevivor.com/news/nba-2k21-inserts-unskippable-ads-pre-game-loading-screens/">once added unskippable ads to NBA 2K21</a>, for instance, rolling them back after an outcry.</p>
<p>The post further comments that devs "should not use advertising as a way to provide value to players, such as giving players a reward for watching or engaging with advertising in their game".</p>
<p>With my shitpost hat firmly jammed down around my devil's advocate horns, I feel that weaving an advert into a setting that absolutely doesn't support adverts would be a thrilling designer's challenge. "Perhaps it deserves a gamejam", I impishly say aloud to myself, smiling at the torch-waving hordes of Steam users outside my window. Here's some homework for the comments: how would you advertise, say, Papa Johns in The Lord Of The Rings? It shouldn't be that tricky, really, given that the Orcs are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dY4V3UUY95A">already familiar with the concept of menus</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Sega and Like a Dragon developer Ryu ga Gotoku are asking fans to select from 100 merchandise ideas from the series to be made a reality, including a karaoke microphone, themed underwear, and a traffic cone.</p>
<p>It's all in celebration of Like a Dragon's 20th anniversary on 8th December 2025, with fans able to vote once per day on a <a href="https://20th-fangoods.ryu-ga-gotoku.com/">special celebration website</a> for the virtual item they want to see actually produced .</p>
<p>There are 100 items to choose from, taken from across the game series, ranging from the obvious, to the iconic, to the downright bizarre.</p>

<p>Themed cosmetics, pens, stamps, incense, and various items of apparel would be easy to reproduce, but I'd argue are fairly boring choices for a series known for its outlandish characters and side quests.</p>
<p>Better yet are karaoke instruments (from the memorable minigame), a Sujimon card set (from that other minigame), Ichiban Confectionery's rice crackers (yes, from a minigame), or a Michio Ono figure (you guessed it...).</p>
<p>No doubt the Majima body pillow will be a popular choice, as will character lingerie, and various themed underpants.</p>
<p>A Like a Dragon board game is intriguing, presuming it's fully playable, as would a Ryu ga Gotoku recipe book considering all the delicious in-game food throughout the series.</p>
<p>No doubt the Big Pylon will win, though - it's literally a traffic cone that's formed a running gag since the first game.</p>
<p>The first Yakuza game was released on PS2 in 2005 in Japan, followed by an international release the following year. The series has more recently taken on its Japanese name Like a Dragon.</p>
<p>After last year's celebrated Infinite Wealth, which had the<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-is-series-biggest-steam-launch-to-date"> series' most successful launch on Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-hits-1m-sales-in-first-week">hit 1m sales in its first week</a>, Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is set to launch later this month on 21st February.

			<p>Despite Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail and Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake doing better than anticipated, Square Enix still reported a drop in video game profits by almost 10% over the past year.</p>
<p>In its <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/pdf/25q3slides.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">financial report</a> for the first nine months of the current fiscal year ending on March 31st, the Japanese publisher confirmed net sales for its Digital Entertainment sector have dropped 10.7% and operating income 9.9% due to the weak performance of mobile and browser-based games and to the low sales of games released this year compared to the sales of those released the previous fiscal year, including the Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters and Dragon Quest Monsters: The Dark Prince. Still, some of the publisher's new releases did well, as the Dragon Quest HD-2D Remake sold better than expected. The Final Fantasy XIV Dawntrail expansion also sold well and has driven an increase in the MMO segment profits over the previous year.</p>
<p>The results reported in the latest financial report aren't particularly surprising, considering how Square Enix reported last September how sales of<a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-underperformed-disappointing-profits/"> Final Fantasy XVI and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth did not meet expectations</a>, expectations that were reportedly reasonable this time. Thankfully, the second entry in the Remake trilogy seems to be doing quite well on<a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-had-great-steam-launch-best-selling-game-of-the-week-ending-jan-25/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> PC</a>, so there's the chance that sales will eventually meet the publisher's expectations. It definitely would be a shame for such a good game to be considered a failure in terms of sales.</p>

            <p>Better get yer cigar chompin' mouth muscles warmed up. Second world war sabotage 'em up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/commandos-origins">Commandos: Origins</a> now has a release date, and it's fairly soon. Good news for people who enjoy sniping fascists from across the map while commanding a barrel-armed Irishmen to simultaneously slit a throat. And equally good news for those who lament the loss of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shadow-tactics-blades-of-the-shogun">Shadow Tactics: Blades Of The Shogun</a> developer Mimimi Games.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This reboot is coming out on April 9th, said developers Claymore Game Studios in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1479730/view/501690406746980951">a Steam post</a>. "After more than four years of setting up a new studio, design and development, and the invaluable community feedback from various playtests - operation ‘Release’ is a go," said studio director Jürgen Reusswig.</p>
<p>But maybe you don't have all the requisite wrinkles to remember <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/commandos-behind-enemy-lines">Commandos</a>? They were a series of tough top-down tactics games that saw the player infiltrate axis territory during World War 2. They looked like real-time strategy games but were really all about high-stakes stealth. That, and trying to find the one good angle your sniper could actually shoot from.</p>
<p>This follow-up will have 10 missions in wartime locales like the North African desert and snowy Scandinavia, and you'll be able to slink through Nazi encampments slashing necks with a pal in two-player co-op (both online or split-screen). Nic played a demo during last autumn's Next Feast, and walked away <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/commandos-origins-looks-like-a-solid-and-satisfying-return-for-the-legendary-tactics-series">feeling broadly positive</a> about all the meticulously timed soldier strangling. He also dropped a wardrobe on the heads of two unsuspecting Nazis. What's not to like?</p><p>Publisher Kalypso Media <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/commandos-acquired-by-kalypso-media">bagged the rights to the Commandos</a> games back in 2018 and promptly got to work <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kalypso-have-set-up-a-new-commandos-game-studio">setting up a studio</a> to revive the series. The resultant reboot will be flying the flag for the stealth tactics genre after the demise of Mimimi Games, who basically revived and modernised all the ideas of old-school Commandos games when they made Shadow Tactics, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/desperados-iii">Desperados 3</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shadow-gambit-the-cursed-crew">Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew</a>. These were all well-liked games by folks here at RPS. Sadly, the studio <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shadow-gambit-studio-mimimi-are-closing-down-to-prioritize-our-well-being">closed down in the summer of 2023</a>, with the founders of the studio citing exhaustion as the main reason they were downing tools.  </p>
<p>"We cherished every game we made and feel proud of what we were able to accomplish as a studio," they said when announcing the closure. "At the same time, dedicating the past decade and a half of our lives working on increasingly ambitious games took a heavy personal toll on us and our families."</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see how Claymore learn from Mimimi's work, and what ideas of their own they'll inject (or re-inject?) into the genre. Although Edwin has just soldier-crawled into the room wearing two stripes of boot polish on his face to pass on some intelligence. He says monastery stealth game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monastery-escape-tactics-sim-the-stone-of-madness-is-out-now-and-has-me-thinking-about-time">The Stone Of Madness</a> from the Balsphemous developers is also keeping the genre alive. This is a promising sign. Dismissed.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Despite the long silence, the Dragon Quest XII: The Flames of Fate development team is still hard at work on it, and more information will be revealed slowly over time.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/dragon-quest-12-is-still-fully-in-development-new-information-to-be-revealed-little-by-little-says-series-creator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Automaton</a> today, series creator Yuji Horii commented on the game during the latest livestream held with his radio show group KosoKoso Hoso Kyuoku over the weekend, saying that the development team is still hard at work on the game, and he hopes to reveal more information on the game little by little. Sadly, the legendary game designer did not say anything more on the matter, but still, it's good to hear that Dragon Quest XII: The Flames of Fate is still in the works, as it has been a very long time since we got a solid update on the game.</p>
<p>Very little is known about the next main entry in the long-running JRPG series, other than the fact that it will be powered by Unreal Engine 5 and that<a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-xii-the-flames-of-fate-is-being-co-developed-by-orca-dev-is-recruiting-unreal-engine-5-staff/"> Orca is co-developing the game</a>. The Japanese studio previously worked on Dragon Quest XI: Echoes of an Elusive Age and its Definitive Edition, so it's not surprising to see them back working on the next entry in the series, which promises to shake up things considerably, as it will feature an overhauled version of the series' trademark command battle system.</p>
<p>Dragon Quest XII: The Flames of Fate isn't the only entry in the series to be in the works. Later this year, the Dragon Quest I and II HD-2D remakes will be released on PC and consoles, continuing the Erdrick saga following the excellent <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake/">remake of the third entry in the series</a> released last November.</p>

            <p>The RPS review of Firaxis' grand <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civilisation 7</a> is currently <em>in progress</em>. We didn't get early code, and our usual method of sidestepping this issue by rapidly entering the numbers and letters spelled out by our extensive collection of longhorn beetles bore no fruit. Rest assured: it's coming. Sin reviewed it for EuroVega though, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/civilization-7-review">awarding it two out of a possible five beetles</a>. While she found it largely dull, she did mention that "its UI has enough potential to make some of my complaints feel patchable". Firaxis seem to agree, putting out a <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/news/message-from-firaxis-games/">statement last Friday</a> following feedback from the game's advanced access period.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"In response to your feedback, we’ve identified three key areas that we’re prioritizing work against as quickly as possible," say Firaxis. They're planning to share a roadmap "soon", but this is what they're working on for now. Chief among the three areas is a focus on improving the UI - their "top priority", they say. They're working on "making UI interactions more intuitive, improving map readability, fixing areas of polish like formatting, and more". Do love a good "more". Could be anything! Exciting!</p>
<p>As for multiplayer, they're working on the following:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Adding Teams to multiplayer games so you can play cooperatively</li>
<li>Allowing full player counts in multiplayer in all three Ages through refinements to our Distant Lands system.</li>
<li>Allowing you to pick your starting and ending Age to allow for single or double Age games</li>
<li>Providing a wider variety of map types</li>
<li>Enabling city and religion names to be customized</li>
<li>Adding in hotseat multiplayer</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, they're aiming to roll out a quality o' life patch in March, featuring "quality-of-life UI adjustments, ongoing AI balance and improvement, adjustments to diplomacy and crises, plus additional bug fixes".</p>
<p>In other Civ news, Firaxis announced <a href="https://youtu.be/ZmHvLykP-HI">Civ 7 VR yesterday</a>, exclusive to ZuckQuest 3 and 3s. I will never stand to play a strategy game and you cannot make me.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Diablo creator David Brevik has shared his distaste for some aspects in current ARPGs, and said that when the journey to levelling up is shortened "you've cheapened the entire experience".</p>
<p>Brevik, now head of indie publisher Skystone Games, spoke to <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/features/diablo-creator-david-brevik-doesnt-vibe-with-todays-rapid-arpgs/">VideoGamer</a> about his career and his thoughts on the ARPG genre. Brevik was co-founder and president of Blizzard North and served as lead programmer and senior designer on Diablo, and project and design lead on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-ii">Diablo 2</a>.</p>
<p>In the interview, Brevik criticised the speed at which games today offer player progression, which he believes spoils the pacing.</p>

<p>"I think that RPGs in general have started to lean into this: kill swathes of enemies all over the place extremely quickly," said Brevik. "Your build is killing all sorts of stuff so you could get more drops, you can level up, and the screen is littered with stuff you don't care about."</p>
<p>Enemy counts in the original Diablo games were notably high for the time, but Brevik believes modern games have learned the wrong lesson.</p>
<p>"I don't find that as kind of personal and realistic as like Diablo 2. The pacing on Diablo 2, I think is great," he said. "That's one of the reasons it's endured. I just don't find killing screen-fulls of things instantly and mowing stuff down and walking around the level and killing everything, very enticing. I just don't feel like that is a cool experience. I find it kind of silly.</p>
<p>"When you're shortening that journey and making it kind of ridiculous. You've cheapened the entire experience, in my opinion."</p>
<p>While Brevik's comments apply to the recent Diablo games, it also arguably applies to the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/path-of-exile-2">Path of Exile 2</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lost-ark">Lost Ark</a>. And MMOs also suffer from similar faults.</p>
<p>"I think that MMOs have definitely pushed in that direction," said Brevik. "How fast can you level? How fast can you kill everything? It's all about speed and things like that, but, in reality, I just think that makes a kind of a worse experience. And I tend to shy away from that direction."</p>
<p>Blizzard has followed the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a> with a number of seasons and major expansion Vessel of Hatred to extend its longevity, while also battling with endgame imbalances. The expansion's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-dlc-boosts-steam-players-to-record-high-despite-rocky-launch">launch in October last year was rocky</a> but still led to a boost in Steam players.</p>
<p>Path of Exile 2, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/path-of-exile-2-first-major-patch-brings-big-changes-to-endgame-content">received a major patch last month</a> after its early access release in December, which made big changes to its endgame.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-%E2%80%93-best-quest-to-complete-as-soon-as-possible-for-a-solid-head-start-in-the-game.1104735/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-best-quest-to-complete-as-soon-as-possible-for-a-solid-head-start-in-the-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Despite some streamlining over its predecessor, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is most definitely not the most accessible role-playing game around. Following the long introduction, where you are taught the very basics of the experience, the game essentially leaves you on your own to figure everything out by experimenting, which can lead to frustration, as at the beginning of the game, Henry is not very good at anything, and the poor gear in your possession will help you little in combat. Thankfully, there is a quest you can complete that will give you a decent headstart in the game and help you have fun even during the first few hours of the adventure.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250210113926_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>To complete the Wedding Crashers main story quest, which is the very first quest you have to complete after Henry and Hans part ways in Troskowitz, you have two different options - either get into the wedding part with the help of the blacksmith Radovan or with the help of the miller Kreyzl. If you are a newcomer to the series, and you are feeling overwhelmed by the many mechanics, the game is already asking you to understand at the beginning of the adventure, your best choice is to ask for Radovan's help for a few reasons.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250210112934_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>After reaching Tachov to the north of Troskowitz and speaking with Radovan, you will learn how to craft items, which is an excellent way to earn a few Groschen and purchase items you may need, such as food. Don't spend your money on weapons and gear yet, however, as you will soon after get the chance to obtain plenty of free gear.</p>
<p>After completing the blacksmithing tutorial, you will not only get a free bed, allowing you to rest and recover health as well as <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-how-to-save-at-any-time-without-using-savior-schnapps-potions/">save your game</a> without having to use a Saviour Schnapps potion, but you will also get access to an additional Kingdom Come: Deliverance II story quest called The Jaunt where Henry will join the lord of Semine and his faithful guard Sir Gnarly to track down a lost cart.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250210112909_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Before venturing forth with the two men, you should head over to the stables, where you can reunite with Pebbles, Henry's horse, potentially for free if you can pass a skill check. Otherwise, you can purchase the horse for a relatively low sum or even try to steal the horse and register it to yourself by the Horse handler in the Nomad Camp to the east of Semine, although you will still need some Groschen to do so. If you are stealing, however, it may make more sense to steal a better horse than Pebbles at this point and then reclaim him at a later time when you have the coin.</p>
<p>While it will take more time to complete the quest, you can complete The Jaunt quest in Kingdom Come: Deliverance II without a horse, so if you are not able to reclaim Pebbles, you should definitely still proceed. After traveling through a few different locations, Henry and the two older men will have to fight some bandits, and if you don't feel confident in your combat skills yet, you can choose to stay in the back and shoot the bandits from afar with a crossbow. Once the bandits are dead, you can loot them of their possessions, which includes weapons and gear that are more than decent to give you a headstart in the game. With this gear, you should have no trouble completing a few other essentially starting quests, which include the Combat Training I quest, where you can learn the extremely useful Master Strike ability, and the Mutt quest to find Henry's loyal canine companion.</p>

            <p>
PlayStation owners impacted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yes-psn-is-still-down-after-12-hours">this weekend's major PSN outage</a> have criticised Sony's apology offer, as well as the lack of explanation on what went wrong. 
</p>
<p>
The latest period of PSN downtime lasted nearly 24 hours, beginning early Friday evening here in the UK. When the service did return, Sony apologised and blamed a vague "operational issue" as the cause.
</p>
<p>
Compensation for the outage amounts to five additional days for anyone with a PS Plus subscription, but nothing for others who were also locked out of playing digital games.

<p>
Not all online games require PS Plus, of course - including free-to-play behemoths like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> and Roblox - and access to these was also unavailable.
</p>
<p>
"Everything was down," <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/all-playstation-plus-members-will-automatically-receive-an-additional-5-days-of-service-for-the-psn-outage.1104324/page-3#post-135525930">one impacted user wrote on ResetEra</a>. "People that game share (like me) were locked out of their entire digital library, including offline games. You didn't need PS Plus to be affected."
</p>
<p>
"I don't have PS Plus but still couldn't play the games I wanted to," opined another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/1il7ibh/sony_is_giving_some_compensation/">impacted user on reddit</a>. "Guess I'm a f***ing second class citizen."
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted Sony to ask if the company plans any other form of compensation, and to ask again about the cause of this weekend's outage. 
</p>
<p>
PlayStation fans have been left in the dark about the root cause of the downtime - and what steps Sony is now taking to ensure it is not repeated again anytime soon.

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Valve has implemented new rules around advertising, explicitly prohibiting games that force players to watch in-game ads.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/advertising">new rules from Valve</a> - available online and first reported by <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/valve-ban-advertising-based-business-models-on-steam-no-forced-adverts-like-in-mobile-games/">Gaming on Linux</a> - confirm that whilst cross-promotion and product placement are permitted, games that force players to watch or engage with advertising in order to play are not.</p>
<p>Nor should developers use advertising as a "way to provide value to players, such as giving players a reward for watching or engaging with advertising in their game".</p>

<p>"Developers should not utilise paid advertising as a business model in their game, such as requiring players to watch or otherwise engage with advertising in order to play, or gating gameplay behind advertising," the rules explain.</p>
<p>"If your game's business model relies on advertising on other platforms, you will need to remove those elements before shipping on Steam. Some options you could consider include switching to a single purchase 'paid app', or making your game free to play with optional upgrades sold via Microtransactions or Downloadable Content (DLC)."</p>
<p>Whilst I suspect most of us would associate this kind of behaviour with mobile games more than those available on Steam, Valve clearly thought it necessary to clarify, in clear English, "what is and is not supported on Steam".</p>
<p>Developers are also not allowed to charge other developers for access to Steam features, such as sale pages, bundles, store fronts, or franchise pages.</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-now-includes-a-warning-flagging-potentially-abandoned-early-access-games">Valve quietly implmented a useful new Steam feature</a> warning users - and potential purchasers - how long it's been since an early access game last received an update.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Mere days after its debut, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 already has a thriving modding community. We previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-mod-roundup-unlimited-saving-and-increased-convenience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">covered</a> a lot of convenience mods to make the game a bit less tedious for those who don't enjoy that side of the franchise. Now, it's time for the first graphics enhancement mods. Nexus Mods user SweeJ24 has uploaded a 3.4GB <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/263?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4K skins mod</a> that greatly increases the skin details of the game's characters by replacing all faces and all body diffuse textures for both males and females. There are reportedly minor seams at the moment, but the detail enhancement is already big, making it more than worthwhile. The default textures in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 are 1K, so the mod offers a 4x resolution improvement.</p>
<p><iframe title="CRT FACES" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ACAvdOyjbDo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>According to the author, the initial load might be a little longer, but afterward, it should be the same as vanilla. They also did not report any performance impact, although that was with the GeForce RTX 4090 graphics card.</p>
<p>No doubt there will be many more graphics mods coming to Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. The game was a resounding success both critically and commercially (it has already <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sells-1-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> one million units, recouping development costs). The game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received a perfect score</a> here on Wccftech from Chris Wray:</p>
<p><em>If I were honest with myself, I don't think I've ever enjoyed an open-world game in the same way I have Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. Or, more accurately, the last time a game ever felt this transformational as to what I would expect from an open-world RPG of this nature was The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion almost twenty years ago. The Witcher III is up there, but even that doesn't feel as responsive as this.</em></p>
<p><em>[...] I would genuinely argue that this could be judged as a benchmark on how to do an open world, and even though I'm over fifty hours in, there's more I want to do and see. There are side quests to complete, easter eggs to hunt, wenches to fornicate with, and bandits to kill. I didn't want to write this review now, not in the slightest; I wanted just one more day to give even more context, and I know I would have wanted just one more day after that.</em></p>

Obviously I can't actually respond to that, so I'll just do the bad news first and if you chose differently you can always tip your monitor upside down, hang from the ceiling, or just work your way up the article from the bottom: tributary <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> demake <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bloodborne-psx">Bloodborne PSX</a> is no more.

The game was previously available on <a href="https://b0tster.itch.io/">Itch</a> for three years without issue.</p>
<p>This follows a recent DMCA takedown of a YouTube video promoting Bloodborne PSX, as chronicled by noted good modsman Lance McDonald below. As McDonald mentions, MarkScan were also responsible for another recent strike against his own 60fps <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bloodborne">Bloodborne</a> mod, which had been <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/manfightdragon.bsky.social/post/3lh2cipa4rk2v">available without issue since 2021</a>.</p>

<p>Here is <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/b0tster.yeag.gay/post/3lhjt5ufa722a">an animated recap</a> of events by Walther herself.</p>
<p>These events seem doubly abrupt and misguided in light of the fact that Sony previously gave Walther their blessing to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bloodborne-kart-will-scrub-the-branding-off-after-being-contacted-by-sonys-lawyers">release Nightmare Kart following a few changes</a>, notably the title from '<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bloodborne-kart">Bloodborne Kart</a>'. Could MarkScan perhaps be acting a touch overzealously here? From The Verge:</p>
<blockquote><p>MarkScan has previously made headlines for <a href="https://www.wired.com/2014/07/markscan-takedown/">taking down World Cup sites that weren’t even streaming the World Cup</a>, and asking Google to <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/sony-flags-its-own-website-for-repeat-copyright-infringements-220724/">remove <em>some of Sony’s own websites</em> on Sony’s behalf</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>As is generally the case whenever they see a.) a cathedral in real life b.) a British person looking a bit under the weather or c.) a normal rat, some fans have broken out the Bloodbornium and declared these events undeniable portents that it is, once again, huffin' season. A brief mention of Bloodborne in Sony's recent <a href="https://youtu.be/KkmonzpHVRg">30th anniversary video</a> helped stoke these fires.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>New ideas and directions are hard to find in the gaming peripheral space. Controllers do what controllers do, and for many people, the official PlayStation and Xbox controllers are as far as it goes. However, there’s a healthy competition for our fingers and thumbs rumbling away, with controllers now one of the most hotly contested sectors in gaming. Turtle Beach have come a long way from being purely a headset maker, and their latest, the Stealth Pivot, ploughs a new direction by having what can only be described as a split personality.</p>

<p>I loved the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/04/turtle-beach-stealth-ultra-pro-controller-review/">Stealth Ultra Pro</a>, cementing the fact that Turtle Beach are onto A Good Thing in the controller space. Where that brought in new technology in the shape of a colour OLED screen for a bit of high-tech gloss, the Pivot is more of a Swiss Army Knife of controllers, letting you switch between a standard controller layout or a fighting/retro focussed one. It’s a brilliant idea, even if it’s answering an unasked question for many gamers.</p>


<p>The Pivot looks pretty familiar, taking its overall design influence from the Official Xbox Controller. Despite that, it’s primarily aimed at PC and Mobile players with Xbox functionality available if you’re wired up. On PC the best performance comes either wired or via the 2.4gHz USB-A wireless dongle, while Bluetooth will let you hop in with your mobile or Apple TV-esque device. In the hand, it’s weighty and solid, fashioned from good quality plastics.</p>
<p>The magic comes with its namesake. It’s called the Pivot for the two pivoting sections on the face of the controller. These rotate between a standard asymmetrical Xbox-esque layout and a six-button lineup, shifting the D-pad into a more accessible position for your thumb. All you need to do is flip the controller over, release the locking switches and rotate the controller faces to your desired position.</p>

<p>It’s an ingenious bit of tech, a more practical and immediate cousin to the Thrustmaster eSwap’s controller modules, and it’s super satisfying just to tinker with. I have to admit, I’ve found myself messing with it before starting a game, even if I don’t need the fighting game layout.</p>

<p>So that this all fits into one controller, there’ve been two necessary changes, and they do affect how the Pivot feels in your hand, and in use. Firstly, the Pivot is a bit on the chonky side. In order for the pivoting mechanism to fit in, they’ve had to make it thicker, and if you’ve got smaller hands, it is a noticeable change. Personally, it didn’t affect my time using the Pivot, but I noticed it every single time I picked it up.</p>
<p>The second alteration is to the analogue sticks. As we’re seeing with more and more controllers, these are anti-drift Hall Effect sticks, which means they should last you a heck of a lot longer than the sticks in either the DualSense or Xbox Controller thanks to their magnetic technology removing the physical friction that wears on traditional sticks.</p>
<p>However, the sticks need to fit within the body of the controller when you rotate them away, with a twisting mechanism releasing them so that you can be tucked inside. It’s clever, and feels pretty solid, though I have to wonder whether it removes the advantages given by the Hall Effect sticks if you’re the kind of person – like me – to mess with the controller’s layout every single time you play. Being so weirdly enjoyable that you want to mess with it, increasing the wear on all the parts around he sticks, is probably a problem that the designers haven’t spent too much time on.</p>

<p>Because they need to be rotated away, both sticks are noticeably shorter than you’ll be used to. It’s far more noticeable to your muscle memory than the rest of the controller’s body, and it’s an oddity that may well be too much for some players to get over. On top of that, the sticks’ resistance is lower than I would like, giving less feedback to your movements and reducing the premium feel.</p>
<p>There’s some benefit to the reduced resistance and shorter sticks though, particularly the ability to change direction quicker, and if you’re a fighting game fan that prefers an analogue stick input, this could make it easier to fire off your directional inputs. That comes at a cost to precision, so if you’re into competitive FPS titles, you might want to look elsewhere. That’s backed up in our testing, with Gamepad Tester delivering a worrying 13.4% accuracy error, with the circularity over-emphasising the four main directions.</p>
<p>That’s not to say it doesn’t have some shooter chops, as the Pivot boasts the near essential short trigger stops for your analogue triggers – seriously, every controller should have these. Further up on the back of the Pivot, you’ll find two easily identified toggles, each of which shortens the travel of the triggers so that they effectively become buttons. There’s only two trigger stop settings, instead of the more typical three, with the standard analogue trigger travel being shorter than you’d find elsewhere.</p>
<p>Hopefully, this improves your reaction speed when you’re lining up a headshot, and through plenty of rounds of Overwatch 2, the Pivot was no slouch. However, not having a longer travel similar, for example, to an Xbox controller can reduce the precision you want for racing games.</p>

<p>The Stealth Pro isn’t the only Turtle Beach controller with a screen, as the Pivot steals one of its killer features. This is a much smaller version though, and monochrome, but it still lets you make a series of on-the-fly changes to your controller’s setup. You can receive alerts from your mobile phone, change the mapping for the buttons and D-pad, and also switch the plastic slider’s functionality, though only for audio controls and not any of the central buttons – this seems a missed opportunity.</p>
<p>No matter which face button layout you’ve gone for, each of the membrane buttons feel good in use, with an expected level of travel. Both D-pads feel great, and given the attention that’s been lavished on them, it feels safe to say that the Pivot is aimed squarely at the fighting game crowd, with the option to play anything else at the flick of a switch.</p>

<p>Beyond the expected buttons, the Pivot also has a pair of extra rear buttons that are a placed unusually, but do still sit just underneath your middle fingers. I think this is actually my preferred layout for back buttons, though, and only having two reduces the chance of accidental activation – if you’re a fully-immersed back button/paddle aficionado, you might want a couple more.</p>
<p>The Pivot isn’t the only controller taking this unusual approach to variety gaming. The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/27/victrix-pro-bfg-controller-review/">Victrix Pro BFG</a>&nbsp;is a great option, though its alternative button layouts need to be screwed in and out of the controller housing so it doesn’t have the immediacy of the Pivot. The trigger lockouts are a lot more finicky too. My personal favourite solution to this question remains the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/19/thrustmaster-eswap-x2-pro-controller-review/">Thrustmaster eSwap X2 Pro</a>, whose magnetic units are a doodle to swap in and out, and it comes in at the same £119.99 pricepoint, though it’s only available as a wired option which won’t be for everyone.</p>
