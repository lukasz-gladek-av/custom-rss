		<p>It’s been a lovely, sunny week, and that’s meant that I’ve actually been outdoors, collecting Vitamin D to see me through the dark days (as in, the normal UK weather when you live up North). I have, however, played a chunk of Overwatch 2, loads of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/29/f1-manager-24-review/">F1 Manager 24</a>, Zenless Zone Zero, Cataclismo, and some more Elder Scrolls Online: The Gold Road, which is, unsurprisingly, something of a time sink.</p>
<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> has been playing Destiny 2, as per, and the very funny <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/29/thank-goodness-youre-here-review/">Thank Goodness You’re Here</a> for review. Oh sure, it it doesn’t sound like much of a game, it sounds like I’m going to chortle my way through it, so I’m sold!</p>

<p><strong>Nic B</strong> has been dipping his toe (paw?) back into MTG Arena with the release of its cutest set, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/30/mtg-arena-bloomburrow-expansion-starters-guide/">Bloomburrow</a>. Beyond that, it’s the usual: Monster Hunter Now!</p>
<p><strong>Aran</strong> played <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/30/deadlink-review/">Deadlink for review</a>, saying, “It’s a fun roguelike arena shooter with a banging soundtrack.” He’s also been heading back in time though, “I’ve also played more Enslaved Odyssey to the West. I’m nearly at the end of the main story and then I’ll start the DLC.”</p>


<p>Chanting “EDF! EDF!” in his sleep has been Ade, who said in his waking hours that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/02/earth-defense-force-6-review/">EDF 6</a> “is everything an Earth Defense Force fan could ever wish for.” He’s also been playing Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess, and seriously enjoying it. He says, “It’s the kind of creative and unique experimental game that I thought major publishers (other than Nintendo) just didn’t make any more. I’m so glad Capcom proved me wrong though, as Kunitsu-Gami is an absolute gem and proving to be one of my favourite games of the year so far.”</p>
<p><strong>Miguel</strong> has been playing some Zenless Zone Zero, some Frontier Hunter, and Shadow Tower Abyss on the PS2! From Software’s weirdest and coolest pre-Souls game. Meanwhile, <strong>Gamoc</strong> has been playing Elden Ring, yet more Baldur’s Gate 3, and Mount and Blade Bannerlord, but the bigger challenge has been playing a game of telephone, trying to convince someone, anyone to come and install internet. Hopefully a chap will come along to sort that out today.</p>

<p>And finally, <strong>Tef</strong> handed in his review for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/01/steamworld-heist-2-review/">SteamWorld Heist 2</a>, and had a whale of a time with crew of submariner Steambots, taking on the game’s distinctive side-scrolling turn-based action. He’s also been out and about playing a much anticipated game… but sadly can’t tell us anything about that until later this month.</p>
<p>But what about you? What have you played?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/2/24211410/humble-games-layoffs-indie-studios-uncertainty<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Humble Games “restructured” and reportedly laid off its 36-person team <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/23/24204641/beloved-indie-game-publisher-humble-games-has-reportedly-laid-off-all-staff-without-warning">last week</a>. The publisher, which is part of the IGN-owned Humble Bundle, started helping developers release games <a href="https://developer.humblebundle.com/post/157036461841/humble-bundle-launches-multi-platform-publishing">in 2017</a> and published notable games like <em>Slay the Spire</em> and <em>Signalis</em>. The resulting fallout from the layoffs has left developers working with the publisher uncertain about many plans for future games, leaving their console ports in jeopardy.</p><p>Amir Fassihi, studio director of Dead Mage, the team behind the in-development <em>Wizard of Legend 2,</em> is worried that the restructuring could impact their project. “We do not want to make any changes,” Fassihi tells <em>The Verge</em>. “However, we’re unsure what changes will be forced on us because everyone in the publisher we collaborated with in the past 2.5 years is suddenly gone.” Now, Dead Mage has to “wait and hope that the new team will deliver the various publishing services that we expected from Humble Games.”</p><p>The “new team,” <a href="https://aftermath.site/humble-games-layoffs-closure-ziff-davis-ign">according to a report from <em>Aftermath</em></a> and three of the developers I spoke with, is the Powell Group, <a href="https://powellgroupconsulting.com/services/">a video game consulting company</a>. The Powell Group and Humble Games didn’t reply to requests for comment. In a post <a href="https://x.com/PlayHumbleGames/status/1815851182977425772">last week</a>, Humble Games didn’t mention the Powell Group’s involvement, only saying that “supporting our development partners and assisting former team members remains our top priority” and that “we are committed to making this transition as smooth as possible for everyone involved.”</p><div><figcaption><em>Coral Island.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Stairway Games</cite></p></div><p>Developers are mostly worried about console ports, which Humble Games seemed to have a major hand in for some of the projects it worked on.</p><p>“We are now in a difficult situation when it comes to updating the console ports, as both porting and QA support was tied into our deal with Humble,” Squid Shock Studios, developer of the newly released <em>Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus</em>, <a href="https://x.com/SquidShock/status/1817973044826226968">said in a post on Monday</a>. (The game is available on PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch in addition to Steam.) “We are actively pursuing all available avenues to allow us to roll out updates to console versions, but we regret to say this may take some time to put in place.” The studio is also planning to <a href="https://x.com/SquidShock/status/1818295470034456578">launch a Patreon</a>.</p><p><em>Coral Island</em> developer Stairway Games <a href="https://x.com/coralislandgame/status/1816674043954925590">said last week</a> that the impact of the restructuring “remains uncertain for all things related to consoles.” The game is out on Xbox Series X / S, PlayStation 5, and Steam, with a Switch port in the works. The team has a hotfix for its 1.1 update “nearing release” on Steam, but “we have no idea how to get this update out to other platform players as we don’t have the backend permission on console platforms to push updates out,” Stairway said. “We only have access to the Steam backend.” Stairway is offering Kickstarter backers who are still waiting for the Switch release <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/coralisland/coral-island-reimagining-the-farm-sim-game/posts/4158875">the option</a> to get a Steam key instead.</p><div><p>“Changing publishers would be an extremely uphill battle”</p></div><p>Even if developers wanted to make a change from Humble Games as a result of the restructuring, that might be difficult. “To the best of my understanding, Humble Games is fulfilling their contractual obligations to us, so changing publishers would be an extremely uphill battle,” says Matthew Taylor of <em>Rolling Hills</em> developer Catch &amp; Release.</p><p>Not every studio appears to have been significantly impacted, and things do seem to be improving for developers since the restructuring. Cody Greenhalge, technical director at <em>#Blud</em> developer Exit 73 Studios, tells <em>The Verge</em> that the Powell Group has “worked well with us and we are hopeful our game won’t have any long lasting effects from this ordeal.”</p><p>Taylor says that the Powell Group has set Catch &amp; Release up with a new release manager, producer, and back catalog specialist. “It’s still too early to know how efficiently all these new folks can work together and get onboarded quickly, but in the case of our game we only need someone to help us get new updates to Microsoft and manage discounts and events, so I think we’ll be OK,” Taylor says. “If we were working on a game still in development or having very recently released, I’d be way more stressed.”</p><p>Despite the uncertainties, Humble Games spokesperson Michael Brown said <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24210726/humble-games-console-ports-layoffs">to <em>Polygon</em></a> that “nothing has changed and no developers have had to change their porting plans; every project is moving ahead.” Brown added that “when people see that the new team at Humble Games was brought in to improve operations and support levels for all the developers, all concerns will be laid to rest.”&nbsp;</p><p>Even if things are slowly improving, the situation has been messy, leaving developers unsure of how they’ll move forward with their games. “The layoff of the whole Humble team has been the strangest thing I have seen in my 20 years of experience working,” says Fassihi. “The fact that nothing was shared with us beforehand, and we had to read this in the news, makes it even worse.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/02/reports-destiny-spin-off-cancelled-and-the-final-shape-underperformed-but-bungie-layoffs-were-always-planned/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Following the news of significant layoffs at <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/bungie">Bungie</a> earlier this week, there’s been a lot of further reporting on what this means for the company’s future and how they’ve ended up in this place. Senior staff have left, a new Destiny game has reportedly been cancelled, and many have called for CEO Pete Parsons to quit for mismanaging the company over the last few years.</p>
<p>The layoffs were announced on Wednesday by Bungie CEO Pete Parsons, with 220 of the company’s 1300 headcount losing their jobs, while a further 155 would be able to move across to the wider PlayStation business, and <a href="https://x.com/jasonschreier/status/1818674500013097178">around 40 to form a new studio</a> and take on an incubation project. That’s roughly a third of the company’s workforce, and follows on from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/06/bungies-independence-reportedly-under-threat-developers-suffering-low-morale/">100 employees losing their jobs last October</a>, leaving the new headcount at around 850 employees.</p>
<p>As part of this, it’s reported that key Bungie figures from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/destiny-2">Destiny 2’s</a> early revival have departed the company. Luke Smith and Mark Noseworthy have apparently left (per Jeff Grubb’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yszLbBLdM3Y&amp;ab_channel=JeffGrubb%27sGameMess" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Game Mess Decides podcast</a>) following the cancellation of their Destiny spin-off game, codenamed Payback. This had been reported as being Destiny 3, but as is often the case, further details are leaked once people are no longer employed, and <a href="https://x.com/jasonschreier/status/1819075149360185737">Jason Schreier’s sources state it was not a direct</a> sequel, and actually cancelled some time ago.</p>


<p>The layoffs have been met with a lot of shock from outside viewers, given the very positive reception of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/11/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review/">Destiny 2: The Final Shape</a>. Bungie had delayed the expansion’s release in an effort to come back from failing to meet financial expectations with the previous year’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/03/14/destiny-2-lightfall-review/">Lightfall</a>, and by all accounts, The Final Shape was the narrative finale that Destiny needed and deserved.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/bungies-deep-job-cuts-were-in-the">Stephen Totilo reports</a> that the deep job cuts were planned to happen regardless of the reception or success of The Final Shape. The need for job cuts was only made worse by The Final Shape having “sold less than Lightfall”, despite its positive reception. As Parsons stated in the job cuts announcement, “We were overly ambitious, our financial safety margins were subsequently exceeded, and we began running in the red.”</p>

<p>Since that announcement, a lot of anger has been directed at Parsons personally for his decision making, leadership and level of accountability. Parsons claimed that the leadership team “did everything we could to avoid today’s outcome,” but there have been various former employees calling for Parsons to quit, especially with anecdotes about him <a href="https://twitter.com/TheSamBartley/status/1818678522397049082?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1818678522397049082%7Ctwgr%5E5c982966ceb610db0c23f156764e420a0aec9131%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techspot.com%2Fnews%2F104075-bungie-ceo-faces-backlash-after-announcing-220-people.html">inviting them to view his personal car collection</a> – a collection that has been found on car bidding site <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/">Bring A Trailer</a>, and which shows a total value of $2.4 million, over <a href="https://twitter.com/D2cbro/status/1818700972660576660?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1818700972660576660%7Ctwgr%5E5c982966ceb610db0c23f156764e420a0aec9131%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techspot.com%2Fnews%2F104075-bungie-ceo-faces-backlash-after-announcing-220-people.html">$450,000 of which came since October 2023,</a> the time of the first wave of layoffs.</p>
<p>Anyone else remember <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2011/07/29/nintendo-president-takes-50-pay-cut/">the time that Nintendo’s President took a 50% pay cut?</a></p>
<p>There’s also analysis of how this ties back into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/01/31/sony-buys-bungie-halo-destiny-2-ps5/">Sony’s 2022 acquisition of Bungie for $3.6 billion</a>. Speaking to Totilo, an anonymous former Bungie insider said, “I think Sony overpaid for Bungie. I think Bungie sold things they were just not able to deliver.” The company had seemingly overstated their earning potential, while courting Sony as a buyer.</p>
<p>And Parsons is again going to be in the spotlight for that, as part of the 2022 acquisition was that Bungie would remain autonomous. That autonomy reportedly came into threat last year as Bungie started to miss financial targets, which was seemingly a driving factor behind layoffs late last year, so the company leadership could try to retain control.</p>
<p>Bungie is remaining committed to supporting Destiny 2 going forward and the development of extraction shooter <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marathon">Marathon</a>, but the company’s future still feels uncertain. Jeff Grubb is claiming that, in time, <a href="https://x.com/JeffGrubb/status/1818686383449346538">Sony will take over control of Bungie’s management</a>, similar to all other developers owned by Sony Interactive Entertainment.</p>

            <p>Jail shake-and-breaker management sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prison-architect-2">Prison Architect 2 </a>has been delayed indefinitely, a couple of months after publishers Paradox parted ways with original developers Double Eleven. Current developers Kokku will use the additional time "to improve both the game's performance and its content". Additionally, Paradox are removing the option to preorder the game until they have a "robust" release timeline. Existing preorders on all platforms will be refunded, and all preorder-exclusive items will be added into the base game.</p><!--more-->
<p>Released into 1.0 in 2015, and developed by Introversion, the original Prison Architect is an old RPS favourite. Our own judge-at-large Brendy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prison-architect-review">sentenced</a> it to a Bestest Best, with time added for being "an excellent story-making game" and for being "the only management game that has made me feel sheepish". Introversion sold the property rights to Paradox in 2019, who subsequently put Double Eleven in charge of on-going development. </p>
<p>Announced in January this year, the sequel both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prison-architect-2-is-official-bringing-paradoxs-jail-management-sim-to-3d">impressed and dismayed</a> Katharine (RPS in peace) with its newly 3D graphics. Once due for release in March, it's been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prison-architect-2-has-been-pushed-from-its-already-delayed-release-date-next-month-all-the-way-back-to-autumn">repeatedly delayed</a>. Then, in May, Paradox <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prison-architect-2-developers-part-ways-with-paradox-months-before-its-due-for-release">revealed</a> that they and Double Eleven had failed "to find a commercial agreement that worked for both parties moving forward and mutually agreed to part ways". This came after the game had passed certification on all platforms. And yet, it seems that there's still more work to be done.</p>
<p>"At this stage, we can't commit to a new release date as we need to re-assess the scope of the work needed to be done before the game is release-ready," a Paradox rep <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/prison-architect-2-delayed-release.1697795/">explained in a forum post today</a>. "Over the next few months, we will focus on improving the game and building a more robust release timeline. This also means we will be limiting our communication with you all until we have a timeline we feel comfortable with."</p>
<p>The post includes a FAQ that goes into slightly more detail about what needs fine-tuning. "Prison Architect is a game with deep systems that all interact with each other, and this is also something we want to bring with us into the sequel, Prison Architect 2," it reads. "Having systems like this in a game also means that a small change in one area will also affect one or more other areas, which we then also need to apply fixes to. Improving the performance has proven to be a task that will take time."</p>
<p>Going by Brendy's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prison-architect-2-is-coming-up-for-release-but-its-hard-to-rehabilitate-from-years-of-2d">hands-on preview</a> from May, Prison Architect 2's problems are at once more straightforward and more fundamental than a few misbehaving systems eating into the frame-rate. "Thematically and mechanically, Prison Architect is about control," he wrote. "It is about little people's lives being directed to a tragicomically draconian degree. But if this franchise is all about being the overbearing loon in charge of every minor detail, does a 3D camera complement that feeling of jealous control? For me, not hugely. If anything, the top-down 2D view of the original allowed you to quickly parse more information."</p>
<p>The Paradox post notes that the delay announcement "aligns with our commitment here at Paradox to reviewing and improving the quality of our released content." This may allude to CEO Fredrik Wester's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-ceo-admits-company-made-wrong-calls-in-several-projects-in-wake-of-life-by-yous-cancellation">admission last month</a> that the publishers have "made the wrong calls in several projects, especially outside of our core, and this must change". Paradox's recent activities include <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-shutter-studio-tectonic-and-cancel-troubled-sims-competitor-life-by-you">shuttering Tectonic, developers of Life By You</a>, washing their hands of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lamplighter-developers-harebrained-go-indie-as-paradox-decides-against-new-project-or-sequel-in-the-same-genre">Harebrained Schemes</a><a></a> following dismal sales of Lamplighters League, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-back-and-now-under-development-by-dear-esther-studio">handing off the infamously troubled Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 to The Chinese Room</a> after years of development under Hardsuit Labs. Prison Architect 2 has only been in the public eye for a few months - hopefully it won't end up in a similar purgatorial state.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Red Rescue Team was one of a duo of games, with Blue Rescue Team released at the same time for the Nintendo DS (which isn't currently part of the Nintendo Switch Online catalogue).

"Mystery Dungeon has hidden depths that make up for any drawbacks," we wrote in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/r-pokemondungeon-ds">review of Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team</a> back in 2006. "As the game progresses, dungeons become more interesting places - and dangerous ones, filled with lava and traps and the like. Levelling up your teammates, managing your inventory, and clearing out dungeons becomes compelling pretty quickly - even though the sidequest structure allows you to play the game as slowly as you like."

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-vr2-works-as-well-on-pc-as-it-does-on-playstation-5-setup-is-easy.942939/</guid>

			<p>The PlayStation VR2 headset is finally becoming compatible with PC next week, and it seems like the headset works on PC as well as it does on PlayStation 5, according to a new video shared online.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GAMERGEN_/videos" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gamergen</a> on YouTube and summarized by ResetERA forums members <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-vr2-ot-vr-using-our-senses.688708/post-126590970" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cilidra</a> and <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-vr2-ot-vr-using-our-senses.688708/post-126593391" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DjRare</a>, the Sony headset works very well on PC, with good tracking, image quality, and easy setup, even with the beta version of the app. The only complaints are the same for using the headset on PlayStation 5, namely the headset's cable and sweet spot. At the end of the day, the adapter bringing compatibility with PC is a great purchase for those who already own the headset and a VR-ready PC, thanks to its low cost. Those who don't own the headset, however, may find other compelling options, according to Gamergen.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nous AVONS TESTE le PSVR 2 sur PC ! - UNBOXING Test Impressions GAMEPLAY Half Life Alyx Adaptateur" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p4035mJVWe0?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It's great to hear the PlayStation VR2 works well on PC. The introduction of compatibility with the most common VR gaming platform and its recent price drop may breathe new life into the headset, which isn't getting supported by Sony as much as it should have. You can learn more about the headset by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-vr2-headset-one-cord-to-rule-them-all/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>With a pricetag befitting of next-generation hardware, the PlayStation VR2 headset offers a virtual reality experience that's unique to the PlayStation 5 ecosystem. Only time will tell if the new technology is worth the investment but all of the design changes and new features make me excited for what's to come in the future for PlayStation VR2.</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/earth-defense-force-6-review.942927/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/02/earth-defense-force-6-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>The Earth Defense Force series has always embraced the inherit silliness of its alien-blasting premise – any action game that prioritises singing alongside gunplay, definitely doesn’t take itself too seriously. For EDF 6, that embrace has become an aggressive yet surprisingly tender cuddle, and it is, without doubt, the most bombastically bonkers and brilliant EDF yet.</p>
<p><iframe title="Earth Defense Force 6 - Launch Trailer PS5/PS4/PC" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XVUhQ9lHkss?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>For those who have never played an EDF game before, the set-up is simple enough. You and your team of fellow players (four players online or two via local split-screen) must shoot your way through each level from a third-person perspective, clearing the mountains, cityscapes, and fields of their alien invaders. Foes are many and varied, from hordes of giant ants to armoured gun-toting anthropomorphic frogs and swarms of deadly flying drones. Levels are fairly small environments and can be played in no more than fifteen minutes, ensuring the pace of the game is fast, frenetic, and highly addictive, not least because the combat is completely over-the-top explosive madness. Let’s face it, blowing an alien soldier through the side of a building with an enormous rocket and then seeing the rubble to collapse on their prone form will always be a delight.</p>


<p>There are four different player characters to choose from: an all-purpose Ranger, a flying jet-pack equipped Wing-Diver, a support-calling Air Raider, and a heavily armed and armoured Fencer. There have been a few tweaks made to each class, though nothing earth-shaking. Rangers continue to be the best all-rounder, their ability to deploy more vehicles to drive is a welcome addition. Wing-Divers meanwhile have a far more generous energy meter from the offset, allowing the player to fly to the top of a tower and rain down laser beam hell on the enemy below. Air-Raiders now utilise drones to deploy most of their attacks, ensuring a huge amount of weapon and item variety for players prepared to take on the challenge of not using any proper guns. Finally, Fencers remain reliable in their four weapons totting combo, though with a notable improvement in manoeuvrability. In short, it’s the same set of characters that you know and love, just slightly better.</p>


<p>There are literally hundreds of weapons to choose from, giving almost impossible amounts of variety. Laser guns, grenades, bazookas, missile launchers, mech suits, EDF 6 has it all. &nbsp;Of course, this being an EDF game, far too many of them are utter pants and will only ever be used once before being discarded for a trusty shotgun. The trial-and-error approach is all part of the fun, as is bringing completely the wrong weapon for a level and being unable to kill any aliens – levels with unexpected flying creatures, I’m looking at you. Still, does it make me sound weird to say that I like all that stuff? That all this clunkiness adds to the very particular charm of an EDF game?</p>
<p>In fact, a huge part of the charm of Earth Defense Force is its slightly shonky quality. Whilst EDF 6 certainly makes the most of its generational leap – the armies of enemies you face are vast and screen-filling in their numbers and the draw-distance goes for miles – it also retains the ramshackle look that so appeals to the franchise’s ardent fanbase. Take the graphical detail as an example, though the visuals are far more polished, a few frames of animation are still missing from each player character and enemy model, keeping the B-movie-inspired aesthetic from previous games.</p>

<p>That’s not to say that a whole host of improvements haven’t been made elsewhere, because they have. Vehicles, the bane of a player’s existence in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/12/10/earth-defense-force-5-review/">EDF 5</a>, have been drastically improved. It may not sound like much to those who aren’t devoted members of the force, but bikes, tanks, and helicopters are now actually controllable. In the last game, daring to clamber atop a motorbike would be met with shame-faced hilarity as you immediately skidded out of control and embedded yourself in a skyscraper. Meanwhile, helicopters would crash as soon as you even thought about steering them. In EDF 6 all these problems have been fixed, and I delighted in zooming around on my bike like an extra from Akira, shredding giant spiders with my twin machine guns before pirouetting away to make my escape in a cloud of dust. It’s glorious!</p>
<p>Player control has been sorted out too, with your avatar happily, and automatically, clambering over any obstacles they encounter, rendering those many moments your hulking soldier was trapped behind a particularly prominent piece of pavement a thing of the past.</p>

<p>Talking of the past, the time-travel-based Terminator 2-like plot is surprisingly decent and cram-packed with plenty of twists and turns. Sure, it is utter nonsense, but it is oddly compelling nonsense. However, it’s likely to be more meaningful to those who have played through EDF 5, for which EDF 6 is a direct continuation.</p>
<p>This direct sequel approach has given developer Sandlot a decent excuse to revisit levels and reuse art assets from the last game. Swathes of levels are lifted directly from EDF 5, though this time there are time-traveling aliens altering the time-space continuum to contend with. A level that you had previously played to death is suddenly turned on its head when enormous grenade-totting androids turn up. It has led to what is the biggest EDF yet,&nbsp;and true EDFers already know that 100% completion will involve playing through each level multiple times with every character anyway.</p>

            <p>This week's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/destiny-creators-bungie-lay-off-220-people-and-form-new-studio-within-sony-to-stave-off-financial-ruin">mass layoffs</a> at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny">Destiny</a> studio Bungie were planned out months ago, former employees have told journalist Stephen Totilo at <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/bungies-deep-job-cuts-were-in-the">Game File</a> (paywalled). According to Totilo, Bungie leadership "overstated their studio’s financial prospects to Sony" after the latter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-are-buying-destiny-devs-bungie-for-36-billion">bought Bungie in 2022</a> for $3.6 billion. The latest cuts were necessary to prevent continued losses, says the report, after Bungie missed Sony’s targets following the release of last year’s Lightfall.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>On Wednesday, it emerged that Bungie were laying off 220 people - about 17% of their total workforce - across multiple departments including design, art, narrative, and sound. Additionally, they announced the transfer of a further 155 roles to SIE, with the aim to form a new PlayStation studio working on an “untitled incubation project.”</p>
<p>CEO Pete Parsons <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/newpath">attributed</a> the upheaval to dire financial straits at the studio, mentioning “a broad economic slowdown, a sharp downturn in the games industry,” and “our quality miss with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>: Lightfall”. Although Totilo’s sources point out that the well-received Final Shape actually sold worse than the panned Lightfall, the recent layoffs seemingly have little to do with the Final Shape’s commercial performance either way, and “couldn't be avoided” even if The Final Shape had "blockbuster performance”.</p>
<p>The layoffs sound to be a continuation of the cuts made last October, which saw around 100 staff laid off, including veteran composer Michael Salvatori. The report also suggests that Bungie’s financial troubles existed long before the Sony acquisition, with one former employee saying the "alternate history is insolvency" if the studio weren’t acquired, adding "Destiny is an incredibly expensive game to make.”</p>
<p>As for the future of Destiny 2 itself, Moises Taveras at Kotaku <a href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-3-content-packs-no-expansions-bungie-layoffs-1851611360">paints a picture</a> of a much-diminished on-going timeline for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a>, which is unsurprising given how much critical talent is no longer with the studio.  “There appears to be no certainty that Destiny will even be around in a few years,” writes Taveras, “or that it’s a priority to the studio outside of being a cash cow riddled with microtransactions.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Prison Architect 2 has been indefinitely delayed so publisher Paradox can improve its performance and content.
</p>
<p>
The game was expected to release on 3rd September, but has now been delayed for the third time this year.
</p>
<p>
The news was shared in a statement from Paradox, explaining the team "need more time to improve both the game's performance and its content" as internal reviews and beta test groups highlight these require more work.

<p>

"At this stage, we can't commit to a new release date as we need to re-assess the scope of the work that is needed to be done before the game is release-ready," reads the statement.
</p>
<p>
"Over the next few months, we will focus on improving the game and building a more robust release timeline. This also means we will be limiting our communication with you all until we have a timeline we feel comfortable with.
</p>
<p>
"This decision aligns with our commitment here at Paradox to review and improve the quality of our released content. We are confident that delaying Prison Architect 2 is the best path forward for the game, allowing us more time to deliver a high-quality experience that honours the legacy of Prison Architect."

Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prison-architect-developer-double-eleven-parts-way-with-paradox-after-nine-years-on-series">Paradox parted ways with developer Double Eleven</a> after nine years working on the management series as it "could not find a commercial agreement that worked for both parties".

</p>
<p>
The game was revealed in January this year, promising a "greater degree of player freedom, impactful choices, and inmate simulation". Now, this indefinite delay puts the future of the game into question.
</p>
<p>
Still, as the statement points out, the delay to Prison Architect 2 aligns with Paradox's commitment to improve its output. Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-ceo-admits-it-made-the-wrong-calls-in-several-projects-following-cancellation-of-life-by-you">CEO Fredrol Wester admitted the company had "made the wrong calls in several projects"</a> following the cancellation of its The Sims competitor Life By You.

</p>
<p>
The publisher appears to be in troubled times, with this Prison Architect 2 delay adding to other disappointments, including the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-fans-complain-of-performance-woes-after-developer-admits-it-missed-target">poor performance of Cities: Skylines 2</a> at launch and its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-publisher-refunds-dlc-and-admits-we-let-you-down">refunded DLC</a>, and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-declares-pulp-strategy-the-lamplighters-league-a-22m-flop">commercial failure of The Lamplighters' League</a>.

            <p>
Bungie is no longer working on Payback, a new project set in the Destiny universe once overseen by franchise bosses Luke Smith and Mark Noseworthy.
</p>
<p>
That's according to reporting by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-layoffs-include-senior-execs-luke-smith-and-mark-noseworthy/1100-6525488/">Gamespot</a>'s Tamoor Hussain, Giant Bomb's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yszLbBLdM3Y">Jeff Grubb</a> and Bloomberg's <a href="https://x.com/jasonschreier/status/1819075149360185737">Jason Schreier</a>, who all state that Smith and Noseworthy are also now no longer at Bungie.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-3-discussion-swirls-following-accurate-expansion-leak">Details of Payback leaked online back in April</a>, when it was described as "Destiny 3". There were questions at the time over whether the project was still in development. Now, Schreier has confirmed that Payback was more of a spin-off, and was cancelled "a while ago". 
</p>
<p>
According to the previously-leaked details on Payback, the game would have shaken up the Destiny franchise by moving away from a class-based character system. Its name was allegedly a reference to "Bungie getting payback against themselves by creating something they hope everyone will love".
</p>
<p>
Smith and Noseworthy's departures appear linked to the cancellation of Payback, ahead of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-developer-bungie-lays-off-220-staff-roughly-17-percent-of-workforce">latest round of layoffs which hit Bungie this week</a>, when 220 jobs were lost. Gamespot sources said executive restructuring meant the pair had "no path forward at Bungie".
</p>
<p>
Both Smith and Noseworthy were Bungie veterans, with the former at the company since 2007. The pair worked closely together on building the Destiny franchise, perhaps memorably on the excellent Taken King expansion. Their departures now further confuse the picture of what Bungie plans to do with Destiny next, following the launch of climactic expansion The Final Shape earlier this year.
</p>
<p>Reporting last night by GameFile claimed that Bungie leadership reportedly "overstated" its own financial prospects to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-developer-bungie-lays-off-220-staff-roughly-17-percent-of-workforce">Sony, which bought Bungie in 2022 for $3.6bn</a>, leading to the need for this year's brutal layoffs. </p>
<p>Staff have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inexcusable-current-and-former-bungie-employees-react-to-sweeping-layoffs">roundly criticised Bungie boss Pete Parsons for the job losses</a>, while affected employees have been speaking out - including <a href="https://x.com/TheRealLexuzi/status/1818699387809529898">one woman made redundant on the eve of her maternity leave</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>"These decisions have challenged me to my core, and this is the hardest thing I've done in my career."</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Intel is cutting 15,000 jobs as part of a swathe of "significant actions to reduce costs" and save $10m in 2025.</p>
<p>CEO Pat Gelsinger said those 15,000 jobs represent 15 percent of its global workforce and come after the computing megacorp reported no profits from the last financial quarter.</p>
<p>Other cost-cutting exercises to make "Intel a leaner, simpler and more agile company" include reducing operating costs, simplifying its portfolio, eliminating complexity, reducing capital, suspending its dividend, and maintaining growth investments.</p>

<p>In a statement, Gelsinger pointed out that four years ago – at the height of the pandemic – Intel's annual revenue was $24bn higher than it is today, despite its workforce swelling by 10 percent across the same period.</p>
<p>"This is painful news for me to share. I know it will be even more difficult for you to read. This is an incredibly hard day for Intel as we are making some of the most consequential changes in our company’s history," Gelsinger said.</p>
<p>"These decisions have challenged me to my core, and this is the hardest thing I’ve done in my career. My pledge to you is that we will prioritise a culture of honesty, transparency and respect in the weeks and months to come."</p>
<p>As part of its efforts to save money, the company will also enhance its retirement and voluntary exit procedures in a bid to reduce its headcount.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-developer-bungie-lays-off-220-staff-roughly-17-percent-of-workforce">Destiny developer Bungie laid off another 220 staff</a>, representing roughly 17 percent of the studio's workforce. Another 155+ staff are being moved to roles within Sony Interactive Entertainment.</p>
<p>In October last year, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2-developer-bungie-latest-playstation-studio-to-be-hit-by-layoffs">studio laid off 100 staff</a> from its then 1200-strong workforce. That means Bungie has laid off around a quarter of its workforce in the past nine months.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Can it still become Nintendo's top console?</p>

            <p>
Nintendo's sales for Switch hardware and software have seen big declines as the console nears the end of its life.
</p>
<p>
In its latest earnings report, Nintendo stated a 46.3 percent decline year-on-year of console sales, while software has declined 41.3 percent year-on-year.
</p>
<p>
However, this is largely due to the huge success Nintendo had in 2023. The release of The Super Mario Bros. Movie "energised" game sales, while the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> boosted both software and hardware sales.

</figure>
<p>

"There were no such special factors in the first quarter of this fiscal year, and with Nintendo Switch now in its eighth year since launch, unit sales of both hardware and software decreased significantly year-on year," reads the report.
</p>
<p>
There has still been some success this quarter, however, with both Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door and Luigi's Mansion 2 HD reaching over a million sales: 1.76m units and 1.19m units respectively. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/princess-peach-showtime-review">Princess Peach: Showtime!</a>, meanwhile, has sold over 1.3m units since its release in March.
</p>
<p>
Switch lifetime sales now stand at 143.42m units, rising from 141.32m units in its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-forecasts-switch-will-overtake-nintendo-ds-this-year-becoming-companys-best-selling-platform">previous report</a>. Nintendo's forecast remains unchanged, with an expected 13.5m units sold this financial year to make the Switch its highest selling console ever over the Nintendo DS's 154.02m units.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo also reiterated its release schedule for the remainder of the year, to aid console sales and reach that forecast.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Emio - The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club - 29th August </li>
<li>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom - 26th September</li>
<li>Super Mario Party Jamboree - 17th October </li>
<li>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership - 7th November</li>
<li>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD - 16th January 2025</li>
</ul>

<p>
There is no mention in this report of the Switch's successor, though Nintendo is expected to announce <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> at some point before the financial year ends on 1st April 2025.

			<p>Fans have decided to develop the Bloodborne remaster that Sony doesn't seem interested in making ahead of the game, becoming playable on PC via emulation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@fromsoftserve" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fromsoftserve</a>, a well-known Souls series modder, revealed a few days ago that they are working on a Bloodborne visual overhaul mod that will bring upscaled textures, dynamic shadows, better reflections, and more. In the video below, the modder explains why they are developing this mod while showing how they are going about improving Central Yarnham.</p>
<p><iframe title="I'm making a Bloodborne visual overhaul mod and here's why" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aI3lXJuRXt4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While it may be a little early to develop a visual overhaul mod for a game that cannot be emulated properly, the day Bloodborne will become playable on PC is getting closer and closer. As reported on X/Twitter by <a href="https://x.com/Pirat_Nation/status/1818920762310275520/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pirat_Nation</a>, the shadPS4 emulator, which has been making some <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadps4-red-dead-redemption-playable/">amazing progress lately</a>, is now capable of getting in-game in Dark Souls Remastered, which is powered by the same engine that powers Bloodborne. It may still be months or even years away, but it's looking more and more likely that the popular PlayStation 4 exclusive will eventually become playable on PC, with some of its most glaring technical issues fixed as well.</p>
<p>As of now, the only way to play Bloodborne is on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5. Those with a jailbroken console can also install the <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-60-fps-patch-released/">unofficial 60 FPS patch</a> that was released online a while back.</p>

<p>Nintendo has announced that the popular GBA title Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team will arrive for Switch on August 9. Nintendo Switch Online and Expansion members will have access to this title.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team is a game in which players wake up in the world of Pokemon as Pokemon themselves. They must figure out why they have been turned into this creature while befriending other Pokemon and beating ever-changing dungeons. Additionally, all Pokemon aren’t your friends, so watch out for some strong ones while you search for the dungeon’s treasures.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-better-visuals-on-nintendo-switch">Better Visuals on Nintendo Switch</h2>



<p>The Nintendo Switch version of Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team is an enhanced reimagination of the GBA title and of Nintendo DS’ Blue Rescue Team. The game has received a visual upgrade for the Nintendo Switch, allowing you to experience the title with more fidelity on TV, tabletop, or handheld modes.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-new-gameplay-features-for-nintendo-switch">New Gameplay Features for Nintendo Switch</h2>



<p>Moreover, the Nintendo Switch version introduces new gameplay features that enhance the gaming experience for Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team. For instance, Auto Mode allows players to progress through their journey more efficiently, with their team moving automatically with just a press of the ‘L’ button. This feature is handy when exploring dungeons, as it automatically shuts off when enemies are near, allowing for strategic gameplay. Another new feature, Unleashing Best Moves, will enable players to unleash their Pokemon’s best moves by pressing the ‘A’ button.</p>



<h2 id="h-other-new-features">Other New Features</h2>



<p>Furthermore, the Switch version introduces a new feature that allows players to make more Pokemon friends and get help when they faint. In the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team, players could have a maximum of 3 members in their party. However, with the Switch version, players can add the Pokemon they encounter in a dungeon to their team, increasing the max cap to 8 team members. If a player faints, other players can rescue them, or they can rescue themselves using one of their rescue teams.</p>



<p>In other news, Nintendo’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-mega-multiplayer-festival-offers-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mega Multiplayer Sale</a> is now live. Also, the court sentenced the man who threatened Nintendo<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/man-threatening-nintendo-receives-one-year-prison-sentence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> to one year in prison</a>.

            <p>
Nailgun-toting FEAR-meets-GZDoom <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/selaco">Selaco</a> is now Steam Deck Verified, allowing you to either impress or appal fellow train commuters with your knack for pixel splatter. That's not all: developers Altered Orbit Studios have outlined planned features for the next round of updates. They include backpacks that considerately replenish your weapons, fresh story material, a tune-up for the enemy AI in the game's second chapter, and a "Randomizer" system that scrambles spawns and pick-ups while introducing weapon rarities, for beaucoup replay value.  
</p><!--more-->
<p>
"Getting the Steam Deck to behave according to Valve's quality expectations on GZDoom took a good amount of hard work, but we managed to get it done in the end," the devs write in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/?emclan=103582791469846912&amp;emgid=4374768959778727710">a Steam blog</a>. Selaco won't get an official early access roadmap, the post adds, because Altered Orbit regard such things as detrimental. "Roadmaps tend to have a negative effect on development/work. Experimentation with new ideas takes time, while roadmaps are schedule-focused and don't allow for such things. When something is in the works, we will let you know through these posts!"
</p>
<p>
Nonetheless, there's plenty to share right now about future additions. The next significant Selaco update will include backpack reloading, which discreetly tops up any guns you haven't equipped for a while, providing there are bullets to spare. This is an optional convenience for the player prone to absent-mindedly brandishing an empty handcannon at the worst possible moment - you can turn it off in the settings.
</p>
<p>
The update will also rebalance the guns, with automatic weapons in particular due a polish. "The current version on Steam has an oversight where there is a solid chance to roll low damage numbers consecutively, making some automatic weapons feel weaker than they are meant to be," the devs note. They're also going to remove and replace the system whereby enemies were less easy to stagger on higher difficulties, as this has simply made some weapons less useful. Beyond that, expect new visual and audio effects and map interactables, performance boosts and quality-of-life adjustments such as "a DMR that respects your hold/toggle setting".
</p>
<p>
Further afield, Altered Orbit are planning "a major voice-over pass to flesh out Dawn as a character, the world of Selaco and the general plot" for end of the year. They're working on AI improvements, including "better Patrol modes, a goal system, [and a] cover system". They're also looking at letting players adjust the difficulty mid-campaign, together with the ability to customise mutators (these being campaign modifers such as enemies having faster projectile speed).
</p>
<p>
Safe rooms will eventually become "more interesting and useful" with free one-time health caches and an armor shop. And then there's Randomizer, slated to drop alongside the major voice-over pass at end of 2024, which "randomizes enemy spawns, introduces a Rarity System where some weapons and enemies are more powerful than usual, repositions ammo pickups and offers tons of customization to tweak the game to your liking."
</p>
<p>
The enemy AI improvements and various other features should arrive as part of the game's Chapter 2, which is "coming along nicely". I've yet to play Selaco but this certainly sounds like an early access project that's hitting its stride. In our launch day <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/selaco-early-access-review">Selaco review</a> from June, resident RPS triggerman Ed Thorn hailed it as "a wonderful balance between tactical and frenetic, with intricate maps and immersive sim tomfoolery that'll delight and potentially frustrate".

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/fellowship-is-a-co-op-multiplayer-game-focused-on-mmo-like-dungeon-runs/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, publisher Arc Games announced a new co-op multiplayer game called Fellowship. Developed by newly established studio Chief Rebel (composed of industry veterans who worked on World of Warcraft, Diablo, Helldivers, Battlefield, The Division, Just Cause, and more), Fellowship is described by the team as a 'MODA': a multiplayer online dungeon adventure. Effectively, it is focused on MMO-like dungeon runs, cutting all the space in-between that type of content.</p>
<p>Axel Lindberg, CEO and Game Director at Chief Rebel, said:</p>
<p><em>We're very excited to introduce Fellowship, a passion project that we’ve been working on for a long time since we formed Chief Rebel. With Fellowship, we took inspiration from many games that we love to create a dungeon adventure that lets players jump right into the best part of MMOs and ARPGs, end-game dungeons, right from the start with ease. Fellowship will be a constantly evolving adventure and we want players of it from the very beginning, so we can’t wait for players to join us for our Closed Alpha playtest!</em></p>
<p>Yoon Im, CEO of Arc Games, stated:</p>
<p><em>Fellowship marks the beginning of a new genre that aims to modernize the traditional MMO gameplay experience, making it a potential game changer in our industry. We are thrilled to leverage our extensive online multiplayer and MMO expertise to support Chief Rebel on this ambitious new video game. The Closed Alpha test is just the beginning for Fellowship, as we have a lot of incredible content and features to unveil as we look toward a PC launch next year.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Fellowship | Official Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lxmwWiKew20?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As you'd expect, the so-called Holy Trinity (Tank, Healer, and DPS) of roles is in full display here. According to Chief Rebel, the dungeon runs will be 'endlessly scaling'. Also, unlike regular MMOs, players will choose from established heroes. In the Closed Alpha playtest due to take place between August 15 and 21, players will be able to choose between six heroes (two Tank, two DPS, and two Healers).</p>
<p>Dungeon runs will be divided into Adventure and Ranked. The former will be a bite-sized experience that lasts 10 to 15 minutes, whereas Ranked dungeons last 30 minutes and also register the results on a competitive leaderboard.</p>
<p>You may register for the Closed Alpha playtest on the official <a href="https://www.playfellowship.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website</a>.</p>

            <p>Obsidian's first-person action-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> Avowed is one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-75-most-anticipated-pc-games-of-2024">75 most anticipated games of 2024</a>, but according to a report, it's been booted back into early 2025 to avoid a "very busy period" on Microsoft's Game Pass subscription service. Thanks, Microsoft. Do you know how long it took to cobble together that 2024 list? I still get hand cramps.</p><!--more-->
<p>The report in question is from The Verge's Tom Warren - as sturdy a source as they come. Writing on his <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/1/24211199/microsoft-teams-new-ui-chat-xbox-employees-studio-d-notepad">Notepad blog</a> (paywall), Warren claimed that Avowed is in "good shape", and that the delay is "more a matter of wanting to give the game breathing room during a very busy period for Xbox Game Pass".</p>
<p>Obsidian <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/obsidian-accidentally-reveals-an-avowed-release-date-before-deleting-it">accidentally let slip a 12th November release date for Avowed</a> in June in a developer blog. On Game Pass, that would have put it up against Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 (19th November) and the much-delayed post-apocalyptic shooter Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl (20th November). I'm not convinced that qualifies as a "very busy period".</p>
<p>Outside Game Pass, it would have to reckon with Assassin's Creed Shadows (15th November) and, perhaps most worryingly for Obsidian, BioWare's Dragon Age: The Veilguard (not dated yet, but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-wont-arrive-before-october-1st">due to land in EA's third quarter 2024</a>, after 1st October).</p>
<p>Avowed could probably do with a bit of distance from anything comparably bulky and shiny with "action" or "RPG" in the job description. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/more-avowed-details-its-a-classless-rpg-with-easy-respeccing-and-open-zones-comparable-to-outer-worlds">A classless RPG with easy respeccing and "open zones"</a>, once pitched as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/avowed-was-originally-pitched-as-obsidians-take-on-skyrim">Obsidian's Skyrim</a>, it still feels to me like it's trudging through a No Man's Land between Obsidian's prior Pillars Of Eternity CRPGs, which are set in the same universe, and the more recent first-person Outer Worlds.</p>
<p>As with all current fantasy RPGs, it must also reckon with (perhaps unfair) expectations created by last year's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-class-list">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, whose spell and ability combos knock what I've seen of Avowed's combat alchemy into a cocked hat. I do like the looks of the game, but I'm not exhilarated.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As we approach the final fixtures for Rainbow Six Siege’s category at the Esports World Cup, we’re preparing to soak up some <strong>intense </strong>matches. This weekend, the grand final will take place, but before then, six more teams will be eliminated. As Rainbow Six Siege is so popular as an esports game, it has found a prestigious spot at the Esports World Cup, and there’s a massive $750,000 prize waiting for the number-one team.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-everything-to-play-for">Everything to Play For</h2>



<p>It has been a phenomenal event thus far. In the opening stages, we saw some teams suffer immeasurably at the hands of heartbreak, particularly those from the United Kingdom, with Into the Breach and Wolves Esports falling short of qualifying for the latter stages. Wolves took up the bottom-most place in the tournament, ending up in sixteenth after failing to secure a single win during the group stage.</p>



<p>The frontrunners have now been established, though. Both FaZe Clan and DarkZero managed to hang on through intense lower-bracket runs that saw them clinch the final spots in the playoffs, but the likes of Team BDS, Team Liquid, and Spacestation have put on monumental showings thus far.</p>



<p>Here are the opening fixtures for the Rainbow Six playoffs at the Esports World Cup:</p>



<ul>
<li>Team Liquid vs. DarkZero</li>



<li>Bleed vs. w7m Esports</li>



<li>Team BDS vs. FaZe Clan</li>



<li>FURIA vs. Spacestation</li>
</ul>



<p>This round weighs heavily in the favour of the Brazilian teams, and they’ve traditionally been fantastic on the grandest stages in Rainbow Six esports. However, there’s no denying the talents shown by the likes of Spacestation and Team BDS so far this tournament, which means we could see an EU or a North American team crowned the ultimate victor.</p>



<p>The playoffs are due to start today, and by Sunday, we’ll have our winner.</p>

<p>Guild Esports, one of the most prolific organisations in the United Kingdom, has reported deepening financial woes in a recent update. With a warning being issued to shareholders, Guild Esports has advised that the firm has less than £25,000 ($31,000) left on hand. This unfortunate news comes following the revelation that Guild’s share price had bottomed out at a record-low.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-explore-the-options">Explore the Options</h2>



<p>In a statement, Guild Esports’ representatives advised shareholders that it was seeking additional funding to stay afloat:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The company is actively exploring a range of options to meet its short-term liabilities. These include securing additional funding, negotiating improved payment terms with creditors, and further cost reduction initiatives.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Guild Esports has long been represented by David Beckham, who came on board as an investor and an ambassador, appearing in commercials and promotional materials for the brand. Recent reports highlighted that while his share value in the firm has dwindled, he has made bank as an influencer attached to the Guild Esports label.</p>



<p>In the recent financial update, it was revealed that Guild Esports has ‘burned through’ £26 million ($33 million) in just three years, while at the same time ‘only’ pulling in around £14 million in revenue. The organisation hasn’t been the most successful in the esports space, and despite a solid following, it hasn’t managed to grow too big in the industry.</p>



<p>Time will tell what decisions the board will make to right the ship, but for now, it looks as though a major shift in the form of a merger might be the only thing that’ll save Guild.</p>

<p>It was revealed a good while ago that Henry Cavill is taking a starring role in a Warhammer 40,000 film – but since that news was announced, there have been some issues pushing the project forward. In a recent financial update, Games Workshop discussed these blockers, addressing the fact that both GW and Amazon have just six months to agree on creative guidelines before the project is assumedly shut down.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-in-the-air">In The Air</h2>



<p>Back in December, Games Workshop revealed a partnership with Amazon that would last 12 months, during which the two firms would need to decide on creative guidelines for both the Warhammer film <strong>and </strong>a television series. However, one of the tighter stipulations of this contract was that these productions would <strong>only </strong>proceed if agreements could be made. Otherwise, they won’t even make it out of the starting gate.</p>



<p>Speaking on the project a while ago, Henry Cavill, one of the world’s most prolific actors and a lifelong gamer, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I have loved Warhammer since I was boy, making this moment truly special for me. The opportunity to shepherd this cinematic universe from its inception is quite the honor and the responsibility. I couldn’t be more grateful for all the hard work put in by Vertigo, Amazon and Games Workshop to make this happen. One step closer to making a nigh-on lifelong dream come true.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>Thanks to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/games-workshop-and-amazon-have-until-dec-2024-to-agree-creative-guidelines-for-henry-cavills-warhammer-40000-film-and-tv-series-or-they-wont-happen" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a> for the quote</em></p>



<p>Games Workshop has been growing in leaps and bounds in recent months, picking up solid profits and expanding worldwide. The push to produce a Warhammer movie and a television series is a logical one, and partnering with Amazon to get it done is shrewd. Earlier this year, Prime Video saw the arrival of the Fallout TV series, and it became the second-largest launch on the platform <strong>ever</strong>. </p>



<p>Games Workshop advised that they’ll provide an update shortly, but with fewer than six months left to work out the intricacies of the project, some fans are getting itchy…</p>

<p>Konami has just released a financial update covering Q1 FY25 (April 1 – June 30), and the numbers are looking good. In the breakdown, it was revealed that the company reached record-breaking peaks in this opening quarter of FY25, with sales being boosted by up to 24% year-over-year. </p>



<p>Speaking to what’s coming next, Konami outlined the road ahead, detailing the top-tier titles coming as part of a hefty content roadmap that includes some real heavy hitters.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-konami-on-top">Konami On Top</h2>



<p>In the financial update, the firm revealed that digital sales were up 33.4% year-on-year, with special praise being given to eFootball 2024 as a leader in the space. The Japanese titan also confirmed that the 25th-anniversary celebrations of Yu-Gi-Oh! have been remarkably well received, and the sale of merchandise is continuing in earnest. </p>



<p>This diversification will continue to be driven by the firm going forward. In a segment of the financial update, <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/999/G999905/20240801046/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Konami reiterated</a> what’s on the horizon, including the remake of Silent Hill 2 (coming October 8) and the launch of an all-new title, CYGNI, on August 6. The latter title is a side-scrolling shooter that aims to bring the somewhat antiquated genre into the modern age.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, Konami is still preparing to release the likes of:</p>



<ul>
<li>Suikoden I&amp;II HD Remaster</li>



<li><strong>Metal Gear Solid Delta</strong></li>



<li>Silent Hill f</li>



<li>Silent Hill: Townfall</li>
</ul>



<p>There are some busy days ahead for Konami, but the future is looking bright.</p>

<p>As Gamescom kicks off in Cologne later this month, Sid Meier’s Civilization VII will be revealed in much greater depth, with the team at Firaxis showing off 20 minutes of gameplay in a deep-dive breakdown. It has only been a few weeks since Civ VII was announced, but the team is eager to debut a lengthy gameplay trailer at Gamescom’s Opening Night Live ceremony to stoke the hype train a little more.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-but-that-s-not-all">But That’s Not All</h2>



<p>The Firaxis team also confirmed that Civilization VII will be playable during the week that Gamescom is hosted in Cologne. From August 21 to 25, attendees will be able to give the game a try.</p>



<p>As Insider Gaming will be on-site at Gamescom, you can bet your last dollar we’ll be giving the game a go.</p>



<p>Here’s <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/289070/announcements/detail/4362384060804271093" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a blurb from Firaxis</a> talking about the upcoming release of the gameplay trailer:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Civilization&nbsp;is a game that is as wide as it is deep, covering the span of human history as you build your empire piece by piece in the attempt to stand the test of time. We know many of you love getting into the details, and we do too – that’s why we’re going all-out for the gameplay reveal coming later this month.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Following Gamescom, Civilization VII will head to PAX West in Seattle, complete with a full-fledged developer panel breaking down everything you need to know about the game. If you’re not already in the know, Civilization is one of the oldest strategy-slash-city-building franchises in existence – and one of the longest-running video game series still going today. It debuted in 1991 and is still going strong as we speak.</p>



<p>Put that in your calendar – on August 20, all will be revealed.</p>

As you roam the realm and fend off attackers, you will encounter various nations and leaders vying for your attention, and it is up to each player to weigh up which force can truly be trusted to fight by their side.</p><p dir="ltr">From allying with the holy Papal states of Rodinia, one of the oldest theocratic regimes on the continent, to drawing up a treaty with the Union of the Knights' States – a national coalition made up of 13 powerful military states – each new ally you declare will have an impact on both your town and the land, bringing a new host of narrative consequences. Can you trust the ancient religious powers to bring peace to the land? Or will long-set corruption be their downfall?</p><p dir="ltr">In a nice touch, individual decisions affect the evolution of your town and how your tale unfolds, adding a welcome layer of dynamism and player agency to Sword of Convallaria’s rich and winding storyline.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4336420-swordofconvallariaimage1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4336420" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4336420-swordofconvallariaimage1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4336420"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4336420-swordofconvallariaimage1.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr">Declare your allegiance</h3><p dir="ltr">No matter how much you grow to love the story, you can only hope to reign victorious with the right allies by your side. Unlike in many games in the genre, Sword Of Convallaria’s tactics don’t just extend to the battlefield. As you journey through Iria, a mineral-rich country whose magical resources have drawn unwanted attention from dangerous external factions, you will need to form alliances with other formidable powers to keep your town safe.</p><p dir="ltr">In Sword of Convallaria, the world is shaped by your choices, with your actions determining the fate of Iria and its loyal citizens. Placed in the leather boots of a rising mercenary leader, it’s up to players to win over hearts and minds across the land with both their words and their swords. While you can recruit individual party members by plying them with ale at local taverns, it’s the more weighty factional alliances that will truly help you to turn the tide of war.</p><p dir="ltr">As you recruit and train a roster of lovable and roguish mercenaries, you will find yourself toiling over each agonizing narrative-affecting decision as you attempt to save the great nation of Iria from invading forces.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4336419-swordofconvallariaimage2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4336419" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4336419-swordofconvallariaimage2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4336419"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4336419-swordofconvallariaimage2.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr">Reign Supreme on the battlefield</h3><p dir="ltr">Victory in Convallaria is earned through employing clever strategies throughout engrossing ‘hardcore combat.’ In classic tactical RPG fashion, battles in Sword of Convallaria are fought via turn-based grid-set skirmishes. While the game follows the genre’s traditional ‘rock, paper, scissors’ approach to resistances and weaknesses, there is a unique twist to proceedings that decides which unit acts first. In Sword Of Convallaria, speed is king, with units acting first according to their agility stats, allowing swift units like archers and rogues to seize key strategic locations on the battlefields before their slower opponents.</p><p dir="ltr">It’s not simply speed and might that wins battles here, but cunning, too. In Sword of Convallaria, you can turn the battlefield itself to your advantage, making use of the environment around you to fell even the most fearsome foes. Unlike many tactical RPGs, here the world around you isn’t just set dressing, but another piece of the puzzle to leverage. By cleverly utilizing terrain advantages and objects like wooden crates, gunpowder barrels, and boulders, players can position units on platforms, obstruct enemies, and even outmaneuver unsuspecting foes.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, it’s not all down to the battlefield: preparation is also key to ensuring that your army has a fighting chance. Equipping different gear and raising each unit’s stats at taverns between battles is key to building a fearsome legion, with the latest and greatest gear ensuring that you will strike fear into the hearts of your enemies.</p><p dir="ltr">There you have it. Launching on PC, Android, and iOS on July 31st, this thoughtfully-made tactical RPG looks set to be a modern love letter to a much revered classic genre. Sword of Convallaria looks set to inject the genre with a captivating tale of tactics, twists, and turn-based brilliance.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://soc.xd.com/#/?shortlink=yoe4d8r6&amp;c=Native%20Article&amp;pid=Fandom&amp;source_caller=bulk" rel="nofollow ">Click here to download the game now.</a></p>

                <p>Nintendo will soon be adding another beloved Pokemon game to Switch's classic games catalog. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-mystery-dungeon-rescue-team/" data-ref-id="5000-25025">Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team</a> is coming to the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack service on August 9.</p><p>Originally released for Game Boy Advance back in 2006, Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team is a roguelike that casts players in the role of a human who has mysteriously turned into a Pokemon. After meeting a partner Pokemon and establishing a rescue team together, players explore dungeons and embark on various missions to help other Pokemon out and unravel the mystery of their transformation.</p><p>Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team was originally released alongside a Blue Rescue Team version for the Nintendo DS. The two games were remade for Nintendo Switch in 2020 as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-mystery-dungeon-rescue-team-dx-coming-to-s/1100-6472626/" data-ref-id="1100-6472626">Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Rescue Team DX</a>.</p><p>Once it drops, Pokemon Mystery Dungeon will be available through Nintendo Switch Online's Expansion Pack plan. This premium tier of the service includes all of the benefits of the base plan along with access to select Nintendo Switch DLC and a library of classic Nintendo 64, Game Boy Advance, and Sega Genesis games.</p><p>A base Nintendo Switch Online subscription costs $20 USD a year, while an Expansion Pack membership costs $50 USD a year. Nintendo also offers an annual family plan for $80 that covers up to eight Nintendo Accounts, even across multiple systems.</p>

And<a href="https://www.kotaku.com.au/2024/05/gamestops-meme-stock-explodes-again-after-youtuber-roaring-kitty-returns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> like its parent company</a>, EB Games is resorting to some really fuckin weird ways to try to stay in business.</p><p>Such as EB World PLUS, a new premium membership program that is asking people to pay AUD$49 a year to get a ramen bowl, a 5% discount off digital purchases (including most digital currencies and gift cards) and, best of all, a "buy 10 get one free" deal on all clothing.</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>INTRODUCING 📣 EB World PLUS!</p><p>Get more out of your EB World membership with amazing awards and benefits including free gifts, extra trade value, and MORE!

And like a battle pass in a game, it leaves free-to-play grinders who have spent years earning loyalty rewards as part of EB World (the chain's longstanding regular membership program) in the dust.</p><p>Even if you weren't an existing member, it's a stupid idea, and was instantly treated as such by the Australian gaming public, who flooded the replies of the announcement tweet with so many variations of "Yikes hard pass for me lol" and "This is the worst thing I've ever seen from you guys" that EB Games locked the thread down, leaving that initial wave of hostility frozen in amber forever, a fitting testament to a company and social media team that wrote the words "BUY 10 GET 1 FREE CLOTHING" and said yup, great idea, the kids will love this.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Luke Smith and Mark Noseworthy, two senior executives at Bungie, were both part of the recent round of layoffs, according to a new report. Speaking on his Game Mess Decides <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yszLbBLdM3Y" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">podcast</a>, Jeff Grubb confirmed that the duo were working on Payback, a new game set in the Destiny universe, but were let go as part of sweeping job losses at the now PlayStation-owned studio.</p><p>"[Smith and Noseworthy] were labelled as working on Payback. It was going to be the next big thing for Destiny, but not Destiny 3," Grubb said. "Luke Smith and Mark Noseworthy are no longer at Bungie. They were let go. They were caught in the executive and leadership shakeup mentioned in the blogpost. Payback has been shelved."</p><p><strong>[Update]</strong> Sources have clarified that Smith and Noseworthy's departure came as the Payback project was shut down, after which executive restructuring meant they had no path forward at Bungie. </p><p>Smith was executive director at Bungie and became a notable public-facing representative for the studio, having guided Destiny 2's narrative back to a place that excited fans and more clearly set up a long-term story for the sci-fi shooter. Noseworthy, meanwhile, was vice president of the Destiny universe and responsible for the overall strategy of Destiny as an intellectual property and a business.</p><p>GameSpot has contacted Bungie for a statement.</p><p>On July 31, Bungie executive <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-announces-mass-layoffs-less-than-two-months-after-destiny-2-the-final-shapes-launch/1100-6525438/#:~:text=In%20a%20blog%20post%2C%20Bungie,affecting%20more%20than%20100%20people." data-ref-id="1100-6525438">Pete Parsons confirmed the company is cutting around 220 people</a> from several departments. This number represents 17% of its workforce. A further 150 people are reportedly being moved around Sony Interactive Entertainment.</p><p>"Due to rising costs of development and industry shifts as well as enduring economic conditions, it has become clear that we need to make substantial changes to our cost structure and focus development efforts entirely on Destiny and Marathon," Parsons said. He also indicated that layoffs at "every level" of Bungie and that "most" of Bungie's executive or senior leader positions are impacted.</p><p>As part of the layoff announcement, it was also confirmed that Bungie is working on a brand-new game, but it is not Destiny 3 or Payback. Instead, this new sci-fi project will be developed at a new internal studio being set up within PlayStation.</p><p>The layoffs follow the release of Destiny 2's The Final Shape expansion, which was very positively received by fans. Although Destiny 2 remains one of the most popular games-as-a-service titles on the market, the significant job losses at Bungie have called into question what content players can expect going forward. According to Grubb, the larger expansions that Bungie has traditionally released are unlikely to return and players will instead be given smaller content packs.</p><p>Bungie is also working on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-everything-we-know-about-bungies-extraction-shooter/1100-6514617/" data-ref-id="1100-6514617">new Marathon</a>, which is coming back as an extraction shooter.</p>

                <p>Often cited as the "best deal in gaming," <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-is-getting-a-price-increase-and-introducing-a-new-tier/1100-6524819/" data-ref-id="1100-6524819">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is going up from $17 to $20 a month starting September 12</a>, but if you act fast, the Amazon-owned online retailer Woot is selling discounted <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kqzyfj.com%2Fclick-100770772-13142092%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fdigital-code-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-5&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fxbox-game-pass-ultimate-will-soon-cost-240-year-but-this-deal-drops-it-to-134%2F1100-6525487%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">prepaid Game Pass codes</a> that will save you a hefty chunk on the subscription service.</p><p>With the deal, you can grab a 30-day prepaid Game Pass Ultimate digital code for $13.49 (was $17) or a 90-day code for $36.49 (normally $51 at the Microsoft store). But that's not all--if you use the coupon code <strong>VIDEOGAMES</strong> at checkout, you'll get an extra $3 off your code. The coupon can only be used once, but that extra $3 helps make this one of the best deals on Game Pass you'll find. For comparison, after the price increase next month, three months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate will cost you $60, so this is almost a 50% discount based on the upcoming price hike.</p><p>This is a great deal even if you only grab one 30- or 90-day code, but the discount is a great excuse to load up on a few months worth of Game Pass Ultimate.</p><p>The current discount price works out to $143 for a year, or $435 for three years of Game Pass. When the price increase hits, a full year will cost $240 and three years will cost $720. At the time of writing, you can stack up to 36 months of Game Pass Ultimate in all countries where it's available, and Woot will let you order up to 24 codes (either 30-day or three-month versions) per customer. After September 18, you will only be able to prepay for 13 months of Gamepass. This won't affect any existing stacks that existing subscribers may already have. When the deadline passes in September, several other tiers of Game Pass will increase in price as well.</p><p>Other Game Pass price increases include PC Game Pass increasing from $10 to $12 per month, and the annual price of Xbox Game Pass Core is going from $60 to $75 a year. The $10 monthly subscription price will remain unaffected for that leaner gaming library.
