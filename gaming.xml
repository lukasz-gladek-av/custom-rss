            <p>Original TimeSplitters and GoldenEye developers David Doak and Steve Ellis have reunited to make - oh, those scalliwags, you're going to love this - a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> word puzzler called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/beyond-words">Beyond Words</a>, which is being billed as "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a> meets Scrabble".</p>
<p>That quote is actually from <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/11/balatro-and-scrabble-just-had-a-baby-thanks-to-two-of-the-legends-behind-goldeneye-and-timesplitters">Time Extension</a>, but publishers PQube have reprinted it ecstatically in the announcement release, and well, come on, look at it. Watch the trailer below. If this game wasn't inspired by Balatro, I will eat an actual Scrabble board, mossy green bags and all. Then I will shit a match-winning seven-letter word of mild approval, like "quality". I do like Scrabble, even when it has 300+ modifiers in it and some possibly AI-generated polar bears.</p>

<p>You can find <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3823370/Beyond_Words/">a demo for Beyond Words on Steam</a>. If you click through and play that demo, I will not have to explain the game any further, and can save my precious high-scoring words for other breaking news stories, like whatever the hell Tim Sweeney has said now. But no, I see that you are still reading, because you are too much in thrall to words. Friend, I can only salute your lexophilia. Here is another paragraph, specially for you.</p><p>As in Scrabble, the goal in Beyond Words is to form your hand of letter tiles into high-scoring words. But this ain't the traditional Scrabble layout, with those wily triple-word bonus squares in the far corners. There's a selection of boards, aka "living puzzles". Some of them look like Zelda dungeons after a pinch of nose candy, sprinkled with gold coins and barricades and power-up signs.</p>
<p>This isn't the traditional Scrabble scoring system, either: you can change letter scores, duplicate them and destroy them. You can "bend the rules past breaking point with modifiers, stickers, and enhancements where every choice shapes your journey". There are also time attack challenges, boss battles, seeded runs and "the brain-melting flipside of negative scoring". If you play the demo, please get back to us to confirm whether your brain has melted - I'm quite attached to my brain and would rather not risk it.</p>
<p>Beyond Words is due in early access in early 2026. The Steam page carries the disclosure that "generative AI was one of many tools used by professional artists to assist in the creation of the artwork for the game". I have to write up Sweeney's latest next so I'll save today's torch-waving excoriations about generative AI usage for that post.</p>
<p>The court dutifully acknowledges that this is not the first time somebody's spilled Balatro over Scrabble - there's also <a href="https://playletterlike.com/">Letterlike</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3586660/Word_Play/">Word Play</a>, at the very least. If you'd rather play some kind of first-person shooter with N64 or PS2 graphics, maybe check out loving fangame <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/timesplitters-rewind-the-fanmade-sort-of-remake-project-finally-makes-it-into-early-access-13-years-on">TimeSplitters: Rewind</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dyson-leverages-amazon-to-clear-supersonic-nural-stock-premium-hair-dryer-hits-all-time-low-2000648096</link>
            <guid>1366555</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Dyson has established itself as the definitive innovator in air management technology and it revolutionized everything from vacuum cleaners to air purifiers through engineering approaches that competitors struggle to replicate. Their <strong>hair dryer line applies this same obsessive attention to airflow physics</strong> and creates tools that fundamentally differ from traditional blow dryers in both function and results.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6000/">At $399, down from $549</a>, the Supersonic Nural represents Dyson’s<strong> most advanced hair drying technology</strong> available at a record-low price on Amazon for Black Friday. The package includes <strong>multiple styling attachments</strong> and <strong>premium presentation packaging</strong> that justifies both personal use and gift-giving applications during the holiday season.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6000/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Intelligent Heat Control That Protects Hair Health</h2>
<p>The Nural designation references advanced sensor technology that <strong>measures air temperature 40 times per second</strong>, adjusting heating elements to maintain optimal temperature ranges that prevent heat damage. Traditional hair dryers blast constant high heat that dries hair quickly but causes cumulative damage through protein denaturation and moisture loss that leaves hair brittle and prone to breakage.</p>
<p>The intelligent regulation keeps effectiveness while preserving hair structure, and creates the paradox where faster drying causes less damage than slower methods. The system learns your drying patterns and adjusts automatically and reduces heat when you pause or change angles and ramping up when resuming active drying. This adaptive intelligence transforms the dryer from passive tool into active partner that protects hair health during every use.</p>



<p>The <strong>digital motor V9 spins at 110,000 RPM while weighing just 27 grams</strong> through miniaturization that defies conventional motor engineering. This extreme rotation speed generates the high-velocity airflow that enables fast drying without excessive heat and fundamentally changes the drying equation. The motor positions in the handle rather than the head and creates unprecedented balance that reduces wrist strain during extended styling sessions. Professional stylists and home users both appreciate how the weight distribution enables precise control without arm fatigue that plagues top-heavy conventional dryers.</p>
<p>Air multiplier technology<strong> amplifies the motor’s airflow by 3x through aerodynamic engineering</strong> borrowed from jet engine development, creating focused high-velocity streams that penetrate through hair to the scalp. This concentrated airflow dries from roots to tips efficiently rather than just moving surface moisture around, reducing total drying time substantially. <strong>Thick, long hair that requires 20-30 minutes with conventional dryers often completes in 10-15 minutes</strong>.</p>



<p>The included styling attachments address various hair types and desired outcomes through engineered airflow patterns rather than just changing nozzle shapes: The smoothing nozzle creates a wide, flat airflow perfect for straightening while drying, the styling concentrator provides precision for detailed work and the diffuser distributes air evenly for enhancing natural curls without frizz. The magnetic attachment system enables instant swapping without fumbling with clips or threads, maintaining workflow during styling routines.</p>
<p><strong>Negative ion generation reduces static electricity</strong> that creates flyaway hair and frizz and produces smoother results that require less finishing product. The ions work at the molecular level by neutralizing positive charges that develop during drying, creating hair that lays naturally rather than repelling itself. This chemistry creates visibly different results compared to non-ionic dryers and reduces the styling product dependence that many users accept as necessary for polished appearance.</p>
<p>The<strong> premium packaging and presentation elevate the Supersonic Nural beyond typical appliances into gift-worthy territory</strong> appropriate for milestone occasions. The included storage case protects the dryer and attachments during travel while maintaining organization at home. The build quality through materials selection and assembly precision creates an appliance that feels substantial and durable rather than disposable.</p>
<p>At $399, the Dyson Supersonic Nural is going for 27% below retail this Black Friday. Dyson’s hair dryer represents the company’s air management expertise applied to personal care with results that justify premium pricing through tangible performance and health benefits.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsungs-cleaning-house-on-curved-gaming-monitors-for-black-friday-save-39-2000647717</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Samsung’s Black Friday blowout sale has spread into their top-level gaming monitor section, with a <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4560/">39% Amazon steal of a deal on the 32-inch Odyssey G55C Series QHD 1000R curved gaming monitor</a>. Ultra-low 1ms motion blur, 165Hz of speed, and dazzling QHD resolution of 2560 x 1440 on a high-quality curved screen will make your gaming setup more immersive and realistic for just $200.</p>
<p>This Black Friday deal brings the 27-inch and 32-inch Odyssey G55C Series monitors to the same $200, but the 39%-off deal on the larger model beats the 33%-off deal on the smaller version. Just $200 for a large curved monitor with QHD resolution that has 1.7 times the pixel density of Full HD is a steal, particularly considering how much razor-sharp detail it brings to your gaming.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4560/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Play Longer, Play Better</h2>
<p>The Samsung Odyssey G55C’s huge, sharp screen will make it hard to tear yourself away from your gaming grind, but that’s ok — you can put it into Eye Saver Mode to minimize blue light and reduce eye strain, and it has far less screen flicker, so there’s less irritation and tiring for your eyes.</p>
<p>With that in mind, feel free to take a nice long immersive gaming dive into the Odyssey G55C, and bring the fastest and most detailed console or PC games you can find. The greasy-fast 165Hz refresh rate keeps up with shooters, eSports, role-players, racers, and any other kind of game. The 1ms response time mean minimal blur, and you getting the jump on the rest of the field in the battle royal game.</p>
<p>AMD Radeon FreeSync is built into the Samsung Odyssey G55C, quietly ensuring the monitor and graphics card keep their refresh rates in perfect sync. That’s how the G55C virtually eliminates image tearing and keeps evey the fastest games looking ultra smooth.</p>



<h2>The Curve Has Verve</h2>
<p>Curved monitors have exploded in popularity with gamers in recent years for the added realism they bring to games. The curved monitor brings the action into your peripheral vision with outstanding detail and great speed, so when you get lost in the game, you&nbsp;<em>really</em> get lost in the game.</p>
<p>What sucks you in is the combination of the flawlessly smooth action and peerless color performance, with millions of colors all popping, and deep blacks and bright whites providing outstanding contrast to go with the pixel density and create a superior overall picture. If you’re usig the Odyssey G55C with a PC, it’s an outstanding everyday monitor in addition to being a top-level gaming monitor.</p>
<p>The Samsung Odyssey G55C 32-inch curved monitor was already an Amazon’s Choice before this Black Friday sale, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4560/">now that it’s 39% off to drop the price by over $100 to just $200</a>, it’s one of the best Black Friday gaming deals so far.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Epic Games CEO recently commented on AI disclosure for game stores, stating it makes no sense as it will be involved in almost all future production. </p>



<p>The gaming industry has conflicting views about AI use in development at the moment. Some seem to be for it, with companies like Ubisoft pushing for full-scale AI-driven <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-ai-teammates-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research projects</a>. The Witcher 3 director also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-3-director-calls-dispatch-game-of-the-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spoke about</a> AI in development, stating he doesn’t feel “that games created with only AI will have soul.” Now Tim Sweeney has shared his two cents on AI in game development and store disclosure. </p>







<h2 id="h-epic-games-ceo-says-ai-will-be-involved-in-nearly-all-future-production">Epic Games CEO Says AI Will Be Involved in Nearly All Future Production</h2>



<p>The CEO of Epic Games, Tim Sweeney, recently responded to a comment on <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1993687499621728312" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) that said Steam and other digital marketplaces “need to drop the ‘Made with AI’ label.” Sweeney said that he agrees with that comment, adding that the AI tag is “relevant to art exhibits for authorship disclosure, and to digital content licensing marketplaces where buyers need to understand the rights situation.”</p>



<p>Sweeney added that AI disclosure “makes no sense for game stores, where AI will be involved in nearly all future production.” When another user spoke about customers deserving to know, Sweeney poked fun at those statements, <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1993890431462166818" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">stating</a>, “Why stop at AI use? We could have mandatory disclosures for what shampoo brand the developer uses. Customers deserve to know lol.”</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Why stop at AI use? We could have mandatory disclosures for what shampoo brand the developer uses.

<p>Talking about AI in game development, Activision was recently under fire by the community for using generative AI <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-responds-black-ops-7-ai-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to create their calling cards</a> for Black Ops 7. The controversy received so much attention that it prompted a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-ai-controversy-catches-attention-of-us-congressman-we-need-regulations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">response from US Congressman Ro Khanna</a>. He stated that “we need regulations that prevent companies from using AI to eliminate jobs to extract greater profits.”</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/27/splitgate-2-relaunches-sometime-next-month-exiting-beta-for-the-second-time/</link>
            <guid>1366534</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>1047 Games is going to give it another shot, announcing that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/splitgate-2">Splitgate 2’s</a> beta will come to an end on 4th December, and that the online shooter will then get a full relaunch later in the month – I’d put some money on a launch during The Game Awards, wouldn’t you?</p>
<p>In a simple announcement on Steam, the team writes, “Thank you to everyone who participated in the Splitgate 2 Beta! On December 4th, the Beta Season &amp; active Battle Passes will be ending, alongside your seasonal “rank” progress.”</p>


<p>This will be Splitgate 2’s second launch, following the turbulent aborted release earlier this year. Having launched during Summer Game Fest in a fashion that put a lot of noses out of joint – namely, the studio founder calling out the industry while at the same time announcing a trend-chasing battle royale mode. Combined with a number of gameplay direction changes that didn’t appeal so strongly, and the game floundered, leading to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/22/splitgate-2-goes-back-into-beta-original-splitgate-servers-going-offline-staff-cut/">1047 taking the game back to beta</a> and, more disappointingly, laying a bunch of people off.</p>
<p>So what’s changed? For the final targeted beta weekend 1047 outlined how they’ve adjusted the experience:</p>
<p><em>Since launching the beta in May, this game has majorly transformed. We started with factions and abilities, and we’ve rebuilt the entire foundation around what makes Splitgate special: portals, movement, and pure gunplay.</em></p>

<p><em>Here’s what’s changed. We removed factions entirely and reimagined abilities as power-ups. We brought back classic roundless modes like King of the Hill, Domination, and Team Deathmatch. We added Classic Arena, an even-starts mode that captures the spirit of original Splitgate. We’ve introduced new maps, new weapons, reworked the menus, and refined systems constantly based on your feedback.</em></p>
<p><em>We’ve also added portal overloading and EMPs, fundamentally changing how map control works. We’ve streamlined equipment to improve combat clarity. We’ve tuned our controller feel. We’ve fixed critical bugs and made countless optimizations.</em></p>
<p><em>None of this happens without you. The past six months have been a journey, and every piece of feedback, every playtest participation, every community discussion has shaped where we are now. Splitgate is in the best place it’s ever been, and that’s because you’ve been here with us.</em></p>
<p>It certainly sounds like a major overhaul that gets back to the game and the genre’s roots a bit more. Splitgate 1 launched just before Halo Infinite and was massively popular for just being a bit like Halo’s classic arena shooter style and having a fun portals mechanic.</p>

              <p>Happy Thanksgaming, <em>Kotaku</em> readers! It’s especially happy because, while all the full-time staff are off worshiping a giant effigy of a turkey (I’ve yet to quite figure out what Thanksgiving is), I’m taking advantage of their all-consuming distraction to post as many unknown indie games as I can onto the front page of this popular gaming site. Take <em>that</em>, capitalism!</p> <p>So please dive into this extraordinary list of upcoming or recently released indie games that you almost certainly won’t have heard of before. There’s definitely going to be&nbsp;<em>something</em> that’s in your field of interest, if not a dozen, and the very best thing you can do for yourself and the developers is slap them straight onto your wishlist. The more interest the games receive, the better opportunities come the creators’ way.</p>

 <p>This list is compiled from the hundreds of emails I’ve received <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/botherer.bsky.social/post/3m6ffpsw7os2r">after putting out an appeal to indie devs</a> earlier this week, which I then select at random (with a common sense filter for quality), and then include below. Unless I say so I’ve not played the games mentioned, so I’m not here vouching for their quality. I’m with you all, looking through the intriguing, amazing creativity that’s out there, and doing my best to celebrate it as loudly as possible. (If you like that sort of thing, by the way, do feel free to support my other unknown indies project,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.patreon.com/c/buriedtreasure"><em>Buried Treasure</em></a>!)</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1858950/Steel_Century_Groove/">Steel Century Groove</a></h2>  <p>Developer: Sloth Gloss Games<br> Release Date: Jan 28, 2026<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1858950/Steel_Century_Groove/">Store Page</a></p> <p>I think we can all agree after watching the trailer above that mecha games should&nbsp;<em>always</em> have been about dancing and nothing else. Oh my goodness, what a joyfully silly thing, watching giant robots have dance battles.&nbsp;<em>Steel Century Groove</em> is a rhythm-RPG, featuring both the mecha dance-offs and a bunch of betwixt-battle friendship making and RPG story. There’s a demo now, and the whole game comes out in January.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3842190/Die_or_Die/">Die or Die</a></h2>  <p>Developer: Ao Norte<br> Release Date: 2026<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3842190/Die_or_Die/">Store Page</a></p> <p>Well that doesn’t seem like the best option. Until you realize one of those “Die”s is dice. This is a top-down twin-stick shooter, inspired by <em>Nuclear Throne</em>, where slain enemies and treasures give you dice, used to roll for new abilities and powers, or to gamble against “Bummers” that make the game harder. There’s a demo on Steam to give you a better idea.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2983410/Xenopurge/">Xenopurge</a></h2>  <p>Developer: Traptics<br> Release Date: Out now<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2983410/Xenopurge/">Store Page</a></p> <p>Released just last week,&nbsp;<em>Xenopurge</em> is an auto-battler, but looks unlike any I’ve seen before. Rather than directly controlling some dude in the middle of a battlefield, here you’re indirectly issuing orders from a remote command center, making plans and setting routes on the fly. It sounds like if the original&nbsp;<em>Rainbow Six</em> were a 2D&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors&nbsp;</em>clone, and that’s won me over immediately. Already installing.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3824720/Descent_Of_Lunaris/">Descent of Lunaris</a></h2>  <p>Developer: Unison Games<br> Release Date: 2026<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3824720/Descent_Of_Lunaris/">Store Page</a></p> <p>Oh my gosh, this went so quickly onto my wishlist. The mindset of a classic-style dungeon blobber, but with modern aesthetics and a super-weird Giger-punk vibe. Inspired by&nbsp;<em>Wizardry</em> and&nbsp;<em>Shin Megami Tensei</em>, and it’s all set on the moon. Absolutely thrilled to see if this one comes together.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3742720/Sobakistan_The_Land_of_Dogs/">Sobakistan: The Land of Dogs</a></h2>  <p>Developer: Terletski Games<br> Release Date: 2026<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3742720/Sobakistan_The_Land_of_Dogs/">Store Page</a></p> <p>Why this isn’t called&nbsp;<em>Sobarkistan</em> is upsetting me too much to think about, so let’s distract ourselves by focusing on how this is a parody of a nation emerging from isolated totalitarianism, in which you play through a branching narrative with puzzles, stealth and a bunch of different endings to find. It’s by the creators of the comic on which it’s based, and I am all in for its distinct pixel style.</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1920290/Barkour/">Barkour</a></h2>  <p>Developer: VARSAV GAme Studios<br> Release Date: TBA<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1920290/Barkour/">Store Page</a></p> <p>See, that’s the correct way to name a dog-based game!&nbsp;<em>Barkour</em> is all about being a super-hi-tech dog, in a third-person action game about being a little woofy spy. The trailer looks completely charming, with a lot of stealth, hacking and swinging from rafters, all as a handsome doggo. There’s a demo on its Steam page.</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3492830/Gunlocked_2/">Gunlock 2</a></h2>  <p>Developer: FromLefcourt<br> Release Date: Out now (Early Access)<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3492830/Gunlocked_2/">Store Page</a></p> <p>I missed the original&nbsp;<em>Gunlock</em> in 2022, but I’m very interested to go back and take a look now. It and its new sequel are Amiga-style vertical scrolling shoot ’em ups—think&nbsp;<em>Cyberdyne</em> or <em>Xenon</em>—but with a far more involved ship-building element. Employing more modern roguelite elements, it’s all about customization and careful movement through bullet-hell action. This sequel came out in August this year in Early Access, and is due a big update in the next couple of weeks.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2974540/Night_Machine/">Night Machine</a></h2>  <p>Developer: Cooler Games<br> Release Date: TBA<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2974540/Night_Machine/">Store Page</a></p> <p>That pesky moon of ours turns out to contain a vast alien factory, revealed after our closest neighbor cracked in half. In <em>Night Machine</em> you pilot a craft to the center of the moon-machine with the goal of destroying it, except everything about your ship is controlled via cards. And yes, there’s a deckbuilder for&nbsp;<em>everything</em> now, but this does sound enormously intriguing.</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3406690/Puzzle_Spy_International/">Puzzle Spy International</a></h2>  <p>Developer: Travel-Friendly Cake<br> Release Date: Q1 2026<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3406690/Puzzle_Spy_International/">Store Page</a></p> <p>The trailer for&nbsp;<em>Puzzle Spy International</em> gives me vibes of both&nbsp;<em>Professor Layton</em> and&nbsp;<em>Curse of the Golden Idol</em>, although perhaps without the latter’s intense difficulty. This is about traveling around the the world to catch some naughty diamond thieves, while solving puzzles involving rearranging words and pictures on the screen, and chatting with the locals. The game’s out early next year, but there’s already a demo to check out.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2891370/Pieced_Together/">Pieced Together</a></h2>  <p>Developer: Glowfrog Games<br> Release Date: Q1 2026<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2891370/Pieced_Together/">Store Page</a></p> <p>Talking of rearranging words and pictures on the screen (I swear to god, I pick these at random, and am&nbsp;<em>far</em> too lazy to curate them into some clever order),&nbsp;<em>Pieced Together&nbsp;</em>is a scrapbooking game that explores the nature of friendship as we age. It looks like a warm hug in gaming form, and there’s already a demo on Steam if you wanna see.</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2719850/Super_Spelling_Ducks/">Super Spelling Ducks</a></h2>  <p>Developer: SKYLE Games Ltd<br> Release Date: TBA<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2719850/Super_Spelling_Ducks/">Store Page</a></p> <p>I love a word game, but for some reason most of them seem to be ad-riddled mobile games. So hooray for&nbsp;<em>Super Spelling Ducks</em>, a particularly mad-looking game about using a duck to push lettered blocks around a grid, spelling out words to make them explode. Being a little rogueish, each run at the game involves putting together a different collection of upgrades and abilities, and it all looks pleasingly chaotic. Oh, and it will have co-op too!</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3637630/Camp_Keepalive_Endless_Summer/">Camp Keepalive</a></h2>  <p>Developer: Porch Weather Games<br> Release Date: Out now<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3637630/Camp_Keepalive_Endless_Summer/">Store Page</a></p> <p>We don’t have summer camps here in the UK, but what I’ve come to understand about them is that they are all absolutely overrun by axe murderers and killer clowns. That seems to be further proved by&nbsp;<em>Camp Keepalive</em>, a turn-based strategy in which you control a group of counselors trying to keep the camp’s residents alive despite the monsters and monstrous people stalking the woods. There game came out earlier this year, but hasn’t gotten the attention it deserves.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3078120/Reality_Drift/">Reality Drift</a></h2>  <p>Developer: Arganoid Industries<br> Release Date: Q3 2026<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3078120/Reality_Drift/">Store Page</a></p> <p>Well this looks stunningly bizarre. A driving game in which you seem to gain astonishing speeds, but all decided by which lanes you pick as you go. It was the location choices of “Space,” “Cat Land,” or “Hell” that convinced me. There’s even somehow deckbuilding in this too, in a game that looks more tactical than reflex-based. Despite still being a fair way off, there’s already a demo.</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3241070/The_Amateur_Deity_Society/">The Amateur Deity Society</a></h2>  <p>Developer: Robert Carlson<br> Release Date: Out now<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3241070/The_Amateur_Deity_Society/">Store Page</a></p> <p>This combination of a point-and-click interface but an interactive fiction delivery has absolutely fascinated me. It’s all about being a member of the high school computer club which is attempting to program a world-simulator, but everything goes too…well? This came out last year but seems to have completely fallen under the radar. I’m installing it as I write, because I want to know more.</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://computerjames.itch.io/stealth-cw">Stealth Crossword</a></h2>  <p>Developer: ComputerJames<br> Release Date: Out now<br> <a href="https://computerjames.itch.io/stealth-cw">Store Page</a></p> <p>As a massive fan of crosswords, both cryptic and <em>New York Times</em>y, I’m always hopeful for innovative approaches to the genre in games, and generally disappointed. But&nbsp;<em>oh my goodness</em>, I am so very here for&nbsp;<em>Stealth Crossword</em>. It’s literally that! You play as the letters needed to finish the clues on grids laid out in clandestine locations, sneaking past the other alphabetical guards to enter the correct cell! There’s a levels where you have to hack a computer (as a sentient letter, naturally), to find out the clues, then knock out a guard to push their unconscious forms into the correct place in the grid! Oh I’m in love. The whole thing is only 10 minutes long (but make sure to play again and get caught), incredibly silly, and brilliantly smart. And it’s free! And it’s out now! This deserves to be developed into a full-length game.</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4136640/Mimic_Meadows/">Mimic Meadows</a></h2>  <p>Developer: sourencho<br> Release Date: TBA<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4136640/Mimic_Meadows/">Store Page</a></p> <p>I was absolutely <em>convinced&nbsp;</em>I’d played <em>Mimic Meadows&nbsp;</em>before, and that it had been&nbsp;<em>brilliant</em>, and I’ve finally figured it out. It’s an expanded version of an absolutely stunning puzzle game from 2022 called&nbsp;<em>Mimic</em>, which <a href="https://buried-treasure.org/2022/01/mimic/">I reviewed here</a>, where after saying how clever it is lamented, “There’s definitely a sense that it stops just as it hits its stride. Pursued further, you can see this becoming a&nbsp;<em>Baba Is You</em>, and I would be just delighted to see that happen.” My wishes are coming true! In the game, you play as a little red blob who can change into different animals by moving through tiles in a certain pattern. Doing so lets you enter terrain specific to that beast, but you’ll need to figure out routes that let you make those specific shapes. It was&nbsp;<em>great</em>, and I’m thrilled to learn it’s becoming a full game. (The video above is of the original version).</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2126810/Memorys_Reach/">Memory’s Reach</a></h2>  <p>Developer:<br> Release Date:<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2126810/Memorys_Reach/">Store Page</a></p> <p>“A first-person puzzle-adventure metroidvania” is a heck of a way to catch my eye. Then take a look at the <em>gorgeous</em> trailer above to be even more convinced. It’s all about unpicking the tragedy that led to the end of an alien civilization, by solving puzzles and gaining new abilities that let you reach further. And there’s no combat! There’s already a demo, despite no release date announced as yet.</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3639950/Star_Spark/">Star Spark</a></h2>  <p>Developer: JoyFlow Games<br> Release Date: TBA<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3639950/Star_Spark/">Store Page</a></p> <p>Surely this can’t be the first time someone’s had the sense to combine a&nbsp;<em>Slay The Spire</em>-style roguelite progression with old-school NES-like turn-based combat?&nbsp;<em>Surely</em>? But I’ve never seen it until now, in the excellent-looking&nbsp;<em>Star Spark</em>. And I want to be playing it already! The sprite art, the feisty animations, and the pumped up music are all on point.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3162890/Project_Lexa/">Project Lexa</a></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000648102" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000648102"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000648102">© Ward Games</figcaption></figure> <p>Developer: Ward Games<br> Release Date: TBA<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3162890/Project_Lexa/">Store Page</a></p> <p>I love the idea of language-deciphering games, but then something like the incredible&nbsp;<em>Heaven’s Vault</em> comes along and it’s far too hard for me.&nbsp;<em>Project Lexa</em> looks like it could be my happy place, however. You play as a communications specialist, marooned on an alien planet and required to translate the glyphs of a vanished colony. It all looks delightful, with its cartoon art and 2D exploration. I cannot wait.</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3210060/Skyfarm/">Skyfarm</a></h2>  <p>Developer: Plaid Games<br> Release Date: TBA<br> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3210060/Skyfarm/">Store Page</a></p> <p>A post-apocalyptic gardening sim is quite the prospect, but&nbsp;<em>Skyfarm</em> is a game about hopefulness. Only the taller rooftops remain safe in the cities after the floods, and you are to be charged with converting a roof garden into a farm to grow food for your community. It looks incredibly positive, positively educational, and also seems to be celebrating the possibilities of joy found in moments of solitude.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sonys-compact-soundbar-just-dropped-to-under-100-ahead-of-black-friday-2000647699</link>
            <guid>1366522</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="661">Whether you primarily find yourself watching TV in you living room, bedroom, basement, or even a home theater, it might be time to upgrade your audio setup. While a great picture is important, it’s the sound that can really boost your viewing experience from good to exceptional. A high-quality sound system makes all the difference, and the good news is you don’t need to spend a fortune to achieve cinematic audio in your home. Historically, Black Friday has been a great time to find discounts on home theater upgrades, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5987/">and right now, Sony is offering a 2.0-channel soundbar at a 39% discount. Normally priced at $160, this soundbar is currently available for just $98.</a></p>
<p data-start="703" data-end="1161">Folks underestimate the importance of good audio, even though it makes up 50% of the TV viewing experience. Even with the best picture quality, if the sound is coming from your TV’s built-in speakers, it won’t have the same impact. A soundbar is one of the easiest and most cost-effective ways to upgrade your home audio system, especially if you’re on a budget.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5987/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p data-start="1163" data-end="1542">This particular 2.0-channel soundbar from Sony is equipped with a built-in tweeter and delivers deep, powerful bass for rich, immersive sound. Its slim design makes it perfect for smaller spaces, such as city apartments or just any room with limited space. You can easily place it on top of your TV stand, or if you prefer, mount it on the wall to save space and maintain a clean, sleek look.</p>
<p data-start="1577" data-end="2206">If you’ve ever been frustrated by the way audio is mixed in modern content, you’re not alone. A lot of us find ourselves constantly adjusting the volume to keep up. Action sequences will be blasting with loud sounds, only for the dialogue to come through as a faint whisper. With this Sony soundbar, you can forget about those volume battles. It features a voice enhancement mode specifically designed to amplify speech, ensuring that dialogue remains clear and easy to hear, without also having the background sounds make your house shake. You’ll be able to enjoy your content without reaching for the remote every few minutes to adjust the volume.</p>


<h2 data-start="2208" data-end="2249">Easy Connectivity and Immersive Sound</h2>
<p data-start="2251" data-end="2742">Setting up the soundbar is a breeze. It connects to your TV via HDMI ARC, allowing for simple and reliable integration with your existing setup. Once connected, you’ll be treated to immersive sound thanks to Sony’s S-Force Pro Front Surround technology. This technology simulates a multi-channel surround sound experience, providing cinema-quality audio no matter where you’re sitting in the room.</p>
<p data-start="2744" data-end="3026">The soundbar isn’t just for movies and TV shows. You can connect your phone or other devices via USB or Bluetooth, allowing you to stream your favorite music, podcasts, audiobooks, and more directly through the soundbar.</p>
<p data-start="3057" data-end="3524">Say goodbye to the poor-quality audio that comes with your TV’s built-in speakers. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5987/">The Sony 2.0-channel soundbar is a great option for upgrading your home entertainment setup and right now it’s priced at just $98, down from its original price of $160.</a></p>

<p>The Pokémon TCG has seen a popularity boom once again in 2025, making products harder and harder to source, but there are some Black Friday deals to take advantage of.</p>



<p>Pokémon has moved the TCG into the Mega Evolution era, following the return of Mega Evolution Pokémon in Pokémon Legends: Z-A, which is expected to remain until the release of Gen 10, expected later next year. </p>



<p>Sets continue to come out thick and fast, but, with the first line of Ascended Heroes products not landing until the end of January, there’s a bit of breathing room to take a look at the best Black Friday deals available—and don’t forget to look at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/holiday-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming’s other holiday guides</a>.</p>

<p>CD Projekt Red has told fans not to expect any new showcases of The Witcher 4 during The Game Awards next month, despite being nominated for an award.</p>



<p>The Witcher 4 faces stiff competition with the likes of Marvel’s Wolverine and Grand Theft Auto 6 to be crowned the Most Anticipated Game at the 2025 awards show, but no matter the outcome, there won’t be any Witcher 4 reveals.</p>

<figure><figcaption>No show. Image via CD Projekt Red</figcaption></figure>



<p>Joint-CEO of CD Projekt Red, Michal Norwakowski, <a href="https://x.com/michalnowakow/status/1993732049044128043" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted on Twitter</a> to thank fans who have voted for Witcher 4 in the running for the award, but stated the team won’t be bringing any new content this year.</p>



<p>The post read: “I’m very happy to see The Witcher 4 nominated in the Most Anticipated Game category at The Game Awards. Thanks to everyone who has already voted – your support means a lot to us.</p>



<p>“We won’t be bringing any new content to TGA this year, but we’re, as always, excited to watch the show and celebrate this amazing industry’s great night alongside all of you.”</p>



<p>The first trailer for The Witcher 4 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-witcher-4-trailer-the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">debuted at The Game Awards last year</a>, while the latest sneak peek behind the scenes came in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-4-gameplay-revealed-at-state-of-unreal-tech-demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">State of Unreal showcase</a> this summer. </p>



<p>A significant amount of hires have been made by the studio, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/60-developers-join-cd-projekt-red-for-witcher-4-cyberpunk-2-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 60 joining back in August</a>, and the latest major acquisition came earlier this month with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-4-devs-acquire-kingdom-come-deliverance-2s-lead-gameplay-designer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hiring of Kingdom Come Deliverance 2’s lead gameplay designer</a>.</p>



<p>The title is the long-awaited sequel to the critically acclaimed The Witcher 3, which was initially released in 2015. However, no release window has been announced yet for the title.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The holiday season is upon us, and sales are starting to hit the entire gaming hobby, including a huge price drop for Battlefield 6 just in time for Black Friday.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 is one of the biggest titles to release this year, achieving critical acclaim, and even more content is on the horizon with seasonal content. If you’ve not yet jumped in and purchased the title, this is the best opportunity to do so.</p>







<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-half-price-on-playstation-5">Battlefield 6 Half-Price on PlayStation 5</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Cut price. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>Amazon has slashed the price of <strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/battlefield-6-ps-5-amazon-us/">Battlefield 6</a></strong> on PlayStation 5 to just $35, half the price of the launch cost and a whopping drop on the previous low price found earlier in the week.</p>



<p>Unfortunately for players on Xbox Series X|S and PC, the cut-price sale of Battlefield 6 on Amazon only applies to the PS5 version, but it’s worth keeping your eyes peeled for similar price drops over the Black Friday weekend.</p>



<p>Stock is likely to be limited, however, so if you’re sat on the fence about picking up Battlefield 6, it’s best to act fast, otherwise, you’ll likely regret it.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 has plenty to offer and, while the single-player campaign is fun at times, nothing beats multiplayer in the title, with combat on the ground and in the air. That’s not it, though, as datamines have previously revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-naval-combat-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">naval warfare content is already in development</a>, having <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-teases-naval-warfare-is-coming-to-battlefield-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously been teased by EA</a>.</p>



<p>Season 1 in Battlefield 6 kicked off on October 28, launching the REDSEC Battle Royale mode, which is free to play, new maps, new game modes, and new weapons.</p>



<p>The season is expected to close towards the end of January, expected around the 20th, with more additional content then being brought to the game in Season 2 and beyond.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> fans have accused <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> of accessibility negligence with its forthcoming Fan Fest event in California. After the "accessibility shitshow" of the previous event in the US, fans fear the production company of next year's event is ill-equipped to deal with accessibility needs and are vowing not to attend.</p>
<p>The Fan Fest events are huge conventions held regularly in the US, Europe, and Japan, where details of the MMORPG's next expansion are typically revealed. The last of these in the US, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-fan-fest-is-a-theme-park-for-its-passionate-community">held in Las Vegas in 2023</a>, was <a href="https://kaylriene.com/2023/07/31/final-fantasy-xiv-fan-fest-las-vegas-2023-was-kind-of-a-shitshow/">criticised for accessibility issues</a>. I attended myself and, while I'm not disabled, can attest to general poor organisation, lengthy queues for food, and a lack of facilities; the London event, by contrast, ran smoothly.</p>
<p>As such, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-fan-fest-dates-announced-so-when-is-the-next-expansion-due">move to Anaheim California for the 2026 event</a> was initially seen as a positive move, away from the desert heat. However, accessibility is once again proving to be an issue for the event organisers, as concerns have been raised by fans about how the third-party company Square Enix has hired is handling accessibility needs.</p>

<p>Upon purchasing a ticket for the event, fans are able to highlight their need for ADA assistance (relating to the Americans with Disabilities Act). While this initially appeared to be a positive step, these attendees are then emailed and required to have a personal phone call with a third-party organisation to raise their specific needs. Attendees then have 24 hours to agree to any accommodations.</p><p>Eurogamer can verify these emails, which are sent from The Trade Group, a company specialising in trade shows and conventions. Its work includes events for the Pokémon 2023 World Championship Series in Japan, and exhibits for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>, Stadia, and Magic the Gathering among others.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is seemingly a single point of contact at The Trade Group dealing with accessibility concerns, who must now personally call all potential attendees with accessibility needs. As such, fans believe their accessibility needs will not be met, that The Trade Group isn't taking concerns seriously, and the convention will not be safe to attend.</p>
<p>"The way that FanFest handled accessibility in 2023 was the worst accessibility experience I have had at a con, and their booth at PAX East 2024 wasn't much better," wrote Final Fantasy 14 player Sara Winters <a href="https://forum.square-enix.com/ffxiv/threads/524332-Accessibility-Missteps-Fanfest-2026">on the game's forum</a>, under the username divisionten. "However at PAX West 24 and then East 25, the booth took some wonderful and active strides to make its space accessible and friendly for all players. It was clear that SQUEX took the criticism of prior events to heart and actively improved.</p>
<p>"When there was an ADA marker in the sign-ups for FF 2026, that gave me hope that you all had learned the lessons of FF 23. However, the third-party company Square hired has been fumbling the bag repeatedly. There is one singular point of contact for accessibility at this third-party company, and [they're] under orders to call each person who requests ADA assistance."</p>

<p>Winters, who is a blind player of Final Fantasy 14 and an accessibility consultant, conducted their own survey of 1000 attendees of nerd conventions and found about 14 percent have accessibility needs. They also spoke on this issue with the head of panels at MAGfest and organisers of PAX. In the case of Fan Fest, 15,000 tickets were sold at the previous Las Vegas event - assuming a similar attendance in Anaheim, that's over 2,000 people that just one person is expected to personally call to discuss their needs. What's more, access to outside food and drink or a quiet room are seemingly considered accessibility needs in this instance, rather than general convention norms, meaning many attendees will not have their assumed needs met.</p><p>"It's very clear to me that this is not the fault of this individual employee, who was clearly assigned a task vastly outside [their] scope," wrote Winters in their forum thread. "But if you - SQUEX - actually want to follow through with your commitment to accessibility, then you need to hire actual accessibility consultants and do what they recommend."</p>
<p>Winters also shared their experience on BlueSky, adding: "Means testing doesn't work. You are making it harder for disabled people to access services they need, and the non-disabled who really want to game the system will do so anyway. You help nobody and harm the people who need assistance."</p>

</span></p><p>Winters confirmed to Eurogamer the consultant at The Trade Group has experience in special education, which appears to have been conflated with accessibility needs. "Special education is adjacent to accessibility - it's not the same thing," said Winters. What's more, a phone call itself is not accessible as a means of communication, especially for those who are deaf or have auditory impairments among other disabilities.</p>
<p>"They're functionally treating accessibility like an IEP [individual education plan], giving each individual a call with individual accommodations," said Winters. "That's just not enforceable, feasible, or usable."</p>
<p>Other players have shared their concerns on both the Final Fantasy 14 forum and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1p6cchi/na_fanfest_accessibility_issues/">reddit</a> in response to Winters' thread. One player didn't tick the ADA box when booking a ticket as the phone call "seemed like too involved of a process" for their accommodations. "I'd hoped that provisions would be available without me needing to jump through hoops before the event, but based on FanFest 2023 experiences and the vibe you're getting from jumping through said hoops, I'm now getting a little nervous," they wrote.</p><p>Another player noted at the last event their medical needs changed the day before attending, but the new phone call system wouldn't account for this. They added the system isn't the fault of the single consultant, but it "will inevitably fail disabled attendees and overwhelm the staff member responsible for them unless this is properly addressed and adjusted".</p>

<p>The Anaheim Convention Center itself does have a guide to accessibility on its <a href="https://visitanaheim.mediavalet.com/portals/ACC-Rates-Policies-Guidelines">website</a>. This includes such basic provisions as wheelchair access, elevators, and accessible seating, but notes individual events are responsible for contracting with ASL interpreters, for example. The convention centre has not responded to Eurogamer's request for comment.</p>
<p>This would suggest that basic accessibility needs will be provided at the convention, as is required by law. Yet beyond that, attendees are concerned their individual needs won't be met. As one forum poster wrote, "accessibility improvements are a boon for all".</p>
<p>"I cannot in any sort of good conscience waste my time and money to attend this con," surmised Winters on Bluesky. "'23 was an accessibility shitshow, and I won't spend a grand to be subjected to that again."</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted both Square Enix and The Trade Group for comment, but received no response.</p>
<p>The last expansion for Final Fantasy 14, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naoki-yoshida-on-dawntrail-criticism-community-feedback-and-the-future-of-final-fantasy-14">Dawntrail, was less well-received by players than previous expansions</a> and, anecdotally, player numbers have dropped since its release. As such, the next round of Fan Fest events are particularly important for Square Enix to ensure a strong future for its award-winning MMORPG, especially as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/world-of-warcraft-expansion-midnight-release-date">main rival World of Warcraft will receive a new expansion next year</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/27/arc-raiders-patch-1-4-0-rolls-out-with-some-content-and-bug-fixes/</link>
            <guid>1366483</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Embark Studio has pushed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/arc-raiders">ARC Raiders </a>update 1.4.0 live, this smaller update focussed on content and bug fixes after the last two updates.</p>
<p>There’s some fixed lighting, a gun exploit that allowed it to be fixed more quickly by swapping to and fro, and they’ve ended an exploit that allowed all locked rooms to be opened.</p>


<p>Here’s the full ARC Raiders update 1.4.0 patch notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Exploit mitigation mechanisms have been added for all locked rooms across all maps.<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed the gun exploit that allowed you to shoot quicker than intended by swapping to a quick use item and back.<wbr></li>
<li>The exterior access to Spaceport’s Control Tower locked room has been blocked off.<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed the issue that sometimes caused low resolution textures in the Main Menu.<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed players being able to push each other by jumping on each other’s backs.<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed lighting artifacts that would sometimes occur upon entering maps.<wbr></li>
<li>Raider Voice now correctly respects the selected voice option after restarting the game.<br>
<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p>Again, that’s much smaller than the last couple of updates, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/13/arc-raiders-update-1-2-0-is-called-north-line-adds-the-stella-montis-map/">1.2.0 adding the Stella Montis map</a> and a community challenge, while <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/20/arc-raiders-update-1-3-0-patch-notes-are-here-with-bug-fixes-and-balance-changes/">1.3.0 brought some balance tweaks</a> and had a more extensive set of bug fixes.</p>

<p>After a couple weeks as the hottest extraction shooter in town, we delivered our review of ARC Raiders a few days ago. Tuffcub said, “Arc Raiders reminds me of Destiny at launch; the core gameplay is excellent, and there’s a heartwarming sense of community, but there are many aspects that need refining and expanding. Managing your stash on consoles is a chore and there are not enough in-game events to spice up each run.”</p>

			<p>Toss a coin to your Witcher and have patience, because The Witcher 4 will not be appearing at <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-nominees-full-list/">The Game Awards 2025</a> next month. The highly anticipated RPG from CD Projekt RED will be skipping this year's awards and will presumably only show up on stage during the call-outs for the Most Anticipated Game award.</p>



<p>The news comes directly from the joint chief executive officer at CD Projekt RED, Michał Nowakowski, who posted a message on X (formerly Twitter) expressing his gratitude that The Witcher 4 was nominated for the category, while also making sure to keep players' expectations in check.</p>



<p>"<em>I’m very happy to see The Witcher 4 nominated in the Most Anticipated Game category at The Game Awards</em>," Nowakowski wrote. "<em>Thanks to everyone who has already voted - your support means a lot of to us. We won’t be bringing any new content to TGA this year, but we’re, as always, excited to watch the show and celebrate this amazing industry’s great night alongside all of you.</em>"</p>

</div></figure>



<p>It's perhaps disappointing news for players who can't wait to get their hands on the next installment in CD Projekt RED's popular franchise, but it can't be too surprising. If you've been following The Witcher 4's production, then you'll have heard that CDPR confirmed <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-wont-launch-until-2027-says-cd-projekt-red/">back in March 2025 that the game will not be released until 2027</a>.</p>



<p>We all still have a whole year of waiting before we can expect to start seeing new trailers and eventually, a release date. Nowakowski even reaffirmed this during the Q&amp;A portion of <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-eclipses-35-million-copies-sold-cyberpunk-2077-sequel-scales-up/">CDPR's recent third-quarter financial report</a>. When asked about The Witcher 4, Nowakowski would not comment on the game's production, saying, "<em>The only thing we're commenting is that we're not launching in 2026</em>."</p>



<p>So, with this year's show off the table for The Witcher 4, anyone waiting to return to the world of The Witcher will have to turn their attention to The Game Awards 2026, since that's a strong candidate for when we'd see a significant trailer reveal.</p>



<p>As far as what will be at The Game Awards, we're starting to see select developers confirm their attendance and that they'll be bringing a new trailer. <a href="https://x.com/EXODUSGame/status/1993365313962889525">Exodus, for example, will be at the show with a new trailer reveal</a>.</p>

            <p>You! Stop trying to break in! Also, while you're at it, stop using quick use item swapping to shoot me faster than you'd otherwise be able to! All of that is yelled by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>' latest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-latest-update-nerfs-an-overperforming-pistol-rebalances-boom-damage-and-also-has-ducks">patch</a>, which sees devs Embark go after a number of pesky exploits and also make piggybacks much less effective.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As outlined in <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/patch-notes-1-4-0">Update 1.4.0</a>'s notes, a gun exploit which allows shotgunners to rapid fire faster than intended by swapping to a quick use item and back again to skip a reload animation is no more. Dubbed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/GFw3n2StWfA">double pumping</a>, the exploit was typically used when wielding Il Toro, which is of course a pump-action lead-slinger. Anyway, it's gone now. You can almost hear that one Call of Duty character who used to yell that switching guns is always faster than reloading shedding a single tear of joy, as the impetus to carry around 20 shotguns returns to Arc Raiders.</p>
<p>Beyond that, Embark are sick of folks getting into places they shouldn't be. Hence some burglar-proofing "exploit mitigation mechanisms" being added to every locked room on every map. All of 'em. Exterior access to the locked room in the Spaceport's Control Tower locked room has also been blocked off, so good luck getting in there now.</p>
<p>Rounding out the patch, embark have nixed some lighting glitches, rectified some low-res main menu textures, and made sure restarting the game won't mess up any voices. Oh, and you now can't push other players around by jumping on their backs. Given how key backpacks are to raider fashion, this probably isn't the game to be try to get a surprise ride on your mate in. Even if you're only trying to shift them out of the way of a door. They might have a bad back, and that's probably making their life in robo-ruled future Italy tough enough without your antics.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sony-offloads-ps5-disc-edition-bundle-with-nba-2k26-now-cheaper-than-digital-model-alone-2000648079</link>
            <guid>1366468</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sony has gone all-in on PlayStation 5 deals this year and it offers consoles in various configurations – standalone units with or without disc drives, plus curated bundles- all hitting record-low prices on Amazon. Rather than picking up a <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5992/">PS5 Slim with disc drive for $449 (already down from à549), the smarter move is grabbing this bundle with NBA 2K26 at the identical price point</a>: You’re getting the PS5 Slim <em>Standard Edition</em> for well under its typical $549 tag with a brand-new AAA title thrown in at no additional cost.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5992/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why This Bundle Makes More Sense Than Buying Separately</h2>
<p>The value of this PlayStation 5 deal is clear when you look at the details. <strong>NBA 2K26 usually sells for $69.99 on its own</strong> and you’re also getting a $100 discount on the PS5 console with the free game. Sony rarely discounts its products this much and bundling a current sports title at no extra cost shows that the company wants to sell a lot during Black Friday. The <strong>bundle comes with the disc drive model</strong> which is important because you can buy used physical games, trade titles with friends, and watch 4K Blu-ray movies without being stuck with digital-only purchases.</p>
<p>The PS5 Slim in this bundle offers the same performance as the original PlayStation 5 but in a smaller size that fits better in entertainment centers: <strong>Sony reduced the volume and weight by about 30% compared to the launch model</strong> which makes it less noticeable next to your TV. The cooling system works well in the smaller design, keeping fan noise low during intense gaming.</p>



<p>The disc drive gives you more options than digital consoles do: Prices for physical games drop faster than for digital ones, especially during sales at stores like Walmart, Target, and Best Buy that compete on price. <strong>You can also borrow games from friends, rent games from libraries&nbsp;or sell games</strong> you’ve completed to recover some costs. The disc drive also plays <strong>4K Ultra HD Blu-ray discs,</strong> which makes your PS5 a functional media player for your physical movie collection.</p>
<p><strong>NBA 2K26 is the latest version in the basketball simulation</strong> <strong>series</strong> that consistently ranks among the best-selling sports games. The game has updated rosters, improved gameplay mechanics, and better visuals that leverage the PlayStation 5’s hardware. <em>MyCareer</em> mode allows you to create a custom player and guide them through an NBA career. MyTeam features card-collecting gameplay where you build your dream roster. The <strong>game also includes WNBA teams</strong> and street basketball modes with active online multiplayer that gets regular updates and seasonal content.</p>



<p>Performance on the PlayStation 5 elevates gaming experiences beyond last-generation consoles: <strong>Games load in seconds instead of minutes thanks to the custom SSD</strong> that reads data much faster than older consoles. <strong>Ray tracing provides realistic lighting</strong> and reflections in supported games and makes environments feel more lifelike. <strong>Frame rates can reach up to 120fps</strong> in compatible games if you have a display that supports those rates and allows smoother motion than standard 60fps gameplay.</p>
<p>The <strong>DualSense controller that comes with every PS5 adds haptic feedback and adaptive triggers</strong> that change how games feel. The haptic motors produce detailed vibrations, simulating different surfaces and textures, such as the feeling of raindrops or snow underfoot. Adaptive triggers offer different resistance levels, making drawing a bow feel different from pulling a gun trigger.</p>
<p>At $449 for the PlayStation 5 Slim with a disc drive and NBA 2K26, this bundle costs less than buying each part separately while offering full current-generation gaming features. Sony usually keeps PS5 prices solid outside major sales which makes this Black Friday offer a rare chance to get the console with a premium game at a price that won’t return until next year.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fire TV Stick HD Gets a 49% Black Friday Cut as Amazon Stops Caring About the Price on This Streaming Device]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-takes-almost-half-off-its-fire-tv-stick-hd-selling-it-for-pennies-2000647772</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Black Friday officially kicks off tomorrow, but you don’t have to wait till then to start shopping and bagging discounts. There’s a ton going for less right now; we’re talking plenty of tech gadgets, kitchen appliances, smart home devices, plus entertainment options. Amazon is being the most generous of all retailers, as it’s offering up to 50% off its own devices!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5986/">Those looking to give their entertainment setup an upgrade should consider grabbing the latest Amazon Fire TV Stick HD, which is slashed by 49% right now.</a> It typically retails for $35, but the current discount drops the price to just $18. The offer is open to all shoppers (Prime and non-Prime members), but the discount and the stock won’t be around for long. Lock the drop in before the Black Friday rush hits.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5986/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Tons of Free and Paid Content, In a Single Place</h2>
<p>The stick is tiny, but don’t let that fool you. It’s made for HD TVs, and lets you stream all your favorite content, whether it’s TV shows from the 90s or the latest crime thrillers in lifelike, detailed visuals that make every color pop in both dim and bright settings. Entertainment comes built right in. There’s support for all the popular streaming platforms (Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, Peacock, and more), so you’ll never be out of content to watch. Binge the season 5 of Stranger Things on Netflix, and end the night with an episode of The Paper on Peacock to cool things down; all from a single place.</p>
<p>These platforms require subscriptions, though. Trying to cut back on those? No sweat. The stick also lets you access over 1 million free movies and TV episodes from ad-supported streaming apps like Prime Video, Tubi, Pluto TV, and more. Those who prefer live TV for a more cable-like feel can consider subscribing to platforms like Sling TV and YouTube TV. This way, you’ll also be able to keep an eye on what’s happening around the world, check the weather, and even watch live sports. Maybe get the day started with some worldly updates, and end it with an episode of your favorite series; the possibilities are endless. Support for music platforms like Amazon Music, Spotify, and Pandora makes it just as easy to listen to your favorite songs throughout the day without pulling your phone out, making it a true all-in-one entertainment device.</p>



<p>The stick comes with a remote for easy navigation, but for times you’re not in the mood to control it manually, you can just use your voice to command, and Alexa will answer. Ask it to launch shows, lower the volume, skip through a scene, and pause; without getting up from your couch. Fire TV Search also lets you find movies by actor, plot, and quotes, so you can also say something like “Alexa, show me the best horror shows of all time” or “Alexa, show me the latest Ryan Gosling movies” instead of getting lost scrolling through a huge library on your own.</p>
<p>To get started, all that you need to do is plug the Fire TV Stick HD directly into your HDTV or use the included HDMI extender. Plug it into a wall outlet, and connect to the internet. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5986/">Follow the on-screen instructions to finish the setup. The latest Fire TV Stick HD was already quite affordable at $35, but you can now grab it for just $18 with Amazon’s Black Friday sale.</a> It’s the lowest we have seen it drop to in a long while, and at under $20, it’s practically a steal considering all the features you’re getting.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Creatures Of Sonaria Codes (November 2025)]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-creatures-of-sonaria/</link>
            <guid>1366462</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Use these Roblox Creatures Of Sonaria monthly redeem codes for November 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Cash, new signature looks, and much more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ever dreamt of soaring through the skies like one of the massive dragons from Game Of Thrones? If so, then Creatures Of Sonaria is a game that you need to check out immediately. Creatures Of Sonaria is a popular survival RPG experience on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/last-letter-codes-november-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> where players take on the roles of various mythical beings. Although many Roblox games tend to be quite basic and generic in their gameplay, Creatures Of Sonaria is a welcome change to that frustrating trend. With a highly immersive world full of secrets to explore, this game has something for every kind of player.&nbsp;</p>







<p>To start, the Creatures Of Sonaria map is absolutely massive, featuring various terrains and atmospheres. Simply exploring every nook and cranny of the map will take players plenty of time. Another element of the game that makes it highly immersive is the fact that there are over 300 playable creatures.

There’s also a solid Gacha system in the game, which players can use to get new and powerful beasts.&nbsp;</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Making developers disclose whether or not generative AI has been used during the making of a game, and how, "makes no sense", according to Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney.</p>
<p>Sweeney made the remarks while responding to a post on X by former Unreal Engine developer Matt Workman (who, incidentally, <a href="https://x.com/cinedatabase/status/1993757796723306612">uses generative AI in his motion capture work</a>) who said: "Steam and all digital marketplaces need to drop the 'Made with AI' label. It doesn't matter any more."</p>
<p>"Agreed," agreed Sweeney. "The AI tag is relevant to art exhibits for authorship disclosure, and to digital content licensing marketplaces where buyers need to understand the rights situation. It makes no sense for game stores, where AI will be involved in nearly all future production."</p>

<p>Sweeney then followed his comment a few hours' later with another post that read, "Why stop at AI use? We could have mandatory disclosures for what shampoo brand the developer uses. Customers deserve to know lol."</p>
<p>The 'made with AI' labels Sweeney and Workman are referring to are mandatory disclosures developers must make on Steam if their game contains traces of AI use. Take <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1808500/ARC_Raiders/">Arc Raiders' Steam page</a>, for example: its "AI Generated Content Disclosure" explains that, "During the development process, we may use procedural- and AI-based tools to assist with content creation. In all such cases, the final product reflects the creativity and expression of our own development team." <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders' Epic Games Store page</a> does not carry such a disclosure.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer / Valve</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Sweeney's comments have understandably provoked reaction across the gaming industry, with decorated indie developer Mike Bithell, of Bithell Games, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mikebithell.bsky.social/post/3m6lzdewov22r">posting on Bluesky</a>: "I just find this really sad. Imagine being so certain that you need slop machines to do your work, that you convince yourself that EVERYBODY must need them," he wrote.</p><p>Sweeney's declaration that "AI will be involved in nearly all future production" suggests Epic might be looking at using it across its colossal business - a business that includes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, the ubiquitous Unreal Engine, and the Steam-like Epic Games Store. And if it does, that decision will likely reverberate across the industry.</p>
<p>Generative AI use in game development remains a contentious issue, as studios figure out how to potentially embrace this powerful technology without risking people's jobs - assuming that is even possible. South Korean company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-south-korean-publisher-krafton-announced-its-transforming-into-an-ai-first-company-its-now-offering-employees-voluntary-resignation">Krafton, which makes PUBG and Inzoi, has taken considerable flak for announcing it is now an "AI-first" company</a> and offering voluntary redundancy to staff who don't want to be a part of that.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ive-been-really-heartened-to-see-the-community-revolt-against-ai-stuff-pubg-creator-brendan-greene-distances-himself-from-investor-kraftons-controversial-ai-first-mandate">PUBG creator Brendan Greene has distanced himself</a> and his Krafton-backed studio PlayerUnknown Productions from that approach, saying "I've been really heartened to see the community revolt against AI stuff". Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-dont-feel-that-games-created-with-only-ai-will-have-soul-the-blood-of-dawnwalker-director-doesnt-think-ai-can-replace-human-creativity-but-the-studio-is-using-it-in-reasonable-ways">Konrad Tomaszkiewicz, the game director of The Witcher 3 and co-director of Cyberpunk 2077, believes games made with AI will have no soul</a>, but also that there can be good uses of AI during development.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/splitgate-2-relaunch-late-december-1047-games/</link>
            <guid>1366441</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Earlier this year, Splitgate 2 launched with a pretty middling start. Players who enjoyed the first game were certainly enjoying 1047 Games' attempt at a sequel, but it wasn't the big new shooter on the block, the way the first Splitgate was in its early days. Unfortunately, an overly confident co-founder promising to "<em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splitgate-2-director-refuses-to-apologize-for-make-fps-great-again-hat-then-apologizes-anyway">make FPS great again</a>,</em>" a poor show of bravado at Summer Game Fest, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-2-slashes-145-cosmetic-bundle-price-following-fan-backlash">an insanely expensive $145 cosmetic bundle</a> meant that 1047 Games really took one on the chin when it put Splitgate 2 back into beta and <a href="https://wccftech.com/splitgate-2-back-to-beta-re-launch-2026-og-splitgate-servers-shutdown-1047-games-layoffs/">admitted it had been released "<em>too early</em>."</a></p>



<p>Now, five months after the fact, 1047 Games is ready to try again. The servers will be taken offline on December 4 to prepare for a proper relaunch later in the month, which technically means that it's actually relaunching sooner than 1047 Games had originally planned, since in its <a href="https://www.splitgate.com/news/building-the-splitgate-you-deserve">July statement</a>, it projected a return for the game in 2026.</p>



<p>"<em>Thank you to everyone who participated in the Splitgate 2 Beta! On December 4th, the Beta Season &amp; active Battle Passes will be ending, alongside your seasonal “rank” progress</em>," the studio writes <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2918300/view/590662508143970096?l=english">on the game's Steam page.</a> "<em>We will also be taking the Beta servers offline on the 4th to prepare for relaunch later in December</em>."</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Thank you to everyone who participated in the Splitgate 2 Beta! On December 4th, the Beta Season &amp; active Battle Passes will be ending, alongside your seasonal “rank” progress.</p><p>We will also be taking the Beta servers offline on the 4th to prepare for relaunch later in December.…</p></div>— Splitgate 2 - Beta (@Splitgate) <a href="https://twitter.com/Splitgate/status/1993028502925541517?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 24, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>When 1047 Games took Splitgate 2 back into beta, it not only 'unlaunched' the game, but took the servers offline for the original Splitgate, and laid off developers for the second time within a month, since its first layoff happened between the span of time that Splitgate 2 first launched on June 6 and when it was put back into beta on July 22.</p>



<p>It has been hosting beta tests in the months since, with <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2918300/charts/">a few hundred players logging into Steam, helping 1047 Games further its testing</a>. But a few hundred players are not going to sustain a multiplayer studio in today's age. If Splitgate 2 has any hope of sticking around, you wouldn't be wrong to imagine that its relaunch needs to be the biggest event in Splitgate history. </p>



<p>Will it be able to pull that off? We'll see. One thing to note is that with the servers going offline on December 4, and its relaunch coming "<em>later in December</em>," it just might be the case that 1047 Games co-founder and game director Ian Proulx makes a return to a Geoff Keighley stage (sans headwear) and announces the relaunch <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-nominees-full-list/">at The Game Awards</a>. It wouldn't be the strangest thing to happen at a Kieghley show.</p>

			<p><span>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is definitely not lacking in content, but if you have already played through the game once and want to experience it again, but with a twist that can make</span> the game's&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-continues-to-show-incredible-combat-depth-over-one-year-after-its-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deep combat</a>&nbsp;even more interesting, this mod, released earlier this month, is the one you are looking for.</p>



<p>Created by D3DNieR, the Playable Rufus Shinra mod, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7rebirth/mods/1598?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">available on Nexus Mods</a>, introduces a playable version of the boss character, complete with all of his iconic techniques. From the gameplay videos provided by the modder, the character appears to work quite well.</p>



<p>However, one specific ability, <em>"Thread Softly,"</em> may cause certain enemies without specific animations to stop moving for the remainder of the fight. Such minor technical issues are expected with mods that radically alter gameplay, and in no way diminish the incredible work that went into making a boss character playable.</p>

<p>Rufus Shinra isn't the only boss that has been made playable in the PC version of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, released earlier this year. Back in April, D3DNier released a mod which made the <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-new-mods-new-playable-characters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Turks Rude and Reno playable</a>, with <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7rebirth/mods/976?tab=files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">subsequent updates</a> not only improving the two characters' behavior in combat, but also adding playable Elena and Tseng.</p>



<p>The Final Fantasy VII Rebirth combat experience is also set to be further expanded in the future by <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-zack-gameplay-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a Zack gameplay overhaul </a>that will massively expand the character's moveset to better represent the power a 1st Class SOLDIER is supposed to have, as seen in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/crisis-core-final-fantasy-vii-reunion-the-price-of-freedom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII - Reunion.</a></p>



<p>As development of the third entry in the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy is well underway, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, which is on sale on Black Friday 2025 on both <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2909400/FINAL_FANTASY_VII_REBIRTH/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-friday-2025-playstation-5-deals-save-on-consoles-bundles-accessories-and-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5</a>, is not getting expanded with new content, so mods such as these are the perfect way to experience the game with some new twists.</p>



<p>The mods that are sure to be developed for the third and final entry in the series, however, may not be the only way the yet-to-be formally announced game will be expanded. Director Naoki Hamaguchi confirmed to us during this year's Tokyo Game Show that there's<a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-tgs-2025-qa-no-dlc-rebirth-but-theres-a-chance-for-part-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> a concrete possibility of having a DLC for the final game, or even a full title.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Gaming laptops usually cost over $1,000 for basic performance and high-end models can easily reach $2,000 to $3,000 for complete gaming capabilities. However, this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5798/">Asus TUF gaming F16 laptop (RTX 4050, 512GB SSD, 16GB DDR5 RAM, Intel Core 5 chip) breaks this trend with a price of $749, down from $1,099</a>. This deal on Amazon for Black Friday <strong>offers real gaming hardware at an all-time low</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5798/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Best in Class GPU</h2>
<p>The <strong>Nvidia RTX 4050 laptop GPU with a maximum TGP of 115W delivers true 1080p gaming performance</strong> in modern games: It uses DLSS 3 technology to upscale images and keeps high frame rates while keeping visual quality intact. The ray tracing support creates realistic lighting effects in games like Cyberpunk 2077, Forza Motorsport and Control without slowing down frame rates, thanks to AI-assisted rendering.</p>
<p>The GPU can run esports titles such as Valorant, League of Legends and Counter-Strike <strong>at competitive frame rates over 144fps</strong>, matching the display’s refresh rate. Creative tasks like video editing, 3D modeling and AI image generation also benefit from GPU acceleration and greatly speed up rendering times compared to integrated graphics.</p>



<p>The I<strong>ntel Core 5 210H processor provides balanced power through an efficient hybrid design</strong> that includes performance and efficiency cores. This setup manages demanding tasks while conserving battery life and gaming sessions experience steady frame rates as the performance cores focus on game logic and physics, while efficiency cores handle background tasks without detracting from gameplay.</p>
<p>The <strong>16-inch FHD+ display has a 144Hz refresh rate and a 16:10 aspect ratio</strong>, and offers an immersive gaming experience through smooth motion that avoids the stuttering of standard 60Hz displays during fast actions. The taller ratio adds vertical space, which is useful for productivity tasks like coding, document editing, and web browsing, where having more vertical pixels reduces the need to scroll. The <strong>display achieves 100% sRGB color accuracy</strong> and ensures correct color representation for photo editing and other creative work beyond gaming.</p>



<p>The cooling system is equipped with <strong>Arc Flow Fans, four exhaust vents, five dedicated heat pipes, and anti-dust filters</strong> and keeps temperatures steady during long gaming sessions without too much noise. This thermal design prevents performance drops caused by overheating to ensure consistent frame rates during extended play. The <strong>anti-dust filter</strong> keeps internal dust build-up in check, which helps maintain cooling efficiency over time, extending the laptop’s lifespan compared to systems that quickly degrade in dusty conditions.</p>
<p>At $749, this Asus TUF laptop offers a great mix of true gaming performance and sturdy build, and at this price point, it offers outstanding value in the gaming laptop market.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-enters-chaos-mode-now-selling-galaxy-z-fold7-at-record-low-and-cheaper-than-old-fold6-2000648076</link>
            <guid>1366420</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Samsung stands out with their folding smartphones and faces almost no direct competition from major manufacturers. After seven generations of improvements, the Galaxy Z Fold series has matured into a product category that Apple has yet to enter, despite ongoing rumors.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5609/">Currently priced at $1,657, down from $2,119, the 512GB Galaxy Z Fold7</a> is available at a record low on Amazon for Black Friday which makes this powerful productivity device more accessible than ever. The <strong>Z Flip7 also sees major discounts on Amazon</strong>&nbsp;but the Fold’s tablet-sized unfolded screen offers different use cases for users who want a pocketable alternative to laptops.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5609/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Expanded Design That Balances Size and Portability</h2>
<p>The <strong>wider cover display makes the Fold7 feel more like a traditional smartphone</strong> when closed and addresses past complaints that earlier models were too narrow for one-handed use. This increased width is closer to standard flagship phone dimensions and makes typing, browsing and using apps more comfortable without needing to unfold the device for simple tasks. The improved design encourages users to rely on the cover display for quick tasks instead of treating it as a backup when unfolding is inconvenient.</p>
<p>When unfolded, <strong>the 8-inch internal display creates a tablet-sized screen</strong> that allows for real multitasking with three apps visible at once. You can run email, a web browser, and messaging apps side-by-side, watch YouTube while browsing Twitter and responding to texts or follow recipe videos while taking notes and setting timers. This multitasking ability changes how tasks are completed by reducing the constant app switching that can disrupt workflow on traditional phones.</p>



<p>The <strong>200MP main camera is Samsung’s most ambitious camera</strong> technology to date on a folding phone, competing with flagship models that don’t have to deal with the challenges of hinges. The large sensor captures incredible detail, allowing for significant cropping while keeping clarity, so you can capture far-off subjects as clear close-ups without the limitations of optical zoom. The <em>Pro-Visual Engine</em> processes images using advanced computational photography techniques to analyze scenes, optimize exposure for different lighting conditions and apply smart enhancements that keep the natural look while increasing quality.</p>
<p>The customized <strong>Snapdragon 8 Elite processor</strong> (from Qualcomm) is designed specifically for Galaxy devices and delivers top performance with improved speeds and optimizations that enhance efficiency. This powerful processor can handle demanding games, 4K video editing, and heavy multitasking without overheating or draining the battery like lesser models. What’s more, with 512GB of storage, you can manage a large library of apps and professional content creation tasks without constant worry about storage space.</p>



<p>Durability is boosted with advanced <strong>armor aluminum framing and Corning Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 protection</strong>&nbsp;which help ease concerns about the fragility of folding phones that once discouraged early adopters. The reinforced hinge can handle hundreds of thousands of folds thanks to precise engineering that ensures smooth operation over years of daily use. The <strong>displays are more resistant to scratches than earlier models</strong> and still maintains the flexibility needed for folding, achieving durability that rivals traditional slab phones. <strong>Water resistance</strong> allows you to use the device in light rain or near water without worry.</p>
<p><strong>Battery life lasts through full days</strong> of mixed use despite the demands of dual displays and powerful processors, achieving longevity that matches or exceeds single-screen flagship devices. Samsung’s smart power management adjusts display refresh rates, processor speeds, and background activities based on how you use the device, maximizing battery life without requiring manual adjustments.</p>
<p>At $1,657, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold7 with 512GB offers an 8-inch folding display, a 200MP camera and Snapdragon 8 Elite processing at 22% less than its retail price this Black Friday. Samsung’s seven generations of refining folding phones have created technology that Apple has yet to match, despite its resources and engineering expertise.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/keep-all-your-crap-fully-charged-with-the-anker-prime-usb-c-charger-at-its-lowest-price-ever-2000647672</link>
            <guid>1366417</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="627">With Black Friday weekend just around the corner, we’re only a couple of days away from one of the biggest shopping events of the year. While the official start of Black Friday may still be a little ways off, many popular items on Amazon are already seeing some substantial discounts. If you’re getting a head start on holiday shopping, or maybe treating yourself to something special, now is a fantastic time to snag a deal. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5984/">Right now, Amazon is offering the Anker Prime Charger at 33% off.</a> Normally priced at $150, this high-tech USB-C compatible charging block is available for just $100—a savings of $50—for a limited time.</p>
<p data-start="629" data-end="1269">Nowadays, we carry a lot of devices with us that need to stay charged. It’s not just our smartphones that need to be plugged in at the end of the day anymore. If you’re someone who likes to listen to music or podcasts while on the go, your earbuds or wireless headphones also need to be juiced up. If you’re using a smartwatch to track your fitness or health, keeping that battery full is essential for getting the most out of its capabilities. And that barely scratches the surface. Tablets, laptops, even portable gaming consoles like the Nintendo Switch 2, the Asus ROG Xbox Ally, or the Steam Deck all need to be regularly charged to stay powered throughout the day.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5984/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="629" data-end="1269">Support for Multiple Devices</h2>
<p data-start="1271" data-end="1839">The Anker Prime Charger is designed to make charging all of these devices easier. Equipped with three USB-C ports, this compact charging block can handle any device that uses USB-C for charging. Each of the three ports can deliver up to 140W of power, which means you can quickly charge even larger devices like a 16-inch MacBook Pro. In fact, the Anker Prime Charger can take your MacBook Pro from zero to 50% battery in just 25 minutes. All three of its USB-C ports can charge at that max speed simultaneously, so it doesn’t matter which port you use.</p>
<p data-start="1841" data-end="2380">When all three ports are in use, the charger adjusts to distribute power efficiently. One port can charge at the full 140W, while the other two can each provide 35W of power. This makes it easy to charge multiple devices at once, whether you’re on a trip or just need to power up your devices at home. For example, if you’re traveling with a MacBook Pro, iPhone 16 Pro Max, and an iPad Pro, the Anker Prime Charger can deliver the same amount of power to each device as their individual chargers would.</p>


<p data-start="2382" data-end="2791">The Anker Prime Charger has a smart touch display, located on top of the device. This LED display offers helpful information about your connected devices, allowing you to check the power status of each port when a device is plugged in. You can also customize charging modes via the app.</p>
<p data-start="2793" data-end="3256">Measuring only 2.56 inches by 2.05 inches by 1.38 inches, it’s small enough to easily fit into your bag or pocket. The prongs even fold into the block, preventing them from catching on anything while you carry it around. For folks on the go, whether you’re working remotely or just want to reduce the number of chargers you carry, the Anker Prime Charger is a travel-friendly solution to your charging needs.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Steam continues to be one of the best places to play games in 2025, and there’s an almost endless list of titles to enjoy, making it hard to find the best games.</p>



<p>Whether you’re on the hunt for your next source of multiplayer mayhem, an expansive single-player adventure, or a little bit of everything, Insider Gaming has listed the best games to buy on Steam, or gift to loved ones, in 2025.</p>



<p>Don’t forget to check out our other <a href="http://also, there should always be a link near before getting into the lists to the Holiday 2025&quot; tag hub: https://insider-gaming.com/tag/holiday-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Holiday 2025</a> gift guides here!</p>







<h2 id="h-best-pc-games-to-buy-on-steam-2025">Best PC Games to Buy on Steam 2025</h2>



<h3 id="h-dispatch">Dispatch</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>The episode superhero adventure is arguably one of the best titles to release in a generation, putting you right in the mix of an Invincible-like story. Taking control of Robert Robertson, leading a pack of wannabe supervillain-turned-heroes seeking to be reformed, Dispatch’s eight-episode arc initially released weekly, but is perfect for playing in bulk, just like a binge watch of your favorite series.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you’re yet to join the fight to defend democracy, where have you been? Helldivers 2 continues to shine as one of the best titles available on Steam, and the fact Xbox players joined the fight earlier this year means there’s even more crossplay fun to be had. While the game has regular updates like other live-service titles, the huge benefit is there’s no expiration to the Battle Passes, and plenty of ways to earn free credits.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-arc-raiders">ARC Raiders</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>The extraction shooter has made a quick impression since its release last month, standing as one of the best-reviewed games this week. Playable solo, or in teams up to three, one of ARC Raiders’ biggest strengths is the unpredictability every time you jump into the game, as you never know who you will come across. With ongoing support, ARC Raiders is here for the long haul.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>After the much-maligned Battlefield 2042, EA has come back swinging with Battlefield 6, arguably the most successful title to release this year. While the solo campaign is entertaining, nothing beats the huge multiplayer battles on the ground and in the air, with naval combat expected in the future. If there’s any year to skip Call of Duty for something else, it’s this one.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>It’s been seven years since Red Dead Redemption 2 was released on consoles and while it took a while longer to get to Steam, it still stands as one of the best games money can buy, and the current price has been slashed. Winner of over 175 Game of the Year awards, Red Dead Redemption 2 is the perfect game to tide you over until the release of Grand Theft Auto 6.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-baldur-s-gate-3">Baldur’s Gate 3</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Baldur’s Gate 3 set the gaming world alight when it initially launched in 2023, clinching a well-deserved Game of the Year award, and the Dungeons &amp; Dragons adventure is rated five stars on Steam to this day. Your choices along the way shape your adventure, meaning you’ll have a different experience on every run.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-palworld">Palworld</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Initially released in January 2024, Palworld caught the eye. and the ire of Nintendo, with its release, and has received several updates since, including some big collabs. With an array of Pals to capture, expansive base-building mechanics, and the ability to permanently trap humans in a small sphere for eternity, what’s not to love?</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-forza-horizon-5">Forza Horizon 5</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Despite turning four this year, Forza Horizon 5 still stands as the best racing game on the market, a title likely to be held onto until the release of Forza Horizon 6 next year. While racing is the name of the game, there’s plenty of other things to do, including exploration, stunt jumps, and listening to one of the best soundtracks available on any game on the market.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-black-ops-7">Black Ops 7</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Black Ops 7 undoubtedly has its issues, but there are some major perks to the game. The biggest among them is Zombies, which is just as good, if not better, than Black Ops 6, with an expansive easter egg to complete on the initial map, along with more content on the way. There’s also intense multiplayer action and a frankly bizarre campaign to complete, which can be done solo with up to three other players.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Celebrating its tenth birthday next year, Stardew Valley continues to be one of the most-played titles on Steam and retains a five-star rating on the platform after a decade. Put in control of a run-down farm, players are tasked with bringing it back to life, growing crops and rearing animals. There’s also a mine to farm resources, a host of romance options, and plenty more secrets hidden away.</p>
