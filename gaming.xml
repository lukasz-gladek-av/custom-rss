                <p>Alan Wake and Control developer Remedy Entertainment launched its newest game, the co-op FPS <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fbc-firebreak/" data-ref-id="5000-647734">FBC: Firebreak</a>, in mid-June. The game didn't exactly take the world by storm, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2272540/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">with Steam concurrents topping out under 300 over the last week</a>, and Remedy itself admitting it "had hoped for a better launch." But Steam concurrent numbers do not tell the whole story, of course, and Remedy isn't giving up on Firebreak. Far from it.</p><p>Speaking to GameSpot, Remedy communications director Thomas Puha responded to the game's launch and outlined some of what's to come as part of the game's ongoing content roadmap. Puha said the team at Remedy is "super motivated" to build upon FBC and make changes based on player feedback. More than <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540/view/536605983645893033?l=english" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">1 million people</a> have played the game so far, and players haven't wasted time submitting feedback.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> FBC: Firebreak GameSpot Review</p>
      </div>
<p>"One of the great things about an online game like FBC: Firebreak is that we receive a wealth of player data and community feedback to inform our decision-making. We read all of it, and we are there talking with the players online," Puha explained.</p><p>We also asked Puha about the decision to bring Firebreak to Game Pass and PlayStation Plus at launch. He said Remedy is still crunching the numbers, but remarked that a "good number" of new players are joining FBC on console every day via the subscription services from Microsoft and Sony.</p><blockquote data-size="small" data-align="left"><p>"We feel strongly that what we have in the pipeline is going to be exciting for players. There is some game-changing content in development." -- Remedy's Thomas Puha</p></blockquote><p>Some in the video game industry have questioned whether or not it makes good business sense to launch new games directly into a subscription service, including those who have done just that. Recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dev-who-launched-game-into-game-pass-warns-against-launching-games-into-game-pass/1100-6532306/" data-ref-id="1100-6532306">the developer of the day-one Game Pass release Revenge of the Savage Planet questioned whether it was indeed a good idea to launch the game into Game Pass</a>, citing concerns about the "devaluation" of content. We don't know about the financial specifics for any deals Remedy may have made for Firebreak, however. At the same time, others have argued that launching directly into a subscription service could be a recipe for success to help a game reach a wider audience out of the gate.</p><p>Beyond financial performance, Puha said it's "pretty clear" that although people who may join Firebreak from Game Pass or PS Plus might not stick with the game for as long as someone who may have bought the game outright, "it's also easier for them to return."</p><p>Puha also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/control-spin-off-fbc-firebreak-is-a-defiant-punk-rock-take-on-co-op-shooters/1100-6531475/" data-ref-id="1100-6531475">reiterated</a> that Firebreak was never designed to require people to play every day to unlock daily login rewards or anything that could make it feel like playing Firebreak was "your other job." The game was purposefully designed to not take over your life, he said. "Instead, you play Firebreak for a while, take a break, and come back when we release new content in the form of major updates," he said. "We feel strongly that what we have in the pipeline is going to be exciting for players. There is some game-changing content in development."</p><p>While Puha said Remedy has already had to make key strategic decisions like prioritizing some areas and deprioritizing others due to the feedback at launch, he said fans can expect Remedy to stick with FBC. "Remedy is fully committed to FBC: Firebreak. We are all curious to see what it will be like later in the year," he said.</p><p>You can read our full interview with Puha below.</p><p>Next up for Firebreak is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540/view/536605983645893033?l=english" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the 1.3 patch</a>, which is targeting release early this week. Remedy said the patch aims to "enhanced the overall game experience" with things like changes to the game's perk economy. This follows on from a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/remedy-is-bringing-major-changes-to-fbc-firebreak-after-launch-backlash/1100-6532591/" data-ref-id="1100-6532591">previous patch that responded to some initial frustrations</a> with the game about the onboarding and progression, among other things.</p><p>GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/fbc-firebreak-review-controlled-chaos/1900-6418376/" data-ref-id="1900-6418376">FBC: Firebreak review</a> scored the game an 8/10. "FBC: Firebreak is an enjoyably chaotic power fantasy, and an interesting experiment for Remedy between its bigger, weirder projects," reviewer Mark Delaney wrote.</p><p>Remedy's ongoing support for Firebreak is just one of the development efforts that remains ongoing at the company. The Finnish studio is also working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/control-2-enters-full-production-as-alan-wake-2-has-finally-recouped-development-costs/1100-6529420/" data-ref-id="1100-6529420">Control 2</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/max-payne-1-and-2-remakes/">remakes of Max Payne and May Payne 2.</a></p><p><b>Can you speak to the Steam numbers for FBC so far, and how do you view Steam in terms of importance relative to console in the overall mix?</b></p><p>Steam is a very important part of the business of FBC: Firebreak. The Steam CCU is a very easy statistic to dig up, but it isn't everything.</p><p>We aren't naïve; we had hoped for a better launch, but the team here is super-motivated to continue building the game and responding to player feedback. We already reacted during launch week with patch 1.2, making some big changes to the game. As Remedy does, we'll do things with smaller teams in our way and try to solve challenges creatively.</p><p><b>What can Remedy say about launching FBC directly into Game Pass and PS Plus? Did this have the desired results for Remedy thus far?</b></p><p>Subscription services are an easy way for a large number of players to try the game, and it's great for cross-platform matchmaking--you have more folks to play with.</p><p>Being on these services also makes it easy for players to return when we release new updates and exciting new content.</p><p><b>What trends has Remedy observed for the Game Pass/PS Plus audience relative to people who may have bought the game outright? Are you seeing people who have never played a Remedy game before try it out, thanks to the subscription offering?</b></p><p>It's very early days, and we have a lot of data, which is very helpful for a game like this. We can see there is a significant number of FBC: Firebreak players who, for example, don't own Control. The game's a bit bewildering for them, to say the least, but we are going to improve on that significantly. Then, it's pretty clear that players from subscription services tend to stick around for shorter periods than those who purchased the game, but it's also easier for them to return. There is a good number of new players coming in every day on consoles.</p><p><b>What are some efforts you might take to help grow the FBC player base and retain the players you have already?</b></p><p>The simple answer is to develop and release great content to the game now that it's live. Post-launch content, as we have always said, will be free. Listen to the player base to understand what they want; their opinion is what matters, while ensuring that Remedy's creativity remains in the mix.</p><p>We never designed the game to be something that requires daily login for some random stuff, making the game your other job. Instead, you play Firebreak for a while, take a break, and come back when we release new content in the form of Major Updates.</p><p>We feel strongly that what we have in the pipeline is going to be exciting for players. There is some game-changing content in development.</p><p>One of the great things about an online game like FBC: Firebreak is that we receive a wealth of player data and community feedback to inform our decision-making. We read all of it, and we are there talking with the players online.</p><p>The drive within the Remedy development team is incredible to see, but of course, the content ultimately will decide what players think, not words.</p><p>It's been interesting to examine the data and feedback, and see that players who spent many hours playing the experience rated the game significantly higher than those who ended it early. So we know we've got something great at the core of the game.</p><p>We didn’t do a great job at all with onboarding and what we call the “first hours” progression, so players' frustration at the beginning of the game is understandable when there are a lot of systems thrown at you with little explanation, and the tier 1 weapons weren’t hitting that hard amongst other things.</p><p><b>What level of ongoing support can FBC players expect going forward as it relates to new content and updates?</b></p><p>Let's keep in mind the game is barely a week and a half old. We have a lot to process.</p><p>We outlined our post-launch plans before releasing the game, so there are two new Jobs and features coming in 2025. That's still the case.</p><p>Ultimately, we always knew that the launch of these types of games would have an impact on our post-launch roadmap. As it has proven to be, we've rearranged some of our development plans, prioritized certain features, and deprioritized others already during the week of the game being live. The game is live, players' feedback comes in, things will change, that’s what we expected.</p><p>We relied more on building game systems that we can expand in the future, and we can do so, so much more. We are going to discuss what's coming to the game in the near future. It takes time to review the feedback, assess what's possible, and communicate it.</p><p>It's exciting that the game starts evolving now that its live, Remedy is fully committed to FBC: Firebreak. We are all curious to see what it will be like later in the year.</p>

                <p>Believe it or not, the Bandai Namco fighter-jet series Ace Combat is now three decades old. To commemorate the anniversary of the first game's release in Japan on June 30, 1995, the company has put out a neat video showing off how the series has evolved over time.</p><p>The short movie highlights clips from various Ace Combat games, giving a glimpse of how the colorful PlayStation 1 art of Air Combat (the first entry in the series) transformed into the hyper-realistic near-future science-fiction of the later entries, such as Ace Combat 7.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYWwUqkBXAI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OYWwUqkBXAI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In addition to the series sizzle reel, the video also teases some projects in the works to further celebrate the anniversary. For instance, Bandai Namco overhauled the Ace Combat website, and it announced <a href="https://acecombat.jp/en/news/30th-anniversary-event1/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a special symphony</a> to be held on January 31, 2026 at Japan's Saitama Kaikan concert hall. Bandai Namco also shared that additional projects will be announced beginning in July.</p><p>It's cool to see how far Ace Combat has come since the early days. Being roughly the same age as the series and having grown up in the 2000s, I have a soft spot for Ace Combat 5 and Ace Combat 6. I remember playing the fifth game for hours at kiosks in local Targets, and the sixth was one of the first games I owned on my Xbox 360.</p><p>For those of you who, like me, are looking forward to seeing what the Ace Combat team can do with modern hardware, we'll likely still have to wait for a while. The company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-ace-combat-game-confirmed-new-developer-involved/1100-6495310/" data-ref-id="1100-6495310">announced back in 2021</a> that a new game is in the works, but there's been little additional information since then. It does seem like work continues, though: In <a href="https://acecombat.jp/en/news/fan-message/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a post to fans</a> today, series brand director Kazutoki Kono wrote, "We're ready. Everything is in place. It's time to take flight once again--toward even greater heights."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/11/gallery-unboxing-superdeluxes-lush-switch-editions-for-radiant-silvergun-clock-tower-and-wizardry">Having already seen how excellent the company's other physical editions can be</a>, I couldn't wait to see what <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/features/sometimes-the-only-way-to-preserve-a-game-is-to-own-it-japanese-publisher-superdeluxe-gets-physical">Superdeluxe</a> had in store for this one, as <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/guides/the-best-castlevania-games-of-all-time">Castlevania</a> is without a doubt my favourite game series.</p>
<p>Despite the firm's connection with fellow physical publisher <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/limited-run-talks-switch-2-game-key-cards-huge-carts-and-difficult-pitches">Limited Run Games</a>, this edition is different from the one that was released (and then quickly sold out) on LRG's site.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067txkomj&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>This amazing collection includes a physical copy of the game (complete with a full-colour instruction manual in both Japanese and English), a trading card, a selection of art cards, a four-disc soundtrack, and a bonus "Castlevania: The Secret History of the Crescent Moon" book.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that while the game is intended for the Japanese market, it plays in your system's selected language on Switch and Switch 2. <em>Phew!</em></p>

<p>This particular edition costs ¥8,980 / $62 / £45, but you'll naturally have to cover the cost of shipping from Japan.</p>
<p>"Even with the questionable inclusion of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/castlevania_ii_simons_quest">Simon's Quest</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/castlevania_the_adventure">Castlevania: The Adventure</a>, the 'highs' on offer are among the highest points in the entire franchise, and a Western debut for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/kid_dracula">Kid Dracula</a> is a lovely treat for retro gamers looking for something new," <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/castlevania_anniversary_collection">is what we said in our 8/10 review of Castlevania Anniversary Collection</a>. "As long as you’re willing to ignore the lesser titles in this package and you're not too bummed out by the omission of other classic entries, then you’re going to have a very good time with what’s left."</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-marine-2-second-year-updates-dlc</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/space-marine-2-will-get-a-second-year-of-free-and-paid-updates-and-dlc.1231947/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Saber Interactive and publisher Focus Entertainment have announced that&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>will get a second year of free updates and paid DLC.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/229-june-community-update" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">community update</a>, the studios say that a second yearly season pass is in the works, made possible by the "unwavering support" of the&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>community. The new pass will offer "new PvE missions, enemies, weapons, and...more", according to Focus, but it's too early for the studio to pin down exactly what's coming.</p>

<p>As well as that second year of content,&nbsp;a major&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>update is coming in September. Update 10.0 will include a brand new PvP mode, with the intervening Update 9.0 bringing "only balancing changes".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/space-marine-2-second-year-updates-dlc-shooting.jpg?itok=ajGZlZZF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/space-marine-2-second-year-updates-dlc-shooting.jpg?itok=s4V_i5o3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>is getting itself a second year of content.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Focus and Saber, the new PvP mode will take place on a brand new map, and it'll pit two warring Chaos factions against one another. You will also be able to pilot a Helbrute, which pretty much justifies the new mode in and of itself.</p>

<p>As part of this new mode, you can also expect new Chaos-themed armor sets to be added to&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>, and a new melee weapon will also be added in the form of the Power Axe, so you'll have another way to cleave heretics in twain (or followers of the False Emperor, whatever your poison may be).</p>

<p>Update 10.0 will additionally bring a new class in the form of the Techmarine, which Focus and Saber say they'll reveal more about in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>The latest community update also contains lots of information about how Saber and Focus learned from the new Siege Mode's public test period, so if you had strong opinions about that mode, you might want to check out their thoughts on that.</p>




<p>Elsewhere in&nbsp;<em>Space Marine&nbsp;</em>news, it was revealed recently that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-space-marine-3-revealed" rel="nofollow">a third&nbsp;<em>Space Marine&nbsp;</em>game</a> is in development, and while not much has been revealed about it yet, we do know that it will likely see protagonist Captain Titus returning from the previous two installments.</p>

<p>Not only that, but the devs behind&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>are currently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-marine-2-devs-hasbro-tentpole-ip" rel="nofollow">working on a brand new AAA-level game</a> using a "tentpole" Hasbro IP. If it doesn't turn out to be a&nbsp;<em>Monopoly&nbsp;</em>Soulslike, I'll be very sad indeed.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2183900/Warhammer_40000_Space_Marine_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4133-PPSA04452_00-SPACEMARINESII00" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2/9n9pczwhvp2l/0010" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and you can read my review of the game (from before its many updates) <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review" rel="nofollow">right here</a>.</p>

            <p>It's happened. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-gets-fallout-4-style-building-from-modder-who-wants-to-collaborate-on-a-full-settlement-system">modding</a> is one step closer to 100% completion.</p>
<p>The 2025 game about a 2006 game that's undergone some serious plastic surgery has gotten its first <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-best-mods">mod</a> that adds in Star Wars' iconic fighty sticks, so you can pretend to be Suke Lkywalker, Yo Da, or the other ones.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The modder who's stepped up the plate and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/4702?tab=description">added lightsabers</a> to Oblivin' on a prayer Remastered is CosmicBoogaloo. They've delivered five different colours of light-up sword, all with authentic 'vzzzzhhhh' and 'vwwwummm' sound effects.</p>
<p>There's red, green, blue, purple, and yellow. All I'll say is, if you join the Dark Brotherhood and use a red one, even Lucien Lachance might think you're a bit too edgy. You'll have to console command them into your inventory once you've downloaded the mod, which requires <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/32">UE4SS</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/1272">TesSyncMapInjector</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/1331">Runtime EditorIDs (Console)</a>, and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/473">NL-Tag Remover</a>. Think of it as just another force power that involves typing midichlorian-infused item IDs into your brain code.</p>

<p>CosmicBoogaloo's a modder whose stuff I've seen pretty regularly in my regular trips to Oblivion Remastered's Nexus Mods page. They've also recently added <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/4681">a gun</a> into the game, in case you'd prefer to roleplay as John McClane while you save Cyrodiil. I'll be honest, their mods which add <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/4232">a literal tree</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/4076">a brick</a> to OR as melee weapons are probably more up my alley.</p>
<p>I also feel like I have to mention that <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/3453?tab=description">one of their mods</a> saw them attempt to make the heads of every Oblivion Remastered character type invisible, and they apparently accidentally ended up rendering "pretty much EVERY normal NPC" in Cyrodiil headless. Happens to the best of us.</p>
<p>Anyway, that's to take nothing away from their lightsaber achievement. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42462?tab=description">Every</a> <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/26200">Elder</a> <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/92440">Scrolls</a> game needs a bunch of lightsaber mods.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-gets-its-inevitable-lightsaber-mod-made-by-someone-who-once-accidentally-decapitated-the-entire-population-of-cyrodiil]]></content:encoded>

<p>We're sure that many of you will have played <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/plucky_squire">The Plucky Squire</a> when it arrived on Switch last year, but did you find the whole thing a little... easy? Well, the next free update from developer All Possible Futures sounds particularly designed for you (thanks for the heads up, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-plucky-squire-too-easy-for-you-the-developer-heard-you-and-said-challenge-accepted">Eurogamer</a>).</p>
<p>The fittingly-named 'Challenge Update' arrived on Steam last week, and will be coming to consoles "soon". As you might expect, this one is all about upping the difficulty, and it throws in two new game modes to ensure it does so. 'Challenge Mode' introduces tougher enemies and a greater level of challenge, while 'Iron Squire' leaves poor Jot with just one life and no second chances — <em>eesh</em>.</p>
<p>On top of that, the new update will add new enemy types, and make some tweaks to the retro-inspired minigames for an extra slice of, you guessed it, <em>challenge</em>.</p>
<p>All Possible Futures announced on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/thepluckysquire.bsky.social/post/3lsjn2npg4c2d">BlueSky</a> that these additions come alongside "several other features and tweaks" in the update, including select page layout changes and the chance to fast-forward through dialogue scenes.</p>
<p>We had a perfectly pleasant time with The Plucky Squire last year, but felt that its performance let it down. From our tests, things are running substantially better on Switch 2, though some hiccups remain. Hey, the Challenge Update could be the perfect opportunity to dive back in, whenever it comes our way.</p>

			<p>The success of <a href="https://wccftech.com/newzoo-july-2024-report-reveals-ea-sports-college-football-25-is-an-instant-hit/">EA Sports College Football 2025</a> doesn't just mean more college football games down the line for American football fans. It also means the return of other collegiate-level sports games from EA, as the company has just pointed to an EA Sports College Basketball game on the horizon.</p>



<p>A post on the <a href="https://x.com/EASPORTS/status/1939703160479637660">official EA Sports X account</a> teases the return of the series, captioned with EA saying "<em>Bring the Madness. Let's run it back</em>,<em>" </em>adding hashtags for college basketball as 'CBB' and the popular EA Sports tagline 'It's in the game.'</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The last time EA released a college basketball game was 2009, with the release of NCAA Basketball 10, and according to <a href="https://www.extrapointsmb.com/p/memo-ea-sports-looks-to-bring-back-college-basketball-video-games-starting-in-2028-2029-0ef3">Extra Points</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-announces-college-basketball-game-16-years-after-the-last-one/1100-6532831/">GameSpot</a>), a memo from the Collegiate Licensing Company (CLC) puts the first game in EA's return to college basketball arriving in 2028. </p>



<p>If it hits that release window, then that means the first game in what'll likely be called 'EA Sports College Basketball' will be out almost two decades since the last time EA had a college basketball game on shelves. </p>



<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Electronic-Arts-Reports-Q4-and-FY25-Results/default.aspx">EA confirmed</a> that sales for College Football 25 exceeded $1 billion, so it's not the biggest shock that the company would look to bring back its other collegiate-level sports series. It'll be interesting to see how <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-college-football-26-madden-nfl-26-release-dates-announced-no-ps4-and-xbox-one-versions/">EA Sports College Football 26</a> does in comparison, to see just how strong the desire is from college sports fans to have these games return as an annual series again.</p>

            <p>
Well, that was quick. Following rumours last week and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/clone-generating-game-the-alters-may-have-used-ai-to-generate-some-writing-despite-the-lack-of-a-steam-disclosure">our own report just today</a>, 11 Bit Studios have confirmed that they made use of generative AI tools in sci-fi management sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-alters">The Alters</a> for the translation and localisation of what they say is a very small amount of text. They've also revealed that they used AI-generated assets as placeholders during development, but "in a very limited manner".</p>
<p>11 Bit argue that all of this represents "a limited impact on your gaming experience", but concede that they should have fessed up about it regardless. For context, the game launched on PC with no mention of any AI-generated material, including on Steam, where <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-dutys-generative-ai-disclosure-reveals-a-glaring-issue-with-steams-policies">Valve requires developers to disclose such things</a>.
</p>

<p>
All this comes in the form of <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:a564tr4carmvmz72gc2xog5i/post/3lstiwaoxcc2i?ref_src=embed">a Bluesky post</a>. "AI-generated assets were used strictly as temporary WIPs during the development process and in a very limited manner," it reads. "Our team has always prioritized meaningful, handcrafted storytelling as one of the foundations of our game.
</p>
<p>
"During production, an AI-generated text for a graphic asset, which was meant as a piece of background texture, was used by one of our graphical designers as a placeholder," the post continues. "This was never intended to be part of the final release. Unfortunately, due to an internal oversight, this single placeholder text was mistakenly left in the game."
</p>
<p>
You can find a screenshot of the asset in question below. 11 Bit say they have carried out a review of the game and "confirmed that this was an isolated case". The asset is now being updated.
</p>

</figure>
<p>
The developers also confirm that The Alters has made use of AI translation or localisation. The game features parody licensed movies you can watch with your clones to boost their morale. These were externally produced, 11 Bit say, and required "last-minute" translations.</p>
<p>"Due to extreme time constraints, we chose not to involve our translation partners and had these videos localized using AI to have them ready on launch", the post goes on, while insisting that 11 Bit had always intended to have the relevant materials properly translated by agencies in the course of a localisation hotfix after release. The hotfix in question is now in development.
</p>
<p>
The developers conclude by noting that the external movies are "approx. 10k words out of 3.4 million across all languages in the game, or just 0.3% of the overall text". The alternative to using genAI to create them, 11 Bit argue, was to release the dialogue exclusively in English. They didn't want to do this, but now "acknowledge this was the wrong call" and that "no matter what we decided, we should have simply let you know". 
</p>
<p>I think the defence that the vast majority of The Alters was made the Old-Fashioned Way by tangible beings of flesh is fair enough. That said, I feel inclined to pass on <a href="https://zaratustra.itch.io/dordle">Dordle</a> developer <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/zaratustra.bsky.social/post/3lstkkc62ns26">Zaratustra</a>'s response to 11 Bit's statement: "If you feel 0.3% of the game's text is not a big deal to have generated with AI, which percentage would you draw the line at[?]"</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/11-bit-confirm-that-they-used-generative-ai-for-the-alters-in-a-very-limited-manner]]></content:encoded>

The fan says they have, but it was a while ago. To that, Ryan responds: “Well, you might have to beat it again...” Ryan then nods, knowingly, and smiles. </p><p>“Is this true? I gotta run through all of them again,” says the fan. </p><p>“Well, especially this one,” says Ryan in response. “There’s a reason I say that, but I can’t say anything.”</p><p>So yeah, it seems like Ryan is teasing <em>something </em>about <em>Black Flag</em>. Now, it could be a comic, maybe a new novel, or perhaps some special update that’s coming to <em>Assassin’s Creed: Shadows</em> that will contain some <em>Black Flag</em>-themed content. But it seems odd that the voice actor for Edward Kenway would have insider knowledge about that stuff or would tease it like this. More likely, this is Ryan teasing the rumored and reported still-in-development <em>Black Flag</em> remake or remaster project. </p><p><em>Kotaku </em>has contacted Ubisoft for comment. </p><p>As previously mentioned, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-4-black-flag-remake-skull-bones-1850596271&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-4-black-flag-remake-skull-bones-1850596271">in 2023 <em>Kotaku </em>reported</a></span> that it had learned from multiple sources that a remake of the 2013 <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>game was in early stages and would not be completed for a few years.

That would likely mean Matt Ryan would need to be brought back in for some voice recording. And considering that voice acting generally doesn’t happen until later in a game’s development, this <em>Black Flag</em> remake may be launching sooner than later. In fact, Ubisoft doesn’t have any big games coming out this holiday season.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Codemasters has released a batch of content for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/f1-25">F1 25</a> that is inspired by F1 The Movie, which recently released in cinemas worldwide.</p>
<p>The F1 The Movie content comes in the form of six Chapter Scenarios, which are available either as part of the Iconic Edition or to be purchased separately. These events take you to key moments from the movie, tackling dramatic weather, strategic moments and overcoming the odds at Silverstone, Monza, Zandvoort, Mexico City, Spa-Francorchamps, and Abu Dhabi. Completing these scenarios unlocks Sonny Hayes’ helmet for use in F1 World and Driver Career.</p>


<p>In addition to this, those who have bought the Iconic Edition or upgrade prior to July 11th will get to race as APXGP and as its two fictional drivers Sonny Hayes and Joshua Pearce, in Career Mode.</p>
<p>Of course, drivers in this game need to have a rating, and even though Brad Pitt is older then most team driver pairings combined – excluding Ferrari with Lewis Hamilton and Aston Martin with Fernando Alonso – he hasn’t missed a beat as Sonny Hayes.</p>

<p>“Collaborating with Apple and Warner Bros. has enabled us to create a unique experience, allowing our players to not just watch, but live the movie,” said Gavin Cooper, Creative Director of F1 25. “The blend of cinematic film content and the interactive gameplay blurs the line between real, fictional, and virtual worlds, creating a one-of-a-kind, authentic Formula 1 moment that only EA SPORTS could deliver.”</p>

<p>We rather enjoyed F1 25’s entry in the yearly sporting franchise, which brought its own fictional F1 story to the table with the third Braking Point tale. Dom saying in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/27/f1-25-review/">our review</a>, “F1 25 is a clear improvement over last year’s entry, with improved handling, the returning Braking Point story mode and more all coming together to create an excellent F1 racing experience.”</p>

<p>Spotted by Gematsu and shared <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gematsu.com/post/3lssklr5nbk2d">on Bluesky</a>, <strong>The Rogue Prince of Persia</strong> was rated for Switch (and other consoles) on 27th June 2025, which you can see on the <a href="https://www.classification.gov.au/titles/rogue-prince-persia">Australian Government website</a>.</p>
<p>Developed by Evil Empire, best known for co-developing the excellent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dead_cells">Dead Cells</a>, The Rogue Prince of Persia was announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/04/prince-of-persia-roguelite-from-dead-cells-dev-revealed-switch-not-confirmed">back in April 2024</a> as an Early Access title, and it arrived on 14th May. It's received a number of updates over the past 14 months, and the full release is due in August 2025 for Steam.</p>

<p>Perhaps those console versions could come at the same time? Of course, we can't be certain until Ubisoft itself makes that announcement, but it seems likely.</p>
<p>The 1.0 update will add more biomes, enemies, bosses, interactions, and the final third of the story. Meanwhile, the most recent update only landed last month, and brought more powerful builds and tweaks to the combat an traversal. You can have a look at it in motion below.</p>

The shooter just entered its 17th season, bringing with it a retro-game-themed battle pass, new heroes and maps for Stadium, and map voting across all modes. All of that sounds good on paper, but the addition of map voting and the way Blizzard implemented the system has split the community. After playing around with it myself, I yearn for the days of getting randomly assigned a map before a match.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196880" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ranking Overwatch 2 Season 10's Biggest Changes" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="218" data-playlist="196880,195460,196049" data-current="196880"><div><p>Ranking Overwatch 2 Season 10's Biggest Changes</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196880/196880_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196880/196880_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196880/196880_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196880/196880_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22434.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The way map voting works in <em>Overwatch 2 </em>is that players are presented with three maps before a match begins. Everyone votes for their preferred stage, and then those votes are put into a roulette that picks between them at random. The idea is that the more people who vote for a map, the higher the chance it has of getting picked. This also means that less popular maps aren’t off the table entirely, and that is the first point of contention folks are voicing about the system, as several clips are being published online of a map that gets one vote being selected over a majority decision from the rest of the players in the game.</p><p>A cursory glance <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/overwatch/t/map-voting-just-made-me-ragequit/971593&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/overwatch/t/map-voting-just-made-me-ragequit/971593" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">at the Blizzard forums</a></span> will show you people arguing the merits of the system, with some asserting that a system that gives every player a chance to play on a map they want means that you won’t have to play the same maps over and over, even if they still feel like they’re playing on less-popular maps at an alarming frequency. Some are even speculating that the map voting system might be weighing maps with fewer votes differently, but that’s just conjecture. Others would rather Blizzard scrap the roulette system entirely in favor of a majority rule, which would probably fix some folks’ issues with being forced to play on maps they don’t like, but would also likely result in most <em>Overwatch 2 </em>matches taking place on the same handful of popular maps.</p><p>Anecdotally, my frustration with the system is that it makes it difficult (if not impossible) to get time in with newer maps. Season 17 added a new Flashpoint map called Aatlis that I haven’t been able to play a match on even once. In my experience, people vote for the maps they know, and that means that statistically, fewer players are voting for something new they aren’t used to playing on. Every time Aatlis has shown up on map voting, it’s been pretty handily outvoted, so I haven’t even seen the map for myself yet. Before map voting was added, matches would be randomly assigned a map with no input from players, so you would eventually get to see new maps as they came through standard play. Now, I guess I have to jump into a custom match to even run around in it?</p><p>One fix would be for voting to be removed from quick-play modes. I see the argument for having such a system in ranked because people in that mode get sweaty and want to craft what they view to be an optimal game. For those of us who just want to jump into an easy, uncomplicated match, however, map voting adds a new potential frustration without enough benefit to make it worth it. I wanted to get in a match or two on the Pride March Midtown map before it went back into the vault at the end of Pride Month, but now I can’t even stumble upon it without having to cross my fingers that someone else votes for it to improve the odds. The system isn’t even a week old, so there might just be some growing pains for fans and Blizzard to sort through. Hopefully, the team makes some quick improvements to map voting as season 17 goes on.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-new-map-voting-season-17-patch-push-escort-1851785326]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">Remasters and remakes are arguably more popular than ever--in video games and even movies--but Sega doesn't sound too keen to revisit the Sonic Adventure series. Sonic Team boss Takashi Iizuka was recently asked about updating <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sonic-adventure-2-review/1900-2777051/">Sonic Adventure 2</a> specifically and stated there are "no plans" for it.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking to <a href="https://www.shacknews.com/article/144842/takashi-iizuka-sonic-racing-crossworlds-interview-june-2025" rel="nofollow ">Shacknews</a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sonic-adventure-director-says-dont-expect-remakes-or-remasters-anytime-soon/" rel="nofollow ">VGC</a>), Iizuka was discussing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonic-racing-crossworld-preorders-are-live-on-console-and-pc/1100-6532225/">the upcoming Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> when the interviewer mentioned their love for Sonic Adventure 2. As such, Iizuka was asked about remaking or revisiting the 2001 game, to which the developer replied: "I am really appreciative of everyone who likes the Sonic Adventure series, but when I think about what it would take to bring that game up to the standards and expectations of what the modern gaming audience would want, I think it would be about as much time and energy as it would to make a new title."</p>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">As such, Iizuka noted that "part of me is thinking maybe I should just make a brand new title and that’s why there's currently no plans." What's interesting here is that 2011's Sonic Generations did get a remaster as part of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review-reruns/1900-6418303/">Sonic X Shadows Generations</a> from last year. The game also arrived <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-nintendo-switch-2-games/2900-6128/">on Switch 2</a> earlier this month.</p><p>Up next for Sonic Team is the previously mentioned Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds. It's the fourth entry in the racing subseries for the Blue Blur and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonic-racing-crossworlds-will-feature-hatsune-miku-and-persona-5s-joker/1100-6532201/">will feature crossover characters like Persona 5's Joker</a> and even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/sonic-racing-crossworlds-spongebob-squarepants-character-reveal-trailer/2300-6466144/">SpongeBob Squarepants</a>. Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is set to launch September 25 on PC, PS4, PS5, Switch, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. A Switch 2 version is also in the works for a later date.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Capcom has released an update for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter: Wilds</a> which has fixed a shader compilation problem on PC, causing high CPU loads and horrendous performance issues.</p>
<p>The title 2 update, which is out now, alters the game so shader compilation occurs upon the game's initial launch, rather than during gameplay. It'll take some time, but players will no longer need to manually delete shader cache files in order to improve performance. That's good!</p>
<p>These performance issues led to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-details-next-monster-hunter-wilds-update-as-steam-reviews-continue-overwhelmingly-negative-plunge">Monster Hunter Wilds receiving an overwhelmingly negative rating on Steam</a>. The game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-weve-got-issues">which suffered from performance issues from day one</a> on PC, had an increased rate of crashes and visual bugs as of an update a month ago.</p>

<p>Hopefully this update fixes these performance woes and gives fans what they've been looking for.

It has waned in recent months, though as of writing a surge of returning players have hopped back into the game with title update 2's release. So, here's hoping the dark times for Wilds are a thing of the past.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-patch-finally-fixes-the-games-inexcusable-performance-woes-on-pc]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition may not be too far from release on Nintendo Switch 2, as the new edition of the popular action role-playing game developed by FromSoftware has been recently rated in the United States.</p>



<p>As the game has been available for a while on other formats, the Switch 2 edition's ESRB rating, which can be found <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40550/elden-ring-tarnished-edition/">here</a>, wouldn't have been notable if the game's release date was known. However, the fact that the rating has been made public shortly before this week's <a href="https://wccftech.com/bandai-namco-summer-showcase-my-hero-academia-game/">Bandai Namco showcase</a> suggests that the release date announcement and subsequent release may not be too far in the future.</p>



<p>The Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition was among the third-party games revealed during the big Nintendo Switch 2 reveal event held back in April. The new edition of the celebrated game will come with new features not found in the original release, such as two new starting classes, four new Armor sets, new weapons and skills, three Torrent customization options, and some yet-to-be-detailed quality-of-life improvements. The Tarnished Edition will also include the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-worthy-of-the-greater-wills-blessing/">Shadow of the Erdtree expansion</a></strong>, which introduces a second map and some pretty challenging enemies.</p>



<p>Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition launches on a yet-to-be-confirmed release date on Nintendo Switch 2. You can learn why the base game is one of the best action RPGs by FromSoftware by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-make-way-for-the-elden-lord/">review.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Cult classic baseball game&nbsp;<em>Backyard Baseball '01&nbsp;</em>is due for a re-release next week, and according to a new report, just three of the game's original 31 licensed stars will not be returning.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://www.sportico.com/leagues/baseball/2025/backyard-baseball-2001-game-release-date-mlb-players-list-1234858525/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Sportico</a> (which cites new <em>Backyard Baseball&nbsp;</em>series owner Playground Productions), 28 of the players who appeared in the original&nbsp;<em>Backyard Baseball 2001</em>, including icons like Derek Jeter and Jose Canseco, will be returning for the new re-release, which is coming to Steam and mobile devices on July 8th.</p>

<p>According to Sportico, while some players were easy to track down, others were more difficult. Playground CEO&nbsp;Lindsay Barnett (that's Playground Productions, not&nbsp;<em>Forza&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/fable-2025" rel="nofollow">Fable</a>&nbsp;</em>developer Playground Games) says that the studio contacted some of&nbsp;Álex González's current coaching students to track him down, for example.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/backyard-baseball-01-mlb-stars-gameplay.jpg?itok=ir5tGdpD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/backyard-baseball-01-mlb-stars-gameplay.jpg?itok=10HRX4PJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Backyard Baseball '01&nbsp;</em>will feature 28 of the original game's 31 players.</figcaption></figure><p>The three players who won't be featuring in this re-release are Ken Griffey Jr., Frank Thomas, and Barry Bonds. As Sportico points out, Bonds hasn't appeared in an MLB-related game since <a href="https://ryanferguson.co.uk/blogs/blog/why-was-barry-bonds-not-in-video-games" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">backing out</a> of a group licensing agreement in the early 2000s.</p>

<p>Barnett said that working with MLB on&nbsp;<em>Backyard Baseball '01&nbsp;</em>"just could not have been easier", and that the league "really love[s] this brand", referring to the&nbsp;<em>Backyard Baseball&nbsp;</em>series.</p>

<p><em>Backyard Baseball&nbsp;</em>belongs to the wider&nbsp;<em>Backyard Sports&nbsp;</em>series, which also includes takes on sports like American football, association football (or "soccer", though the word feels hollow in my mouth as a Brit), and basketball.</p>

<p>As well as re-releasing&nbsp;<em>Backyard Baseball '01</em>&nbsp;and other games in the&nbsp;<em>Backyard&nbsp;</em>series, Playground is also currently working on a <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/backyard-sports-new-video-game-tv-film-adaptations-1236213649/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">brand new title</a>, although we don't know around which sport the new game will revolve yet.</p>




<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Backyard Baseball '01&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3104970/Backyard_Baseball_01/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a> on July 8th, so make sure to wishlist it if you're after a slice of nostalgic sports action.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Capcom have a tough fight on their hands at the moment. No, Arkveld hasn't escaped from its lair to terrorise the non-OP masses. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> has been suffering from some <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/#app_reviews_hash">pretty nasty performance issues</a> on PC.</p>
<p>While they don't look to have the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action game</a> running as well as some kind of crash and stuffer-free Usain Bolt quite yet, the release of Wilds' second title update has seen the studio try to curb some shader compilation and VRAM-related problems.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Alongside deploying the update, which brings <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-second-title-update-is-adding-in-lagiacrus-from-monster-hunter-3-when-it-arrives-next-week">Lagiacrus and a bunch of other new stuff</a> to the game (including Fender guitars, because why not), Capcom have put out a fix aimed at stopping shader compilation while you're playing from causing "high CPU load and unstable performance".</p>
<p>Now, instead of shaders being complied once you're hunning the mons, that process'll take place at launch when there's a fresh update to apply, and you won't need to worry about trying to delete your shader cache files in order to improve the situation.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Steam hunters!</p><p>With Title Update 2's arrival, we have resolved a previous issue where shader compilation during gameplay caused high CPU load and unstable performance. </p><p>Please be aware of the following when booting up the game after installing the latest update:</p><p>⚪ Shader… <a href="https://t.co/PzXQK3NGvV">pic.twitter.com/PzXQK3NGvV</a></p></div>— Monster Hunter Status (@MHStatusUpdates) <a href="https://twitter.com/MHStatusUpdates/status/1939617276677759340?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 30, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>That's not the only thing the devs have done, with title update two's <a href="https://info.monsterhunter.com/wilds/update/en-us/Ver.1.020.00.00.html">full patch notes</a> revealing some other Steam-specific tweaks designed to help reverse the game's recent review fortunes in the Valve money place.</p>
<p>First of all, you'll now have a warning pop up if you try to launch the Wilds with out of date GPU drivers, an unsupported OS, or while using compatibility mode. There's also some extra support for Nvidia and AMD upscaling and frame generation tech.</p>
<p>The big fixes in the notes, though, concern VRAM. Capcom have tweaked how much of it's used when the game's streaming textures, fixed the VRAM usage estimate in the game's settings not being accurate, and rectified that last one also affecting distant shadow quality readouts.</p>
<p>As for how much these fixes have improved things performance-wise for PC Wilds, the verdict so far looks to be a bit mixed, with some folks <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MHWilds/comments/1lo0yeu/title_update_2_is_good/">reporting</a> that things are generally better and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MHWilds/comments/1lo0i4v/framerate_issues/">others</a> still seemingly running into crash and frame rate problems.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-two-aims-to-defeat-the-biggest-beasts-of-all-shader-compilation-and-vram-issues]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-spent-too-long-not-knowing-there%E2%80%99s-a-stealth-crossword-game.1231827/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When your job involves writing about video games, you quickly come to realize there are way too many video games to ever keep track of. You have two options here: painstakingly trawl storefronts and lists of new releases every week in an effort that will almost certainly destroy you, or trust that the universe will put cool games in front of you when the time is right.</p><p>Here’s an example of the latter: This weekend I randomly saw a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/annacwebs.bsky.social/post/3lsr2d23wtk2p" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on Bluesky</a> about a browser game called <a href="https://computerjames.itch.io/stealth-cw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Stealth Crossword</em></a>. The game appears to have come out a few months ago, and developer ComputerJames says it’s a remake of a game they made six years ago. It’s a very short game, taking me about 10 minutes. ComputerJames describes it as “the forced stealth mission in a game that really shouldn’t have one.”</p><p>The genre this stealth is forced into is a crossword puzzle. Your character turns into any letter you press on your keyboard, and you then have to slot that letter into crossword clues to spell a word. Overtop this wordplay is a stealth game about international espionage, complete with cameras to avoid, blind spots to hide in, bad guys to disguise yourself in front of, and secrets to uncover. The game has two endings, and is, in ComputerJames’ words, “100% not procedural and un-replayable.”</p><figure><figcaption>ComputerJames</figcaption></figure><p>Switching to a new letter sends you back to the start of a level, so you have to think a bit strategically about how to fill in the crossword clues, and you also have to employ the usual stealth game timing and navigating. There are a few twists on the crossword mechanics I won’t spoil, but the game never loses focus on its core idea. Neither the stealth nor crossword gameplay is too challenging, but when combined they turn into some new thing that works perfectly even though when you step back to think about it, the whole idea is weird as hell.&nbsp;</p><p>I’d absolutely play a much longer version of <em>Stealth Crossword</em> if one existed, but I also love that it’s just this small, contained thing that was put before me completely at random. Instead of letting it cause me to panic about how many other cool games I’m surely missing out on, I’m just going to be psyched that I saw it.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-zohran-mamdani-fifa-sim-city"><h3>Congratulations To Zohran Mamdani, NYC’s (Second) Gamer Mayor</h3></a><p>"Unfortunately, our first gamer mayor – at least, in terms of policy – is Eric Adams"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/lies-of-p-overture-dlc-success-bonus"><h3>Bucking The Industry Trend Of Post-Launch Layoffs, Lies Of P Devs Received $7,500 Bonuses, Switch 2s</h3></a><p>"This bonus payout is both a celebration of that achievement and a significant turning point as the Lies of P franchise progresses to its next stage.”</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/this-game-sure-looks-a-lot-like-venba"><h3>This Game Sure Looks A Lot Like Venba [Update]</h3></a><p>Prolific copycat studio makes a copycat game of Venba, stripping it of any life</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/rent-a-girlfriend-manga"><h3>You win, Rent-A-Girlfriend.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/roguelite-kingdom-builder-the-king-is-watching-gets-july-release-date.1231809/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Hypnohead and publisher tinyBuild have announced the release date for roguelite city-builder&nbsp;<em>The King Is Watching</em>, and it's set to arrive on PC next month.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>The King Is Watching&nbsp;</em>will arrive on July 21st. According to tinyBuild, the game has enjoyed 300,000 demo downloads and has amassed over 200,000 wishlists from hopeful fans. That's a lot of people who'll be over the moon to discover a release date has been revealed, I'm sure.</p>

<p>With&nbsp;<em>The King Is Watching</em>, tinyBuild and Hypnohead promise to "[take] the base-building genre in a new direction" by "adding in roguelike elements to make each reign fresh". I suspect games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/against-storm" rel="nofollow">Against the Storm</a>&nbsp;</em>would have something to say about that, but I see what they're driving at.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-king-is-watching-city-building.jpg?itok=H2ypKkKg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-king-is-watching-city-building.jpg?itok=RZ7fzUWi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The King Is Watching&nbsp;</em>comes to Steam next month.</figcaption></figure><p>The game's name comes from a mechanic whereby you must be watching certain facilities and buildings for them to be productive; the moment your gaze moves elsewhere, those facilities essentially slack off, so you'll need to keep your eyes on the places you most need to be productive.</p>

<p>You'll also need to manage resources carefully, choosing which resources to prioritize and which ones to put on the back burner for different situations. Hypnohead and tinyBuild say that every decision you make will shape your reign.</p>

<p>The roguelike elements in&nbsp;<em>The King Is Watching&nbsp;</em>manifest in the form of new challenges and variables for each run; you may, for instance, be confronted with "cursed cemeteries", or you may need to do battle with generals you've never faced in combat before.</p>




<p>However, you'll unlock permanent bonuses like increased troop limits and new facilities between runs, ensuring that you're constantly increasing the scope and range of your power.</p>

<p><em>The King Is Watching&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2753900/The_King_is_Watching/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a> on July 21st. There's no word yet of ports to other platforms.</p>

The tale of a smart, innovative man stranded on Mars went on to have a great movie based on it, directed by legendary filmmaker Ridley Scott. It was a glorious success story...and then Weir published <em>Artemis</em>. Oh good lord, what a fall. An astoundingly terrible book, it is one of the most excruciating examples of the “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://www.jezebel.com/strong-female-characters-arent-enough-goddammit-1592135553&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.jezebel.com/strong-female-characters-arent-enough-goddammit-1592135553">strong female character</a></span>” trope, and while rights to make a movie were purchased before it was published, it’s not really a surprise that nothing’s happened with that since 2018.</p><p>Fears that the author, who self-published <em>The Martian</em> after being rejected by various imprints, might be a one-hit-wonder grew, until 2021's <em>Project Hail Mary</em> appeared, and was a completely compelling piece of sci-fi on par with his first book. Phew! And now, we have a first trailer for the inevitable movie adaptation, starring Ryan Gosling as the book’s main character, Ryland Grace. Even better, the screenplay is by Drew Goddard, who not only wrote <em>The Cabin in the Woods</em>, <em>Cloverfield</em>, and many episodes of <em>Buffy</em>, <em>Angel</em> and <em>Lost</em>, but also adapted <em>The Martian</em>. Oh, and it’s being directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, the pair behind <em>The Lego Movie</em> and the writers of the<em> Into The Spider-Verse </em>movies.</p><p>So Ryland Grace is a junior high science teacher with a specialist background in molecular biology who is rather forcibly drafted to help with an effort by the European Space Agency to investigate a universal phenomenon of “dimming,” whereby stars are losing luminescence, including, rather pressingly, our own. Grace is pressured into joining a years-long mission to a star, Tau Ceti, that is resistant to the dimming, to find out why. Except, as you’d expect, lots goes wrong. But this isn’t a movie about that!</p><p>If you’ve not read the book, the latter third of the trailer might feel like quite a spoiler, and—I dunno—if I were marketing this, I’d have been a bit more subtle. But in truth, it’s actually setting up the vast bulk of the story, and really gives nothing away about the true extent of the narrative.</p><p>This is, without giving any specifics, a story about a unique relationship, and if the film can match the intimacy and uniquely peculiar nature of the novel, it could be very special. Or, the movie could trivialize that aspect and be far more about shit exploding in space. Who knows. But still, it looks pretty and fun so far.</p><p>The movie, which also stars Sandra Hüller, Liz Kingsman, and Lionel Boyce, is headed to theaters in March of next year. I imagine we’ll be seeing a lot more of it before then.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/project-hail-mary-trailer-ryan-gosling-andy-weir-1851785317]]></content:encoded>

It also detailed a series of upcoming patches to address the various issues, including “major improvements to chat input, scoreboard layout, and HUD elements,” and “Fixed softlocks, graphical glitches, and input issues in various screens.” Based on some players’ assessment of the <em>Master Crafted</em> Edition in general, however, it still might not be worth picking up. </p><p>The Anniversary Edition is currently 75 percent off, letting us get an already solid version of the old-school FPS for just $10. The <em>Master Crafted Edition </em>was more of a bone for console players anyway, since the <em>Anniversary Edition</em> never came to Xbox or PlayStation, and the original version of <em>Space Marine</em> wasn’t supported by backwards compatibility. Even there, however, Xbox Series X/S players (the game’s free with Game Pass Ultimate) have been <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Spacemarine/comments/1l9czva/lost_progresssave_on_xbox_series_x_on_master/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Spacemarine/comments/1l9czva/lost_progresssave_on_xbox_series_x_on_master/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">complaining about a major bug that’s eating their save files</a></span>. </p><p>“Played earlier today. Shut down the game like I always do, and turned back on today only to get greeted by missing save for campaign,” wrote one player on Reddit a couple of weeks ago. “Happened to me too,” responded another. “I am done with this version of the game for now. I couldn’t play online at all and today I just saw my save is gone.” Refunds aren’t available for that platform though, and the issue doesn’t appear to have been patched out yet. </p><p>The <em>Master Crafted Edition</em> isn’t available on PS5 yet, possibly due to the Game Pass deal with Xbox. Hopefully, all of these issues get ironed out before it arrives. In the meantime, <em>Space Marine 2</em>'s new horde mode isn’t a bad substitute. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-master-crafted-refunds-ps5-1851785318]]></content:encoded>

Personally, I think Xbox hardware is dead."</p><p>Fryer acknowledged that remasters of classic games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-review/1900-6418359/" data-ref-id="1900-6418359">The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered</a> have been massively successful, but she questioned Xbox's ability to make new hits. She also notes that Microsoft has a valuable resource in Game Pass, but believes that it's not enough to drive hardware sales on its own.</p><p>Former Xbox Live and Game Pass vice president Mike Ybarra had a slightly different assessment on <a href="https://x.com/Qwik/status/1939298865976647790" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">X</a>. While Ybarra also believes that Microsoft is pulling back from hardware, he thinks it can become the biggest gaming publisher if it focuses on that goal alone.</p><p>"They have to figure out what needs to change, and fast," wrote Ybarra. "I'm a big fan and will always bleed green... Pick your lane and stick to it... It's simple to me, Xbox should strive to be the world's largest publisher of entertainment content. Get rid of everything else and get focused. Do not be afraid to say what you are. Embrace the lane... Straddling the fence is not a winning plan."</p><p>A recent report suggested that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/major-xbox-layoffs-reportedly-coming-soon/1100-6532671/" data-ref-id="1100-6532671">a new round of layoffs may hit Microsoft's gaming division</a> as soon as this week.

<p>Another console port first</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Hamster, known for its suite of retro <strong>Arcade Archives</strong> ports, has revealed its next Switch 2 game as part of the Arcade Archives 2 series. And, just like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-ridge-racer">Ridge Racer</a>, it's another polygonal arcade-to-home port. This time around, it's <strong>Air Combat 22</strong>, which is coming to both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/arcade_archives_air_combat_22">Switch 1</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/arcade_archives_2_air_combat_22">Switch 2</a> on <strong>3rd July 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/06/namcos-air-combat-22-is-coming-to-arcade-archives-on-ps4-ps5-switch-and-xbox">Time Extension</a> (via <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202506/46058">Famitsu</a>), Air Combat 22 is an arcade game from 1995 and a spin-off of the original 1993 <strong>Air Combat</strong> arcade game. These games would eventually become part of what we know as the <strong>Ace Combat</strong> series, which actually celebrates its 30th anniversary <em>today</em> (for the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/air_combat">console port of the original</a>, at least).</p>
<p>The Switch 1 version comes in at <strong>$14.99</strong>, with the Switch 2 one priced at <strong>$16.99</strong>. And, those of you who don't have a Switch 2 yet, you'll be able to buy an upgrade pack when you eventually upsize for <strong>$2.99</strong>.</p>
<p>Both versions of the game come with "Original Mode", "High Score Mode", and "Caravan Mode", but the Arcade Archives 2 version (for Switch 2) will also get a resolution bump and additional modes such as "Time Attack" (not Network Mode though, as this is a single player game).</p>

<p>Air Combat 22 was a step-up in nearly every way to its predecessor. Named for running on the Super System 22 hardware, the game let you choose form one of three aircrafts — Grumman F-14 Tomcat, Sukhoi Su-27 and the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor</p>
<p>Notably, this is the first time that Air Combat 22 has ever received a console port, so it's fantastic that we're finally getting it in a more-accessible format. And if the Ridge Racer Switch 2 version is anything to go by, you're in for a treat.</p>
<p>Let's hope we get more Ace Combat love on Switch 2, especially after the fantastic <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ace_combat_7_skies_unknown_deluxe_edition">Ace Combat 7</a> port.</p>
