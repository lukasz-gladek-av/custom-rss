			<p><strong>GameStop</strong>, the largest retailer dedicated to videogames, is reportedly <strong>shutting down hundreds of stores in the United States</strong>. </p>



<p>The reports started appearing on social media and were quickly conflated into one very long list on the '<a href="https://gsclosing.blogspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GameStop Closing List'</a> blog, which reckons there are at least <strong>410 GameStop stores confirmed to be closing</strong> and another 11 reported but as of yet unconfirmed.</p>



<p>This is only the latest round of closures for the retailer headquartered in Grapevine, Texas. In the annual 10-K SEC filing <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000162828025014731/gme-20250201.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">issued in February 2025</a>, the company stated:</p>



<p><em>We have also initiated a comprehensive store portfolio optimization review which involves identifying stores for closure based on many factors, including an evaluation of current market conditions and individual store performance. This review, among other things, resulted in the closure of 590 stores in the United States in fiscal 2024. While this review is ongoing and a specific set of stores has not been identified for closure, we anticipate closing a significant number of additional stores in fiscal 2025.</em></p>



<p>The employees being let go are understandably furious, especially since the latest wave of cuts occurred shortly after another SEC filing was issued this Wednesday, January 7, when GameStop <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000132638026000004/pressrelease-rclti.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> a massive performance-based stock option for its current CEO, <strong>Ryan Cohen</strong>. Cohen, who assumed the role on September 28, 2023, is the largest individual shareholder and stands to gain up to <strong>$35 billion</strong> (yes, you read that right), albeit with a massive caveat: the company’s market capitalization would have to grow to $100 billion and the company would need to achieve $10 billion in Cumulative Performance EBITDA.</p>



<p>Considering that GameStop's current market <span>capitalization as of yesterday's closing was&nbsp;<strong>$9.51 billion</strong>, Cohen would have to somehow stage a 10-fold market capitalization</span> growth to receive his full bonus. Granted, there is a precedent: in January 2021, a short squeeze <a href="https://wccftech.com/gamestop-shares-soar-70-as-short-sellers-account-hacked-children-harassed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">caused the company's stock to </a><span><a href="https://wccftech.com/gamestop-shares-soar-70-as-short-sellers-account-hacked-children-harassed/" target="_blank">surge significantly</a>, briefly reaching an</span> astounding pre-market value of <strong>$500 per share</strong> on January 28, almost thirty times the share's valuation earlier that month. Even then, though, the market cap only reached $33.7 billion, still quite far from that $100 billion threshold required by Cohen's bonus. And with the constant shift toward digital games, it's hard to imagine how the company could achieve such a high valuation. </p>



<p>There are, however, nine vesting tranches, the first of which is definitely more achievable for the executive.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Tranche</strong></td><td><strong>% of Award</strong></td><td><strong>Market Cap Hurdle</strong></td><td><strong>Cumulative Performance EBITDA Hurdle</strong></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>10%</td><td>$20 Billion</td><td>$2.0 Billion</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>10%</td><td>$30 Billion</td><td>$3.0 Billion</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>10%</td><td>$40 Billion</td><td>$4.0 Billion</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>10%</td><td>$50 Billion</td><td>$5.0 Billion</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>10%</td><td>$60 Billion</td><td>$6.0 Billion</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>10%</td><td>$70 Billion</td><td>$7.0 Billion</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>10%</td><td>$80 Billion</td><td>$8.0 Billion</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>15%</td><td>$90 Billion</td><td>$9.0 Billion</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>15%</td><td>$100 Billion</td><td>$10.0 Billion</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>By the way, GameStop is also restructuring its operations in other countries. They sold their Italian operations, closed down in Germany, Ireland, Switzerland, and Austria, and shared their intent to sell the Canadian branch. Now, <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/business/583322/eb-games-proposes-closing-all-new-zealand-stores" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to RNZ</a>, they might be looking to close in New Zealand, too, although the proposal is apparently 'not final'. They currently have 38 stores there.</p>

Luckily, we've got games to keep us busy, and we're going to go through which of the buggers we plan on playing this weekend.</p>
<p>In case you've missed the main headlines this week, let's take a peek at what's been going on in the world of Nintendo. First up, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/fire_emblem_path_of_radiance">Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</a> was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/nintendo-expands-switch-2s-gamecube-library-with-another-game">released on the GameCube NSO app</a> for the Switch 2, so that's lovely. Fans of green and purple will also be pleased to know that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/nintendo-reveals-first-new-joy-con-2-colours-for-switch-2">new Joy-Con colours</a> are being released in just a few short days.</p>
<p>We got a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/mario-tennis-fever-overview-trailer-serves-up-a-host-of-fresh-features">new overview trailer</a> for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a>, which is looking really solid so far, while more 'evidence' emerged to suggest that <strong>Call of Duty</strong> might <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/rumour-call-of-dutys-nintendo-release-is-apparently-on-target-for-2026">finally make its way to Nintendo platforms</a> this year.</p>
<p>And now, let's see what Team NL is up to this weekend, hm?</p>
<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>It's a more-of-the-same week for me, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cast-n-chill-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Cast n Chill</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/skate-story">Skate Story</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/expelled">Expelled</a> still occupying the left side of my Switch 2 home screen. The GameCube NSO app is there now, too, thanks to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/fire_emblem_path_of_radiance">Path of Radiance</a> dropping, and I also dipped back into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shinobi_art_of_vengeance">Shinobi</a> the other morning with my coffee.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I'll be valiantly resisting the eShop sale. Gotta love that post-holidays quarterly tax bill. Have a good one, folks.</p>
<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I love Star Wars, but it's a franchise I really have to be in the mood for. As such, I often take lengthy breaks before diving back in. The good thing about this is that there's often a boatload of new content to enjoy when I do eventually sidle back into the fandom. With that in mind, I'm playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/lego_star_wars_the_skywalker_saga">Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/star_wars_jedi_survivor">Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</a>, both on the PS5.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 is getting a bit of love, though. I'm currently making my way through <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, and it really is quite remarkable. Ubisoft nailed it with this one; it's just so darn fun with a wonderful sense of place.</p>

<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I don't remember the last time that my weekend gaming plans were dominated by free demos, but here we are! I haven’t had a chance to touch either <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</a>’s tasters yet, and I’m super excited to dive in. I’m not so excited by the prospect of falling madly in love with both of them and ending up with two meaty RPGs on my plate to start the year, but that’s the risky game I play.</p>
<p>Oh yes, I was also lucky enough to finally get Star Wars Outlaws on Switch 2 over the holidays, so I have been busy tinkering around with all of the side quests I intentionally left untouched once I heard it was coming to the hybrid. May the Force be with you, dear readers!</p>
<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>Being a Portuguese myself it never gets old listening to Portuguese NPCs speaking fluent Portuguese in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>. Really, they’re a bit everywhere in the game, I hope it all works out for them in the end (historical spoilers: It does not). I am not sure in exactly what percentage of the main story I have already completed, but there will surely be many hours spend this weekend in virtual 16th century Japan.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> left me wanting more trooper based action so after a four year hiatus I have reinstalled <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-one/halo_the_master_chief_collection">Halo: The Master Chief Collection</a> on STEAM and resumed my single player campaign marathon where I had left it (two thirds into Halo 2). Having just completed (and loved) Halo 3 ODST, I am moving on to Halo 4.</p>
<p>Game of the week is actually a demo: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</a> is just a very cosy JRPG that ticks all my boxes. I hope to compete said demo before the real villain shows up: Monday!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Like the rest of the Imperium, the borders and planets that make up the homeworlds of the Ultramarines have been eroded over time, but with the return of the Chapter's Primarch, Roboute Guilliman, the time has come to push back against their enemies. But who should lead this campaign? Captain Titus has been chosen, freshly promoted out of Space Marine 2, to his former rank. Titus deploys with a new entourage to back up his new title of Master of the Watch and faces off a new Necron threat. In this article, we check out the new <em>Warhammer 40K</em> 500 Worlds Titus campaign books, and the new miniatures for Captain Titus, and 2 Necron enemies.</p><p>We've been covering <em>Warhammer 40K</em> for a while on the site, and you can check out our full <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/warhammer-40k-guide" rel="nofollow">Warhammer 40K Guide</a>, our preview for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/warhammer-40k-leviathan-first-look" rel="nofollow">Leviathan box</a> that launched the latest edition of the rules, or the most recent wave of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/crux-terminatus-battleforce-marneus-calgar-and-friends-review-codex-compliant" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Ultramarines and Space Marine reinforcements</a>.</p>
<p>Most Space Marine legions have a home base, either a world from which they exclusively recruit from, or a ship where they live nomadic lives, recruiting suitable candidates wherever they can find them. Before the events of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/warhammer-horus-heresy-guide" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Horus Heresy</a>, the Ultramarines had an entire sector of planets, known as the 500 Worlds, or simply Ultramar.&nbsp;</p><p>The Ultramarines still recruit and manage this sub-sector of space, but their empire has shrunk over the last 10,000 years, eroded by enemy forces from without and emerging cults from within. Now, the time has come to reclaim it all.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>The Campaign Books</h2><p>With the return of the Chapter's Primarch (in <em>40K</em> 8th edition) and after starting his new Lord Commander duties, for which the Indomitus campaign still takes up a lot of his time, he has started a new campaign to regain these 500 worlds. Missions of reclamation have been given to the Ultramarines and their successor chapters, warriors originally pulled from the same gene-seed as the Ultramarines, but divided into smaller forces to avoid the huge collections of warriors that had such a critial effect during the events of the Horus Heresy.</p><p>500 Worlds Titus is a set of 4 linked books detailing the campaign. The first, simply 500 Worlds Titus, details the backgrond for the Ultramar sub-sector and the imperial forces that defend it. This includes some fantastic maps of the sub-sector and the 4 fronts of the campaign, information about 10 Ultramarine successor chapters, and details about Captain Demetrian Titus and his new retinue.</p><p>The book also includes background for the Necrons and their place in the sub-sector, along with specific details about the 2 new Necron miniatures we discuss later in this article. The book closes with the narrative around the campaign featuring Titus battling against these new enemies.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>The second book, 500 Worlds Titus - War of the Vespator Front, is a full campaign system for fighting linked battles as part of the 500 Worlds reclaimation campaign in the Eastern tetra of the 500 Worlds. In the campaign, players build their forces and create alliances, then battle each other and record campaign points. The book details some unique Vespatro Front events for use in game, along with details of the various theatres of war with terrain guidance and unique twists. The book also has a dedicated mission pack, with 6 new missions to play out the various scenarios in the campaign.</p><p>The third book, 500 Worlds Titus - Dread Incursions, entirely focuses on <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-40k-boarding-actions-compendium-review" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">boarding actions</a>, which is one of my favorite ways to play <em>Warhammer 40K</em>. The book includes rule adaptations for boarding action missions, 2 brand new boarding action detachments, Shield of the Void for the Ultramarines, and Harbinger Cabal for the Necrons. It also includes 3 campaigns of linked missions that use the 12 missions included in the book.</p><p>The final book, 500 Worlds Titus - Detachments, is a 16-page booklet with new Detachments for both the Space Marines (Orbital Assault Force, Bastion Task Force, and Reclamation Force) and Necrons (Pantheon of Woe, Cursed Legion, and Cryptek Conclave). All of these Detachments are available in the newly updated <a href="https://chrome-extension//efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://assets.warhammer-community.com/eng_07-01_warhammer_40000_faction_pack_space_marines-9ps9uold3v-zei03cythi.pdf" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Space Marine Faction Pack</a> and <a href="https://chrome-extension//efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://assets.warhammer-community.com/eng_07-01_warhammer_40000_faction_pack_necrons-wgehvvo84t-ijjxadnsk6.pdf" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Necron Faction Pack</a>. Detachments are new with this edition of <em>40K</em> and give unique special rules for your forces, and usually some restrictions on the units you can take.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Captain Titus and Friends</h2><p>Titus returns to <em>40K</em> as a Captain, with a new entourage in tow. Previously available as Lieutenant Titus as a limited edition miniature (and in the <em>Space Marine II</em> board game), he now returns to his former rank to fulfil his new duties as Master of the Watch, defending the boundaries of the 500 Worlds.&nbsp;</p><p>Captain Titus comes in a box of 7 miniatures, which includes Titus and the Wardens of Ultramar - Veteran Sergeant Metaurus (who you might know from the <em>Secret Level</em> episode on Amazon Prime), Ancient Gadriel (whom Titus served with in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Space Marine II</em></a> video game), Lucia Vestha (plenipotentiary of Ultramar), Astropath Dainal Kornelius, Gaius Silva (Veteran Commodore of the Ultramar Defence Fleet), and Aemelia Minervas (Commander of the 30th Macragge Defence Auxilia).</p><p>On the tabletop, Titus is extremely difficult to kill as his Honour of Ultramar ability means that if he would be removed and hasn't fought yet, on a 2+, Titus can fight immediately after the attack is resolved, and if he destroys a model, he gets D3 wounds back. He can also fight later in the phase as his usual action, but he can only use the Honour of Ultramar ability once per turn.</p><p>The Wardens of Ultramar deploy as a unit that Titus can join, and includes all 6 of the Wardens. They all have different armaments and can redeploy 3 units after both players have set up, including putting these 3 additional units into strategic reserves if that suits your plan after seeing how your opponent has deployed. The Wardens can also join another unit, but if they do that, only Titus can join on top (they can't bring a different Space Marine hero).</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>C’tan Shard of the Nightbringer and Nekrosor Ammentar</h2><p>The enemies the Ultramarines face in the 500 Worlds campaign also get some reinforcements. Leading these enemies is Nekrosor Ammentar, a hero of the Destroyer Cult. Nekrosor is rapid, with a 10-inch movement, which is useful as they work best up close. At distance, they have the 18-inch range Enmitic Disintegrators, with 4 attacks, armor piercing -2, and sustained hits 2 for extra damage on 6s. But up close in melee is where they excel, with 2 different attacks for a total of 12 melee attacks, which benefit from Nekrosor's own Infecious Murder-madness aura that gives nearby Necron units sustained hits 1.</p><p>Releasing alongside Nekrosor is a new C'Tan Shard of the Nightbringer miniature, which has had their stats updated alongside the new release. Shard of the Nightbringer is a combat monster. In melee, they can target armored enemies with a strike from their sythe, doing 6 attacks at strength 14, armor piercing -4 and dealing D6+2 wounds each, or sweep attack for hordes with 14 attacks at strength 8, armor piercing -2, dealing 2 wounds each. To add extra killiness for anything that survives that, at the end of the fight phase, any enemies within 6 inches take D3 mortal wounds on a 4+.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Warhammer 40K 500 Worlds Titus Final Thoughts?</h2><p>I absolutely love this whole campaign. The format of the 500 Worlds campaign book is fantastic, with the background, campaign, boarding actions and new detachments, and releasing the new commanders for both forces alongside it makes it feel fresh and exciting. It's all geared towards Ultramarines and Necrons, so if you don't play either of those, the narrative, new detachments and new miniatures won't appeal that much to you, but the campaign gives players of any faction a chance to join, even if you don't have any Space Marine players as you can just tweak the narrative to a group of aligned forces trying to push back against the borders against another group.</p><p>The new miniatures of Titus and the Wardens, C’tan Shard of the Nightbringer, and Nekrosor Ammentar are all fantastic and full of detail. Both Necrons are murder machines on the tabletop, and I love that you can put Titus and the Wardens into another unit that can sit on and dominate an objective, and having to take Titus out twice is a fantastic mechanic that captures the lore-armor for a famous Space Marine hero.</p><hr><p><em>The copies of</em> <strong>Warhammer 40K 500 Worlds Titus, Titus and the Necrons&nbsp;</strong><em>used to produce this review were provided by Games Workshop.</em></p></div><div><p><span><div>

<p>Fans of both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a> can apparently look forward to "free major updates" this month and next. There are no specific release dates just yet, but here's a rough translation (via RPG Site):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Akihiro Hino:</strong> "This is the video published internally in Level-5 on the last working day of 2025. It was done in a rather interesting way, so I'm sharing it with everyone too. Once again, please support us in 2026 as well. Both Inazuma Eleven and Fantasy Life i will have free major updates in January and February. We'll also do an Inadai [stream] on January 13. Look forward to it!"</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067hxlmku&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-barricades-exploit-shield/</link>
            <guid>1402348</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In recent hours, clips have started emerging on social media showcasing ARC Raiders players creating mobile barricade systems via a newly-discovered exploit. With the assistance of ziplines and deployable barricades, users are building semi-useless bulletproof shields that they can carry either in front of themselves or as a complete, 360-degree shield.</p>



<p>It sounds strange, and it’s hard to convey, so be sure to check out the clips below to understand what we’re talking about.</p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-barricade-exploit-is-pretty-hilarious">ARC Raiders Barricade Exploit is Pretty Hilarious</h2>



<p>The recent barricade exploit in ARC Raiders has been popularized by streamers like TheBurntPeanut. The award-winning streamer was captured experimenting with the exploit during a recent broadcast, when one of his teammates – Hutch – was seen enshrouded by a four-barricade shield.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In a later clip, the creator was using a bizarre contraption made up of a barricade, zipline, and jolt mine to push along a corridor while trying to deflect damage with his mobile shield. It wasn’t a successful effort, which has prompted ARC Raiders players to ridicule the exploit, dubbing it completely pointless.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple to complete this exploit. For those wanting to build a large, mobile shield, you’ll need four ziplines, four deployable barricades, and a ‘depot battery’. You need to place ziplines onto the battery, and then once deployed, you can place a barricade <strong>on </strong>the zipline, with a little fiddling around.</p>



<p>Do that four times, and you have your shield.</p>



<p>In the second clip from TheBurntPeanut, you can see the zipline trick was only completed once, creating a ‘riot shield’ of sorts rather than an encircling barricade.</p>







<p>Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you have any fun playing around with this new exploit in ARC Raiders.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/mpc-25-kicked-out-of-cdl-by-pro-players/</link>
            <guid>1402345</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Call of Duty League has come under intense scrutiny once again from fans due to a questionable GA that has locked down anyone attempting to use the MPC-25 SMG. The weapon was used <strong>very briefly</strong> in recent days, most notably by Skyz, and all of a sudden, pro players have decided to nix the gun ahead of Major I.</p>



<p>This pushes the CDL back to a two-weapon meta, forcing players to use the Dravec and M15 once again, prompting an outcry from fans desperate for a little variety ahead of the season’s first Major tournament.</p>







<h2 id="h-mpc-25-is-gone-from-the-cdl">MPC-25 is Gone From the CDL</h2>



<p>The MPC-25 lasted no time at all in the Call of Duty League, the top flight of COD esports. It was used for a couple of hours and then pushed clean out of the rotation by a fresh GA (Gentleman’s Agreement).</p>



<p>This has prompted fans of the League to take to social media to rage against ‘soft’ pro players who will do anything to control every facet of the ecosystem.</p>



<p>ACHES, one of the most prolific former pro players in the space, said: <em>‘Slasher retired and the next day they GA’d the one gun used on 2 maps. The last of the old guard is gone.’</em></p>



<p>Sam ‘Octane’ Larew, one of the more recent retirees from the Call of Duty League, wrote:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The current set of pro players gotta be the most cry baby pussy set of players COD has ever had. They’d GA the M8 in BO3. <a href="https://t.co/esK6xiC1n8">https://t.co/esK6xiC1n8</a></p>— Sam “Octane” Larew (@OctaneSam) <a href="https://twitter.com/OctaneSam/status/2009833696279617691?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 10, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Many pointed out how ‘busted’ the MPC-25 is under a 10-meter range, which is the leading reason behind the GA, but others have stressed that it simply doesn’t hold a candle to the existing meta and should have been left alone.</p>



<p>Another CDL fan wrote, <em>‘The MPC gets demolished outside of like 12 meters by the Dravec and M15, you’re taking a BIG risk pulling out an MPC, and you’re rewarded with a better TTK up close. That’s how it should be. Pros just HATE 3 gun metas, BO7’s our last good cod in a long time, we’re wasting it.’</em></p>







<p>Do you think the MPC-25 should have been given a fairer chance in the Call of Duty League? Let us know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Apex Legends Hackers Are Taking Control of Your Character Again]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/apex-legends-hackers-taking-control-character/</link>
            <guid>1402342</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><strong>Update: </strong>At the same minute as this article was posted, the Apex Legends team gave an update confirming the resolution of this issue: ‘This incident is now resolved with the help of our community. Anti-Cheat is a constant cat-and-mouse game and your reports are imperative to bringing information to our attention, including the one that helped us today. Thanks for your patience as our teams jumped to tackle and resolve this issue.’</p>



<p>Fans have taken to social media to cry out against the latest Apex Legends hack. The situation is dire, and ‘a bad actor’ is utilizing an unknown exploit to control other players’ characters in the popular battle royale game. This has led to Respawn making an official statement declaring an ‘active security incident’.</p>



<p>In a two-minute clip uploaded on social media, users get a first-hand look at the depth of this issue. In the video, a player is toyed with multiple times, with the hacker emptying their inventory and throwing them off the map.</p>











<p>In a post on social media, the team at Respawn Entertainment wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are aware of an active security incident where a bad actor is able to control the inputs of another player remotely in (Apex Legends).</p>



<p>Based on our initial investigation, we have not identified evidence that suggests the bad actors can install or execute code as in the case of an RCE or injection attack. </p>



<p>We are actively working on a solution and will update you when we have more information.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This message was posted a few hours after a clip surfaced showcasing the exploit in question:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>This is far from being the first major hacking incident to hit Apex Legends, one of the oldest and most popular battle royale games on the market. In January 2025, some of the most notable pro players had their accounts hijacked, and in March 2024, the Apex Legends Global Series was <strong>taken over </strong>by malicious operators during a live broadcast, and the hack was <strong>very similar </strong>to this one.</p>



<p>Fans were quick to criticize the situation in the comments under Respawn’s post. One user pointed out:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Apex is a security risk to have installed at this point</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Another wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>lol maybe if they focused more on Anti-Cheats and better security they wouldn’t have these problems but instead they focus on buffing characters and more boring events.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Use these Roblox Death In The Box monthly redeem codes to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Wheelspins and much more.</p>



<p>Death In The Box is a popular <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-roblox-volleyball-legends-codes-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> experience that drops players into the middle of a high-stakes survival and strategy game. Players are required to compete against up to 15 other participants upon launch, and from there, navigate through a series of deadly challenges orchestrated by a menacing clown figure. With a unique blend of luck-based events and strategic card play, Death In The Box offers an intense competitive experience where players must outthink and outlast their opponents to be the last one standing.</p>







<p>Having been released in August 2023, Death In The Box has gradually gained traction and now boasts over 87 million visits with an active player base of more than 2,000 players. Although mastering the card system and understanding strategic voting mechanics is enough for players to improve their survival chances, using redeem codes to get extra Wheelspins is never a bad idea.</p>

<p>As of the writing of this article, there are no expired codes, so players can redeem the active codes safely.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Death In The Box Codes Menu | Image By Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Redeeming Death In The Box codes is a fairly straightforward matter, and they have made sure that even newer players to the game can navigate to the codes section and claim their rewards without too much fuss. Here’s how:</p>



<ol>
<li>Launch Death In The Box in Roblox</li>



<li>Click on the button with the gears on the left-hand side of the screen</li>



<li>At the base of the pop-box, there will be a text box for codes</li>



<li>Enter or paste the active code in the box</li>



<li>Click on ‘Confirm Code’ to collect the freebie</li>
</ol>







<h2 id="h-how-to-get-more-death-in-the-box-codes">How To Get More Death In The Box Codes</h2>



<p>Death In The Box codes are typically released through the game’s community and developer channels, but they don’t appear automatically in-game. The best places to catch them early are the official Death In The Box Discord server, which features a dedicated announcements channel where all new codes are posted first, and the ARK-ADE Roblox group, where updates and milestones are announced.</p>



<p>Codes often come out around special events, major updates, or game milestones, but if you’re only checking sporadically, you’ll very easily miss them because no alert system tells players when a code drops—or when it stops working. Because of this, the easiest strategy is to save this guide in your browser and check back instead of trying to monitor every source yourself.</p>



<p>This page is refreshed as soon as new codes go live, and any expired codes are removed promptly, so you always see only the ones that are still active.</p>

<figure data-uuid="db4a5556cf705"><a title="Beast of Reincarnation" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/db4a5556cf705/beast-of-reincarnation.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Game Freak</em></figcaption></figure><p>The Pokémon developer Game Freak recently released the DLC <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension">Mega Dimension</a>, so what's it up to beyond this? In case you missed it <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/game-freaks-upcoming-action-rpg-looks-awesome-but-dont-expect-it-on-switch-2-yet">when it was revealed last year</a>, the studio has a new action RPG <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/beast_of_reincarnation"><strong>Beast of Reincarnation</strong></a> in the pipeline.</p>
<p>In an update this week, it's now been revealed we'll be hearing more about it at Xbox's upcoming <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2026/01/xbox-developer-direct-2026-showcase-gets-official-date-alongside-three-confirmed-games">Developer Direct showcase</a>, taking place later this month on <strong>22nd January 2026</strong>. This latest broadcast from Xbox promises to give fans an "inside look at not just the games" but also "the studios working to bring them to life".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>We’ll also be taking a trip to Tokyo to visit the legendary Game Freak, offering a first in-depth look at</em> <em>Beast of Reincarnation</em><em>, which we revealed at Xbox Games Showcase last year."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, while there may not necessarily be any Nintendo-related announcements here, we might at least get a look at the inner workings of Game Freak and how it goes about developing new projects.</p>
<p>For now, Beast of Reincarnation will release on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, PC and Game Pass. It was officially revealed in June 2025 (just days after the launch of the Switch 2) and is published by Fictions and directed by Kota Furushima - a Game Freak employee who has <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Kota_Furushima">worked on the battle system and sound</a> in past Pokémon releases.</p>
<p>Beasts of Reincarnation is described as "an expansive one-person, one-dog action RPG built around demanding, technical combat". Here's a slightly more detailed description and the trailer from last June:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>In post-apocalyptic Japan, a land ruined by corruption and crawling with monstrous beasts, humanity’s last hope may rest with Emma—an outcast cursed as a Blighted One—and Koo, her loyal canine companion. Survive a journey across an ominous, ever-changing world where dangerous forests can erupt in the wasteland. As Emma and Koo push deeper into the unknown, their bond strengthens—and with it, strange powers bloom.</em>"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although Game Freak has mostly focused on major Pokémon projects over the years, in between these releases, it has worked on its own unique titles. During the Switch generation, it released games such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/little_town_hero">Little Town Hero</a> across multiple platforms and even revived <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pocket_card_jockey_ride_on">Pocket Card Jockey</a>.</p>
<p>As for its latest Pokémon DLC Mega Dimension, it's not bad, but like the base game it lacks the freedom of the core series.</p>

<p>Games Workshop announces plans to bring Warhammer World to the United States by 2027</p>



<p>For those enthralled by the Warhammer universe, a Warhammer World could be coming to the United States within the next two years. Games Workshop announced on their website that they have begun working on the second Warhammer World just outside of Washington, DC.</p>







<h2 id="h-warhammer-world-in-the-u-s-won-t-be-a-full-blown-recreation-of-nottingham-location">Warhammer World In The U.S. Won’t Be A Full-Blown Recreation Of Nottingham Location</h2>



<p>The original Warhammer World first opened in Nottingham, England, in 1999. It is currently the ultimate destination for Warhammer fans, featuring a dedicated shop, dioramas on display in the Warhammer Museum, and more. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/u6jqjmvz/a-warhammer-world-in-the-usa-get-the-details-here/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">On their website, Games Workshop</a> notes that the future American Warhammer World won’t be a brick-by-brick recreation of the original. However, they hope to create something special for Americans passionate about the Warhammer hobby.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Based just outside Washington DC, this new Warhammer World will be a flagship venue that celebrates Warhammer in all its forms: gaming, painting, modelling, storytelling, events, and community.</p>
</blockquote>







<p>As for the video game side of Warhammer 40,000, Space Marine 3 is<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warhammer-40000-space-marine-3-is-in-development"> currently in development</a>, but there are still free updates planned for Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 later this year.

<p>Masahiro Sakurai is one of the most well-known game developers in the industry. Best known for his work in the Kirby and Super Smash Bros. franchises, he remains a pillar of Nintendo.</p>



<p>Now, he’s discussing the changes the game development process has undergone over the years and why he’s not a fan of massive teams.</p>







<h2 id="h-masahiro-sakurai-dislikes-how-game-development-teams-continue-to-increase-in-size">Masahiro Sakurai Dislikes How Game Development Teams Continue To Increase In Size</h2>



<p>Recently, he was interviewed by Japan’s <a href="https://www.47news.jp/13701368.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">47NEWS</a> and discussed how much more satisfying it is to see the results of your work when you work solo, rather than constantly checking in with others. To him, the strength of an individual’s work runs the risk of getting lost in the shuffle when part of a larger team.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Talking specifically about game development, it’s very satisfying to see the results of your hard work,” Sakurai said<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/smash-bros-creator-masahiro-sakurai-says-it-can-be-really-frustrating-working-on-massive-games-with-hundreds-of-devs-there-is-work-that-clearly-shows-your-results-and-work-that-doesnt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> (via GamesRadar+)</a>. “You don’t get this when working in a team, and it can be really frustrating. For example, when a pixel artist draws a picture by themselves then they of course finished it. But when managing a team, it’s often difficult because you have to keep talking about what kind of pixel art is suitable.</p>
</blockquote>







<blockquote>
<p>“I feel like this is getting more difficult with large-scale games. Staff size is rapidly increasing into the hundreds. The sense of fulfillment gained from making something by yourself is different to something made as part of a group. What you are meant to do is also changing.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Sakurai recently helmed the development of Kirby Air Riders, released exclusively on the Nintendo Switch 2. Check out our coverage of the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/?s=kirby+air+riders">here</a>.</p>

It includes an exhibition centre with dramatic, large-scale dioramas featuring everything from famous battles in the grimdark sci-fi setting Warhammer 40,000 to the fantasy world of Age of Sigmar.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For competitors, a sizeable castle-themed gaming hall lets fans play matches, often in scheduled tournaments. There’s a themed bar and restaurant, areas to paint miniatures, and an in-house store with exclusive products.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In a post on <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/u6jqjmvz/a-warhammer-world-in-the-usa-get-the-details-here/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Warhammer Community</a>, Games Workshop confirmed its plans to start work on the new Warhammer World, to be built just outside Washington DC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This new Warhammer World will be a flagship venue that celebrates Warhammer in all its forms: gaming, painting, modelling, storytelling, events, and community,” Games Workshop said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The original Warhammer World in Nottingham, UK sets a very high bar. We’re not going to replicate it brick-for-brick, but instead build something equally uncompromising on quality and experience, something worthy of Warhammer’s rich settings and of course the title ‘Warhammer World.’ And of course, at the heart of all this is creating something extraordinary for all of you — the Warhammer fans!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Now, there’s a lot to do – but with a fair wind, and the might of the Emperor and his inexhaustible armies, we hope to open the doors late in 2027.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Total War: Warhammer 40,000 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With this new Warhammer World, Games Workshop is clearly hoping to reinforce its explosive success and the ever-increasing popularity of Warhammer 40,000 in particular, which in recent years has grown far beyond the confines of a tabletop game. Its loyal fandom fusses over lore, analyzes new novels for fresh insight into the setting, and speculates about future development. The smash hit video game Space Marine 2 boosted interest in all things Warhammer 40,000 — so much so that playable character <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/games-workshop-just-promoted-titus-from-space-marine-2-with-a-fancy-new-trailer-that-sets-up-the-next-narrative-expansion-for-warhammer-40000">Titus is now the poster boy of the tabletop game and is even at the heart of its next narrative expansion</a>. And former Superman actor Henry Cavill’s upcoming Warhammer 40,000 Cinematic Universe for Amazon will undoubtedly take it to new heights. It makes a lot of sense to have a Warhammer World in place to capitalize on the army of newcomers Cavill’s Prime Video work will surely rally together. (Cavill once visited Warhammer World in the UK and posted a video of his tour on Instagram.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the shorter term, Warhammer 40,000 fans are bracing themselves for an announcement and release of the 11th Edition of the game, accompanying lore developments, and new model releases. And we’re arguably in the golden age of Warhammer 40,000 video games, with Space Marine 2 still receiving updates, Space Marine 3 in the works, and Dawn of War 4 and Total War: Warhammer 40,000 waiting in the wings.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>AI is a bubble – one whose futuristic sheen deflects attention from a core of hot air. Anyone with sense recognizes this. But will it finally burst this year? Unfortunately, we have our doubts. On the latest <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/aftermath-hours/"><u>Aftermath Hours</u></a>, we talk about that.</p><p>We begin the episode by diving into the good and the bad of this brand new year. First we reflect on my time attending Awesome Games Done Quick, the annual speedrunning marathon that raises money for charity and <a href="https://aftermath.site/agdq-2026-interview-speedrun-convention-charity/"><u>just generally rules</u></a>. Gaming communities can be forces for good – at least, when they don’t allow their ranks to be overwhelmed by shitheads. Who knew? Then we move on to less positive happenings: Ubisoft just <a href="https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-halifax-closed-weeks-after-unionizing-cwa-canada/"><u>shut down an entire studio mere weeks after its workers voted to unionize</u></a>. Suspicious, to say the least.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, we close out the show by predicting the year ahead with 100 percent, crystal-clear accuracy. Will <em>GTA 6</em> finally come out? Yes. <em>Elder Scrolls VI</em>? Absolutely not. As for the aforementioned AI bubble, well, it’s complicated (see below).</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Spotify</u></a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Apple</u></a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can forge a giant needle with which to personally pop the AI bubble, ushering in a new era of peace and prosperity.</p>
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p>Here’s an excerpt from the conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Do we think that this is the year the AI bubble bursts?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>It’s hard to tell. You can say with certainty that it’s about to burst, but it’s been about to burst for a while now, and I’m skeptical that [it’s gonna happen overnight]. Your brain says it has to, and then all of this is a fiction anyway, so maybe they can continue to make it go, but it will just get shittier.</p><p>I think yes, but that presumes the shared reality that we will have lines up with how things work.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>When you think about NFTs or whatever, they required people to buy them, and nobody bought them. The metaverse required people to use it, and nobody used it. But here, it doesn’t seem to matter. In order for the bubble to burst, it has to float into a wall. What is the wall that it hits? Even if none of us have docked it at this point, does it matter? [Companies] shove it into Microsoft Office, or they put it in Google, and I don’t use it, but they can charge me more for my G Suite.</p><p>I’m definitely on Team “It has to burst, come on, this is absurd,” but what causes it? One of those big investors pulls out? It makes enough children kill themselves?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Clearly not a problem in this country.&nbsp;</p><p>I think in the meantime also we’re gonna see more and more moments like <a href="https://aftermath.site/podcasts/aftermath-hours-podcast-larian-ai-divinity-baldurs-gate/"><u>what’s happening with Larian</u></a> where they talked about using AI to make games, people got mad at them, and it seems like they’re digging their heels in. But I think we’re gonna hear about AI usage on more major games, and people are gonna have to make up their minds about how they react – where they draw their lines in the sand. As long as executives continue to believe that they can use AI to improve efficiency, allowing them to make games faster and for less money, they’re not gonna step back from this ledge.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> One thing I will say is that the sentiment toward AI will continue to get more and more rancid. Starting the year off with what Grok has been doing and with what X has been doing, I think it is only going to get worse. I don’t know if that actually means anything materially to these companies. But with Grok doing sex crimes out in the open, there’s a nonzero chance it ends with X getting removed from the App Store in some capacity. Being on X could be a crime at this point. As people live with it more and more, it’s gonna become a meme how bad this shit is.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I hope so. My concern is that people will grow numb to it. Going along with what I said a moment ago about people finding out that their favorite games are being made with AI, it also feels like a lot of those companies and a lot of the people in charge are gonna do their best to convince everyone that it’s here, it was inevitable, and now you’ve just gotta live with it. To try to win through attrition, basically – to get people to begrudgingly accept that this is just how things are now. And so maybe those rancid vibes turn into people being like “Well, what can be done, really? This is just the world now.”</p><p>So that’s my concern: that people could succumb to a state of numbness and acceptance instead of maintaining that energy of “Fuck this shit, this is bad, and I don’t want it in any of the things that I use personally.”</p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/please-seek-help-immediately/"><div><p>Please Seek Help Immediately</p><p>Motherfucker have you listened to yourself</p><p><span>Luke Plunkett</span></p></div></a></figure>

            <title><![CDATA[2026 RPG That Lets You Ride Dragons Promises A Map Twice The Size of Skyrim]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/crimson-desert-map-size-dragon-skyrim-2000658542</link>
            <guid>1402180</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Yesterday brought us the inaugural New Game+ Showcase, in which multiple content creators decided to cut out the Kojima-glazing middleman and just show off a crapload of games. While the event ended up getting ridiculed a lot for feeling more like a podcast than a showcase, it did include interesting new glimpses of a number of upcoming games, including what claims to to be one of the largest open-world RPGs of 2026. </span></p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA7AZs4Gn_o"><i><span>Crimson Desert</span></i></a>,<span> the sprawling action-adventure with the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/crimson-desert-pearl-abyss-horse-drift-black-desert-onl-1850763397"><span>racecar-like horses</span></a><span> from </span><i><span>Black Desert Online</span></i><span> developers Pearl Abyss, is set to launch on March 19. PR rep Will Powers was asked during </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@newgameshowcase"><span>New Game+</span></a><span> about the actual size of the game world, after some of the initial previews gave the impression that the game’s pretty massive vistas were “just a tiny corner of the map.” Powers then gave an eye-popping answer:&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote><p><span>Twice the playable area of <em>Skyrim</em>. It’s larger than the map of <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>. The area that you’re playing in, the continent of Pywel is absolutely massive.</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>In fairness to Pearl Abyss, that’s not a terribly out-of-pocket thing for a developer largely known for </span><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/black-desert-online-has-made-usd1-7bn-in-revenue-to-date"><span>an enormously popular freemium MMORPG</span></a><span> to say, especially given how much of </span><i><span>Crimson Desert</span></i><span> looks like an MMORPG that eventually had a single-player action game grafted into it (</span><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/crimson-desert-release-date-trailer-online-gameplay/"><span>which is what actually happened</span></a><span>). But still, that’s a lot of game. Or at least a lot of game map.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Crimson Desert claims to have twice the playable area as Skyrim and a map larger than Red Dead Redemption 2 <a href="https://t.co/iCtLZ7IWU4">pic.twitter.com/iCtLZ7IWU4</a></p> <p>— Jake Lucky (@JakeSucky) <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeSucky/status/2009694157896663175?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 9, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>The footage shared thus far </span><a href="https://youtu.be/1ItNYP9U1M0"><span>in trailers and previews</span></a><span> does show a pretty world and some solid combat, and look, I will always give brownie points to any game that lets you ride a dragon. But what about the possibility that it will be a lot of space with no real purpose? Powers himself tries to cut off that concern at the pass. </span><i><span>“</span></i><span>Size doesn’t really matter if there’s nothing to do,</span><i><span>” he said “</span></i><span>Open-world games are about doing things, having activities, having distractions, so we wanted to create a world that’s not only massive but incredibly interactive</span><i><span>.”</span></i><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>To her credit, streamer Luality chimed in fairly often during the interview trying to press Powers on what kinds of interactions the player can look forward to in this giant world, asking if you can fight dragons or romance NPCs. The best Powers came up with in response was emphasizing </span><i><span>“</span></i><span>all sorts of deep crafting systems.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Therein lies the real issue with making promises about map size in the year of our Lord 2026: it’s long since become a useless metric. Having a game world the size of Australia is all well and good, you can even have it be full of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-game-pass-release-date-no-man-s-sky-bethesda-1849053885"><span>empty space to traverse</span></a><span>. But you have to do more with empty space than just fill it with crafting supplies. That’s a legitimate reason to praise games that actually make their terrain meaningful, like Kojima’s </span><i><span>Death Stranding 2</span></i><span>, and a reason to put on your skeptic glasses whenever anyone starts hyping up the size of their map rather than what’s in it. </span></p>

<p>The first Nintendo GameCube game to hit the Nintendo Switch Online service in 2026 is a pillar of one of Nintendo’s top franchises, one with a new game releasing later this year.</p>



<p>Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance is now playable for subscribers to Nintendo Switch Online as part of the Nintendo GameCube – Nintendo Classics service, which is exclusive to the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>







<h2 id="h-fire-emblem-takes-center-stage-in-2026">Fire Emblem Takes Center Stage in 2026</h2>



<p>Released in 2005, Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance is the sole game in the series released on the Nintendo GameCube. It’s also the first console game in the series to be released in the U.S. At the time, the game was received well critically. Since then, five more games have been released in the series. The game features Ike as the main character. He would go on to be a playable character in multiple Super Smash Bros. games.</p>



<p>Path of Radiance is the eighth Nintendo GameCube game to be made available on the Nintendo Switch Online service. However, unlike other releases such as F-Zero GX and Wario World, players know when the next game in the franchise will be coming to Nintendo Switch 2. Later this year, Fire Emblem: Fortune’s Weave will launch as a Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive. That game was announced during the September 2025 Nintendo Direct. As of this writing, there is no official release date for the game.</p>







<p>For more Nintendo news, check out details on the upcoming Mario Tennis Fever game. Featuring 38 characters, the game will have the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-unveils-new-features-and-characters-in-mario-tennis-fever-gameplay-overview-trailer/">largest roster in series history.</a></p>

              <p><span>GameStop has been in hot water for some time now. </span><span>But the company’s CEO, Ryan Cohen, should come away relatively unscathed</span><span>, because, thanks to</span> <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/07/business/gamestop-ceo-ryan-cohen-compensation-package"><span>CNN</span><span>,</span></a> <span>we now know he will score a $35 billion payout if the storefront hits a $100 billion market cap. One small issue: that’s about 10 times its current value.</span></p> <p><span>How is Cohen planning on getting it there? Thanks to a</span><a href="https://www.polygon.com/gamestop-closing-stores-as-ceo-payday/"> <i><span>Polygon</span></i><span> report</span></a><span>, we know that he intends to close hundreds of stores and to offer customers a 20 percent trade-in bonus via a QR code. Although we don’t have concrete numbers on exactly how many stores have been shut down, a</span><a href="https://gsclosing.blogspot.com/2025/12/january-2026-reported-closings.html"> <span>post on a blog</span></a><span> that tracks GameStop closures</span><span> reports that close to 400 stores have either already been closed this month or are set to be closed before the month is over.</span></p>

 <p><span>The trade coupon, meanwhile, was shared on the </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1q2h1j2/gamestop_really_put_a_trade_coupon_on_my_local/"><span>official GameStop Reddit</span></a><span> page by a user who posted their frustration about the closure of their local store, saying “GameStop really put a trade coupon on my local stores closing sign?” In that same thread, the </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1q2h1j2/comment/nxhrn13/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>original poster voiced their frustrations by calling it</span></a><span> “a fucking joke,” while others stated that they have begun canceling pre-orders.</span></p>

 <p><span>It’s also worth noting that GameStop closed 590 stores in 2024, according to a</span><a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001326380/000132638025000098/gme-20251101.htm"> <span>December 2025 SEC filing</span></a><span>. The filing goes on to state that the company plans on “closing a significant number of additional stores in fiscal 2025.” This is important because the 2025 fiscal year ends on January 31, 2026, which means more stores could close sooner rather than later. GameStop has also been closing stories across various countries worldwide. The same SEC Filing states that the company has already “exited” operations in Austria, Ireland, and Switzerland. In 2024, it also closed down store operations in Germany while selling off its Italian subsidiary.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Even as it shuts down stores en masse, GameStop has been doing everything it can to get attention back on the storefront over the last few months, partnering with popular influencers such as Casey Neistat and Mega64, and even with</span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/reels/DSIjPqvACxN/"> <span>Rilie Huntley</span></a><span>, a popular e-girl who originally went viral over a Best Buy ad. Just recently, the company had a </span><span>“</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/gamestop"><span>trade anything day</span></a><span>“</span><span> which saw people bringing in all sorts of things, including sex toys. Just a few days earlier, the</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/gamestop-power-pack-pokemon-tcg-trade-in-gengar-2000649582"> <span>GameStop card loot program led to a record-breaking $30,000 trade-in</span></a><span>.</span></p>

Here at <em>Game Informer</em>, we've been hard at work publishing stories each and every day, from previews to reviews to exclusive interviews and the daily onslaught of gaming news, to behind-the-scenes proofing and editing on the next issue of our magazine. Speaking of, it features [REDACTED] on the cover and wowsers, it's a beaut (and the story is fantastic and packed with the kind of game development details you won't find anywhere else).&nbsp;</p><p>Also, hey, this is the first This Week On GI story we've made for the site! Newsletter subscribers are familiar with our weekly round-up of stories, but fret not – this is its own thing. Now, as the Newsletter writer, I highly recommend subscribing to it because I bring a more laid-back, casual vibe to it that's not befitting of the CMS here. What I want This Week On GI to be is a post you can look forward to every Friday that not only catches you up on the latest <em>Game Informer </em>housekeeping, but will also neatly organize all the stories we published this week. We know life can get busy, and you might not be able to refresh the greatest video game website ever made hourly; this article is for you.&nbsp;</p><p>Below, you'll find our general <em>Game Informer </em>housekeeping section followed by the article round-up underneath it:&nbsp;</p><h2>Game Informer Housekeeping</h2>

<p>We've seen that many of you have already received our latest magazine issue, which features World of Warcraft: Midnight on the cover and is extra-large due to our extensive Game of the Year coverage, Editor's Top 10s, and more. If you've already received it, I hope you love and appreciate it as much as we did creating it – if you haven't yet, don't worry because it's in the mail and on the way to your mailbox.&nbsp;</p><p>We're aware of shipping hiccups that occurred in 2025 and continue to do our best to remedy any situation where someone didn't receive an issue they should have. If you missed it, the government shutdown affected postal services across the country last year, and that heavily affected our shipping processors; that's not your fault, though, and we apologize for any inconvenience or stress this may have caused you. With the World of Warcraft: Midnight issue, we're seeing that our shipping is seemingly back to normal, and people are receiving issues in a timely manner.&nbsp;</p><p>As for what's in the pipeline, we can't quite share what game is gracing the next edition of <em>Game Informer, </em>but trust me: you don't want to miss it. Plus, it features a massive round-up of our most anticipated games of 2026 and beyond, making it the perfect issue for those of you who like to plan out your year of gaming (like me). If you aren't already a <em>Game Informer </em>subscriber, there's still time to become one and receive this awesome issue – you can subscribe here.&nbsp;</p><h2>Story Round-Up</h2>

              <p>As PC components like RAM continue to be gobbled up by AI hyperscalers, leading to higher prices and limited supplies, a large electronics store in Japan is running out of computers and parts and is asking its customers to please sell them some old PCs.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-10-biggest-gaming-disappointments-worst-news-game-key-cards-gta-6-delay-2000655356#:~:text=Playing%20Video%20Games%20Is%20Becoming%20A%20Very%20Expensive%20Hobby">It has become more expensive to build or upgrade a PC</a> over the last few months. A big reason for that is <a href="https://kotaku.com/asus-rog-ally-price-increase-nvidia-amd-ai-ps6-delay-2000656448">AI-focused tech companies gobbling up PC parts to build massive data&nbsp;centers</a>. It’s&nbsp;becoming <a href="https://kotaku.com/amd-gpu-prices-radeon-ps5-xbox-steam-machine-2000645803">quite pricey and challenging</a> for your average person to buy PC RAM and graphics cards, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/12/after-nearly-30-years-crucial-will-stop-selling-ram-to-consumers/#:~:text=The%20fault%20lies,output%20through%202026.">as companies like Micron stop selling to consumers</a> and focus more and more on big companies that buy in bulk. Prebuilt PCs from companies like HP, Dell, and Asus will likely see a price increase of 15 to 20 percent as well, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3021660/computer-prices-could-go-up-by-20-due-to-ram-shortage-pc-makers-warn.html">according to&nbsp;<em>PC World.</em></a> All of this, plus tariffs causing other problems, has led to fewer PC parts and computers on shelves in some stores, forcing one shop to beg people to sell them some hardware.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">ゲーミングPC、中古も本当に在庫なくて今これ</p> <p>あの、お願いなので買い替えたらぜひ弊社にゲーミングPCを売ってください…<br>結構高く買い取っていますので…<br>ゲーミングのデスクでもノートでも、もちろんゲーミングじゃない普通のでもPCなら大体買い取っているので… <a href="https://t.co/IinBuGgRV7">pic.twitter.com/IinBuGgRV7</a></p> <p>— ソフマップゲーミング (@sofmap_gaming) <a href="https://twitter.com/sofmap_gaming/status/2008871239096431070?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 7, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>On January 7, as spotted by <a href="https://pc.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/news/2076399.html"><em>PC-Watch</em></a> and <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/desktops/pc-building/major-japanese-electronics-store-begs-customers-for-their-old-pcs-as-hardware-drought-continues-we-pretty-much-buy-any-pc-pleads-the-akihabara-outlet"><em>Tom’s Hardware,</em></a> Sofmap Gaming, a large electronics shop in the Akihabara district of Tokyo, <a href="https://x.com/sofmap_gaming/status/2008871239096431070">posted a somewhat desperate-sounding plea</a>. Here’s the tweet text via machine translation:</p>

 <p>“Um, as a favor, if you buy a new PC, please sell your gaming PC to our company. We buy them back at pretty high prices. Whether it’s a gaming desk or a laptop, or even a regular non-gaming one, we pretty much buy any PC.”</p> <p>Attached to the tweet was a photo of what appears to be a mostly empty shelf inside of Sofmap Gaming with only a few PCs and monitors left. “Gaming PCs, even used ones, are really out of stock right now. This is it,” claimed Sofmap Gaming. The account is also replying to nearly every user who responds with questions about what they can sell and how much it might be worth.</p>

 <p>With some experts saying the ongoing demand for memory and other PC components, like GPUs, will be a problem for 2026 and even 2027, it might be a good time to start looking around your house to see what random bits of hardware you have lying around somewhere collecting dust. If the parts aren’t too old, they might be worth a pretty penny soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, Larian Studios <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/divinity-original-sin-2-is-getting-a-free-upgrade-for-ps5-xbox-series-and-nintendo-switch-2">presented console players of Divinity: Original Sin 2</a> with a special treat: an upgraded version of the game for PS5, Xbox Series, and delightfully, Nintendo Switch 2. But while Original Sin 2 has been on Nintendo's system since 2019, Larian's next game, Baldur's Gate 3, never made it to any Nintendo console. Why not? Well, Larian at least says it wasn't its decision.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/larian_studios_divinity_ama/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit AMA today</a> conducted by various members of Larian, CEO Swen Vincke took a moment to answer a question about whether or not Baldur's Gate 3 for Nintendo Switch 2 was "even possible". Sadly, his <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nylkog6/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">answer wasn't a happy one</a>: "We would have loved to but it's wasn't our decision to make."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Vincke is speaking in the past tense because officially, Larian is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-patch-8-notes-include-final-farewell-message-as-larian-looks-ahead">done with Baldur's Gate 3</a>. It's still supporting the game with minor bug fixes, but there's no reason to expect the studio to do a whole new release on a new platform now, especially since it's moved on to a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yup-that-weird-statue-was-teasing-a-new-divinity-game-the-game-awards-2025">new Divinity game</a>. That leaves Wizards of the Coast in charge of the future of Baldur's Gate 3, meaning a port isn't happening without its blessing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Which seems to be what Vincke is implying here - that Larian would have done one, but Wizards for whatever reason decided not to. Wizards of the Coast declined to comment.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Which is a shame for Switch owners, because Baldur's Gate is a fantastic game. We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-review">gave it a 10/10</a> at launch, saying that "with crunchy, tactical RPG combat, a memorable story with complex characters, highly polished cinematic presentation, and a world that always rewards exploration and creativity, Baldur's Gate 3 is the new high-water mark for CRPGs."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We covered other topics from Larian's AMA today, such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-writer-wishes-wyll-had-gotten-more-content-and-a-more-fulfilling-arc-too-explains-what-happened">what happened to Wyll's storyline</a> in Baldur's Gate 3 and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/everything-we-learned-about-divinity-from-larians-reddit-ama">how Larian will (or won't) use generative AI for Divinity</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Nintendo <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-reveals-new-switch-2-joy-con-colors-light-purple-and-light-green">recently announced</a> it’s releasing a Light Purple and Light Green color variant of the Joy-Con 2 Switch 2 controllers, and now it's available for preorder. It costs $99.99 per pair and is set to release on February 12. You can preorder now (<a href="https://zdcs.link/a07gJw?object_uuid=81292efd-a9ed-422a-bd86-ce83ee260697&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">see at Target</a>). Read on for the details.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Preorder Joy-Con 2 Light Purple and Light Green </h2><div catalogid="23cbb7a0-2d78-4ddc-921c-19737646ae32" id="234333"><div id="234333" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Joy-Con 2 Light Purple and Light Green&nbsp;</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/a07gJw?object_uuid=81292efd-a9ed-422a-bd86-ce83ee260697&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Target</a> - $99.99</li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QG8bxW?object_uuid=81292efd-a9ed-422a-bd86-ce83ee260697&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get at Best Buy</a> - $99.99</li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QV5OxY?object_uuid=81292efd-a9ed-422a-bd86-ce83ee260697&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get at GameStop</a> - $99.99</li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/aR75XO?object_uuid=81292efd-a9ed-422a-bd86-ce83ee260697&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get at Nintendo Store</a> - $99.99</li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/9gXMdB?object_uuid=81292efd-a9ed-422a-bd86-ce83ee260697&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">See it at Amazon</a> - (not yet available)</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Functionally, these Joy-Con 2 operate exactly the same as the red and blue ones that come with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-review">Nintendo Switch 2 console</a>. And since black is still the main color on the casing, they’re not as flashy as the color variants of the original Switch Joy-Con. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, the new colors are visible under the thumb sticks, as well as on the connector part of the controllers. The included plastic bumpers for the wrist straps are also the same colors, so they’ll be more visible when the Joy-Con 2s are disconnected from the console or grip.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And if you’re buying an extra pair of Joy-Con 2 for multiplayer sessions, having different colors for each player makes it easier to tell your controller from everyone else’s. For me, if I were in the market for an extra set of Joy-Con 2, I’d definitely get these instead of a second set of red and blue ones.</p></div><div catalogid="c49cc388-129c-45cb-84e8-738834eaacdc" id="228077"><div id="228077" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mario Tennis Fever</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I suspect it’s no coincidence that Nintendo’s next big first-party Switch 2 game is also coming out the same day as these new Joy-Con 2 colors. Mario Tennis Fever (see our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-tennis-fever-nintendo-switch-2-where-to-buy">preorder guide</a>) is also set to release February 12. It’s a single or multiplayer game that lets up to four players join in on the action at a time. Preorder the game and a new pair of Joy-Con 2, and you’ll be all set to play with friends next month.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While there are currently only two <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/nintendo-switch-2/All_Switch_2_Joy-Con_Colors">Joy-Con 2 colors</a> on the market, I expect the list to grow in the coming years. After all, the original Switch got a whole rainbow's worth of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/nintendo-switch/Joy-Con_Colors">Joy-Con colors</a>, to say nothing of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/nintendo-switch/Special_Edition_Joy-Con">special edition Joy-Con releases</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Chris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN.
