                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a>'s upcoming expansion, The Edge of Fate, launches at an uncertain time in the long lifespan of Destiny 2. It follows the high-octane culmination of Destiny's first era, The Final Shape, and a series of transitional episodes that attempted to tie up some loose narrative threads. You'd be forgiven if you fell off of Destiny 2 after The Final Shape--after all, <em>final</em> is right there in the name. Developer Bungie seems to be trying to walk a tightrope with this new expansion: ideally, The Edge of Fate will be enough to bring back lapsed players, but it also needs to give Destiny 2 a shot in the arm that will keep avid superfans engaged for the foreseeable future.</p><p dir="ltr">I recently had the opportunity to dig into The Edge of Fate at a preview event hosted by Bungie, and after around eight hours of gameplay, I can confidently say that the expansion's big changes bring new life to the game. Its campaign takes some big swings with its environmental puzzles and new methods of traversal, and it overhauls Destiny 2's core gameplay to make it significantly more streamlined and comprehensible. It remains to be seen if that's enough to revitalize Destiny 2 with the numbers it once had or reinforce the game's status as a live-service powerhouse, but it <em>is</em> enough to make me want to play more.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Destiny 2: The Edge of Fate | Cinematic Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The Edge of Fate is headlined by a story campaign that takes players to Kepler, a new location located at the far edge of the solar system. Following the conclusion of the story of the battle between the Traveler and the Witness in The Final Shape, The Edge of Fate shifts narrative focus to The Nine, shadowy supernatural beings that predate the Traveler's arrival in the solar system. Instead of powers linked to Light and Darkness, which defined all of Destiny's previous expansions, The Edge of Fate introduces powers related to dark matter--which, in Destiny's universe, is a usable resource that permeates Kepler. The narrative that unfolds features new civilizations, enemies, and a bearded and hipster-glasses-wearing human with an enigmatic backstory and uncertain motives named Lodi.</p><p dir="ltr">I spent my time exploring Kepler and engaging with the early part of the expansion's story, and while I found some of the narrative hooks intriguing, I was most impressed with Kepler's world design. The remote planetoid is distinct from Destiny 2's other locations: The dark matter appears as yellow-orange fungal growths that cover many of the surfaces, serving as organic ornamentation for red canyons and purple-green tunnels. The place is not <em>completely </em>alien, though--human architecture, vehicles, and objects are strewn throughout the world, bringing an eerie sense of familiarity to an otherwise foreign place. One of the most impactful scenes in the expansion comes right at the beginning of the opening mission, when you gaze out from a vista at a skybox dominated by a colossal aircraft carrier.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4505397-screenshot2025-06-03at6.18.20%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4505397" data-ratio="0.41700680272109" data-width="2940" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4505397-screenshot2025-06-03at6.18.20%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4505397"></a><figcaption>Recognizable human objects are strewn throughout Kepler, contrasting with alien landscapes. </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4505397-screenshot2025-06-03at6.18.20%E2%80%AFam.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">The dark matter diffused throughout Kepler powers the new abilities that you acquire throughout the campaign. In contrast to how Destiny's subclasses and associated skills have traditionally focused on combat, Kepler's "destination abilities" (meaning they are only usable while on Kepler) are geared toward navigating environments and finding secrets. While platforming and light puzzle-solving have always appeared in Destiny campaigns, The Edge of Fate leans more into environmental puzzles than previous expansions, drawing directly on Bungie's past experience with Dungeons and Raids. As such, the new abilities all provide ways of moving through or manipulating levels.</p><p dir="ltr">The first ability you receive is called Matterspark, and it transforms your character into a compact, glowing ball of energy. While you can damage enemies using sparks of energy jettisoned off of your new spherical form, the main purpose of Matterspark is to allow you to travel through tunnels, air ducts, and tight spaces, and to charge up locations throughout the world that open doors or chests. Another ability, called Matterform, similarly provides new means of traversal, allowing you to manipulate particular parts of the environment--such as sheets of metal or loose walls--into temporary bridges and ladders. Many missions that I played also heavily used the Relocator Cannon, an item you pick up at certain points that lets you create portals to move through otherwise inaccessible barriers.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4505398-screenshot2025-06-03at6.20.34%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4505398" data-ratio="0.56459330143541" data-width="2926" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4505398-screenshot2025-06-03at6.20.34%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4505398"></a><figcaption>You'll use Matterspark to traverse narrow spaces, but not all tunnels are marked by fungal growths like this one.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4505398-screenshot2025-06-03at6.20.34%E2%80%AFam.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">These abilities are key to Bungie's goal of making The Edge of Fate play more like a metroidvania than a linear, first-person shooter. The developer has, in fact, invoked this genre multiple times in its discussions about the expansion; game director Tyson Green told me in an interview that the team was directly inspired by Metroid and Hollow Knight when designing the new campaign. In my time with the game, I found that these new abilities provided a welcome injection of new mechanics into the otherwise quite familiar Destiny 2 gameplay. Finding secrets and figuring out how to traverse through new areas is enjoyable, and the promise of being able to return to old areas to use upgraded abilities to unlock previously unattainable chests adds a fun reason to retread earlier paths and fully explore this new planet.</p><p dir="ltr">As is frequently the case with environmental puzzles in shooters, though, the line between enjoyably challenging and deeply frustrating is a thin one. There were several instances throughout my time on Kepler where I struggled to find the specific nooks and crannies that I needed to move my Matterspark ball into; some of these moments of fruitless searching literally doubled the length of what was otherwise a compact mission. I was playing an early build and Bungie is aware of some of the particularly opaque moments of Matterspark traversal, so these may be improved by launch. I am cautiously optimistic that the abilities will be a welcome change of pace, but Bungie is definitely taking risks in order to shake up Destiny's formula.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4505399-screenshot2025-05-30at2.31.53%E2%80%AFpm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4505399" data-ratio="0.56122448979592" data-width="2940" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4505399-screenshot2025-05-30at2.31.53%E2%80%AFpm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4505399"></a><figcaption>The Exotic sniper rifle New Land Beyond returns from Destiny 1 in all of its iron-sights glory.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4505399-screenshot2025-05-30at2.31.53%E2%80%AFpm.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">In tandem with the new campaign that unfolds on Kepler, Bungie is also implementing significant revisions to the core Destiny 2 experience. While the changes are numerous, two of the most obvious and impactful are an overhaul of the game's UI--called the Portal--and the addition of a shooting range.</p><p dir="ltr">These may sound like marginal updates, but in a game as complex as Destiny 2, they make a huge difference. The Portal represents a fundamental break from Destiny's past, as Bungie is deprioritizing the familiar destinations map and implementing a streamlined menu-based system for selecting and customizing activities. The developer is attempting to throw out Destiny's fairly obfuscated rewards system and the multi-layered map that has often hidden activities away in far corners. It is supplanting them with a system that is meant to give immediate information about what activities are available, how difficult those activities are, what rewards you can expect upon completing them, and any highlighted events or modifiers they might include.</p><p dir="ltr">One of the best examples of how the Portal aims to make Destiny 2 more digestible for all types of players is how it organizes activities on the basis of the way you want to play. As a person who plays almost exclusively solo, I have long been frustrated by the way that Destiny 2 hides or discourages activities that are good for playing alone. The Portal improves this by having "Solo Ops" as one of its four core categories of activities. In addition to curating a set of missions that are highly compatible for short play sessions, the interface also made it clear that I would not be punished with lesser rewards or slower progression for choosing to go solo. Other categories include Fireteam Ops, for Strikes and missions that are built for the classic three-person Destiny experience; Pinnacle Ops, for particularly challenging missions that reward the best loot; and Crucible Ops, for PvP gameplay.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4505402-portal.png" data-ref-id="1300-4505402" data-ratio="0.561875" data-width="1600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4505402-portal.png" data-ref-id="1300-4505402"></a><figcaption>The Portal makes rewards and tasks much more streamlined.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4505402-portal.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Portal's other transformative change is the inclusion of a much more extensive set of modifiers and options that you can use to customize a mission's difficulty to your liking. This is a <em>huge </em>change over Destiny's past, where missions generally have only a few difficulty settings and little granular control over the gameplay experience. Now, you can choose from dozens of different buffs and de-buffs, evocative of the way that finding Halo's collectible Skulls unlocked a series of options to tune particular elements of the game. These all affect scoring multipliers, which themselves affect how many rewards you are able to earn in a mission. In addition to allowing high-level players to create extreme challenges, it also lets you, for example, tune things to make a mission easier to complete in less time.</p><p dir="ltr">I found the Portal genuinely transformative to the Destiny 2 gameplay loop. While I have always generally liked the use of the destination map, the improvements to visibility and customizability that the Portal implements will make the game more enjoyable and replayable for many different types of players. I even ended up replaying quick missions multiple times during my preview, just because I was invested in seeing how different combinations of modifiers would affect my performance, enemy difficulty, and the rewards I got. It was exciting to try to push my limits, and that excitement was driven by the fact that I got to choose exactly how I was going to get challenged.</p><p dir="ltr">The other big change to the core Destiny 2 gameplay, the addition of a shooting range, is designed to benefit both beginner and expert players. Destiny 2's gear and stats system is extraordinarily complex, combining both intrinsic weapon and armor perks, user-selected mods, and upgrade mechanics. This has resulted in high-level play increasingly oriented around build-crafting, or the creation of combinations of gear and mods that are most suited to particular tasks. However, this process is more involved than, say, creating a loadout in Call of Duty. It can be extremely difficult to figure out exactly how armor and weapon perks interact, or how marginal increases in character stats impact one's performance. I have played Destiny 2 for hundreds of hours and I am still a relative beginner at build-crafting, as I have found comparing combinations of gear to generally be too difficult and time-consuming.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4505403-screenshot2025-05-30at2.31.08%E2%80%AFpm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4505403" data-ratio="0.41700680272109" data-width="2940" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4505403-screenshot2025-05-30at2.31.08%E2%80%AFpm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4505403"></a><figcaption>Lodi, a human, just appeared one day on Kepler. What's he up to?</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4505403-screenshot2025-05-30at2.31.08%E2%80%AFpm.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">The shooting range is Bungie's attempt to encourage players to engage more deeply with builds. Located in a corner of the Tower, the shooting range lets players safely experiment with different weapons, gear, and mods to figure out exactly how they want to approach certain encounters or mission types. There are many buttons to hit to change the shooting range's setup (you literally shoot buttons to switch settings), including what enemy types are included, whether a champion spawns, and whether the enemies should engage in combat with you. There is even a big scoreboard that tells you exactly how much damage per second you have put on a target.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a stat nerd's dream, but it is also a profoundly useful way of learning Destiny's more involved mechanics. Even in the short time I spent at the range, I found myself quickly picking up on gear complexities that I hadn't been willing to engage with in the past. I was able to carefully investigate how the perks on the new Exotic weapons worked, and I figured out how to match certain mods to significantly increase my combat effectiveness.</p><p dir="ltr">There are dozens more additions and tweaks that Bungie is implementing with The Edge of Fate--including a simplification of the armor and power systems--that I generally found to make my gameplay experience more enjoyable. However, it is still unclear if Bungie has done enough to bring back the lapsed Destiny players who have fallen off at some point over the game's long history, or to entice new players who have never touched the game before. Destiny is a daunting game in many ways, and despite The Edge of Fate attempting to initiate a new, more welcoming phase, there is a lot of narrative and mechanical intricacy that has accumulated over the years. Bungie has to find a way to simultaneously signal that it's a good time to (re)join the Destiny community, while also giving its committed players both continuity and new treasures to chase.</p><p dir="ltr">In the absence of a truly clean break in the form of a new sequel, I don't think this challenge is getting any easier–and I'm not sure Kepler, the Portal, and the Shooting Range will fully solve it. Despite all that, I am optimistic about the swings that Bungie is taking with the expansion, especially those that overhaul the core game. You're likely to find me spending too much time fiddling with weapon mods at the shooting range when The Edge of Fate launches on July 19.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">I love weird little guys. It's a truism about me that crosses games, genres, and mediums. It's the reason why, even if I didn't realize it at the time, Toad has been my main Mario Kart racer since I was sitting cross-legged on the carpet of my living room mere inches from the glow of Mario Kart 64. And it's one reason why Mario Kart World has me so excited: It's a veritable treasure trove of weird lil guys.</p><p dir="ltr">By now we all know about Cow, the breakout star from the Switch 2 reveal presentation. Everyone loved the outside-the-box approach of plucking a background creature from one stage of Mario Kart and including her as a racer. And to hear Nintendo tell it, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-a-silly-sketch-led-to-cow-becoming-a-pivotal-character-in-mario-kart-world/1100-6531712/">Cow was the eureka moment</a> of their whole approach to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-mario-kart-9-racer/2900-6141/">racers in Mario Kart World</a>. Once you've thrown Cow into the mix, nothing is off-limits.</p><p dir="ltr">I enjoy the novelty of Cow, but I've never gravitated toward heavy racers. Mario Kart has always felt best to me when I'm behind the wheel of someone light and zippy with a tight turn radius. So I can <em>respect</em> Cow even if I don't expect to actually race as Cow very often. But the philosophy behind Cow has enabled a smorgasbord of other, equally unconventional racers, and I spent a recent extended hands-on session trying all that I could find. I may have even found a new main. (Sorry Toad.)</p><p dir="ltr">Let's start with Penguin, another unassuming background character. Penguins are just adorable in general, and this one has a checkered history with Mario in particular. I played as Penguin hoping to get the opportunity to knock Mario off a ledge this time, so I could cackle with righteous fury as I did. <em>Now</em> who's getting thrown off a cliff, plumber? But alas, the stars did not align, and I was never close to Mario to perform such a stunt. Something to anticipate in the final game, I suppose.</p><p dir="ltr">But Penguin was far from the only oddball racer. I tried Chargin Chuck--putting aside my reservations about heavy racers, I enjoyed his grunting meathead persona behind the wheel. I played as Swoop, the little purple bat enemy you forgot about from Super Mario World. I played as Monty Mole, an adorably portly little fellow who looks like he should be having afternoon tea with a badger in a storybook. The list goes on and on.</p><p dir="ltr">But my favorite of all was Para-Biddybud. The little ladybug-like creature looks like a Poke Ball grew eyes and wings. He's lightweight, making him a great match for my preferred racing style. And he's just so gosh darned cute.</p><p dir="ltr">Each of the racers has a little personality animation they display when you hit the weapon button without a weapon equipped. Para-Biddybud turns toward the camera and smiles with his eyes--he <em>smizes</em>--and makes a little trilling squeak. All of the racers I could find also had some themed kart they could equip, and Para-Biddybud rides in style in a little rounded kart that has the same ladybug pattern as his body. After only 15 minutes, I got viscerally angry when other racers would hurt my dear sweet Biddybud. He's just a wee fella! What is wrong with you?!</p><p dir="ltr">The one drawback of this expanded roster is that not everyone gets a series of costume changes. The core Mario cast does, which means mostly humanoid-type characters or established racers like King Boo. There are no costumes, as far as I can tell, for Cow or Swoop or Para-Biddybud. That also means that lunch bags don't change you to a random costume; they just give you a speed boost.</p><p dir="ltr">But hey, they have to save something for the DLC, right?</p>

            <p>The Chief Legal Officer and Chief Financial Officer at MindsEye developer Build a Rocket Boy have left the company, a week before the game's release.</p>
<p>Writing on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/riley-graebner-0464378_after-three-and-a-half-years-my-time-at-barb-activity-7335325435200761858-TbDN/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADDOgdoB1gzNggnuaGLIXM_FUprl3u0285o">LinkedIn</a>, former CLO Riley Graebner said he was "proud" of what the team has accomplished during his time there, stating that during his tenure the company had "doubled" in size, to "over 450 employees". Graebner did not give a reason for this departure.</p>
<p>In addition, Build a Rocket Boy's <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-bland-b7410313/?originalSubdomain=uk">CFO Paul Bland</a> has also left the company after two years.</p>

<p>Over on the MindsEye Discord, many have expressed concern that two key members of the Build a Rocket Boy team are leaving so close to the game's release. As a reminder, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-new-thriller-from-former-gta-producer-and-hitman-publisher-gets-release-date">MindsEye is launching on 10th June, across PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC</a>.</p>
<p>"It could be a sign of very troubling internal affairs, or [they] don't want to deal with potential legal issues if MindsEye comes out broken," one member has speculated.</p>
<p>"Trying to keep an open mind, but that's sus indeed..," another wrote. "People don't bail right before they think they're releasing a hit usually. If you were the CFO at Rockstar a week out from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA6</a> launch, would you resign?"</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Build a Rocket Boy for further comment on Graebner and Bland's departures.</p>

<p>Word of Graebner and Bland's departures from Build a Rocket Boy come days after the studio's co-CEO Mark Gerhard suggested the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-boss-claims-games-negative-reaction-ahead-of-release-has-been-paid-for-in-concerted-effort-against-studio">negative reaction to MindsEye so far had been paid for in a "concerted effort" against the studio ahead of its release</a>.</p>
<p>In an exchange on the MindsEye Discord server, Gerhard was asked if he believes "all the people who reacted negatively were financed by someone", to which he replied: "100 percent."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Earlier this year, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a> developer Pocketpair announced their intent to get into games publishing using some of that Scrooge McDuck-size swimming pool of money they've acquired over the past year. They already had a game signed up too, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworlds-creators-are-paying-the-kenzera-devs-to-make-a-horror-game-about-the-entertainment-industry">from Tales of Kenzera: ZAU developer Surgent Studios</a>, and today said indie dev has offered a small tease of a reveal at their upcoming psychological <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game Dead Take.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
For now the game is mostly wrapped in mystery, but it's apparently all about taking a look at the "darkest secrets" that lurk underneath the "glittering facade" that is the entertainment industry. You'll step into the role (pun intended) of an actor exploring a mansion to "piece together the story of how far a powerful executive will go to seal his legacy." There's object-based puzzles to solve, and you'll need to edit video clips you find to figure out what happened there. No full trailer just yet though.
</p>

<p>
In a statement Surgent Studios founder Abubakar Salim said that they're "being secretive" about the game "for a reason," continuing on to say that the "subject matter of this game is delicate, and it hits close to home. When it comes out, and it won't be long until it does, I want players to think, 'I can't believe they actually did this.'" 
</p>
<p>
For some context, before getting into game development, Slim was an actor, having appeared in Ridley Scott's Raised by Wolves and Napoleon, House of the Dragon, and on the video game front he was also <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-origins">Assassin's Creed Origins</a>' Bayek, as well as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tales-of-kenzera-zau">Tales of Kenzera's</a> titular Zau. One can only imagine the stories any actor working on such big names might have.
</p>
<p>
Release date wise it's supposedly launching this year, but for now you can wishlist the game on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3352690/Dead_Take/">Steam</a>.

Create rain and fog to hamper your enemies, or mighty winds to hurl them over cliffs. Freeze your foes or set them aflame. Reshape earth to gain the high ground, or melt it into deadly lava.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/witcher-4-kelpie<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>CD Projekt Red showed a look at <em>The Witcher 4</em> in today's State of Unreal presentation. It looks nice! I knew we'd play as Ciri, but for some reason it didn't fully occur to me that Ciri would, of course, have her own horse until we saw her in today's demo.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Witcher 4 - Gameplay UE 5.6 Tech Demo | State of Unreal 2025" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FJtF3wzPSrY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Kelpie is Ciri's horse in <a href="https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Kelpie_(horse)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Witcher books</a>, and is mentioned in <em><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/witcher-3-wandering-in-the-dark/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Witcher 3</a></em> as well. In today's demo, she's a big black horse, and the presenters took pains to note that "since you're going to explore the world on horseback, riding needs to be seamless, natural, and just fun" and that "controlling her [will feel] realistic and grounded" thanks to tools in Unreal. </p><p>The developers also detailed Unreal tech that allows for "realistic movement and muscles stretching under Kelpie's skin without compromising the performance there," zooming in on Kelpie running unadorned to show... a bunch of horse, and also a cutaway to an anatomical drawing of... a bunch of the inside of a horse.</p><figure></figure><p>That's some real "<a href="https://aftermath.site/you-are-error-horses-red-dead-redemption-2-horse-testicles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">horse testicles changing with the weather</a>" hours, but the idea of a better-controlling horse is nice if you, unlike me, aren't trauma-bonded to how Geralt's horse Roach famously steered like a boat. </p><p>I have to admit I have reservations about playing as Ciri--not for the reasons that are surely ripping through the worst parts of the internet right now, but because I did her real dirty in my <em>Witcher 3 </em>playthrough, playing Geralt as the <a href="https://kotaku.com/i-accidentally-got-the-worst-ending-in-the-witcher-3-1793040692" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">worst possible dad</a> despite being fully confident that I was doing everything right. It's a shame my Witcher-loving colleagues like Luke have never let me live down, and for years after I wrote about it on Kotaku I would get emails from readers either admitting to their own failures or excoriating me for mine, compounding my own struggles with the matter. As I wrote at the time:</p><blockquote><p>Even though it was just a video game, I had a bit of a moral crisis. I couldn’t get over how spectacularly badly I’d done while thinking I was doing such a good job. I used to be a prison chaplain for goodness’ sake—surely I should be good at feelings, even virtual ones? I started recalling all the real-life interactions where I think I’m putting other people’s needs ahead of my own, mining them for hidden failures. Who else in my life could I be ignorant of hurting?</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>So<em> The Witcher 4</em>, which I am excited about because it's more Witcher, is also exciting to me as a chance to try to do better by Ciri. But it's also a new chance to do <em>terribly</em> by Ciri all over again. And now she has her own special horse in the mix, one with lore and a fandom. One without Geralt's gruffness and, potentially, Roach's recalcitrance to justify their love-hate relationship.   </p><p>Will Kelpie end up on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/em4v3e/whats_up_with_the_memes_about_roach_standing_on_a/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roofs</a>? Will I steer her into trees and off cliffs and hop off her and wander miles away and then get mad when she doesn't instantly appear when I whistle even though it's my fault for wandering so far away in the first place? How will Ciri talk to her? How will I do right by this horse, and by extension Ciri?</p><p>It's already too much pressure. I haven't made it through any of The Witcher books beyond the first, so if there's some horrible <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vE8mFDabqD0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The NeverEnding Story</a></em>-style twist coming, please do not tell me about it until after it happens and I blame myself for it. I am going to do my best to not lose this horse. I am not going to call her "Roach" by accident. I am not going to be mad at her for things that are my fault. I am going to redeem myself in her eyes, and by extension in the eyes of all the people in my life because I will read too much into my video game life choices. This is a good plan that has no downsides. Let's go.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/dropkickd-etterboxd-wrestling"><h3>Finally, A Letterboxd For Wrestling</h3></a><p>Dropkickd puts criticism and community back in the hands of fans at whatever point of their wrestling journey

                <p>Ahead of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">Switch 2's launch this week</a>, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang reflected on the first Switch console in a new video. As Huang explained, Nintendo had an ambitious goal to create a gaming device that was "powerful enough" to run first-party games at home and still be small enough to be used while on the go.</p><p>"We've worked with Nintendo for more than a decade, drawn together by a shared belief that technology should serve creativity, and that joy is worth engineering for," Huang said in a Nintendo Creator's Voice video, while also reflecting on late Nintendo president Satoru Iwata's vision for the system.</p><p>"I still remember the day Iwata shared his dream with us. He wanted to create something no one had seen before: a console powerful enough for big cinematic games, but small enough to take anywhere. It sounded impossible, but that vision became the original Nintendo Switch. We lost Iwata before the launch, but his clarity, his purpose, it still inspires our work every day."</p><p>According to Huang, the Nvidia Tegra X1 chip for the Switch took over "500 engineer years" to develop, and the company had to "reinvent everything" for the Switch 2. Huang added that it achieved three major breakthroughs on the Switch 2: full-hardware ray tracing, dedicated AI processors, and "ultra low power" through optimized semiconductor process technology for high performance. The Nvidia CEO claims that this has led to the most advanced graphics ever seen in a portable device.</p><p>The Switch 2 represents a major step forward for Nintendo in terms of graphics, as the hybrid console is capable of rendering games at up to 4K resolution and 60fps when docked. This means that some good-looking games will be coming to the console, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-on-switch-2-is-best-way-to-experience-the-game-on-the-go-says-dev/1100-6531204/" data-ref-id="1100-6531204">like Cyberpunk 2077</a>. CD Projekt Red recently revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/getting-cyberpunk-2077-to-run-on-switch-2-wasnt-as-challenging-as-cd-projekt-red-thought/1100-6531992/">bringing the game to Switch 2 wasn't actually as much of a challenge</a> as anticipated, as modern technologies like Nvidia's DLSS helped make the port easier.</p><p>While other graphically impressive third-party games like Elden Ring and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-enix-confirms-entire-final-fantasy-7-remake-trilogy-will-come-to-nintendo-switch-2/1100-6531363/" data-ref-id="1100-6531363">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> are headed to Switch 2, several first-party Nintendo titles will also be upgraded on the system.

But it's important to note that even though this looked like a gameplay video, the studio specifically noted this was a "technical showcase" for the RPG.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-coming-to-state-of-unreal-event-tomorrow-heres-how-to-watch/1100-6531983/">The Witcher 4 was featured at Epic's State of Unreal event</a> in Orlando earlier today, with CD Projekt Red previewing the game on PS5--not PS5 Pro, to be clear. That distinction is necessary since the developer stated the footage was running at 60fps on the Sony console with ray tracing. The tech demo for The Witcher 4 starts with Ciri standing on a cliff, peering out at snow-capped mountains and forested valleys.</p><p data-embed-type="html"><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AjikvaR0i34?si=curvr5-uR8nON2Zc&amp;start=2028" height="315" width="560"></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">From there, The Witcher 4 protagonist walks along a path before meeting up with her buddy, Kelpie. She saddles the horse and takes off at a gallop. CD Projekt Red uses this moment to demonstrate the black mare's muscle movement and fluidity with Unreal Engine 5. The developer transitions from this fauna to highlight <a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/nanite-virtualized-geometry-in-unreal-engine" rel="nofollow ">nanite foliage</a> in the open-world game.</p><p dir="ltr">Meeting back up with Ciri (and Kelpie), The Witcher 4 tech demo introduces the port town of Valdrest. After jumping off her horse, Ciri takes down her hood to walk around the market. CD Projekt Red is proud of how when she bumps into a person carrying a crate of apples, the fallen fruit leads to a boy and pigs running toward the food organically.</p><p dir="ltr">While this footage of The Witcher 4 might bring back bad memories of Cyberpunk 2077 promises, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-dev-say-it-has-learned-from-its-cyberpunk-2077-mistakes/1100-6528468/">CD Projekt Red has previously mentioned it's learned from its past mistakes</a>. Another key difference is The Witcher 4 is made in Unreal Engine 5; Cyberpunk 2077 utilized the studio's internal RED Engine.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-release-date-is-not-soon-as-dev-discusses-why-it-wont-use-genai/1100-6530369/">The Witcher 4 isn't arriving anytime soon</a>. CD Projekt Red has noted it won't launch until after 2026, but that's all for specifics regarding a release window. And yes, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-was-always-planned-to-have-ciri-as-the-new-lead/1100-6531815/">Ciri was always planned to be the lead</a> in this new RPG.

			<p>The Fortnite Unreal Editor will soon be expanded with new tools and IPs, including Squid Game and Star Wars.</p>
<p>During today's State of Unreal presentation, Epic provided an overview of what is coming to UEFN, which has proven to be extremely popular, with players having spent over 11.2 billion hours across 260,000 live creator-made islands since its release two years ago. To make the Editor even more enticing for developers, new tools and IPs are coming soon, starting with the LEGO Brick Editor coming on June 17th, creation elements inspired by Squid Game on June 27th, the same day the third and final season of the show debuts on Netflix worldwide, and Avatar: The Last Airbender and Star Wars, both launching on yet to be confirmed release dates.</p>
<p>Based on the technology that powered the AI-powered Darth Vader seen during the latest Season of Fortnite Battle Royale: GALACTIC BATTLE, new tools for the creation of similar NPCs will be coming to the Fortnite Unreal Editor later this year. Creators will be able to use the new Persona Device to create characters with full-blown personalities that players can interact with. Another AI tool coming to UEFN is the Epic Developer Assistant, which is actually already available in beta on the Epic Developer Community. The AI-powered assistant will help creators write Verse code that can be used in UEFN projects while also providing ideas, workflow guidance, and more to speed up the Fortnite island development process.</p>
<p>The last new Fortnite Unreal Editor feature coming soon is Scene Graph, which is launching in beta on June 7th, and is setting out to become the new foundational layer for UEFN. More information on Scene Graph and every other addition outlined above can be found<a href="https://create.fortnite.com/news/state-of-unreal-2025-highlights-for-fortnite-creators?team=personal" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> here.</a></p>
<p>Besides providing updates on the future of the Fortnite Unreal Editor, today's State of Unreal also provided a first in-game look at <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-new-trailer-ps5-60-fps-ray-tracing/">The Witcher IV</a> and confirmed the core features of <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-6-now-available-open-worlds-60-fps-ray-tracing/">Unreal Engine 5.6</a>, which is now available.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splitgate-2-1-0-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher 1047 Games has announced the&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>1.0 release date, and the full version of the portal-hopping FPS is coming sooner than you might think.</p>

<p>In a press release, 1047 Games reveals that&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2</em>'s full release is coming on June 6th. Given that the game only <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splitgate-2-open-beta-release-date" rel="nofollow">entered its open beta period in late May</a>, that's a pretty rapid turnaround.</p>

<p>The full version of the game will boast several new modes and improvements over the beta release, including new modes, new weapons, and a full map creator to allow you to make your very own<i>&nbsp;Splitgate 2&nbsp;</i>maps.</p>

Surprise!</figcaption></figure><p>Excitingly, 1047 Games says that there's still a "massive surprise" in store for the full release of&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2</em>, describing said surprise as "the biggest part" of the game. It'll be revealed during the Summer Game Fest show, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/summer-game-fest-2025-date-revealed" rel="nofollow">airs on the same day</a> as&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2</em>'s release.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2</em>, it's a multiplayer first-person shooter that essentially marries the arena-focused FPS action of games like&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>with the portal-jumping of, er,&nbsp;<em>Portal</em>.</p>

<p>You'll head into a variety of maps and use portals to traverse them, getting the drop on your enemies or setting up tactical ambushes with your portals to achieve victory. Alternatively, if you're me, you'll be firing portals anywhere you can in a frantic attempt to escape players way better than you at the game.</p>

<p>You can check out the new trailer for&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2</em>'s 1.0 release, described by 1047 Games as "surprisingly emotional", right here. Tissues at the ready.</p>




<p>Since launching into open beta in May,&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>has attracted a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2918300/Splitgate_2__Beta/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">"Mixed" rating</a> on Steam across over 7,000 reviews, with some players comparing it unfavorably to the original&nbsp;<em>Splitgate</em>.</p>

<p>Whether or not the full release remedies those issues remains to be seen, but at any rate,&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2918300/Splitgate_2__Beta/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010012" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/splitgate-2/9pf5q1b0fhsl" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a> in full on June 6th.</p>

He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Epic Games is going to allow <em>Fortnite</em> creators to make AI-powered NPCs that work similar to the recently-launched AI Darth Vader. The company showed off the tech at its State of Unreal show on Tuesday.</p><p>Using the Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN), creators can make characters with personalities that they can voice chat with. Creators will be able to set the type of voice, their delivery, and the AI NPC’s characteristics when the feature is available later this year.</p><p>In a live demo shown onstage at the event, two Epic staffers showed a conversation with an AI character, “Mr. Buttons,” whose sole purpose was to try and get the player to press a big red button in the room. For example, one Epic staffer asked a question about the screens in the room saying not to press the button, and the AI wanted the player to push the rules and press the button.</p><p>In May, Epic added a Darth Vader NPC to <em>Fortnite</em> that could speak to players using an AI-powered version of James Earl Jones’ voice. Jones’ estate approved of the use of his voice. However, Epic had to issue a hotfix after players got the AI Darth Vader <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/668349/fortnite-star-wars-james-earl-jones-vader-ai-voice">to swear</a>.</p><p>The AI NPCs aren’t the only AI-focused news for <em>Fortnite</em> creators. Epic is also beta testing the Epic Developer Assistant, an AI chatbot that can help UEFN creators write code in UEFN’s Verse programming language. The beta test is live today.</p><p>Epic also announced that new franchises will be available for UEFN creators to make experiences with. <em>Squid Game</em> assets will be available <a href="https://x.com/FNCreate/status/1929912150786453683">starting June 27th</a> — the same day as the premiere of the show’s third and final season — and creators will be able to publish <em>Squid Game</em> experiences later this summer. <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em>, which appeared in <em>Fortnite</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/8/24093527/fortnite-chapter-5-season-2-greek-gods-battle-royale">last year</a>, will be available for creators to build with in 2026. <em>Star Wars</em> assets will be available at some point in the future.</p><p>And on June 17th, creators will also be able to build LEGO experiences brick by brick, which should allow for more customizable LEGO experiences.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>While the large publishers continue pumping out sequels and remakes, Nippon Ichi Software’s new CEO Kenzo Saruhashi says mid-sized companies should be taking more risks if they're to survive.</p><p>In a Famitsu interview translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/if-we-dont-make-new-ips-well-die-nippon-ichi-software-believes-mid-size-developers-need-to-do-what-the-big-guns-cant/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>, Saruhashi and Yomawari series creator Yu Mizokami discussed the company's policy when it comes to making new IPs in the face of rising development costs and risk of failure.

<p>Saruhashi notes that although making sequels is the easier and safer option, NIS does things differently. "In our case, we’re more driven by whether our fans want a sequel. If there’s demand for it, we’ll make it.”</p><p>In regards to making new IP, he said that it's imperative for a mid-sized company to dare to do things big companies can't risk in order to survive. He added, "If we were to stop taking on new challenges, we would be like a fish out of water--I think we’d die.”</p><p>These new and experimental titles are however being given limited budgets, which means developers need to come up with creative solutions. But in the interview, Mizokami commented that she prefers the thrill of problem-solving within a tight budget, saying that she'd "probably get bored halfway through" if suddenly given a multi-million budget. Saruhashi and Mizokami instead liken NIS's approach to "speedrun/real-time attack-style game development.”</p><p>NIS nonetheless still has some notable franchises it continues to release, including the Disgaea series, while its Western counterpart NIS America publishes the international release of the Trails series.</p>

		<p>Portal-filled arena shooter <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/splitgate-2">Splitgate 2</a> is getting its full 1.0 launch this week on 6th June across PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. If you don’t want to wait, the game is already available to play in open beta across all platforms.</p>
<p>1047 Games announced the game’s launch in the run up to Summer Game Fest, during which a “massive surprise” is still set to be revealed.</p>
<p><iframe title="Something to Fight For | Launch Announcement | Splitgate 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AdpTm9qfCGE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Of course, while Friday will be the 1.0 launch, the game is already playable in its current open beta, which will continue through to launch and track all player stats and progression through to the full game as well.</p>
<p>The open beta doesn’t have all of the game’s maps and modes just yet, but it does have the core of the game and the fully featured level editor, The Lab, which allows up to 16 people to collaborate on a custom map.</p>

<p>Another thing that the beta has had over the past couple weeks is server issues. 1047 Games has battled to get on top of these, which have blocked player progression from being awarded in real-time, and forced them to scramble to find fixes. That’s always the way for online multiplayer games, it seems.</p>
<p>Still, the game has had over 1 million downloads already, and anyone that has donwloaded and logged in during the beta will receive some poo-themed cosmetics by way of apology for server issues. So that’s… nice?</p>

<p>Splitgate 2 has been on the cards since 2022, when <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/09/05/splitgate-development-to-end-so-1047-games-can-work-on-aaa-sequel/">1047 halted production on content for the original game</a>. While the original release into beta had quickly raced to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/08/20/splitgate-beta-will-continue-as-shooter-hits-10-million-downloads/">over 10 million players</a>, satiating some of the appetite for a tight arena shooter and drawing comparisons to the Halo series as it did so, 1047 quickly realised that they needed to revamp many aspects of the game, and not just produce more content for it. A few years on and they’re now on the cusp of realising that vision.</p>

		<p>Sony has announced that the next State of Play stream will take place tomorrow, 4th June, at 10PM UK time (2pm PT / 5pm ET / 11pm CEST).</p>
<p>The show will last around 40 minutes and will have the usual mix of news, updates, reveals and trailers for games coming to PlayStation 5.</p>


<p>You can find the stream embedded here:</p>
<p><iframe title="State of Play | June 4, 2025 [English]" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1bYaEtALe00?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Of course, we’re taking our first steps into the faux-E3 season wrapped up around Summer Game Fest. The main SGF stream will take place on Friday, 6th June at 10PM UK time, with Day of the Devs coming right after at midnight. We’ve then got Xbox Games Showcase with Outwer Worlds 2 Direct on 8th June, as well as the PC Gaming Show and Death Stranding 2 Game Premier a little behind, and there’s Devolver, Wholesome Direct, and a variety of other curated showcases for specific groups of the indsutry, including Black Voices, Southeast Asian, Latin American and Women-Led games.</p>

<p>While a State of Play stream had been rumoured and expected for this time of year, Sony decided to wait until just about the last possible moment before confirming the date and time of the showcase. No idea why, but there we go.</p>

            <p>The State of Unreal 2025 showcase has just offered us a first glimpse at what playing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> might look like, via an Unreal Engine 5 demo build that featured Ciri exploring the wilds and a village in Kovir. Kovir was also confirmed to be a location you'll visit in the final game, so start packing your bags.</p>
<p>In this tech demo, which you can watch below, CD Projekt and Epic showed off some of the Unreal Engine 5 tech that'll be aiming to make The Witcher 4 feel even more immersive than its already impressive predecessor when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/">it drops</a>.</p>

</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_aRhNcHryA" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>The demo kicked off with a merchant in a cart having his day entirely ruined by a monster, with Ciri then swooping in to quite literally pick up the pieces, as she embarks on a contract to hunt the monster that just killed the poor peddler. Things then properly transitioned into a Ciri-following build running on a PlayStation 5 at 60 frames per second with all the raytracing bells and whistles at play.</p>
<p>We got a look at Ciri's horse Kelpie, whom you'll be riding about and if they're anything like Roach, crashing into something every five minutes. The devs even peeled back Kelpie's skin to show the engine simulating horse muscles as they run, which wasn't at all freaky.</p>
<p>Ciri then wandered from the countryside of Kovir - a mountainous region that forms part of the Kingdom of Kovir and Poviss located in the northwest of The Continent - into one of the area's villages, Valdrest. CD Projekt and Epic really played up all the immersive details that make up the likes of bustling marketplaces, with details like an innkeeper dynamically lobbing a Gwent cheat out of an inn's front door being highlighted.</p>
<p>It seems that may well be what happens to you too if you try to con some cardplayers, so you've been warned. After showing off some varying crowd density at a circus, the demo concluded by showing Ciri looking out at the city of Lan Exeter in the distance. According to the lore, that's Kovir's winter capital and a Venice-style major port city filled with canals, so getting to explore it for the first time in a Witcher game will no doubt be prime screenshot material.</p>
<p>The Witcher 3 had the very Elven and French-feeling Beauclair and Novigrad could be just as breathtaking in a more grungy fashion, so it'll be interesting to see how Lan Exeter stacks up. I'm really keen to explore Kovir full-stop, since it's one of the fringe regions we've not heard too much about as The Witcher games have generally concentrated more centrally, aside from trips to Kaer Morhen. Regardless, it looks like we'll be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-witcher-4-wont-come-out-before-2027-so-chill-out-would-you">waiting until about 2027</a> to set foot there.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The sequel will be the Polish studio’s first after ditching its in-house game engine tools for UE5, and CDPR shared a taste of those early results running at 60fps on a base PS5 with fans during the conference, including the player’s new horse pal called Kelpie. </p><p>A new cinematic trailer showed crooked elites getting their just desserts when a dragon flies down in the night and rips their wagon to shreds. A mysterious wanderer emerges the next day to investigate the remnants of the crime scene, eventually revealing herself to be Ciri, the former princess and Geralt of Rivia’s mentee all grown up. Observing for clues as if her mind had shifted into detective mode, it’s clear she looks a little different from her appearance in <em>The Witcher 4</em>'s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/witcher-4-cdpr-ciri-open-world-rpg-release-date-trailer-1851720322&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/witcher-4-cdpr-ciri-open-world-rpg-release-date-trailer-1851720322">initial reveal at The Game Awards 2025</a></span>. Is that emblematic of a shift moving forward?</p><p>While she’s supposed to be much older now, her new model looked different than what fans may have expected from playing <em>The Witcher 3</em>. CD Projekt Red later revealed <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGJ-B7v5tYI&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGJ-B7v5tYI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a behind-the-scenes video</a></span> about the making the of the 2024 cinematic trailer and noted that character models naturally look different depending on the rendering-style and medium. “At this point, any character’s appearance may vary depending on the medium—whether it’s in a trailer, a 3D model, or in-game,” game director Sebastian Kalemba wrote at the time.</p><p>A spokesperson for CD Projekt Red told <em>Kotaku</em> that only two changes were made to Ciri in the new trailer, one of which has already been changed again. “It’s the same character model used in the [2024] trailer,” they said. “Ciri’s face is a direct copy of <em>The Witcher 3</em> model, adapted to work with the latest MetaHuman technology. Two subtle changes were made to improve animation quality: slightly raised eyebrows, and a more relaxed eye area—the latter was present in the trailer but has since been removed.”</p><p>The real treat today was nearly 10 minutes of seeing Ciri wander around a new open world. A gameplay tech demo showed the monster slayer wandering through sprawling sections of wilderness and village streets lined with NPCs. There’s even a bear that pops out at one point, and a knocked-over fruit crate that sends apples tumbling down a cobblestone path. It’s a UE5 showcase intended to wow and amaze with its extensive detail, hyper-realistic movement, and seamless transitions. Gently falling snowflakes and icy river currents all add to the effect. More immersive! More visceral! Video Games!</p><p>The spokesperson for CDPR stressed to <em>Kotaku</em> that today’s footage is a tech demo for Unreal, not the game itself. Ciri’s look, the open world, all continue to evolve throughout development. “It showcases the powerful foundation we’re building in close collaboration with Epic Games to push open-world design further than ever before and the core systems and features we’re developing using Unreal Engine 5. We’re really proud of this early milestone and excited to give you a sneak peek at some of the cool tech like UAF, Nanite Foliage, Smart Objects, ML Deformer and FastGeo Streaming that are helping shape the future of <em>The Witcher</em>.”</p><p>I don’t need to remind <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-witcher-3-downgrade-controversy-sucks-1705882405?_gl=1*168moj4*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDg5NTgwNTUkbzExNSRnMSR0MTc0ODk1OTMxNiRqNTgkbDAkaDA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-witcher-3-downgrade-controversy-sucks-1705882405?_gl=1*168moj4*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDg5NTgwNTUkbzExNSRnMSR0MTc0ODk1OTMxNiRqNTgkbDAkaDA."><em>Witcher </em>fans of E3 “downgrade”-gate</a></span>, which saw players poring over preview footage and showing how it looked better than what eventually launched in <em>The Witcher 3</em> in 20215. As then-CD-Projekt-Red visual effects artist José Teixeira explained at the time, you can’t downgrade a game that doesn’t exist, and what’s really happening in these situations is that trade-offs are made to keep a game performant while also making it look as good as possible. </p><p>The takeaway from Unreal Fest is that CDPR feels confident it’ll be able to do that using UE5 in a way that makes the wait worth it for all the Witcher-heads out there. It looks like it’s working so far! The in-game footage is even better-looking than the cinematic. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Eight years ago, just before the release of the Nintendo Switch, we <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/03/nintendo-switch-review/">provided an in-depth review of the hardware</a> thanks to early production units provided by Nintendo. This year, Nintendo has opted not to provide such unrestricted early press access to the Switch 2 hardware, citing a "day-one update" to the system software and some launch games that would supposedly make pre-release evaluation more difficult.</p>
<p>As such, we won't be able to provide our full thoughts on the Switch 2 until well after the system is in players' hands. While that's not an ideal situation for readers looking to make an early purchase decision, we'll do our best to give you our hands-on impressions as soon as possible after launch day.</p>
<p>In lieu of review access, though, we were able to get some extended hands-on time with the final Switch 2 hardware at a daylong preview event held by Nintendo last week. This event provided our first look at the console's system-level menu and settings, as well as features like GameChat (which was hard to fully evaluate in an extremely controlled environment).</p>
<p>While this access was far from sufficient for a full review, it did let us discover a few interesting features that we weren't aware of beforehand. Here are some of the new tidbits we stumbled across during our day with the Switch 2 hardware.</p>
<h2>GameChat can generate captions for live speech</h2>
<p>One of the most unexpected accessibility features of the Switch 2 is the system's ability to automatically generate on-screen captions for what friends are saying during a GameChat session. These captions appear in their own box that can be set to the side of the main gameplay. The captioning system seemed pretty fast and accurate in our test and could even update captions from multiple speakers at the same time.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>

                                  </p>
                          </div>

          </p>
  </div>
      </figcaption>
      </figure>

<p>While this is obviously useful for hard-of-hearing players, we could also see the feature being a boon for managing crosstalk among rowdy GameChat parties or for quickly referring back to something someone said a few seconds ago.</p>
<h2>You can generate spoken speech from text messages</h2>
<p>In a reverse of the auto-captioning system discussed above, GameChat also has a feature buried deep in its menus that lets you type a message on the on-screen keyboard and have it spoken aloud to the other participants in a slightly robotic voice. This could come in handy when you're playing in an environment where you have to be quiet but still want to quickly convey detailed information to your fellow players.</p>
<h2>The camera has built-in head-tracking</h2>
<p>During GameChat sessions, you can make the connected camera show only your face instead of your entire body and/or the background behind it. This mode keeps your face centered in a small, circular frame even as you move around during gameplay, though there is a slight delay in the tracking if you move your head too quickly.</p>
<p>While you can also activate a similar face display during local multiplayer sessions of <em>Mario Kart World</em>, the game doesn't seem to track your movements, meaning you can easily fall out of frame if you don't hold your body still.</p>

<h2>The system can detect the angle of the kickstand</h2>
<figure>
    <div>
            <p>
              Wonderful!
                          </p>
          </div>
          <figcaption>

    <p>
      Wonderful!

          </p>
  </div>
      </figcaption>
      </figure>

<p>This was a cute little surprise I discovered in a <em>Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em> mini-game that asks you to set the kickstand as close as possible to a given angle. This mini-game works even if the Joy-Cons are not attached, suggesting that there is a sensor in the kickstand or tablet itself that measures the angle. It did take a few seconds of stillness for the game to fully confirm the system's resting angle, though, so don't expect to be tilting the kickstand rapidly to control action games or anything.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<h2>You can use mouse mode to navigate system menus</h2>
<p>I stumbled on this feature when I was holding the Joy-Cons normally and one of my fingers accidentally passed over the mouse sensor, activating a mouse pointer on the system menu screen. When I put the controller down on its edge, I found that the pointer could scroll and click through those menus, often much more quickly than flicking a joystick.</p>
<p>Mouse mode also lets you zoom in on specific areas of the screen with a quick double-click, which should be useful for both vision-impaired players and those playing on tiny and/or far-off screens.</p>
<h2>You can adjust the mouse mode sensitivity</h2>
<p>The system menu lets you adjust the mouse sensor's sensitivity between "low," "medium," and "high." While that's a lot less precise than the fully adjustable DPI settings you might be used to with a computer mouse, it's still a welcome option.</p>
<p>In some quick testing, I found the high-sensitivity mode to be especially useful when using the mouse on a small surface, such as the top of my thigh. At this setting, the pointer could move from one end of the screen to the other with the slightest wrist adjustment. Low sensitivity mode, on the other hand, proved useful in more precise situations, such as in a <em>Welcome Tour</em> mini-game where I had to move a ball quickly and precisely through a large, electrified maze.</p>
<h2>You can play sounds to find lost controllers</h2>
<figure>

      </figure>

<p>Lose a Joy-Con somewhere in the depths of your couch? Not to worry—a new menu option on the Switch 2 lets you play a distinctive sound through that Joy-Con's improved HD Rumble 2 motor to help you find its precise location. While we confirmed that this feature also works with the new Pro Controller 2, we were unable to determine whether it can be used for original Switch controllers that are synced with a Switch 2.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<h2>You can set a system-wide security PIN</h2>
<p>Your unique PIN code must be entered any time the system comes out of sleep mode, making the hardware functionally useless to anyone who doesn't have the PIN. This should be great for kids who want to keep siblings away and parents who are worried about their kids sneaking in extra Switch 2 time when they shouldn't be.</p>
<h2>You can limit the battery charging level</h2>
<p>A new system-level option will prevent the Switch 2 from charging as soon as it hits 90 percent of capacity, a move intended to increase the longevity of the internal battery. This is already a common feature on many smartphones and portable gaming devices, so it's nice to see Nintendo joining the bandwagon here. Thus far, though, it appears that the 90 percent battery capacity is the only cutoff point available, with no further options for customization.</p>
<h2>You can adjust the size of menu text</h2>
<figure>
    <div id="caption-2098404"><p>
              MAXIMUM TEXT SIZE.

      </figure>

<p>As you can see in the photo above, setting the system text size to "MAXIMUM" lets menu options be seen easily from roughly the moon. You can set the system text to bold and high-contrast for even more legibility, and there's also an option to make the system menu text smaller than the default, for whatever reason.</p>
<h2>You can swap the A and B buttons at the system level</h2>
<p>With this menu option activated, the B button is used to "confirm" and the A button is used to "cancel" in system menus. This should be welcome news for players more used to the button layout on Xbox, PlayStation, and Steam Deck controllers, which all have the "confirm" and "cancel" options in reversed positions from the Nintendo default.</p>

          <p>When Ars tried out <em>Mario Kart World</em> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/hands-on-with-the-switch-2-its-the-switch-too/">at April's Switch 2 premiere hands-on event</a>, the short demos focused on more-or-less standard races in the game's Grand Prix and Knockout modes. So when Nintendo invited us back for more time previewing the near-final version of the game before the Switch 2's release, we decided to focus most of our time on the game's mysterious (and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/what-do-you-actually-do-in-mario-kart-worlds-vast-open-world/">previously teased</a>) "Free Roam" mode.</p>
<p>We're glad we did, because the mode feels like the hidden gem of <em>Mario Kart World</em> and maybe of the Switch 2 launch as a whole. Combining elements of games like <em>Diddy Kong Racing</em>, <em>Forza Horizon</em>, and even the <em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</em> series, Free Roam provides a unique mixture of racing challenges, exploration, and collectibles that should keep new Switch 2 owners busy for a while.</p>
<h2>Switch hunt</h2>
<p>Surprisingly, Free Roam mode isn't listed as one of the main options when you launch a new game of <em>Mario Kart World</em>. Instead, a tiny note in the corner of the screen tells you to hit the plus button to get dropped into a completely untimed and free-wheeling version of the vast <em>Mario Kart World</em> map.</p>

<p>Exploring in Free Roam mode provides the best sense of scale for the game's massive, multi-ecosystem island in a way individual races just can't. Sure, other race modes sometimes let you travel between the individual race courses along pre-set paths from one finish line to another starting line. But Free Roam mode lets you fully explore the vast spaces between those paths, encouraging you to go off-roading in the mountains, valleys, rivers, oceans, volcanoes, snowdrifts, and landmarks that dot the countryside.</p>
<p>Your main explicit goal when exploring all this varied expanse is to look for large, blue P-Switches, each of which activates a short, timed challenge mission in the immediate vicinity. In many cases, simply reaching the P-Switch is half the challenge, requiring some inventive wall-riding or item use to get to a particularly out-of-the-way corner of the map.</p>
