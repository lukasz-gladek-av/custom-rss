<p>A new report reveals that the director of ‘Chernobyl’ is being brought on to helm the upcoming Netflix Assassin’s Creed series.</p>



<p>Things have been progressing rather quickly for Netflix’s Assassin’s Creed series lately. Just last month, players were informed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-assassins-creed-series-actor-toby-wallace-euphoria/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Toby Wallace from Euphoria</a> has been cast as the lead in the show. There was also a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-assassins-creed-setting-ancient-rome-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a> in November that spoke about the setting of the upcoming series. Now we know who will direct the show, and Netflix has locked in a major name. </p>



<h2 id="h-netflix-s-assassin-s-creed-series-is-centered-on-a-secret-war-between-two-shadowy-factions">Netflix’s Assassin’s Creed Series is ‘Centered on a Secret War Between Two Shadowy Factions’</h2>



<p>A new report by <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/global/assassins-creed-netflix-directed-johan-renck-1236610672/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Variety</a> reveals that Johan Renck, the Swedish director behind HBO’s highly rated ‘Chernobyl’ series, will be at the helm for Netflix’s Assassin’s Creed. Renck has also directed series like ‘The Last Panther’ and episodes of popular shows like ‘Breaking Bad,’ ‘The Walking Dead,’ ‘Vikings,’ ‘Bates Motel’ and more. </p>



<p>Additionally, Roberto Patino and David Wiener will be the creators, showrunners, and executive producers for Netflix’s Assassin’s Creed adaptation. Gerard Guillemot, Margaret Boykin, Austin Dill, Matt O’Toole, and Genevieve Jones of Ubisoft Film &amp; Television will be coming on as executive producers. </p>



<p>The plot of the upcoming adaptation hasn’t been revealed, but we do have some idea now, thanks to the logline. It states that the series will focus on a secret war between two shadowy factions. One of these factions is “set on determining mankind’s future through control and manipulation, while the other fights to preserve free will.” We all know which two factions the series has always revolved around. ‘</p>



<p>Additionally, the logline also says that Netflix’s Assassin’s Creed series will follow the characters “across pivotal historical events as they battle to shape humanity’s destiny.” </p>



<p>In other news, Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Resynced recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-appears/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appeared on the PEGI ratings</a> site. Additionally, future games in the series will feature <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-games-will-feature-more-parkour-possibly-dual-protagonists-again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more parkour and potentially dual protagonists</a> again.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> fans are starting to suspect that generative AI cosmetics have been added to Battlefield 6, in spite of previous statements by senior EA staff stating that wouldn't happen.</p>
<p>This controversy stems from a player card sticker included in the Battlefield 6 Windchill Bundle, a package of cosmetics offered this festive season to players of the military FPS. One sticker, called Winter Warning, features an assault rifle with a snowflake background. This assault rifle seems to be quite the futuristic weapon indeed, as it has two barrels attached. Double the fire rate, surely?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1prq9x9/remove_this_ai_shit_from_the_store/">This was spotted by user Willcario on Reddit</a>, who titled their post 'Remove this AI s**t from the store', writing: "Two barrels on the M4A1, sure. I would literally prefer to have no sticker than some low quality AI generated garbage. You can look at BO7 and see how many favors AI generated rewards won with them".</p>

</figure>
<p>This led to a bit of holiday investigation from Battlefield 6 players, who went back through the library of similar cosmetics to try and find additional examples of AI use. There's no smoking gun here, but some did point to another sticker <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1ps4ze4/there_are_a_lot_of_things_that_dont_really_pass/">featuring a bear with ten claws as a possible naughty bit of technological tomfoolery</a>. On one paw the bear has four claws, whereas the other paw has five. A bit of perspective magic at work, or the shadow of Sam Altman casting an evil spell on EA? Who can say.</p><p>What's interesting though is that previous statements by senior staff at EA have outright crossed out the possibility of generative AI assets showing up in Battlefield 6. <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8xrkxdkkrno">In an interview with BBC News Night</a>, VP general manager at EA DICE Rebecka Coutaz stated that while generative AI was "very seducing" to use, it would only be used in the proprietary stages of game development to " allow more time and more space to be creative". <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/holy-fck-guys-were-not-pushing-hard-for-or-replacing-concept-artists-with-ai-larian-ceo-responds-to-genai-backlash">A similar sentiment to Larian's CEO earlier this month</a>, who also got hit by plenty of backlash.</p>
<p>So is this a case where temporary AI assets slipped in, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-privately-acquired-in-55bn-deal-by-group-of-investors-including-saudi-arabias-investment-fund-and-donald-trumps-son-in-law">has there been a change in AI strategy in the months following EA's move to privatisation</a>, or is this a simple case of artist error. Sometimes I still write in Americanised spelling, so maybe an artist could be on autopilot and draw two barrels on a gun? We don't know.</p>
<p>EA nor any of the Battlefield Studios have responded to these accusations as of writing.</p>

			<p>PlayStation and security: a match made in hell. Following the major PlayStation Network crash of 2011, which brought the network down for 23 days, users often encountered various issues, including account security concerns and <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-network-down/">prolonged downtime</a></strong><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/fbi-lizard-squad-investigated-ddos-attacks/"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">, sometimes caused by DDoS attacks</strong></a>. </p>



<p>Judging from a new report, however, all these may pale in comparison to the possibility of an account being hacked, even with every security measure in place, including 2FA and passkey.</p>



<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://x.com/LelloucheNico" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Nicolas Lellouche</strong></a>, tech journalist at French publication Numerama, reported on X that their PlayStation Network account protected with a passkey has been hacked, as an unknown user was able to change the associated email and password, and even spend money from a linked payment method.</p>



<p>The story took a bizarre turn after Lellouche initially recovered the account through PlayStation Support, only for the hacker to seize control a second time. In an ironic twist, Lellouche spent the evening communicating with the hacker, who reportedly detailed how their method bypasses modern security measures.</p>



<figure><div>

<p>While Nicolas Lellouche has promised an in-depth follow-up to this story (which will be added to this post once it is live), he summarized what happened in a now-deleted message on X, which has been saved by <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/french-tech-journalist-gets-their-psn-account-hacked-twice-in-a-row-while-having-passkey-and-2fa-and-exposes-a-security-breach-at-sony.1390756/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">ResetERA forums member Arubedo</strong></a>. Reportedly, the hacker is taking advantage of a <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"a fatal security flaw with Sony's security systems"</em> to hack PlayStation Network accounts, requiring only the associated email address, as they are apparently using internal tools. This, if true, is likely the core of the issue, as knowing a public email address shouldn't normally constitute a security risk.</p>



<p>Ultimately, their account was targeted because a screenshot showing the email address associated with the account had been shared online in the past, and hackers are reportedly <em>"collecting screenshots of that type to take over accounts and making sure the owners never manage to get them back."</em></p>



<p>Without the follow-up report and a final confirmation of a potential massive issue, there's no way to know if all PlayStation Network accounts are genuinely at risk. For the time being, the basic security measures remain the best: avoid sharing personal information online and use prepaid cards whenever possible to make purchases on any digital store. Losing access to a digital library is bad, but having money stolen is considerably worse.</p>

              <p>If you’ve been looking for a premium pair of earbuds that offer impressive sound and a long-lasting battery without blowing your budget, we’ve got good news.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6565/">The latest Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 FE are currently going for just $110 at Amazon, after the retailer took a massive 27% off their usual $150 price.</a> The offer applies to both the classic black and the stunning gray color options, but there’s a catch. The discount is only around for today. It ends at midnight, which means you don’t have a lot of time left to save. Additionally, you’re also getting a two-month free trial to Audible with your purchase, which adds even more value to the deal. We highly recommend placing your orders before it’s too late.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6565/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Two Distinct Listening Modes</h2>
<p>This stylish pair of earbuds features a sleek blade design with newly redesigned round eartips that keep the buds securely in place. The lightweight frame makes it easy to wear them for long; perfect for never-ending commutes and extensive workout sessions. Samsung has packed these with a bigger 11mm dynamic speaker with rich bass and powerful sound that brings all your favorite music to life. You will be able to enjoy all those energy-packed tracks during the day, plus calming theme songs at night, to the fullest.</p>
<p>There are two listening modes to choose from; active noise canceling and transparency mode. The ANC mode blocks all external background distractions to deliver an immersive listening experience. It’s great for when you want to block the outside world for a bit, such as when in a coffee shop or in a packed subway. The transparency mode, on the other hand, lets external sounds in while still delivering solid audio. It’s designed to keep you aware of your surroundings.</p>
<p>Catching up with friends on the go and taking work meetings will be just as easy, thanks to the added microphone and enhanced background noise reduction. These come together to isolate your sound from all that chatter and laughter in the background, ensuring you come through clearly on the other end. Gemini support also makes it easy to communicate with the smart assistant throughout the day without pulling your phone out. Just say something like, “Hey Google, what’s the weather today?”, and you will have your answers within seconds.</p>



<p>Managing music and taking calls can be done right through the buds. A simple pinch lets you play audio, pause songs, and attend calls. Similarly, simply swiping the blade adjusts the volume. Another feature that deserves a mention is real-time translation, which converts spoken audio into your preferred language on the fly. Battery-wise, you’re looking at around 8.5 hours of listening with ANC off, and a total of 30 hours with the charging case. You can easily go a couple of days without worrying about plugging these in.</p>
<p>All things considered, the Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 FE are a great option for anyone looking to enjoy powerful sound, deep bass, stable battery life, and hands-free AI assistance. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6565/">This deal brings the total down to $110, which is nothing considering all the features the pair comes packed with.</a> Additionally, you’re getting a two-month free trial to Audible, which gets you instant access to a wide range of audiobooks, podcasts, and Audible Originals.</p>
<p>Be sure to grab the discount sooner rather than later, as the deal is only going to be around for a few more hours.</p>

The fast-paced tournament format works wonders in tandem with Battlefield 6's kinetic gameplay, which feels all the more intense in close quarters.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In February 2023, Microsoft inked a 10-year deal to bring Call of Duty to Nintendo platforms. The deal was signed amidst Microsoft’s landmark acquisition of Activision Blizzard, but fast-forward to today, and the Nintendo space is still without a Call of Duty title.</p>



<p>According to one insider, that might be about to change. In a recent claim posted to social media, it was suggested that Call of Duty is ‘a few months’ away from launching on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-call-of-duty-coming-to-switch">When is Call of Duty Coming to Switch?</h2>



<p>According to Windows Central’s Jez Corden, the first Call of Duty ‘Switch version’ is set to land on the platform in ‘a few months’. Corden explained that the spanner in the works concerned the lack of developer kits for the Nintendo Switch 2, which has been a pretty public issue since <strong>before </strong>the console launched in June.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The first CoD Switch version is nearly done and launching in a few months</p>— Jez (@JezCorden) <a href="https://twitter.com/JezCorden/status/2003171421879460027?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 22, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>Corden didn’t explain which Call of Duty title is being ported to Nintendo Switch 2, leaving it up to fans to surmise what’s on the way. There’s a lengthy line-up to pick from. It could be Call of Duty Warzone, which would promote the fastest adoption on Nintendo Switch 2, or it could be a recent release like Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>Fans aren’t too sure about Black Ops 7 being released on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>If we were betting people, I think the safest wager would be in the Warzone stakes.</p>



<p>Recently, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sledgehammer-games-call-of-duty-switch/">Sledgehammer Games started hiring</a> for developers with ‘AAA mobile or Nintendo Switch’ experience, which was telling enough.</p>







<p>What Call of Duty title do you think would do well on the Nintendo Switch 2? Let us know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <p>Do you need a new Pokémon T-shirt? Don't answer that. Could you be convinced to buy a new Pokémon T-shirt if a nice one popped up? Well, prepare yourselves, because trendy Japanese high street clothing company Uniqlo has announced a new Pokémon collab for 2026.</p>
<p>The range is scheduled to arrive late March, according to <a href="https://www.uniqlo.com/eu-at/en/spl/ut/pok%C3%A9mon-ss26">the Uniqlo website</a>, and features seven unique designs - some for adults, some for kids (often differentiated by the base colour of the T-shirt). I think the standout adult design is a blue-ish Snorlax T-shirt with a sleepy character design on the left side of the chest, and the words "Snorlax woke up!" underneath it. Though there's a grey Gengar T-shirt with the character smiling wickedly in the middle of the chest that I can imagine going down well.</p>

</figure>
<p>The best kids' T-shirt, and I don't know why they don't do these in adult sizes, is a sunshine yellow (or Easter yellow - is that a real colour?) Pikachu design. Kids and adults both get a watercolour-style white T-shirt with cute little Bulbasaur, Charmeleon and Squirtle character designs across the middle and the words "I have only 3 left, but you can have one! Choose!" underneath. I think this is a quote from one of the games when you get your Pokémon at the beginning? It could even be the original Pokémon game. I am really stretching my Pokémon knowledge here.</p>

<p>Pokémon turns 30 years old next year - I'll look away while you turn to dust at that realisation - and the official celebration date is 27th February, apparently. But Pokémon arrived a few years later in the west, not touching down in the UK until 1999. I know this because I investigated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-pokemons-arrival-in-the-uk-changed-games-workshop-forever">the story of how Pokémon significantly upset Games Workshop's operations</a> when it did arrive. It's unlikely competition, I know, but it transformed the house of Warhammer's operations forever.</p>
<p>The Uniqlo adult T-Shirts are €19.90, and the kids' T-shirts are €12.90. Maybe see if you can squeeze into one of the smaller ones?</p>
<p>Uniqlo is no stranger to Pokémon collabs. Earlier this year it released an eye-catching and very, perhaps, knowing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/did-uniqlo-know-what-it-was-doing-with-this-pokemon-magikarp-t-shirt-slogan">Magikarp design that referenced the creature being an "expert splasher"</a>.</p>
<p>This year saw the launch of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> on Nintendo Switch - another of the in-between and slightly off-at-a-tangent Pokémon Switch instalments. It was a bit uneven but, overall, Chris Tapsell liked it. "Lumiose City could do with work, but Pokémon Legends: Z-A is a much more tightly focused - and delightfully goofy - return to better form. At least by modern Pokémon's standards," he wrote in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-review">Pokémon Legends: Z-A review</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> fans will have a very Merry Christmas this year, as Sega will be launching the free 'NiGHTS DLC Pack' this week on Christmas Eve – that's <strong>24th December 2025</strong>, just to make it crystal clear.</p>
<p>The pack will include NiGHTS as a playable character, the Dream Sleeper vehicle, and new emotes and sounds.</p>
<p>The character originally appeared in <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/saturn/nights_into_dreams">NiGHTS into Dreams</a> for the Sega Saturn in 1996. The release of the DLC on Christmas Eve appears to be a direct nod to <strong>Christmas NiGHTS into Dreams</strong>, a promotional sampler disc that released in the festive period of 1996.</p>
<p>There are even more free characters on the way too, with AiAi from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_monkey_ball_banana_rumble">Super Monkey Ball</a> expected to drop in January, followed by Tangle and Whisper in February.</p>
<p>If you've purchased the additional Season Pass, you can also enjoy characters such as Spongebob Squarepants and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">Minecraft</a>'s Steve, with <strong>Pac-Man</strong> racers also expected in January.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our review</a> for the Switch 2 version of CrossWorlds, we said that "Nintendo has a competitor on Switch 2 that is at the very least equal to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> if not better in certain respects". High praise indeed. It's a good'un, folks.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/egs-is-a-shop-steam-is-a-home-developer-explains-why-pc-users-attached-valves-platform/</link>
            <guid>1390777</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It's been just a little over seven years since <strong>Epic</strong> threw the gauntlet at <strong>Valve</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-taking-fight-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launching its <strong>Epic Games Store</strong> as a direct competitor to the <strong>Steam</strong> platform</a> on PC. Right away, Epic tried to lure the game development community with a far more appealing revenue share split (88%-12% in favor of the developers, versus Steam's 70%-30%) and fans with a combination of exclusive games (which are more or less gone now, except for rare exceptions), free games and discounts (those <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-free-add-your-epic-games-store-library-through-december-18/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are still very much happening</a>), and more.</p>



<p>At the end of 2025, we can safely say that Epic's massive efforts and expenses successfully carved a sizable user base for itself. Earlier this year, Epic <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-year-in-review-released-players-spend-2-68-billion-hours-playing-third-party-pc-titles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that the community had grown to host <strong>more than 295 million users</strong> in total. However, it did not impact Steam in the least; Valve's platform has continued to grow at an impressive pace, <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-achieves-new-concurrent-player-record-over-41-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surpassing <strong>41.6 million concurrent users</strong> two months ago</a>. That's users who were online at the same time, a figure that can be verified independently thanks to the existence of SteamDB. The same cannot be done with the EGS, but it is believed to be far lower. </p>



<p>Besides mere figures, though, core gamers still tend to be quite dismissive of Epic's Store, whereas they are really fond and protective of Steam, perhaps at times even more than they ought to be. Why? This specific question was answered by <strong>The Astronauts</strong> founder <strong>Adrian Chmielarz</strong>. <a href="https://frvr.com/blog/epic-fails-to-compete-with-steam-because-egs-is-a-shop-steam-is-a-community-says-witchfire-lead-as-epic-has-nothing-to-do-but-to-buy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In an interview with FRVR</a>, he claimed that Valve's Steam feels more like a home thanks to its feature set, whereas the EGS is still merely a shop:</p>



<p><em>People are not, basically, using EGS as their home, it’s not home to them. I don’t know if it’s deliberate or not, but EGS doesn’t have written reviews. They don’t have the forums. There’s nothing to do there but to buy. So that will always lose to a shop that is also emotional and you can basically engage with the shop.</em></p>



<p><em>EGS is a shop, and Steam is a community. There’s actually so much happening in that community hub for every single game, much more than I ever imagined, and it’s no wonder that people sort of get invested emotionally in Steam. And then they feel like, ‘Okay, my home is here, so my personal library is here’. So when something is released exclusively to Epic, something they want to play, then it’s a problem for them because now I’m gonna [have to] cheat on my home library with some other shop.</em></p>



<p>It's a fair explanation. While Epic has improved its store over time, introducing the long-awaited <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-opens-black-friday-cyber-monday-premium-editions-sale-now-with-gifting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gifting feature for Black Friday 2025</a> and, a few days ago, a cross-platform text chat, it still lacks the community features mentioned by Chmielarz. Overall, Epic's improvements to its platform have been too slow to catch up with Steam, especially since Valve hasn't rested on its laurels and continues to refine its own ecosystem. </p>



<p>It should be noted that The Astronauts actually did take the timed Epic Games Store exclusivity deal for Witchfire, <a href="https://wccftech.com/witchfire-qa-on-long-dev-phase-egs-exclusivity-dlss-3s-phenomenal-frame-rate-boost-and-fsr-xess-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as discussed in a previous exclusive interview with Wccftech</a>. The game eventually <a href="https://wccftech.com/witchfire-comes-to-steam-early-access-later-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched a year later on Steam</a>. In the FRVR interview, Chmielarz stated that the company was running out of money, making the deal vital to keep the company independent. Ultimately, he claims everyone got what they wanted: Epic got an exclusive game for a year, The Astronauts got the money to keep afloat, and the Steam community got a more polished game, albeit a bit later.</p>

            <p>Vince Zampella, the co-creator of Call of Duty, founder of Respawn Entertainment, and head of EA's Battlefield franchise died in a car crash on December 22nd. He was 55 years old.</p>
<p>"We're heartbroken by the passing of our founder and dear friend Vince Zampella," Respawn Entertainment said in a statement on Twitter. "Our hearts are with his family, friends, and all who love him."</p>

</p></div>
<p>Zampella's earliest credited work was as a producer at GameTek, but he rose to prominence when he joined 2015, Inc., working as development director on Medal of Honor: Allied Assault. The Second World War-set shooter made in collaboration with Stephen Spielberg was a huge success and EA attempted to bring the development team in-house. Instead of being absorbed by EA and working on the publisher's series, Zampella, and fellow developers Jason West and Grant Collier left 2015, Inc. and formed Infinity Ward.</p>
<p>Backed by Activision, <a href="https://mcvuk.com/business-news/publishing/the-medal-of-honor-killer-a-call-of-duty-story/">the studio began work on a project with a less than subtle codename: 'Medal Of Honor Killer'</a>.</p>
<p>Released in 2003, just a year after Medal of Honor: Allied Assault, Call of Duty was an immediate hit. Under Zampella, who worked as both a head of the studio and producer, the series continued to grow and the studio became a valuable cornerstone of Activision.</p><p>Following the release of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</a> 2 in 2009, Activision fired Zampella and fellow Infinity Ward founder Jason West, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/activision-decapitates-infinity-ward">citing breaches of contract</a>. Zampella and West sued Activision for unpaid royalties and following years of suit and countersuit, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-fireworks-activision-infinity-ward-lawsuit-settled">the publisher settled with the founders in 2012</a>.</p>
<p>In that time, Zampella and West co-founded Respawn Entertainment with their old frenemy EA. Zampella remained with the studio until 2020, overseeing the release of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/titanfall-2">Titanfall 2</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order">Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</a>, and a return to Medal of Honor, with the VR title Medal of Honor: Above and Beyond.</p>
<p>In 2020, Zampella moved up within EA, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/respawn-ceo-vince-zampella-is-taking-over-dice-la">taking over the LA branch of DICE</a>. Then in 2021, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-next-battlefield-is-a-return-to-the-peak-era-of-battlefields-3-and-4-with-a-modern-setting-and-smaller-headcounts">he took over the Battlefield series</a>. Under his leadership, the series has seen its largest launch to date and looks to be going toe-to-toe with Call of Duty in terms of player numbers.</p>
<p>To only look at a person's career is to inevitably capture only a small part of the impact they had on the world, it says nothing of their family and friends, but there are few parts of modern gaming that haven't been touched in some way by the games Zampella created – either in response to them or reaction to them. His loss will be felt by many.</p><p>"This is an unimaginable loss, and our hearts are with Vince’s family, his loved ones, and all those touched by his work," <a href="https://x.com/EA/status/2003249476836966693">EA wrote in a statement</a>. "Vince’s influence on the video game industry was profound and far-reaching. A friend, colleague, leader and visionary creator, his work helped shape modern interactive entertainment and inspired millions of players and developers around the world. His legacy will continue to shape how games are made and how players connect for generations to come."</p>

<p>Asmussen wrote: "Truly saddened today. Still processing, like a lot of us. Vince was my friend, and he made me a better person.

<p>Cover up</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>When the Switch generation was in full swing, there were stories about games being censored in some way or form, and even blocked from being published on the eShop.</p>
<p>With this in mind, it seems fans of the "superhero comedy" <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dispatch">Dispatch</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DispatchAdHoc/comments/1pp96i9/sigh_nintendo_has_fucking_ruined_dispatch/">have spotted a potential cover up</a> on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/dispatch-art-and-comics-pack-70050000063187-switch/">Nintendo's digital storefront in the US</a>. The banner for the "Dispatch Art and Comics Pack" DLC is showing much <em>less</em> skin compared to the <a href="https://ec.nintendo.com/AU/en/aocs/70050000063189">listings in other locations</a> (and even on other digital marketplaces <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-au/product/HP7386-PPSA27158_00-0567897799992899/">such as the PlayStation Store</a>).</p>
<p>Here's what is currently displayed on the US store. Below this, you can see the banner for the same DLC on the Nintendo store in Australia.</p>
<figure data-uuid="1d20fe2f74ba9"><a title="Dispatch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1d20fe2f74ba9/dispatch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Censored artwork — <em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / AdHoc Studio</em></figcaption></figure>
<figure data-uuid="79f3c16a242dc"><a title="Dispatch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/79f3c16a242dc/dispatch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Uncensored artwork — <em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / AdHoc Studio</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unsurprisingly, it's got a lot of Dispatch <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DispatchAdHoc/comments/1pp96i9/sigh_nintendo_has_fucking_ruined_dispatch/">fans questioning what's going on</a>, with some even pointing the finger at Nintendo. As this does appear to be isolated to a specific location, cases like this can sometimes be tied to local decisions, storefront regulations or classification laws. Of course, it could also be a mistake.</p>
<p>Website Notebookcheck also puts forth some ideas:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Nintendo of America may be seeking to maintain a more family-friendly image. It’s also possible that AdHoc Studio submitted the revised digital art without the company’s insistence. Nevertheless, many gamers question why the censorship is appropriate for <em>Dispatch</em>."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, it's not the first time we've seen changes covering up characters in video games. This also doesn't necessarily mean this will carry over to the full game, but if we do hear any significant developments or findings about possible censorship in the game, we'll let you know.</p>
<p>Dispatch has been rated by the ESRB as 'Mature 17+' and contains blood, crude humor, intense violence, nudity, sexual content, strong language, and use of drugs and alcohol. It's also got in-game purchases. This game launches for Switch and Switch 2 early next year on 28th January 2026.</p>

			<p>You may or may not remember, back when Microsoft and Activision Blizzard King were trying to get the acquisition across the finish line, Microsoft signed deals with the two other major console platform makers to continue (<a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-announces-10-year-committment-for-call-of-duty-on-switch-and-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">or in one case, to start</a>) releasing Call of Duty games on that platform. Microsoft and Nintendo's deal was a 10-year commitment, and while no one really expected a Call of Duty game to come to the Nintendo Switch, it seemed like we could expect the shooter franchise to arrive on the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>Well, we're two years into that 10-year commitment, and the Nintendo Switch 2 is no longer a poorly kept secret but the latest console on the market. So, where is Call of Duty on the Nintendo Switch 2? According to Jez Corden at Windows Central, it's just around the corner and into the new year.</p>



<p>Replying to a user on <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/2003171421879460027">X (formerly Twitter)</a> regarding the series' arrival on Switch, Corden replied, "<em>The first CoD Switch version is nearly done and launching in a few months</em>."</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The first CoD Switch version is nearly done and launching in a few months</p>— Jez (@JezCorden) <a href="https://twitter.com/JezCorden/status/2003171421879460027?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 22, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Another user quoted the above reply from Corden, asking for further clarification, and if the arrival of Call of Duty on Switch could be counted as "<em>close</em>," to which Corden said, "<em>I wouldn't say close but it's on the way and hitting milestones, 2026.</em>"</p>

<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I wouldn't say close but it's on the way and hitting milestones, 2026</p>— Jez (@JezCorden) <a href="https://twitter.com/JezCorden/status/2003179459936145530?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 22, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Now, Corden has been right in the past when it comes to rumours regarding Microsoft properties, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't be cautious of his claim. We do at least know that Microsoft has to make good on its promise; the question of when and how is what is left in the balance. To be fair, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer <a href="https://wccftech.com/spencer-bringing-call-of-duty-to-switch-will-require-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">did say it would take some time</a> to get the technology ready for the port. </p>



<p>Still, we don't know if Activision would aim to put Call of Duty on the first-generation Nintendo Switch and the Nintendo Switch 2, which, if that is the case, would almost definitely limit the scope of the version Activision is trying to create for the hybrid handhelds. Perhaps in that scenario, it's Call of Duty: Warzone, not a mainline release, that arrives on the platform.</p>



<p>Or, perhaps Warzone hits both the Switch and Switch 2, while the latest mainline entry, Black Ops 7, arrives on the Switch 2 to take advantage of the extra hardware capabilities on the new device. Or, while Warzone makes it on to the Switch and Switch 2, the next mainline Call of Duty game (<a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-2027-introduce-new-sub-series-says-leaker/">not the new sub-series said to be coming in 2027</a>, but whatever 2026's Call of Duty will be), is the one to arrive on Switch 2.</p>



<p>Or none of that, with Nintendo and Activision taking what is arguably the weirdest route, but one that would harken back to the days when games for handheld consoles were made as somewhat changed, or sometimes entirely changed, experiences compared to their home-console contemporaries: a completely brand-new Call of Duty game that is exclusive to the Nintendo Switch/Switch 2 and isn't just a port of the other Call of Duty titles.</p>



<p>Whatever the case, according to Corden, we won't have to speculate much longer.</p>

<figure data-uuid="d88e9faedd8c2"><a title="Bloober Team" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d88e9faedd8c2/bloober-team.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Bloober Team</em></figcaption></figure><p>Bloober Team has recently been busy with the Switch 2 versions of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/layers-of-fear-the-final-masterpiece-edition">Layers of Fear: The Final Masterpiece Edition</a>, but did you know it's got one other mysterious Nintendo release in the pipeline?</p>
<p>In case you missed it, in July last year, the Polish-based horror developer teased it was working on a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/07/horror-dev-bloober-team-says-its-working-on-a-new-project-for-nintendo-platforms">new project specifically for Nintendo platforms</a> known as '<strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/07/horror-dev-bloober-team-says-its-working-on-a-new-project-for-nintendo-platforms">Project M</a></strong>'. Now, in a new interview with Nintendo Insider, the studio's CEO Piotr Babieno has revealed that the first details about this title could be shared "very soon".</p>
<p>To add to this, this new game apparently has a "bold twist" which is part of a "vision that could only exist on Nintendo hardware". Fans of titles such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/eternal_darkness_sanitys_requiem">Eternal Darkness</a>, the indie game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/limbo">Limbo</a>, and iconic video game horror series should feel right at home here. Below is the full exchange:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>While the title hasn’t been announced, can you go into what players should expect from Project M, the Nintendo platform exclusive horror title from Bloober?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Piotr Babieno:</strong> "You have no idea how hard it is for me not to reveal what Project M truly is—but for now, it’s still too early to talk about it. We’re confident that we’ll be able to share the first details very soon.</p>
<p>"What I can say is this: fans of <em>Resident Evil</em>, <em>Silent Hill</em>, <em>Limbo</em>, and <em>Eternal Darkness</em> will immediately feel at home. That said, Project M introduces a bold twist—one that no horror game has ever explored before. This is a vision that could only exist on Nintendo hardware."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When details about 'Project M' originally surfaced last year, it was described as having a budget "significantly smaller" than the company's usual projects, and is a game being developed "in cooperation with the world's best creators for Nintendo platforms".</p>
<p>In the same interview, Babieno also acknowledged the "incredible" support from the team at Nintendo, mentioning how Nintendo's "trust" has guided and empowered Bloober.</p>

<p>We noted <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/persona-3-reload">in our review here on Nintendo Life</a> how the "biggest drawback" of P3R when it launched in October on the new hybrid system was the 30fps performance. Thankfully, the latest update (<strong>Version 1.03</strong>) comes with <em>some</em> performance improvements.</p>
<p>Most notably, it bumps the docked version of the game up to 60fps when it's running in performance mode. The frame rate stability across the docked and handheld modes has also been improved, and Atlus notes how it will be rolling out a patch for the demo in the "coming days". Here's the full rundown:</p><div><figure data-videoid="nhkdyt-h_Eo" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nhkdyt-h_Eo?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytnhkdyt-h_Eo" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nhkdyt-h_Eo?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nhkdyt-h_Eo?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5e7948mqyksn&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<h3>Persona 3 Reload - Nintendo Switch 2 Version 1.03 Update (December 2026)</h3>
<p><strong>Persona 3 Reload Version 1.03 patch notes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Performance Mode (only available in TV Mode) – targets 60 FPS</em></li>
<li><em>TV Mode and Handheld Mode – improved frame rate stability</em></li>
<li><em>The Nintendo Switch 2 patch update for the free demo will take place in the coming days (exact time TBD)</em></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Once again, you can find out more about Persona 3 Reload on the Switch 2 in our review here on Nintendo Life, and the demo is available to download from the eShop.</p>
<p>Although we wanted more from the game's performance when we first looked at P3R on the Switch 2, we still enjoyed the overall experience, calling it an "extensive and thoughtful remake of the original and unquestionably the best way" to play this modern RPG classic.</p>

That means none of the game data is included on the card, and instead it's used as physical DRM that allows you to download and install the full digital edition of the game from the Nintendo eShop. It was unclear from the game's box art whether this would be the case, but the game's listing on various retailers confirms it. We don't know how much space the game will require, but this will likely be confirmed with the Switch 2 version's final box art.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0G6QV6ZPN,B0G6QGRFHK,B0G6Q8ZHBN&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0G6QV6ZPN,B0G6QGRFHK,B0G6Q8ZHBN&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0G6QV6ZPN,B0G6QGRFHK,B0G6Q8ZHBN&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight Deluxe Edition</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0G6QV6ZPN,B0G6QGRFHK,B0G6Q8ZHBN&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0G6QV6ZPN,B0G6QGRFHK,B0G6Q8ZHBN&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0G6QV6ZPN,B0G6QGRFHK,B0G6Q8ZHBN&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$90 | Releases May 26, 2026</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight is also available in a $90 physical Deluxe Edition.

It features free-flow combat inspired by Rocksteady's Batman: Arkham games, but fine-tuned so younger family members can easily learn and master it as they face off against groups of enemies that grow larger and better-equipped. Batman won't be alone in his quest to save Gotham, as Detective Jim Gordon, Robin, Nightwing, Batgirl, and Catwoman will join the Dark Knight throughout the campaign.</p><p>Each character also has unique skills and gadgets. Gordon has a foam-sprayer that can incapacitate foes, Batgirl can bypass security systems with her hackarang, and Nightwing has a battle-staff that can make short work of bad guys. All of this action will take place inside of an open-world recreation of Gotham City, as the Bat-Family will take on supervillains like the Joker, Ra's al Ghul, Two-Face, Poison Ivy, The Penguin, Mr. Freeze, Bane, and Firefly.</p><p>Batman can develop and acquire new Batmobiles to help him speed through Gotham, including several iconic vehicles featured in films and TV series such as Batman '89, The Dark Knight, and Batman: The Animated Series. When he's not fighting crime, Batman can recharge at the Batcave, which is full of Easter eggs like Two-Face's giant penny and a collection of Batsuits. Overall, there are 100 suits and outfits to collect for the Bat-Family.</p><p>For more preorders, you can also check out deals on several games that will launch before Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-preorder-guide-ps5-nintendo-switch-2-xbox-pc/1100-6535813/">Resident Evil: Requiem arrives on February 27</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pragmata-preorder-guide/1100-6536943/">Pragmata will be released on April 24</a>, and both <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0G5RRPGFF?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="nofollow ">Housemarque's roguelite action Saros</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/CODENAME-TAG-PlayStation-5/dp/B0G2TB51WV?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="nofollow ">Invincible fighting game</a> launch on April 30.</p><hr><p><strong>Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter:</strong></p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsd-express-cards-nintendo-switch-2-best-deals-available-now/1100-6530578/">Nintendo Switch 2 Samsung 256GB MicroSD Express Card On Sale For Only $33</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-console-mario-kart-world-bundle-holiday-deal/1100-6536599/">Nintendo Switch 2 Mario Kart Bundle Reportedly Discontinued - Save $50 At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/asus-rog-xbox-ally-handheld-gaming-pc-holiday-amazon-deal/1100-6536577/">ROG Xbox Ally Gaming Handheld Is On Sale For Only $489 For A Limited Time</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (2)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arcade1up-classic-se-arcade-machines-pac-man-ms-pac-man-mortal-kombat-amazon-deals/1100-6534472/">Arcade1Up Classic Special Edition Mortal Kombat Cabinet Gets First Discount</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-transformers-building-sets-optimus-prime-bumblebee-soundwave-best-deals/1100-6509331/">Lego Transformers Optimus Prime And Bumblebee Get Limited-Time Price Cuts</a></li>   </ul> </div>

            <title><![CDATA[EA Company Shareholders Approve $55 Billion Sale]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ea-shareholders-approve-sale-saudi-arabia-pif/</link>
            <guid>1390621</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The sale of EA to the Saudi Arabian-owned Public Investment Fund has been approved by shareholders. However, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-announces-55-billion-private-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the purchase</a> still needs government approval before it can go through.</p>



<p>Earlier in the year, EA announced that PIF would be purchasing a majority stake in the gaming company. The deal, set for $55 billion, would lead to PIF acquiring 93.4% of EA. While the company <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-says-it-will-keep-creative-control-if-saudi-arabia-sale-goes-through/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">would still run things</a> as it would in the United States, it would be mainly owned by Saudi Arabia. Pushback from fans and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/electronic-arts-sale-facing-resistance-us-politicians/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">even US government officials</a> have arose since the announcement, but nothing has been amended. Now, the company’s shareholders have moved forward with the deal, further solidifying it.</p>











<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>As of 2:03pm PT, EA's shareholders have officially approved EA's $55 billion sale to a consortium led by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. </p><p>The deal will next need to receive approval from government regulators</p></div>— Stephen Totilo (@stephentotilo) <a href="https://twitter.com/stephentotilo/status/2003225658982576557?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 22, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/stephentotilo/status/2003225658982576557" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">tweet from journalist Stephen Totilo</a>, EA shareholders have approved the deal of the company being sold to Saudi Arabia’s PIF. The only thing truly left is for government regulators to approve the deal. No word as to when that deal will come in has been said as of yet. </p>



<p>Despite the buyout, EA will maintain creative control of the company. It’s not fully known what PIF will play within the company. EA did extremely well in 2025, with Battlefield 6 topping the charts in sales and it’s sports titles doing great, as well. Still, given the many warnings from government and fans, as well as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-bioware-employees-worried-about-more-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">studios at EA like Bioware</a>, the direction the company can go is up in the air.</p>



<p>What do you think of shareholders at EA approving the sale? Do you think it will pass government regulators? Have thoughts on the whole sale, in general?

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Is Scrambling To Address AI Accusations Over Double-Barreled Gun]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-ai-stickers-cosmetics-bundle-2000655167</link>
            <guid>1390612</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The player backlash against generative AI in gaming <a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-loses-indie-game-awards-after-being-accused-of-lying-about-ai-use-2000655119">has hit a fever pitch as we close out the year</a>, and <em>Battlefield 6</em> is the latest target of fans’ ire.<em> Kotaku</em> understands that EA is currently investigating accusations of AI slop in season 1’s recent <span dir="auto">winter cosmetics and trying to determine just exactly how the controversial technology may or may not have been used in their production.&nbsp;</span></p> <p>The accusations started over the weekend when fans circulated one of <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-review-steam-ps5-campaign-multiplayer-2000633379"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a>‘s new stickers from the Windchill bundle, which is currently being sold for just under $10. The cosmetic shows a character aiming down the scope of a double-barreled rifle. “Two barrels on the M4A1, sure,” read one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1prq9x9/remove_this_ai_shit_from_the_store/">angry viral post</a> on the game’s subreddit. “I would literally prefer to have no sticker than some low quality AI generated garbage. You can look at <em>BO7</em> and see how many favors AI generated rewards won with them.”</p>

 <p>This led some fans to start doing an AI “vibe check” on other cosmetics in the game. While nothing as glaring as <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>‘s six-fingered <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-ops-7-generative-ai-call-duty-gamescom-2025-slop-2000618833">Santa Zombie loading screen</a> has been found, it’s raised questions about how widespread the issue might be. For example, there’s an in-game sticker of a bear who appears to have more than <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1ps4ze4/there_are_a_lot_of_things_that_dont_really_pass/">10 claws on its paws</a>. Is this just sloppy quality control or evidence that <em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s post-launch development has been outsourcing designs to generative AI tools?</p>

   <p>An AI-generated double-barreled rifle would fun afoul of a promise made earlier this year by EA VP Rebecka Coutaz, who oversees DICE and the other teams making <em>Battlefield</em>. In an <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8xrkxdkkrno">interview with the BBC</a>, she promised fans they wouldn’t see any AI-generated imagery in the final game, but admitted that the technology is used in the earlier phases of production “to allow more time and more space to be creative.”</p>

 <p>There are a couple of increasingly common ways AI slop like this might make it into a big-budget blockbuster that’s on its way to being the best-selling game of 2025. The first is that concept artists might use generative AI to create references for a design before digitally painting over those by hand. The second is that an outsourcing team EA subcontracts with ends up submitting designs for cosmetics that then slip through a rushed review process.</p>

 <p>EA has been uniquely bullish on the potential for AI to transform game development. “We view AI as a powerful accelerator of creativity, innovation, and player connection,” CEO Andrew Wilson told investors during the company’s earnings report last May. Staff across various departments, from art and QA to marketing and customer service, have been strongly encouraged to find ways to experiment with AI tools in their daily workflows. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-ai-divide-roiling-video-game-giant-electronic-arts-2025-10"><em>Kotaku</em> reported just last month</a> that the tools were used to create an entire cover for the Deluxe Edition of <em>NHL 26</em>.</p>

 <p>But while a double-barreled rifle might be a dead giveaway that AI was involved, other errors might simply be a result of quality control going down as teams rush to flood <em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s post-launch window with new content and microtransactions. According to a source familiar with the game’s production, the scope of its current roadmap has stretched resources thin when it comes to reviewing it all for any potentially embarrassing mistakes.</p> <p>EA did not respond to a request for comment.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Zampella has been working in the video game industry since the late '90s, starting off answering phones and testing games at a local game company where he lived. He then went to work for GameTek, Atari, and Panasonic Interactive Media, among other companies. Famously, Zampella was the lead designer on <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/pc/medal_of_honor_allied_assault">Medal of Honor: Allied Assault</a> and worked on the franchise from 1999 to 2002.</p>
<p>In 2002, along with Jason West and Grant Collier, Zampella founded Infinity Ward in and began developing the now-seminal <strong>Call of Duty</strong> franchise, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/call_of_duty_modern_warfare_reflex">Modern Warfare</a> among the many games to receive Nintendo console ports.</p>
<p>Following <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/call_of_duty_modern_warfare_2">Modern Warfare 2</a>'s release, Zampella and West were fired from Activision (who owns Infinity Ward) and the two sued the company for wrongful termination. At the same time, they formed Respawn Entertainment and partnered with EA. West would leave in 2013, with Zampella staying on as head of the company.</p>
<p>The studio is behind some of the biggest franchises and titles on modern consoles including <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-360/titanfall">Titanfall</a>, <strong>Star Wars Jedi</strong>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>. Zampella was also in charge of the LA branch of DICE (now known as Ripple Effect Studios) and was head of the <strong>Battlefield</strong> franchise.</p>
<p>We send our thoughts to Zampella's family and friends during this incredibly difficult time.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/vince-zampella-call-of-duty-co-creator-and-respawn-head-has-died]]></content:encoded>
