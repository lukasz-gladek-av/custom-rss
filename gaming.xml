		<p>Microsoft is backtracking on a shift to charging $80 for their games, with Obsidian confirming that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a> will now be priced at $70 – alright,&nbsp;<em>fine,</em> it’s technically $69.99 – when it launches this October.</p>
<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/obsidian.net/post/3lun6okl2us2q">Obsidian got to make the announcement</a> in suitably silly fashion, given the franchise:</p>


<p>We have received your SOS via skip drone about the pricing. As an organization devoted to making sure that corporations do not go unfettered, we at the Earth Directorate have worked with [REDACTED] to revise the price of The Outer Worlds 2.</p>
<p>While this will not bring peace to the galaxy, or even your local colony, we assure you all that we are here to fight for all colonies in every way that we can.</p>
<p>From the Office of the Director of the Earth Directorate</p>

<p>In a statement to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-concedes-that-the-outer-worlds-2-retail-price-was-too-high">Windows Central</a>, an Xbox spokesperson said, “We’re focused on bringing players incredible worlds to explore, and will keep our full priced holiday releases, including The Outer Worlds 2, at $69.99 – in line with current market conditions.”</p>
<p>Refunds for pre-orders will have to be requested manually, depending on the retailer, and the new pricing is rolling out today or tomorrow.</p>
<p>Those market conditions were probably everybody telling them that $80 for a new game sucks, both in the form of comments across social media and forums, and most likely in the form of the number of pre-orders that Microsoft were seeing. While The Outer Worlds 2 will launch on Game Pass for Xbox and PC, which naturally affects the number of people paying full price on console in particular, the higher price would be felt when looking at pre-orders across Steam and PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>Of course, this is bigger than just The Outer Worlds 2, and it was expected that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> would follow suit this year, before Fable, Gears of War E-Day and other major launches in 2026. Black Ops 7 pre-orders aren’t live yet, but if The Outer Worlds 2’s pre-orders were bad enough, there would have been some execs and accountants with a case of the nervous bouncy leg, especially when they already sacrificed a huge amount of day one revenue last year by putting Black Ops 6 on Game Pass.</p>
<p>We’ll have to wait and see if Microsoft is just delaying the price bump until January, or if they hold off a while longer.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>If you follow the video game industry at all, then unless you've been living under a rock for the month of July, you've heard about <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/">Microsoft enacting its latest mass layoff</a>, which cut 9,000+ people across the company, a large chunk of those cuts hitting its Xbox and gaming division. It was an awful way to start the month, as we learned, and are still learning, how those cuts impacted studios like <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/">The Initiative</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/">ZeniMax Online</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/rare-everwild-cancelled-microsoft-gaming-layoffs/">Rare</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/candy-crush-microsoft-laid-off-developers-being-replaced-by-ai-tools-they-built/">King</a>, to name a few.</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/zenimax-staff-lambast-inhumane-xbox-layoffs-it-s-difficult-to-work-when-you-re-looking-at-a-graveyard-">Game Developer</a>, several ZeniMax Media developers, some of whom are still with the studio and others who were impacted in the layoffs, called out Microsoft and Xbox executive leadership for how poorly the mass layoff was handled, the chaos it caused, and the execution of the whole situation, which some called "<em>inhumane</em>" and "<em>disgusting</em>."</p>



<p>One former employee described to Game Developer how they were booted out of their work email, Slack, everything, without any proper notice that they'd been laid off, and were left for hours without any communication from Microsoft. Member of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-workers-united-qa-union-haved-reached-a-tentative-deal-with-microsoft-the-first-deal-reached/">ZWU-CWA</a> union, Page Branson, said the lack of any process to the layoffs left people "<em>distraught and confused and not knowing if they would have a job by the end of the day, or even if the layoffs were done by the end of the day</em>." </p>



<p>When Branson and others started to get a better picture of who was impacted and who wasn't, Branson said that some of those who were cut were "<em>absolutely crucial</em>" and "<em>integral</em>" members of staff, specifically for The Elder Scrolls Online. Autumn Mitchell, a senior QA developer and also a member of the ZWU-CWA union, added, "<em>It's not okay. It wasn't normal. I don't care how many times they do it to try and make it seem normal—it's not. The way they do it is inhumane. I don't care how much they say that it's dignified or they want to do it in a respectful way—it's not."</em></p>



<p>"<em>Some people were here for 15 years and cut out. Making it so that people have to rush to type a goodbye message into Slack to their colleagues that they've been working with on various projects, that have been making your corporation money for 15 years, is disgusting. It's disgusting. If I could get any message to any executive right now it would be review this process because it's not normal and it's not okay."</em></p>



<p>Branson also spoke about what is perhaps the most significant long-term impact of mass layoffs like this: the sudden disappearance of institutional knowledge that developers who had been working at the studio for years had. "<em>A lot of practical knowledge just disappeared overnight</em>. <em>Everyone left now has to pick up the pieces as best they can. The [dwindling] morale and general confusion of it all has extended into our general workflow. We used to have very, very reliable people working on things and they're no longer there. They were integral. I feel like they were numbers on a sheet that got cut, but the real application of what they were doing was integral to making everything run correctly.</em>"</p>



<p>Mitchell added that they estimated a third of ZeniMax Media's institutional knowledge is now gone thanks to the layoffs, and that they "<em>don't really know</em>" how those left standing are supposed to continue making games at the same quality they did before. They also added that they don't see how moving forward in some cases is even possible without critical members of the team who were impacted in the layoffs getting brought back.</p>



<p>Every story from the Microsoft layoffs is upsetting, and these details only compound the sadness for the developers and the frustration towards Microsoft and Xbox leadership for their carelessness in how things were handled. The short-term financial benefit that comes with having fewer people on the payroll only digs a deeper debt when it comes to the lack of experiential knowledge left behind, and the inability to properly train and mentor a new class of workers to take the place of the developers who players praise for creating the games we love in the first place. </p>



<p>These kinds of cuts, and the careless ways in which they're handled, are what make it difficult to see any real future for Xbox and Microsoft in the video game industry beyond that of a third-party publishing house. And even then, it's worth asking why anyone in the video game industry should place their trust in Microsoft, if the company is going to cut whatever it wants to cut, <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-layoffs-funding-increased-spending-ai-infrastructure/">just to chase the latest trends in tech</a>.</p>

The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rat-king-has-eaten-my-lunch-and-now-its-going-to-eat-yours">Rat King</a> is dead, long live the Fool King. In this medieval roguelite autobattler, you must murder a skeleton monarch with dice. You will do this not by loading bags of D20s into a culverin and shooting the Fool King point blank, though yes, that sounds like an amazing lategame unlock. Instead, you will be rolling the dice to determine how many knights, peasants, wizards and crossbowmen you can summon to each battlefield. I've been playing the prototype, and while roguelites are thick as wheat these days, this is a promising contender. Here's a trailer.

<p>
Let me walk you through it. First, you pick three dice corresponding to unit type. Then, you roll them to decide how many of each unit you can conjure. You get to re-roll selected dice exactly once before committing. Then, you line them all up facing the enemy army using drop-and-drag controls. Then, you bellow CHARGE at your computer (while pressing the "fight" button) and look on indolently as they sword, fireball and arrow each other to bits. This was exactly how Richard the Lionheart did it during the siege of Castillon-sur-Agen, except he had to imagine the fireballs.
</p>
<p>
Whether you win or lose, you'll earn coin from the engagement with which to customise your units. Maybe a passive for your knights that electrifies attackers? Maybe some poison for your crossbows? You can also add pips to your die faces, and buy new dice to increase the number of formations in play. The basic roguelite tuggowar here is whether to enhance the units you have, or increase your army's headcount so that you aren't outflanked and surrounded.
</p>
<p>
The autobattling bits seem rudimentary by the standards of, say, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mechabellum">Mechabellum</a>, but it's early days for the Fool King, with no release date in sight. Possibly the neatest feature is the asynchronous multiplayer. As developers Loot Donkey explain on <a href="https://lootdonkey.itch.io/fool-king">the Itch.io page</a> (where you'll find the downloadable prototype), "your ghost data and choices are recorded so that you will be facing real player decisions and may even have to battle your past self in a future run." My past self? I farking hate that guy. Fetch me my culverin and don't spare the D20s.

We now know it’s the fastest-selling console launch in the U.S. ever. But the Switch 2 wasn’t the only thing interesting about June 2025's video game sales numbers. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197565" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="197565,197567,196165" data-current="197565"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23089.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Research group Circana released its monthly figures on Wednesday, with director Mat Piscatella sharing charts and data in an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lun37i6gok2k&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lun37i6gok2k" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">extended thread on Bluesky</a></span>. The Switch 2 sold 1.6 million units in the U.S. alone in June and almost all of those buyers were also playing <em>Mario Kart World</em>. According to Circana, 82 percent of all Switch 2 owners in the country also purchased Nintendo’s new racer, either as a physical copy or through the digital pack-in bundle. The data doesn’t track digital sales of the game, which suggests the real number of<em> Mario Kart World</em> players on Switch 2 is even higher. </p><p>Here are the top-20 best-selling games overall in June 2025:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ol data-type="List" data-style="Number"><li><em>Elden Ring: Nightreign</em></li><li><em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em></li><li><em>Mario Kart World</em></li><li><em>Cal of Duty: Black Ops 6</em></li><li><em>Stellar Blade</em></li><li><em>Forza Horizon 5</em></li><li><em>MLB: The Show 25</em></li><li><em>Minecraft </em></li><li><em>Grand Theft Auto 5</em></li><li><em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em></li><li><em>Split Fiction</em></li><li><em>EA Sports FC 25</em></li><li><em>Elden Ring</em></li><li><em>NBA 2K25</em></li><li><em>Red Dead Redemption II</em></li><li><em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em></li><li><em>Star Wars: Battlefront II</em></li><li><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></li><li><em>Assassin’s Creed: Shadows</em></li><li><em>WWE 2K25</em></li></ol></blockquote><p>Circana also shares a list of the best-selling games on each individual platform but doesn’t break them out between Switch 2 and the older hardware. Instead, both consoles are rolled up into a single “Nintendo platforms” list, at least for now. That makes it hard to get a clear sense of what Switch 2 owners specifically are buying and playing, but not surprisingly the list is dominated by new Switch 2 games and older games that received upgrades like <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>. Notable Switch 2 releases that didn’t chart include <em>Hitman: World of Assassination </em>and <em>Yakuza 0</em> <em>Director’s Cut</em>. Here are some other interesting takeaways from the data.</p><h2 id="h704286"><a id=""></a><em>Elden Ring: Nightreign</em> is still topping the charts</h2><p>FromSoftware’s multiplayer spin-off is now the best-selling game for two months in a row. That’s especially notable given it’s only $40 and Circana tracks sales by revenue, meaning it’s pulling double duty compared to full-priced games like <em>Mario Kart World</em>. Interestingly, it’s still only the eighth overall best-selling game year-to-date, but it’s clearly pushed lots of players who apparently hadn’t already purchased<em> Elden Ring</em> to go back and play it, bringing its predecessor back into the top 2o for the month. </p><h2 id="h704287"><a id=""></a><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> has completely dropped off</h2><p>Despite being the best-selling game for 2025 overall so far, <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> hasn’t charted in either of the last two months. That could suggest some momentum has died down as players bounce off with the lack of post-game content and rapid updates, and/or that PC performance has really stopped the game dead in its tracks on the platform where it was selling the best. It’s still sitting at “overwhelmingly negative” in its recent Steam reviews and the concurrent player count has fallen off more quickly than it did with <em>Worlds</em>. </p><h2 id="h704288"><a id=""></a>Fans can’t get enough of the Switch 2 Pro controller</h2><p>Nintendo’s conventional alternative to the Joy-Con was June’s best-selling gaming accessory. Around 32 percent of Switch 2 owners also picked one up, a number that likely would have been higher if the controller hadn’t kept selling out everywhere. Some fans have called it <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/1l5dk80/is_the_switch_2_pro_controller_worth_it/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/1l5dk80/is_the_switch_2_pro_controller_worth_it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the best controller ever made</a></span>, but its popularity also probably speaks to just how many people play their Switch 2 docked and are tired of compromising that living room experience with sub-par Joy-Con controllers, even the upgraded ones for the Switch 2. </p><h2 id="h704289"><a id=""></a><em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em> was a surprise hit </h2><p>The long-running RPG life sim series that started on the DS was a console exclusive on Switch 1 and 2 last month (it also came to PC) and ended up making the top 1o. It’s hard to know how many of those players were on Switch 2, but the game was the third best-selling across both Nintendo platforms, just behind <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>and ahead of <em>Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>. I preferred<em> Fantasy Life i </em>myself, but it shows how Nintendo continues to benefit from rolling handheld and console-like experiences into a single device. </p><h2 id="h704290"><a id=""></a>It’s the summer of <em>Elder Scrolls Online</em> on Xbox</h2><p>We hear a lot about<em> World of Warcraft</em> and<em> Final Fantasy XIV</em>, but much less about Bethesda’s ongoing MMORPG which just crossed its 11th year out in the wild. It was the second best-selling game on Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One last month. A big part of that is probably <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/68093&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/68093" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a major update and new seasonal storylines</a></span> that went live for the game in June, but another factor is probably the release of <em>Oblivion Remastered</em> earlier in the year and returning fans looking for more reasons to hang around in Tamriel.<em> ESO</em> was the second best-selling game on the platform last month as well. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-sales-mario-kart-world-elden-ring-nightreign-1851786793]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Julian LeFay, widely regarded as "the father of The Elder Scrolls", has passed away at the age of 59, following what his studio described as a "courageous battle with cancer." His death was <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/oncelostgames/the-wayward-realms/posts/4441113" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">confirmed by OnceLost Games</a>, the studio he co-founded, which called his passing "an immeasurable loss for our team, our community, and our industry."</p><p>According to CEO Ted Peterson, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/father-of-elder-scrolls-stepping-away-from-industry-due-to-ailing-health/1100-6533230/" data-ref-id="1100-6533230">LeFay stepped away from work just a week before his death</a>, choosing to spend his final days surrounded by family. Despite his illness, he remained actively involved in development, continuing to guide the team, mentor younger developers, and help shape The Wayward Realms to reflect his signature design philosophy and creative ambition.</p><p>Lefay was a key figure behind The Elder Scrolls: Arena and Daggerfall, two titles that laid the foundation for one of the most influential franchises in gaming history. His legacy was so deeply embedded in the series that the in-game deity Julianos was named in his honor. In 2019, LeFay teamed up with fellow former Bethesda developers Ted Peterson and Vijay Lakshman to establish OnceLost Games, announcing their ambitious new RPG, The Wayward Realms, in 2021.</p><p>OnceLost Games affirmed that work on the game will continue in LeFay's honor, stating that the team is dedicated to realizing the vision he helped build. "Julian's influence extends far beyond our studio," the statement reads. "He touched the lives of millions of players worldwide and inspired countless developers to push creative boundaries. His legacy will live on in every realm, quest, and moment of wonder players experience in The Wayward Realms."</p><p>The statement goes on to say that while "this is an immeasurable loss for our team, our community, and our industry," development on the game will continue. The team is committed to honoring LeFay’s legacy by bringing his vision to life.</p><p>The tribute concludes: "Julian's impact reaches far beyond our studio. He touched millions of players worldwide and inspired generations of developers to push creative boundaries. His legacy will live on in every realm, quest, and moment of wonder in The Wayward Realms."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege">Rainbow Six Siege</a> has seemingly underperformed, according to a recent <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/5wMXD5U7aP5imdxB186rmg/d3ffd32ed3c2821d7e89d3c48d0ade35/Ubisoft_FY26_Q1_Sales_EN_vf.pdf">Ubisoft quarterly financial report</a>. This is blamed on a "pricing exploit" allowing players to inflate in-game wallets with more currency than they should have had.</p>
<p>Overall, the company has earned 2.2 percent less than it did this time last year. This drop was blamed on issues tied to Rainbow Six Siege X's launch, "unfavourable exchange rates", and the aforementioned pricing exploit.</p>
<p>Players were able to use pre-paid currency cards to buy more in-game currency than intended, allowing them to buy more items in-game than Ubisoft intended. This exploit has now been fixed. </p>

<p>Ubisoft president Yves Guillemot stated: "Rainbow Six Siege X received highly positive player feedback thanks to its renewed gameplay and enhanced features that drove significant player engagement growth."</p>
<p>Guillemot continued: "However, player spending in Rainbow Six Siege faced temporary but significant disruptions due to technical pricing issues, which have now been identified and addressed. Despite this one-off setback, the growth potential of the game is strong with solid traction on activity and in-game spending."</p>
<p>In contrast, Guillemot stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> has performed exceptionally well, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-coming-to-switch-2-ubisoft-hints">pushing past five million players since its release</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Developer Sloclap has released its first major patch for Rematch (a bit of unexpected poetry, there).</p>
<p>While this patch <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rematch-crossplay-top-priority-future-updates">doesn't add the likes of crossplay</a>, though "good progress" is being made, it does address a swathe of other fixes and improvements for Rematch, which the team has been working on since the last hotfix.</p>
<p>One major change coming with this patch is gamepad remapping, with the developer admitting while this first version is "quite basic", soon it will offer a more advanced version for players to tinker with.</p>

<p>Rematch's first major patch also includes fixes to the camera during goal replays, with Sloclap saying the jitter has been removed. Animations, meanwhile, have received a bit of polish, while the studio has also fixed an issue where goalkeepers were not reacting to opponents' collisions. The team has additionally made "multiple" environment and lighting improvements and fixes.</p>
<p>On the Menus and Interface side of things, Sloclap has added a Colourblind Mode. When this is activated, it will change the colour selection for teams according to deuteranopia, protanopia or tritanopia (the three main types of colour blindness). For now, this mode appears to be the start of a work in progress, with the developer saying the "feature will be pushed further" in a future patch, to apply the filter to the entire screen.</p>
<p>There are still some known issues with Rematch, which Sloclap has acknowledged. These include the ball on occasion emitting "loud wind sounds" until it gets kicked, which honestly sounds to me more like a feature than a bug.</p>
<p>The next patch is expected in the next two to three weeks, Sloclap has said. In the meantime, you can find <a href="https://www.playrematch.com/post/patch-1-1-200-100">further information on Rematch's first major patch here</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rematch-kicks-off-first-week-with-impressive-sales-and-player-milestones">Rematch surpassed 1m sales in its first week on the market</a>, with three million "unique" players also joining the pitch thanks to its inclusion on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-next-batch-of-xbox-game-pass-titles-for-june">Xbox's Game Pass subscription service</a>.</p>
<p>Our Tom was one of those three million Rematch players, and had rather a good old time with it. "I feel like I've finally found a competitive online game that I enjoy and can't stop thinking about," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/for-the-love-of-ibrahimovic-rematch-players-learn-to-pass-before-i-become-the-very-thing-i-hate">Eurogamer's Rematch feature</a>.

<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2 Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/91bf859864489/nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>We already know the Switch 2 has broken sales records in the US — just last month, Nintendo's upgraded hybrid console reportedly hit an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/switch-2-sets-all-time-launch-record-for-video-game-hardware-in-the-us">"all-time launch week unit sales record for video game hardware"</a>. And now, Circana's Mat Piscatella has more data to back up that info.</p>
<p>Sharing the stats on Bluesky, not only is the Switch 2 the fastest-selling console in the US <em>ever</em>, but the launch also helped boost video game spending in the US to an all-time June high.</p>
<p>Spending on industry products increased by 22% in June 2025 compared to last year, which is a huge boost. And while the year's overall spending is still slightly behind 2024's (just by 2%), things are looking up thanks to the Switch 2.</p>

<p>Originally, we knew the console had sold 1.1 million units in its opening week, but by the month's end, that climbed to 1.6 million units. As a reminder, we know the console has sold over <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/its-official-switch-2-has-sold-over-3-5-million-units-globally-in-its-first-four-days">3.5 million units worldwide in its first four days</a>, so with the extra 5 million, console sales are already over 4 million.</p>
<p>Hardware spending has increased by 249% compared to last June — to $978 million — another record-setting month for sales, surpassing the previous record of $608 million in June 2008.</p>

<p>In terms of game sales, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> was the third best-selling game of the month, right behind Death Stranding 2: On the Beach and Elden Ring: Nightreign. However, Nintendo doesn't include digital sales in this data, so if we had to guess, Mario Kart World is <em>possibly</em> number one. Digital sales have boomed in recent years, after all.</p>
<p>In terms of Nintendo games, the Switch 2's line-up, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/bravely-default-flying-fairy-hd-remaster">Bravely Default</a> all made the top ten, with other titles that got free Switch 2 upgrades or paid Switch 2 Editions also making up most of the rest of the list.</p>
<p>There's no stopping <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">Minecraft</a>, though!</p>

<p>So, the Switch 2 is doing incredibly well, then! We'll likely hear more on sales figures at Nintendo's next financial briefing, which is due in August.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-price-has-been-reduced-to-69-99/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Outer Worlds 2, the second entry in the series developed by Obsidian Entertainment launching this year on PC and consoles, won't be Microsoft's first $80 game, as the game's price has been reduced ahead of its release in a few months.</p>



<p>In a new message shared today, developer Obisidian Entertainment confirmed that the game's price has been revised to $69.99 instead of $79.99. Considering the series is a relatively recent one without a massive following, pricing The Outer Worlds 2 at $80 was a really weird decision that might have impacted the game's sales significantly.</p>







<p>The last we saw of The Outer Worlds 2 was last month during this year's Xbox Game Showcase with a trailer providing an overview of the story which also confirmed the game's release date, and a more in-depth Direct presentation that provided some additional information on the game's mechanics. Judging from the footage seen so far, the new entry in the series is setting out to expand its predecessor's mechanics considerably, which should result in a game more enjoyable than its predecessor, which left something to be desired in the moment-to-moment gameplay, as highlighted by Alessio in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-outer-worlds-obsidian-never-changes/">review.</a></p>



<p>"<em>The Outer Worlds is pretty much exactly what you'd expect from Obsidian. The first-person action RPG features a great setting, fantastic writing and remarkable, complex characters to meet. The moment-to-moment gameplay isn't as exciting, though, failing to measure up with the best in the genre. Still, there's plenty to like here as long as you know what you're getting into, not to mention the potential for a sequel to be much better, particularly if the developers had a higher budget to work with.</em>"</p>



<p>The Outer Worlds 2 launches on October 29 for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

            <p>Developer Julian LeFay, a key cog in the early days of Bethesda and the development of classic Elder Scrolls RPGs <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-arena">Arena</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-ii-daggerfall">Daggerfall</a>, has died. His passing was announced by OnceLost Games, the studio he co-founded in 2019, and follows a years-long battle with cancer.</p>
<p>LeFay <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-elder-scrolls-developer-julian-lefay-steps-away-from-his-daggerfall-esque-the-wayward-realms-as-cancer-worsens">stepped away from his most recent development post</a> as technical director at OnceLost, where he'd been working on Daggerfall-inspired RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-wayward-realms">The Wayward Realms</a> alongside fellow Bethesda veteran Ted Peterson, last week. OnceLost revealed at the time that this was due to his cancer worsening, writing that LeFay's doctors had informed them "his time with us is limited".</p>

<p>In a statement on LeFay's passing aged 59, the studio's team wrote that the Danish-born developer "was not just a colleague - he was a visionary who fundamentally shaped the gaming industry as we know it today" and praised his "unwavering commitment to pushing the boundaries of what RPGs could achieve".</p>
<p>"Throughout his courageous battle with cancer, Julian never wavered in his passion for The Wayward Realms," they added, "Even during his illness, he continued to share his vision with our team, mentor our developers, and ensure that every aspect of the game reflected his commitment to creating something truly extraordinary. His strength, determination, and unwavering focus inspire us all."</p> <div>

<p>LeFay joined Bethesda as a programmer in 1987, and was a key influence on many other RPGs through his work on Elder Scrolls. He was programming lead on Arena and Battlespire, project leader on 1996's legendary Daggerfall, and is credited on The Elder Scrolls Adventures: Redguard and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind">Morrowind</a>. According to Peterson, his name <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_YhxCkF09Y">was also an inspiration</a> for Tamriel's god of wisdom and logic, Julianos.</p>
<p>LeFay also served as director and chief programmer on Bethesda's The Terminator and follow-up The Terminator 2029 back in those early days. He largely disappeared from the spotlight after leaving Bethesda, working on various projects including some with Sega, before being dragged back in via an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGLGi5RK8V8">interview with YouTuber Ian Phoenix in 2017</a>, which snowballed into LeFay and Peterson deciding to team back up on an RPG that'd be a worthy successor to the likes of Daggerfall.</p>
<p>That led to OnceLost's founding in 2019 and a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-daggerfall-developers-reveal-a-teaser-for-their-open-world-rpg">Kickstarter for The Wayward Realms</a>. As Peterson and the studio's staff wrote when they revealed LeFay had stepped away from work on the game, their plan is to keep on developing their RPG in a fashion that matches his vision for it.</p>
<p>Thanks to LeFay for all of his contributions to the medium and all the best to those he leaves behind.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-bethesda-developer-julian-lefay-known-as-the-father-of-the-elder-scrolls-has-died]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">1.6 million units were sold during its launch month in the U.S., and 82% of buyers also got Mario Kart World.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> debuted in June to become the fastest-selling hardware ever in the U.S., shooting spending on games to new monthly records, according to the monthly report from Circana.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Spending on hardware was up a whopping 249% year-over-year thanks to the console's debut, reaching $978 million and greatly surpassing the previous monthly record from June 2008 of $608 million. In total, the Switch 2 sold 1.6 million units in the U.S. during its launch month, beating the PlayStation 4's previous sales record of 1.1 million units in November of 2013. Unshockingly, it was the best-selling console of the month both in terms of units and dollar sales.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Across both Nintendo Switch platforms, Switch 2-exclusive Mario Kart World was the best-selling game of the month, followed by Cyberpunk 2077 and Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma, both of which launched alongside the new console. In fourth and fifth place respectively were Tears of the Kingdom and Breath of the Wild, followed by Street Fighter 6, Mario Kart 8, Hogwarts Legacy, Bravely Default's remaster, and Minecraft. Because Nintendo doesn't share digital sales numbers with Circana, this chart may be missing some big sellers. For instance, we learned today that <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/deltarune-topped-switch-2-digital-charts-in-june-while-mario-kart-world-dominated-in-active-players/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deltarune topped Switch 2 charts in digital sales in June</a>, but with no physical edition and the game only costing $25, it's missing from the dollar sales ranking entirely.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So does all this Nintendo Switch 2 success mean it's on track to outsell the Nintendo Switch 1? I asked Circana analyst Mat Piscatella, and this is what he told me:</p><blockquote>What the launch sales of Switch 2 primarily tell us is that they made a lot of Switch 2 to sell at launch. Lifetime sales and launch sales of a console often do not correlate, meaning that some consoles with small launches ended up doing incredibly well lifetime (PS2 only sold 400k in its launch month) while others with big launches ended up not doing as well lifetime. Since launch month demand is rarely satiated by available supply (and it is certainly not a great sign when it is, historically) all we can really get a read on at launch is the confidence of the manufacturer to make so many units available, and the ability of the supply chain to get those units into the market.</blockquote><blockquote>But having the biggest launch month sales for any new video game hardware platform is a helluva good start.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Across all platforms, Elden Ring: Nightreign was the best-selling game of the month for the second month in a row, followed by debut titles Death Stranding 2: On the Beach and Mario Kart World. Those numbers don't include Nintendo digital sales of Mario Kart World, and they also don't include physical hardware bundles, meaning Mario Kart World will likely have performed significantly better than is indicated here. Per analysis by Circana's Mat Piscatella, 82% of Nintendo Switch 2 buyers in June purchased Mario Kart World either via a standalone sale, or as part of a bundle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma debuted at No.10. Stellar Blade ranked No.5 on the overall charts and was the second best-selling game on PlayStation thanks to its debut on the platform last month. And while Final Fantasy XVI didn't crack the overall top 20, it was the fourth best-selling game on Xbox, also thanks to its release on the platform in June. Overall, content spending in June was up 6% year-over-year, largely driven by Switch 2 game sales.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Accessories spending also set a new June record of $293 million, in no small part due to sales of the Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller. It was the best-selling accessory of the month and has a 32% attach rate with Nintendo Switch 2 hardware.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">June 2025 U.S. Top 20 Best-Selling Games:</h2><ol data-cy="list"><li>Elden Ring: Nightreign</li><li>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach (NEW)</li><li>Mario Kart World (NEW)*</li><li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</li><li>Stellar Blade</li><li>Forza Horizon 5</li><li>MLB: The Show 25*</li><li>Minecraft*</li><li>Grant Theft Auto V</li><li>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</li><li>Split Fiction</li><li>EA Sports FC 25</li><li>Elden Ring</li><li>NBA 2K25</li><li>Red Dead Redemption II</li><li>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion: Remastered</li><li>Star Wars: Battlefront II (2017)</li><li>Cyberpunk 2077*</li><li>Assassin's Creed: Shadows</li><li>WWE 2K25</li></ol><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>* Indicates that some or all digital sales are not included in Circana's data.

Set in two eras—the decaying future and 1980s Poland—players are plunged into a world inspired by the real Krakow district—Nowa Huta, where survival means bending time itself. You play as a Traveler, an agent of the mysterious Collective, emerging from a dystopian future to dive back into time and extract people before they perish in the apocalypse. As you explore a world on the brink of annihilation, you’ll encounter grotesque enemies known as the Orphans.</p><p><strong>Don’t Let Them Merge</strong></p><p>The new gameplay trailer reveals intense survival moments inside the Orphans’ nest, offering a closer look at these terrifying creatures. Orphans are twisted, body-horror monstrosities born from humanity’s darkest nightmares. The trailer showcases their behavior—exceptionally aggressive and relentless—turning every encounter into a desperate fight for survival. Most importantly, players must prevent them from merging. As previously shown, defeated enemies must be burned immediately. If not, they risk being absorbed by other foes, triggering a merge that creates an even stronger and faster enemy. </p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Exploring the Twisted Realms of the New Dawn</strong></p><p>Additionally, the exciting new trailer reveals part of the story of a mysterious Predecessor—Traveler ND 3500—and their cryptic travel log. Players will journey through unsettling post-apocalyptic environments inspired by the existing Polish district—Nowa Huta, where decaying Brutalist architecture is warped and twisted by reality-bending anomalies.</p></blockquote><p><em>Cronos: The New Dawn</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [9,940 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,557 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [23,714 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2101960/Cronos_The_New_Dawn/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/cronos-the-new-dawn-85b409" target="_blank">Epic Games Store</a> this fall.</p><p>Watch the footage below.</p><h2><span>Sector A-0 Gameplay Showcase</span></h2><p><iframe title="Cronos: The New Dawn | Sector A-0 Gameplay Showcase" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iW4EcsG_Deg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/07/cronos-the-new-dawn-sector-a-0-gameplay]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Bethesda veteran Julian LeFay, sometimes referred to as the 'father of Elder Scrolls' thanks to his pioneering work on the legendary fantasy RPG series, has died aged 59.
</p>
<p>
The news follows developer OnceLost Games' announcement last week that LeFay, who had previously been diagnosed with cancer, would be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-veteran-julian-lefay-father-of-the-elder-scrolls-departs-game-development-due-to-cancer">stepping back from game development</a> to spend his "remaining time with his family and loved ones".
</p>
<p>
LeFay joined Bethesda shortly after its founding in 1987, and oversaw the likes of The Elder Scrolls: Arena and its 1996 sequel Daggerfall in his role as chief engineer. He departed the company in 1998, briefly returning for The Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind, then pursued various other ventures before setting up OnceLost Games with fellow Elder Scrolls veterans Ted Peterson and Vijay Lakshman in 2019. Since then, the studio has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-wayward-realms-is-a-grand-rpg-by-former-elder-scrolls-devs">working on The Wayward Realms</a>, an open-world RPG announced in 2021.
</p>
<p>
LeFay's departure from The Wayward Realms project was announced last week in a video addressed to fans, where it was revealed he'd been "fighting a battle with cancer for the last several years" and didn't "have very much time left". Now, OnceLost has confirmed LeFay's death in a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/oncelostgames.bsky.social/post/3lum4pyp3cs2e">message shared on social media</a>.
</p>
<p>
"It is with profound sadness and heavy hearts that we inform our community of the passing of Julian LeFay, our beloved technical director and co-founder of OnceLost Games," the studio wrote. "Julian LeFay was not just a colleague, he was a visionary who fundamentally shaped the gaming industry as we know it today," it continued, highlighting his work on numerous classic games. "His pioneering work established the foundation for open-world RPGs and influenced countless developers and games that followed."
</p>
<p>
"At OnceLost Games, Julian was one of the masterminds behind The Wayward Realms, bringing decades of expertise and an unwavering commitment to pushing the boundaries of what RPGs could achieve. His technical brilliance, creative vision, and dedication to player agency have been the driving forces behind our ambitious project.
</p>
<p>
"Throughout his courageous battle with cancer, Julian never wavered in his passion for The Wayward Realms. Even during his illness, he continued to share his vision with our team, mentor our developers, and ensure that every aspect of the game reflected his commitment to creating something truly extraordinary. His strength, determination, and unwavering focus inspires us all."
</p>
<p>
Acknowledging the questions fans and Kickstarter backers might now have regarding the future of The Wayward Realms, OnceLost wrote that despite the "immeasurable loss for our team, our community, and our industry", LeFay's "technical frameworks, design philosophises, and direction have all been carefully documented and shared with our team", and that it was "more committed than ever to bringing The Wayward Realms to life exactly as Julian intended it".
</p>
<p>
"Julian's influence extends far beyond our studio," OnceLost concluded. "He touched the lives of millions of players worldwide and inspired countless developers to push creative boundaries. Julian's legacy will live on in every realm, every quest, and every moment of wonder that players will experience in The Wayward Realms."

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-fastest-selling-gaming-hardware-us-history/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-beat-the-ps4-to-become-the-fastest-selling-gaming-hardware-in-us-history.1251036/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is now the fastest-selling piece of video game hardware in the US in the video game industry's history. With 1.6 million units sold in the US according to Circana executive director and analyst Mat Piscatella, it decisively crushed the previous record holder, the PlayStation 4, which sold 1.1 million units in its debut.</p>







<p>Since the Nintendo Switch 2 launched last month, we've seen multiple reports about how it is selling like hotcakes around the world, including in the United States. Just four days from launch, the Switch 2 had reached <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-debuts-with-3-5-million-units-sold-in-4-days/">3.5 million units sold around the world</a>. It was selling <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-nintendo-switch-2-is-selling-twice-as-fast-as-the-og-switch/">twice as fast as the original Nintendo Switch</a> in when it launched in 2017, and it was already <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-set-another-record-by-selling-1-1-million-units-in-its-launch-week-in-the-us/">breaking records for US sales in its first week</a>. </p>



<p>With Piscatella's report for June 2025, he confirms the Switch 2 is solidly in first place, and also shows how impactful the console's launch was on the video game industry for the month, with hardware spending going up <strong>249%</strong> compared to June 2024. It should also not come as a surprise that the Nintendo Switch 2 was the best-selling bit of video game hardware in the US for the month in terms of units and in dollars, beating the PlayStation 5 for the month. That said, the PS5 is still the best-selling piece of hardware for 2025 in both categories, though it'll be interesting to see if that changes before the year is out.</p>



<p>Another significant part of the Switch 2's blockbuster launch is that 82% of people who bought a Nintendo Switch 2 in the US in June also bought <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mario-kart-world/">Mario Kart World</a>, either through the Switch 2 bundle or as a physical game separate from the console. The second-best-selling game for Nintendo platforms last month was Cyberpunk 2077, followed by Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma in third, then The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild rounding out the top five in fourth and fifth place, respectively. </p>







<p>Leaving Switch 2 territory for a bit, other notable aspects of the June 2025 sales charts for the US video game industry are <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a> continuing to sell strongly, making its way into the top-10 best-selling games in the US for 2025 so far at the number eight spot, and being the top-selling premium game in the US for June 2025. </p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review-in-progress-one-more-for-the-road/">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> found itself behind Nightreign in the number two spot on the sales charts for June 2025, and has yet to crack the top-20 best-selling games of the year so far in the US. Zooming in to platform-specific sales charts however shows Death Stranding 2 on the top of the charts for PlayStation 5 game sales in the US.</p>



<p>Lastly, Stellar Blade is the other notable entry on the sales charts, jumping up to second place on the PC sales charts and from 185th place to fifth place on the overall sales charts for June 2025, thanks to its launch on PC. Like everything else though, it still found itself looking up at Nightreign in first place.</p>



<p>All that said, the Nintendo Switch 2 dominating the charts is probably the most unsurprising event in 2025. What's exciting about watching the console now is seeing just how far it goes. We're not yet certain as to how many units were sold globally in June, though reports from earlier in the month put it at surpassing <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-likely-sold-more-than-5-million-units-in-june/">5 million</a>. Marketing analysis firm <a href="https://wccftech.com/switch-2-2025-sales-forecast-bumped-from-15-to-16-million-units-by-dfc-intelligence/">DFC Intelligence has the Switch 2 selling 16 million units</a> before the end of the year.</p>



<p>At this rate, it feels like the Switch 2 will almost certainly reach those heights.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sales analysis firm Circana has released its US gaming industry sales data for June, and it looks like FromSoftware and Bandai Namco can continue their celebrations from last month.</p>

<p>In May, multiplayer spinoff experiment&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/may-gaming-sales-data-elden-ring-nightreign" rel="nofollow">topped the charts</a>, and despite the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">release of the Nintendo Switch 2 in June</a>, it hit the number one spot on the all-format chart for last month as well, according to the ever-reliable <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lun37lnhg22k" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Mat Piscatella</a>.</p>

<p>The Switch 2's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">flagship launch title&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">Mario Kart World</a>&nbsp;</em>didn't manage to scrape second place, either; that honor went to&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em>, a particularly impressive achievement given that Hideo Kojima's latest is only available on PS5.&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart&nbsp;</em>did come in third, though.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/death-stranding-2-us-gaming-sales-data-june.jpg?itok=fl97ed_3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/death-stranding-2-us-gaming-sales-data-june.jpg?itok=o153mxfh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach&nbsp;</em>outsold&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>in June.</figcaption></figure><p>With regards to the year-to-date best-selling chart, no game has yet to unseat&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, which, despite <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">recent negative feedback</a> from players, has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-10m" rel="nofollow">proven a runaway success</a> for developer and publisher Capcom.</p>

<p>Second place still goes to <i>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</i>, and&nbsp;Ubisoft's&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>brings up third, which may come as something of a balm to the studio following its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-creative-houses-q1-financials" rel="nofollow">disappointing Q1 financial results</a>.</p>

<p>In hardware terms, June 2025 set a new record for hardware spending by Circana's reckoning, beating out previous record-holder 2008. Spending hit $978m in June, bolstered by the release of the Switch 2.</p>

<p>The console managed to sell 1.6 million units in June in the US, breaking records for launch month unit sales and shattering the previous record set by Sony's PlayStation 4, which hit 1.1 million units in November 2013.</p>

        <p>Endgame Gear’s tainted Configuration Tool was left online for at least two weeks</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>PC gaming mouse 'n' keeb manufacturers Endgame Gear have admitted to and apologised for unknowingly spreading malware, after an infected version of the OP1w 4k v2’s Configuration Tool software was left available to download from their website.</p>
<p>After Reddit user Admirable-Raccoon597 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EndGameGear/comments/1m29q06/security_alert_endgame_gears_op1w_4k_v2/">raised the alarm</a>, having installed the Configuration Tool and found the malware hiding inside, German tech site <a href="https://www.igorslab.de/en/malware-in-official-mouse-software-endgame-gears-op1w-4k-v2-tool-infected-with-xred-rat/">Igor’s Lab</a> confirmed that the publically available application had been compromised for at least two weeks. Endgame Gear have since replaced the dirty software with an apparently safe version, and today <a href="https://www.endgamegear.com/security-update">shared a post</a> admitting the oversight – though claimed no sensitive data was stolen via the server infrastructure that was hosting it.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We became aware of this situation involving one of our product pages through online discussions," the statement reads. "Following this, we initiated an internal review to better understand the circumstances and address any potential issues. A clean version of the affected file was immediately published as soon as we identified the situation.</p>
<p>"Importantly, access to our file servers was not compromised, and no customer data was accessible or affected on our servers at any time." </p>
<p>The post adds that the company "sincerely regret this incident and deeply apologise for any concern or inconvenience it may have caused. For Endgame Gear, the security and trust of our customers are paramount. We are fully committed to continuously improving our security protocols to prevent such events from occurring again."</p>
<p>The malware in question, Xred, is a particularly nasty strain: it’s a remote access trojan (RAT) that, if allowed to propagate through a PC system, would allow an attacker to take control and do all kinds of unsavoury things, from nicking passwords and spying through webcams to replacing RPS with PC Gamer in your browser bookmarks. Truly heinous stuff. Luckily it’s also known to Internet security suites, so most firewalls should pick it up – though Admirable-Raccoon597’s post doesn’t mention being warned before executing the infected software.</p>
<p>It’s also not terribly reassuring that Endgame Gear’s statement neglects to identify the breach that saw their innocuous mouse utility fouled by Xred in the first place. The company has at least implemented a variety of additional anti-malware measures, though without users knowing that the specific hole has been plugged, they may have some trouble earning back trust, even if no personal details were pinched from the hosting servers directly.</p>
<p>If you own an OP1w 4k v2 and downloaded its Configuration Tool between June 26th and July 9th, do follow the steps in Endgame Gear’s post to identify and remove any trojany files. Because, yeesh. The worst thing <em>my</em> mouse does to me is blink its lights for no reason, and that still runs me ragged; if it started letting crims seize control of my PC, one of my windows would spontaneously develop a visibly mouse-shaped hole.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pc-peripheral-makers-deeply-apologise-for-hosting-malware-in-their-mouse-software-by-accident]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Borderlands 4 - Official Story Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Anyone looking to buy a physical copy of Borderlands 4 for Switch 2 will also have to clear some space on the console, as Pitchford suggested that it might be sold as a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-wont-be-tied-to-your-account/1100-6530654/" data-ref-id="1100-6530654">Game-Key Card</a>. "It's a big game. There will be a download, even for physical copies," <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1947722574122901838" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pitchford wrote</a>.</p><p>Game-Key Cards essentially turn the Switch 2 cartridge into an authentication key to enable the download of the game directly to the console. It's worth noting that Game-Key Cards aren't tied to your Nintendo account, as they can be used be shared with friends or sold to another person.</p><p>Borderlands 4 will also be available for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, and the game will launch earlier for those platforms on September 12. As its release date draws closer, Gearbox has begun sharing more details on the game's playable characters--like the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-borderlands-4-trailers-introduce-latest-siren-character-show-off-necromancer-abilities/1100-6533123/" data-ref-id="1100-6533123">new Siren named Vex</a>--the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-has-over-200-bobblehead-collectibles-but-good-luck-getting-all-of-them/1100-6533163/" data-ref-id="1100-6533163">hundreds of collectibles</a> that you <em>probably</em> won't find, and an option to finally <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-introduces-its-best-feature-yet-a-claptrap-volume-slider/1100-6532865/" data-ref-id="1100-6532865">make Claptrap shut up</a>.</p>
