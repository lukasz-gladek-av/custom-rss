            <p>Sony have announced a new PlayStation studio made up of former developers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny">Destiny</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/halo">Halo</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/league-of-legends">League Of Legends</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/roblox">Roblox</a>, plus a few industry newcomers. Called teamLFG - where "LFG" stands for Looking For Group, not the other, naughty phrase you're thinking of - they're based in Bellevue, Washington, and are dedicated to "exceptional action-based gameplay, moment-to-moment game feel, and richly social virtual worlds". Uuuuuurrrgh. Their first project is a "comedic" and "lighthearted" team-based action game set in a new science-fantasy universe.</p>
<p>The PlayStation <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/07/welcome-teamlfg-to-the-playstation-studios-family/?sf277193480=1">blogpost</a> announcing all this is a wearying paean to an idea of the live service game that dates back to the original Destiny in 2014. It's written in the style of a cyborg that is trying to remember how to love. There is, however, a spark of eccentricity at the end that makes the labour of being preached to about engagement processes worthwhile: the team claim to be inspired by "frog-type games". What is a frog-type game? A Frogger homage? A real estate sim about Finishing Rooms Over Garages? Did they just misspell "frag"? The mind froggles.</p><!--more-->
<p>You should have led with "frog-type game", Sony - it's easily the most interesting part of this announcement, which otherwise makes me feel terribly old. But perhaps you placed it at the end to test the willingness of news writers to wade through yet more paragraphs of live service pablum. On which note: "We are driven by a mission to create games where players can find friendship, community, and belonging," the post explains. "We want our players to feel excited when they log on to discover their teammates already hanging out online. We want our players to recognize familiar names and to make myths and memes out of each other. We want our players to love remembering that one time where they pulled off That Play that changed the whole story of the match. As we say on the team - dat's da good stuff."</p>
<p>I refuse to believe that you say "dat's da good stuff", teamLFG, and I do not appreciate your attempts at being colloquial, after threatening to make me feel excited about the prospect of seeing somebody I know online. Still, it's possible the clunky roguishness here is a ruse, and there's a cunning reference to discover. A quick Google of "dat's da good stuff" leads me to an Instagram image of a football player inhaling the scent of pastry. Perhaps the real frog-type games were the baked goods we memed along the way.</p>
<p>The post promises to make action games that people can play for "countless hours". There's also talk of early access playtests and "[growing] the game and community for years to come." This from a studio owned by Sony, who recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hero-shooter-concord-taken-offline-as-sony-say-its-initial-launch-didnt-land-the-way-wed-intended">gutted hero shooter Concord at launch</a>.</p>
<p>As for teamLFG's debut project, it'll take cues from "fighting games, platformers, MOBAs, [and] life sims", in addition to "frog-type games". It seems likely this is the very same sci-fantasy action game that was disclosed as part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/destiny-creators-bungie-lay-off-220-people-and-form-new-studio-within-sony-to-stave-off-financial-ruin">mass layoffs at Bungie last July</a>. It also seems likely that teamLFG include a few of the former Bungie devs who were relocated to form a new PlayStation studio as part of Bungie's cost-cutting. What's left of Bungie are still working on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> and the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> reboot, each an out-and-out live service production. You can never have too much frogspawn in the live service basket.</p>
<p>I petitioned the RPS hivemind for their thoughts on "frog-type games" before writing this piece. Jeremy pointed me towards <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1978150/Kamaeru_A_Frog_Refuge/">Kamaeru: A Frog Refuge</a>, "a cozy frog collecting game, where you take pictures of frogs, play mini-games and decorate your habitat". It seems charming and painterly and relaxed. If you can feel your soul fragmenting at the idea of feeding "countless hours" to another sci-fantasy Skinner box, maybe play the demo for Kamaeru instead.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Both <em>FFVII</em> games are Steam Deck verified, but the install base of that PC gaming handheld remains tiny. “I have high hopes that we can build a strong partnership between Nintendo and the <em>Final Fantasy </em>brand,” he added. </p><p>Hamaguchi ended with a tease for what that partnership will entail. “I hope players are looking forward to the <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> series on Switch 2,” he said, hinting that the second two games, including <em>Rebirth</em> and the currently in-development part three, will find their way to the Nintendo handheld hybrid as well at some point. While<em> Remake</em>, which was available on PlayStation 4, <em>&nbsp;</em>seemed like an obvious port, <em>Rebirth</em>—which struggled with some texture resolution and framerate problems even on PS5—would be a much more ambitious port. </p><p>From the way Hamaguchi talks, however, it sounds like Square Enix will be making those ports a priority. Could the third <em>Remake</em> game be a day-and-date multiplatform release across PS5, Switch 2, and PC? Juggling all of those different versions might be a bit much from a technical perspective, but Square Enix has certainly gestured <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/square-enix-business-plan-multiplatform-1851472456&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/square-enix-business-plan-multiplatform-1851472456">at wanting to broaden the availability</a></span> of its biggest releases after staggered exclusivity held back both <em>Rebirth</em> and <em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>. Maybe we could even see that release get ported to Switch 2 as well. It seems more likely than either game hitting Xbox Series X/S at this point. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>La Quimera, the story-driven FPS from the developers formerly known as 4A Games Ukraine, was recently delayed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/la-quimera-delayed-just-after-reviews-went-live/1100-6531145/" data-ref-id="1100-6531145"><em>after </em>reviews for the game went live</a>, and now the developers have reverted the game to early access instead of a 1.0 launch. The game is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2282350/La_Quimera/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">out now on Steam Early Access for $30.</a></p><p>Reburn CEO Dmytro Lymar said in a statement, "Though this wasn't our original plan, as Ukrainian game developers, we're very familiar with perseverance in the face of tough choices and tougher odds."</p><p>As with other early access titles, La Quimera will grow and evolve over time with future updates, the developer said.

                <p dir="ltr">The odds of an Xbox-branded handheld arriving this year look like they're increasing. That's because images have leaked of the ROG Ally 2, with one version sporting an Xbox button and better specs, according to <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/asus-rog-ally-2-and-rog-ally-2-xbox-edition-gaming-handhelds-leaked" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VideoCardz</a>. This would confirm reports from earlier this year that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-branded-handheld-planned-for-later-this-year-report/1100-6530020/">Microsoft was partnering with Asus on a portable device</a>.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://x.com/94G8LA/status/1919936711423135892" rel="nofollow ">On X</a>, user Huang514 posted pictures of two different variations of the ROG Ally 2. The black version is supposedly the Xbox-branded edition of the hardware, apparently boasting an eight-core AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme processor and 64GB of memory. The images were discoverable after <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/id/hub/asus-rog-ally-2-diduga-segera-rilis-di-indonesia-dapat-sertifikat-sdppi-postel/" rel="nofollow ">website 91mobiles</a> spotted Indonesian certification office entries for the devices from Asus. Keep in mind that <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1906769447341510708" rel="nofollow ">the official Xbox account on X</a> teased a collaboration with Asus in March, too.</p><p dir="ltr">This all certainly sounds like project Kennan. In addition, in possibly a happenstance moment, The Verge's Tom Warren noted <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tomwarren.co.uk/post/3lollkmjcic2f" rel="nofollow ">on BlueSky</a> that the Xbox app on PC just received an update that adds battery status and Wi-Fi signal icons for the compact mode.

Last year, Asus delivered <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-rog-ally-x-handheld-is-a-mid-gen-refresh/1100-6523336/">a mid-generation refresh with the ROG Ally X</a>, sporting a bigger battery and more RAM. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-might-not-be-a-traditional-console-may-launch-in-2027-per-insider/1100-6529996/">it's believed Microsoft is working internally on its own Xbox handheld</a> that could come out in 2027 along with a new home console.</p><p dir="ltr">What will be intriguing for this apparent Xbox edition of the ROG Ally 2 relates to the handheld's price tag. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/">Microsoft just raised Xbox Series X|S console prices</a>--Series X now costs $600--and stated that select first-party games will retail for $80 this holiday season.</p>

			<p>After a last-minute, <a href="https://wccftech.com/reburn-has-delayed-la-quimera-with-no-new-release-date-in-sight-after-sending-out-review-codes/">quietly confirmed delay</a> on the day of its original intended release, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/la-quimera-short-but-not-sweet/">La Quimera</a> has launched on PC in early access a week and a half later.</p>
<p>La Quimera was originally scheduled to release on April 25, 2025, and just days before that release, review keys were sent to members of the press, including Wccftech. When the release day came, shortly after reviews went live, the game was quietly delayed, with developer Reburn releasing a statement just to its Discord server on launch day.</p>
<p>The following day, Reburn posted the same statement to La Quimera's <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2282350/discussions/0/597399045152010557/">Steam page</a>, and three days after that, the studio released a longer statement about the delay on the game's Steam page. It was at that point that Reburn confirmed La Quimera would be an early access release after it had originally been marketed as a complete game.</p>
<p>In a press release for today's release, chief executive officer of Reburn, Dmytro Lymar, thanked players who had been keen to play La Quimera for their support after the decision to release La Quimera in early access was announced.</p>
<p>"<em>We truly appreciate the support our community has shown since we made the decision to pivot La Quimera into Early Access. Though this wasn't our original plan, as Ukrainian game developers, we're very familiar with perseverance in the face of tough choices and tougher odds.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Our goal is to deliver a new experience that fans of our past work have come to expect now and through future updates. Thank you again to all of our supporters</em>."</p>
<p>According to the game's Steam page, Reburn intends to work on La Quimera in early access for 18 months, with the full version meant to offer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deeper integration between narrative and gameplay in both solo and co-op modes</li>
<li>Expanded NPC involvement in story-driven gameplay situations</li>
<li>Improved pacing and balance between narrative sequences and gameplay encounters</li>
<li>Enhanced level design for combat, ensuring challenges remain engaging for both solo and cooperative players</li>
<li>A large number of levels that complete the game's major story arcs</li>
</ul>
<p>Reburn also clarified that it intends to raise the game's price from its current early access price of $29.99 USD as it adds more content.</p>
<p><iframe title="La Quimera - Early Access Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n-OBrFTGwWI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>I was tasked with playing La Quimera for review, and it was apparent from my time with it that it was an unfinished game. I even commented in my review that if it had been marketed as an early access game from the beginning, I would feel better about its current state. But at the time, it was described as a full release, and was simply a broken game that wasn't worth playing.</p>
<p>Now that it has launched in early access, I can't say that I feel better about its chances. I would love to see it improve over the next 18 months and release as the game Reburn first envisioned, but its issues go beyond the numerous technical problems I faced. So many things about La Quimera need not just to improve, but change completely, to come out the other side of early access as a strong, single-player shooter that can stand out in a crowded genre.</p>
<p>It didn't make a good first impression, but La Quimera has the bones of a game that could grow to be a must-play for shooter fans. This is one case where I hope I'm eating my words and the doubts I have now by the time it hits 1.0.</p>

And surprisingly, EA isn’t going to do that.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://ir.ea.com/events-and-presentations/events/event-details/2025/Electronic-Arts-Q4-and-FY-2025-Earnings-Conference-Call/default.aspx&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://ir.ea.com/events-and-presentations/events/event-details/2025/Electronic-Arts-Q4-and-FY-2025-Earnings-Conference-Call/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On May 6, EA held its Q4 and FY 2025 earnings call</a></span> and took some questions from various investors. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ea-suggests-it-has-no-plans-to-raise-game-prices-yet-despite-others-doing-so/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ea-suggests-it-has-no-plans-to-raise-game-prices-yet-despite-others-doing-so/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As reported by <em>VGC</em></a></span>, during the call one person asked Wilson about the “pricing power” of EA’s franchises and whether the company was going to start “taking a similar approach” to other game publishers who were raising prices. </p><p>Wilson replied that the video game industry is “very different” today than it was a decade ago. Back then it was all about selling “discs in plastic boxes” in stores. Now that’s a very small part of EA’s overall business, and they have a wide variety of pricing options from “free-to-play all the way to deluxe editions and beyond.” </p><p>“At the end of the day,” said Wilson. “Whether we’re doing something that costs a dollar, or we’re doing something that costs $10, or we’re doing something that costs $100, our objective is always delivering incredible quality and exponential value to our player base.”</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ea.com/executives&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ea.com/executives" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EA CFO Stuart Canfield</a></span> added: “From a games perspective we put out, we have reflected no changes in our current strategy at this point.”</p><p>Now, you’ll notice that nowhere in either executive’s comments did they outright promise prices will never go up. In fact, there’s plenty of wiggle room in there for them to one day start selling standard editions of games for $80 or more. But for now at least, it seems like EA doesn’t feel the need to slap an $80 sticker on its next big <em>Star Wars</em> game, and that’s probably because—unlike Nintendo—<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-one-series-x-s-college-football-25-madden-nfl-ea-1851604118&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-one-series-x-s-college-football-25-madden-nfl-ea-1851604118">EA has actually been selling $100 games for some time now</a></span> via their super-pricey deluxe editions. No need to raise prices for everyone when a smaller portion of your audience is already paying a lot more every year. How long this will stick remains to be seen. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-xcom-ea-zero-company-turn-based-trailer-2026-1851776904&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-xcom-ea-zero-company-turn-based-trailer-2026-1851776904">But for now, it seems like EA’s upcoming <em>Star Wars: Zero Company</em></a></span> won’t be $80. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

With <em>Dorfromantik</em>, you can immerse yourself in a quiet, peaceful world at any time and take a break from everyday life. At the same time, Dorfromantik offers a challenge for those who are looking for one: To beat the high score, you need to carefully plan and strategically place your tiles.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p><p>In <em>Dorfromantik</em> you start with a stack of procedurally generated tiles. One after the other, you draw the top tile of the stack, place it on one available slot and rotate for the best fit. Thereby groups and combinations of landscapes are formed, such as forests, villages or water bodies, and you are rewarded with points depending on how well the tile fits.</p><p>On some tiles you will also encounter special objects that give you a quest: For example, the windmill wants to border 6 grain fields, the locomotive wants to be connected to 10 tracks or the deer wants to inhabit a forest with at least 50 trees. Fulfill these quests to get more tiles to continue the expansion of your landscape. The game ends when the tile stack is used up.</p><p>As you expand the landscape, you can advance into new, colorful biomes and discover pre-placed game objects that give you long-term tasks. Through these tasks you can unlock new tiles, new biomes and new quests.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li>Building endless and beautiful landscapes.</li><li>Unique mix of strategy and puzzle mechanics.</li><li>Relaxing and calming gameplay.</li><li>Idyllic village scenery.</li><li>Strategic placement to beat the high score.</li><li>High replay value—every session is different.</li><li>Many unlockable tiles and biomes.</li><li>Original art style with hand-painted <a title="Genres > Board Game [57 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/board-game">board game</a> feel.</li></ul><p><strong>Not Features</strong></p><ul><li>4X strategy.</li><li>Trading.</li><li>Resource <a title="Genres > Management [28 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/management">management</a>.</li><li>Combat and violence.</li><li><a title="Genres > Multiplayer [494 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">Multiplayer</a>.</li></ul><p><strong>Game Modes</strong></p><p><em>Dorfromantik</em> offers options for any style of play!

                                        <p>The beloved cult-classic, Ragnarok X: Next Generation (ROX), is making its triumphant launch in the Americas, Australia, New Zealand and Western Europe on May 8th. Developed by Gravity Game Hub (GGH)--the original creators of Ragnarok Online--ROX is a free-to-play remake featuring enhanced full 3D visuals and fresh gameplay mechanics that bring the magic of the original series forward for a new generation.</p><p>With pre-registrations live on PC, iOS, and Android, GameSpot is here to tell you everything you need to know about Ragnarok X: Next Generation and how it introduces the next chapter of the Ragnarok series.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4486452-picture1rox-kv-1280x1720.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4486452" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4486452-picture1rox-kv-1280x1720.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4486452"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4486452-picture1rox-kv-1280x1720.jpg"></figure><h4>Explore a living, breathing, player-driven world</h4><p>In Ragnarok X: Next Generation, combat is just one of many ways to enjoy the adventure. Rox is a dynamic world with a real in-game economy shaped directly by player activity. Venture into dungeons to uncover rare loot to trade, or take on life skill jobs like fishing, mining, and farming to gather resources for yourself and to sell in the market. Just like in real life, the in-game market is in constant flux, creating an immersive environment that rewards player resourcefulness and ingenuity.</p><p>The major cities of ROX are also constantly evolving. Explore them solo or with friends to uncover hidden quests, secret dungeons, and limited-time events. Or kick back and relax--shop for new gear, complete your daily chores, and partake in mini-games like Battle of Arms.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5CfjQM7onE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/A5CfjQM7onE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h4>Forge your path alone or with friends</h4><p>Whether you're tackling Midgard's challenges by yourself or teaming up with friends, ROX lets you choose your path. Going solo is a satisfying way to overcome obstacles and build something of your very own, but when you're ready to band together via cross-play, you and your adventurer buddies can clear dungeons, hunt powerful MVP bosses, and unravel the world's many mysteries.</p><p>The new and improved guild system makes joining a guild or building and managing your own a simple affair. Guilds aren't just opportunities to join fellow players to find quests but also to take part in events and earn some excellent rewards, ranging from exclusive offline prizes to in-game loot. Anyone who forms or joins a guild to partake in guild events qualifies for rewards, so don't be afraid to invite your friends or make new ones within ROX’s lively community.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4486455-picture3gameplay.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4486455" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4486455-picture3gameplay.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4486455"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4486455-picture3gameplay.jpg"></figure><h4>Choose from six evolving classes</h4><p>From the moment you step into Midgard, players' destinies can branch into six professions, each with unique paths, signature abilities, and legendary gear:</p><ul><li>Swordsmen can embrace the stalwart defence of the Knight or – for team boosting buffs--the holy might of the Crusader</li><li>Mages harness elements as Wizards to unleash devastating spells or refine their magical arts into supportive Sages for enchantments to turn the tide of battle.</li><li>Archers can progress to become Hunters whose arrows block out the sun, or a harmonious Bard for inspirational melodies to aid teammates.</li><li>Acolytes can become Priests whose healing abilities can safeguard their comrades, or channel their faith into Monks' chants, which offer both damage and protection.</li><li>Thieves can either take the stealthy route to become a deadly Assassin, or they can use their cunning to become a Rogue, where their unique tricks and speed can give them the edge.</li><li>Merchants can become Blacksmiths to master the art of weapon and armour creation, or Alchemists to brew special potions and elixirs that can reshape the flow of combat.</li></ul><p>As you play, you'll unlock new Tiers in your chosen profession to gain even more powerful skills, plus exclusive mounts and class-specific equipment. All these elements mean that you can fine-tune your build for any challenge, whether it's PvE raids, PvP showdowns, or all-out Guild v Guild brawls.</p><p>Every drop is yours to trade, and with the economy of the game driven by the player, trading your equipment, along with the bounty from your fishing, cooking, and mining activities, is very much encouraged. Whatever path you choose, be it the path of steel or the road of ingenuity, the journey is unique to you.</p><h4>Fully customisable real-time gameplay</h4><p>Job classes in Ragnarok X: Next Generation have roles tailored to specific playstyles. These can be further customised by equipping different weapon types and allocating skill points to boost specific stats. Play as an archer with boosted vitality to increase your HP and stay in the fight for longer, or play as a fleet-footed acolyte with a boosted dexterity stat to evade enemy attacks while keeping the team alive with healing magic.</p><p>Combat in ROX takes place in real time, with fast, responsive controls that can be fully customised on both mobile and PC. The improved auto-battle and pathfinding systems let players dynamically engage enemies using preset tactics and locate and complete quests automatically.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4486456-picture4cta.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4486456" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4486456-picture4cta.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4486456"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4486456-picture4cta.jpg"></figure><h4>A cult-classic reborn</h4><p>Whether you're new to the franchise or a seasoned veteran, Ragnarok X: Next Generation delivers a fresh experience that blends nostalgia with modern, intuitive gameplay set in a charming, colourful, and vibrant world. As an award-winning free-to-play MMORPG that avoids pay-to-win mechanics, ROX is the most accessible entry in the franchise yet, giving players the freedom to forge their own journey, shape their identity, and immerse themselves in the decades-long story that started it all.</p><p>Recognized by Google Play as the Best Game of the Year, Best Competitive Game, and Best Tablet Game, ROX continues to redefine the future of mobile MMORPGs. Combining nostalgic appeal with cross-platform gameplay, ROX brings an unparalleled gaming experience that redefines what players expect from an MMORPG. Join over 20 million players already online when Ragnarok X: Next Generation launches on May 8 across North America, South America, and Western Europe on PC, App Store, and Google Play.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/eve-vanguard-makes-a-lot-of-big-promises-but-delivers-good-gunplay<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It's almost surreal to ride a drop pod down to the surface of one of EVE Online's tens of thousands of planets in the upcoming shooter tie-in, EVE Vanguard. I've flown by them hundreds of times in the many years I've been playing the venerable spaceship MMO, but usually at astronomical distances. I always wondered about what was going on down there. I would make up stories about it in my head. Now I have a high-powered space rifle in my hands and I'm experiencing the universe up close and personal. And while it was a very, very build that couldn't show off a lot of the bigger promises, to my disappointment, there are some promising hints already.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a quick caveat, the footage you're seeing is still from an early build and a lot of things, including the weapon and enemy models, are not final. CCP just announced that Vanguard will be going into Early Access in Summer 2026, so we've still got a while to wait. Also, the portion we actually got to play was only the session-based shooter maps themselves, and not the career and progression stuff that will be taking place back in space. But I got to talk to the devs about both, so we'll get into a bit of each here.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">EVE Vanguard – First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What, exactly, is a Vanguard? Well, like most things in EVE Online, it's some esoteric high concept sci-fi that can seem a little bewildering at first. Your character is a semi-immortal "infomorph" – which is to say a digital human consciousness that lives in cyberspace. I guess you could say you're something like Johnny Silverhand from Cyberpunk 2077. To fight on the front lines of New Eden's many wars, you upload yourself into a powerful war clone, which is purpose-grown from a fresh soup of biological matter for each mission. They're not free, but you can call down a new one in the middle of a mission if the one you're in gets blown up, explaining how you can respawn over and over.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On a scale from random cannon fodder to Master Chief, the devs said you can think of war clones as not exactly superhuman, but more like the absolute peak of human ability an elite athlete could achieve. They are renowned across the galaxy, and running into another player-controlled Vanguard on a deployment is meant to feel like a mini boss fight.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Suit Up</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Vanguards gather in bastions, which CCP says you could think of almost like The Continental from John Wick. I swear I'm not trying to shoehorn in more Keanu references here. It just happens! It's neutral ground to shop, swap stories, and pick up new contracts, represented by a virtual space where you'll be able to physically walk around and interact with other mercs' avatars. As someone who was devastated when EVE Online removed the ability to walk around in stations, I was particularly pleased to hear this.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The really cool thing, though, is that these bastions exist out in the same universe where EVE Online players are zipping around in their spaceships. The initial ones will be NPC-controlled, but it will eventually be possible for players to attack, build, and even own their own bastions. CCP hopes specific bastions might develop a reputation as the place you go if you really need a job done right. And similar to how EVE has "high sec" space where NPC law enforcement protects new players and "low" or "null sec" where players are free to PvP to their heart's content, new Vanguards will also be able to choose where they end up based on how interested they are in fighting other players.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Hair Trigger</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the biggest changes in philosophy EVE Vanguard has undergone since its reveal back in 2023 is how the guns themselves are being designed. We're moving away from sleek, understated military sci-fi into what the designers called an homage to the "golden age" of shooters, citing inspirations like Doom, Quake, and Unreal. There is still your standard space rifle, which comes in a few different faction variants. But I also got to play around with an energy shotgun with ricocheting projectiles that can fire in a spread pattern, or a single, massive orb of destruction if you hold down the fire button for a couple seconds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As more of a long-range enjoyer, my favorite was this high-powered sniper rifle that features the ability to hold your breath to line up a perfect shot. While the model is clearly unfinished, the reload animation of swapping out the little focusing crystal is slick and memorable as well. Like in EVE Online, almost everything is gathered and crafted by players, too. Even in a mission, I had to loot some corpses and spend a bit of time with my portable fabricator to top up my ammo. Mining and industry will also be a part of the Vanguard experience. It will even be possible to specialize in it – though the devs warned me that you'll probably want to bring some backup with combat skills if you do.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>For now, EVE Vanguard is still a lot of "wills," "shoulds," and " hope tos." It is playable, and the gunplay feels a bit unpolished still, but satisfying. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You might see me switching weapons with a debug menu in the video at the top of the page, which was just for the demo. Eventually, we'll be picking our loadout from the deck of our own battlebarge ahead of a deployment. This will also let us pick which kind of war clone to spawn, and we were told they will eventually come in all different shapes and sizes for different specializations. Vanguard will also have a bit of separation from the main EVE Online economy. Notably, you don't buy guns and ammo with ISK, which is the main currency for the starship jockeys, since it wouldn't make much sense for a rifle to cost the same as a frigate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There absolutely will be ways for players of both games to work together and benefit one another symbiotically, though. Some materials Vanguards can access planetside might not be abundant in space, for instance. Another example I was given likened it to Star Wars: Rogue One or Return of the Jedi, where an elite ground team might have to take down a shield generator so the fleet above can attack a fortified station.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Nightmare Fuel</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The enemies here are also a work-in-progress. Using placeholder models, they spawn in small groups and mostly keep their distance, but I did get caught a couple times by a flanking attack from an unexpected direction. We got to see some concept art of one of the PvE enemy factions, Mordu's Legion, though, and they are extremely unsettling. These cyborg space mercs who have their heart ritually removed as part of their initiation will come in several different ranks, with some being able to direct the others on the battlefield.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On any given deployment, you might end up running into these NPCs and other players. These arenas are massive, open-ended, and varied, a combination of procedurally-generated terrain and handcrafted battlegrounds featuring the wreckage of some of EVE's recognizable starships. In this mission, there was debris actively streaking through the atmosphere as we fought, which was a really awesome touch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, EVE Vanguard is still a lot of "wills," "shoulds," and " hope tos." It is playable, and the gunplay feels a bit unpolished still, but satisfying. The environments are impressive, and the weapon designs are diverse and bombastic. It's just hard to get the full picture without actually experiencing how it will tie into the EVE Online shared universe or the social features, which are definitely the most exciting part of the whole idea. For that we'll have to wait until the middle of next year when Early Access warps in, at which point both games will be connected at last.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/genshin-impact-updates-shop-to-show-how-much-you-need-to-spend-to-guarantee-pulling-a-character-and-now-players-want-hoyoverse-to-sell-the-characters-directly<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a> is one of the most popular gacha games in the world. The free-to-play action RPG from HoYoverse lets players spend a virtual currency called Primogems to have a chance (a “wish”) to obtain rare characters of varying power. It’s a microtransactions system that has proved controversial, but a money-spinner for the developers, generating billions of dollars in revenue over the years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In most games of this type, the amount of money you have to spend to eventually pull a character is withheld from the player — and you can see why given the poor odds available. But now, HoYoverse has updated Genshin Impact to do just that, revealing front and centre just how much needs to be spent.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Genshin Impact shop now tells U.S. players how many pulls you’re getting with each purchase (you can buy wishes directly with a direct conversion rate displayed) and how much you need to spend to guarantee pulling a character, which varies between $1.98 to $475.20. The figure is based on the base prices of the pulls (without bonuses) and if you hit the max pulls to guarantee the character (180 pulls).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, while the posted figure assumes the highest possible price if you intentionally don’t buy the higher value (and more expensive) bundles, you could face spending nearly $500 pulling just one character in Genshin Impact.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players have reacted with a mix of disbelief and positivity at the transparency.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Whole thing is weirdly.... Transparent,” said redditor Zion-plex. “You see it clear as day, 100 bucks 50 pulls every time staring at you (whales think or maybe don't even care they ‘know’ the math). Man, that'll sting, even for those who can and will spend, there's a lot of mental suppression that goes on.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">”Unmitigated positive,” said Whilyam. “The only people helped by obscuring costs are the ones who want to take advantage of people or make it easier for people with addictions to justify spending money.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think it’s harder to justify the spending with abysmal conversion rate visible with your eyes,” added Mtboomerang. “I think the biggest problem with addicts is they follow the emotion then they will calculate. With the conversion rate visible now, their logic will shut their emotion down in time before they are deep in emotion abyss trying to come up with a reason.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Good changes that should be standardized for all Gachas and other similar games with gambling/loot box type mechanics,” said mikethebest1.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Some players are now calling on HoYoverse to just let Genshin Impact players buy characters directly, given they now know how much it could cost to obtain them through the gacha system.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I wish they would just freaking sell the damn characters,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1kgml90/comment/mr0iwzu/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said yuusharo</a>. “Horse armor works on me, I’d pay a freak ton on these games if I knew I’d get what I wanted every single time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Instead, the vast majority of their revenue comes from a tiny percentage of players exploiting gambling tendencies, preying on people like vultures. I hate it, I feel so gross whenever I succumb to that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, why has HoYoverse added this layer of transparency to Genshin Impact now? It’s because it lost a court case against the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) back in January that resulted in a ban on selling loot boxes</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you are wondering why, back in January <a href="https://consumer.ftc.gov/consumer-alerts/2025/01/ftc-settlement-order-bans-sales-genshin-impact-loot-boxes-kids-under-16-without-their-parents" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HoYoverse reached a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)</a> that resulted in increased transparency around parental consent and virtual currency practices within its games. The results are now kicking in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As part of this, <a href="https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/news/detail/155805" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HoYoverse is now required by U.S. law to age verify U.S. player accounts</a>. That's because as part of the FTC's settlement order, sales of Genshin Impact loot boxes to kids under 16 without their parents' consent were banned. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The age verification process will be rolled out to all U.S. players by May 20. If you don’t provide your age information by July 18, 2025, you could see your account suspended, the developer warned. If the verification is not completed by July 20, 2026, the personal information of your HoYoverse account will be deleted permanently.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

The latest video features Square Enix's Naoki Hamaguchi, director of the Final Fantasy 7 Remake trilogy, who confirmed that all three FF7 Remake games will eventually come to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/">Switch 2</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade was included among <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-nintendo-switch-2-games/2900-6128/#1">games coming to Switch 2</a> mentioned during the Direct, but the Creator's Voice video is the first confirmation that all three games--Remake, Rebirth, and the as-yet-unnamed third game--will launch on Nintendo's new console in the future. No official release dates have been confirmed for the Switch 2 ports of Remake and Rebirth.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wm68MEd3d5c" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Wm68MEd3d5c" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">During the interview, Hamaguchi revealed that, despite his 24 years of experience developing games, this is the first time he'll be creating something for a Nintendo console. "When I first saw the Switch 2, I was intrigued," Hamaguchi says in the video. "I felt it would have enough power to run the FF7 remake series I was creating. That's what convinced me to get involved."</p><p dir="ltr">FF7 Remake Intergrade isn't the only Square Enix game confirmed for Switch, with Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster launching on June 5--the same day as the console itself. Other <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-launch-game/2900-6401/" data-ref-id="2900-6401">Switch 2 launch titles</a> include <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/" data-ref-id="1100-6528874">Mario Kart World</a>, Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition, and updated <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-game-getting-switch-2-edition-enhanced-versions/2900-6398/" data-ref-id="2900-6398">Switch 2 Edition</a> versions of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom.</p><p dir="ltr">The third game in the Final Fantasy 7 remake trilogy, meanwhile, has seen no details emerge other than a confirmation of its existence during the Final Fantasy 7 Anniversary stream in June 2022. Recently, the development team confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-development-takes-another-big-step-forward/1100-6528974/" data-ref-id="1100-6528974">work on the third game began immediately</a> after Rebirth was completed, and that the story scenario had been fully written as of the end of 2024.</p>

For this project I wanted to create a realistically simulated DSLR camera, for the satisfaction of photographers and to hopefully let newcomers learn more about camera settings.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Most of the camera's standard effects like depth of field, focal length, exposure and noise are all very easily simulated in Unreal Engine. The one effect that was missing however, was the ability to recreate long exposure, a standard feature of high grade cameras that allows you to leave the shutter open and capture an entire range of motion in one image. I hadn't seen this being done in a game engine before, so I wanted to give it my best shot.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/how-avowed-s-qa-team-stomped-out-bugs-by-working-inside-the-design-tools" target="_self" data-discover="true">How Avowed's QA team stomped out bugs by working inside the design tools</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Final in-game effect:</span></span></p><p>Image via Matt Newell/Annapurna Interactive.</p><p>Image via Matt Newell/Annapurna Interactive.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The approach I made to this was purely based on math. Real cameras don't work in "frames" or "ticks," so the in-engine solution for this would be to sequentially take images over time and compile them on top of one another. Combining all these images would end up being way too bright of course, so I created various methods of adjusting the exposure and appearance until I landed on the right outcome. I’ll try and describe the approach I took in each attempt, what went wrong, and how I found the correct solution.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="First attempt:">First attempt:</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If I were to take images over a long exposure period of one second, I would have 30 images.

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>At the end of this month, co-op spin-off <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> will make its debut. Back in February, developer FromSoftware hosted a network test for the upcoming release, before later revealing some stats which suggested many players actually struggled to finish it.</p>
<p>According to figures shared in March, the final boss Nightreign testers came up against in the cycle - Nightlord Gladius, Beast of Night - was only defeated 58,615 times. To compare, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-players-were-really-struggling-to-complete-the-network-test">the mini bosses strewn across the world were defeated from between 99,000 times to 195,000 times</a>, depending on how often they appeared over the day cycle.</p>
<p>So, what has FromSoft learned from the playtest? Well, speaking with <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/07/elden-ring-nightreign-interview-reimagined-game-design-anchored-by-in-depth-combat/?sf277193252=1">PlayStation</a>, Nightreign's game director Junya Ishizaki said the team had "received a lot of helpful feedback regarding the difficulty", and as a result has made some adjustments to the final build.</p>
<p>These adjustments will "strike a balance that makes the game challenging as you progress, but still manageable", Ishizaki said. The director added Gladius "will also receive some updates", although he did not elaborate on what exactly these updates will include. These, Ishizaki said, will be something for players to look forward to on Nightreign's release.</p>
<p>Ishizaki added that some of those who took part in the network test "found it difficult to understand what elements were visible on the map, and said it was hard to identify next steps or how to use some of the character movesets". Therefore FromSoft has made some tweaks to the final version of the game, which will ensure this information is presented more clearly.</p>
<p>Nightreign's director additionally said that on the game's release, players will be able to determine a boss's weakness before heading on into the fray.</p>
<p>"So, if poison is effective against an upcoming boss, you may proactively search for and loot items that inflict poison more often in that run. Taking advantage of their susceptibility will give you an edge in the fights," Ishizaki explained. "We intentionally designed the game so that you’ll need to adapt and evolve your strategies along with the changes that happen in the game."</p>
<p>Nightreign will be released on 30th May across PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S and PC. You can check out the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/here-are-the-pc-requirements-for-elden-ring-nightreign">PC requirements for Elden Ring Nightreign here</a>.</p>
<p>Our Ed has already been hands-on with Elden Ring Nightreign. "Nightreign provides a delectable hit of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> in a repeatable microcosm," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-eight-hours-with-elden-ring-nightreign-im-convinced-multiplayer-souls-is-an-exhilarating-rush">Eurogamer's Nightreign preview</a>. </p>

"It's got the difficulty, the levelling, the boss battles, and the sense of discovery, but all at high speed for a new type of challenge, while its grim enemy selection is like a best-of Souls mixtape I'm itching to replay."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ea-has-no-changes-currently-planned-for-raising-the-price-of-its-games/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>While other major publishers across the video game industry are raising the prices of their games, EA currently says it has "<em>no changes</em>" to its pricing strategy.</p>
<p>During its investor call <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-bucks-industry-trend-and-says-it-has-no-plans-to-increase-video-game-prices">yesterday</a>, after <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-next-battlefield-game-will-be-revealed-this-summer-new-battlefield-and-skate-due-to-release-by-april-2026/">EA reported its fourth quarter earnings</a> and wrap-up report for its 2025 fiscal year, the question of game pricing was brought to EA's executive leadership. At least for now, there's no indication from chief executive officer Andrew Wilson and chief financial officer Stuart Canfield that EA plans to hike its game prices just yet.</p>
<p>"<em>In terms of pricing power, our business is very different than today than it was even just 10 years ago</em>," Wilson began. "<em>In a world where everything we did 10 years ago was about selling shiny discs in plastic boxes in retail shelves, while that's still a part of our business it's a significantly smaller part of our business, and we now have pricing representing everything from free-to-play all the way to Deluxe Editions and beyond.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>At the end of the day, whether we're doing something that costs a dollar, or we're doing something that costs $10, or we're doing something that costs $100, our objective is always delivering incredible quality and exponential value to our player base. And what we've discovered over the course of time is when we can marry quality and value together, our business is strong, resilient and continues to grow.</em>"</p>
<p>Canfield added, "<em>From a games perspective, we have reflected no changes in our current [pricing] strategy at this point</em>."</p>
<p>It's nice to hear from a big publisher like EA that it has no plans to raise prices at the moment, but that doesn't mean a price increase for its games won't happen. Right now, it's an easy win for EA to hold off on raising prices and raise them later when the rest of the industry has done so.</p>
<p>Everyone was worried that Rockstar would be the ones to smash the pricing ceiling with <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-gets-surprise-second-trailer-as-rockstar-shares-first-info-and-many-gorgeous-images/">Grand Theft Auto VI</a>, but it was actually Nintendo to break through first with the price of <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-is-worth-the-80-price-of-admission-says-nintendo/">Mario Kart World</a>. Microsoft has <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-xs-price-increase-europe/">now followed along</a> and will increase the cost of its games starting this holiday season, and even though PlayStation's next major release, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-will-be-even-better-than-tsushima-says-shuhei-yoshida/">Ghost of Yotei</a>, isn't getting a price increase, it wouldn't be a surprise to see their next first-party title cost an extra $10.</p>
<p>EA might not have any plans right now, but remember this in a year's time. You can bet those plans will have changed by then.</p>

When announcing layoffs in 2024, Bungie CEO Pete Parsons said that “we are working with PlayStation Studios leadership to spin out one of our incubation projects – an action game set in a brand-new science-fantasy universe – to form a new studio within PlayStation Studios to continue its promising development,” which appears to be Team LFG. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/646977/bungie-marathon-release-date-september-alpha-test-details">Bungie is currently working on a multiplayer shooter called <em>Marathon</em></a>.</p></div><div><p>Sony also released the hero shooter <em>Concord</em> in 2024, and the launch was so disastrous <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/3/24234909/sony-concord-ps5-shutdown-poor-sales-launch-pc">the game was taken offline</a> and, eventually, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282900/sony-shutting-down-concord-firewalk-studios">its developer Firewalk Studios was shuttered</a>.</p></div><p>It’s not clear how far into development Team LFG’s first release is, nor when it might be properly announced. The studio says that “we will make immersive multiplayer worlds propelled by action games that players can learn, play, and master for countless hours” and that its first game “draws inspiration from fighting games, platformers, MOBAs, life sims, and frog-type games.” The studio adds that “players will inhabit a lighthearted, comedic world set in brand-new, mythic, science-fantasy universe.”</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Cough! Splutter! Sneeze! Excuse me, it's mighty dusty in here all of a sudden. Exceedingly dirty alleged leaked images of both the Asus ROG Ally 2 and what could be Microsoft's rumoured "Project Kennan" gaming handheld have burst forth from the tissues of the internet in a shower of dead skin particles and grime.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/asus-rog-ally-2-and-rog-ally-2-xbox-edition-gaming-handhelds-leaked">Videocardz</a>, <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/id/hub/asus-rog-ally-2-diduga-segera-rilis-di-indonesia-dapat-sertifikat-sdppi-postel/">91mobiles</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-handheld-photos-leak-showing-off-asus-made-project-kennan">Eurogamer</a>, the images originate from the US Federal Communications Commission's official certification testing procedures. Which is why they look like they've been used as attic insulation, yes.</p>
<p>Two handhelds are shown in the images, each sporting prodigiously-sized grips. One has the Xbox logo just visible on a button by the left analog stick. That'll be the Xbox-branded one, then, though both are referred to in documentation as versions of the Rog Ally 2. As <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-hardware-report-project-keenan-next-gen-xbox-2027">rumoured by Windows Central</a> earlier this year, Microsoft appear to be collaborating with outside parties on their big break into on-the-go vidyagaming.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>FCC / Videocardz</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There are no final tech specs, but a quick zoom at each handheld's posterior suggests that the Xbox-branded one will have an AMD eight-core 36W Ryzen Z2 Extreme processor, while the white model comes with an AMD four-core 20W AMD Aerith Plus processor. Each has a seven inch 120Hz screen. You might want to compare and contrast all that with James' <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/asus-rog-ally-review-a-nifty-handheld-pc-with-the-best-and-worst-of-windows">review of the original Asus ROG Ally</a>, which he deemed "a viable alternative" to the Steam Deck that trades "some of the ease of use and battery life you get with a Deck" for "a nicer screen, more powerful internals, wider game compatibility, and faster storage".</p>
<p>Care of my <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blade-runner">Blade Runner</a>-grade forensic scanning equipment, I notice that one of the leaked images also reveals something of the FCC working environment. You can see a small plastic Xmas tree on a filing cabinet in a corner. From this I deduce that either 1) these images were taken around Xmas time, 2) the FCC are pretty loose about tidying up their offices after the holiday season, or 3) the FCC are also road-testing small plastic Xmas trees.</p>

<p>It's possible Microsoft will air their Xbox handheld properly at their June showcase during this year's Summer Games Fest. Perhaps they'll take the opportunity to comment on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bds-calls-for-boycott-of-microsoft-and-xbox-gaming-products-over-alleged-israeli-military-connections">recent BDS boycott of their business links with the Israeli military</a>, as well.</p>
<p>Some might find the dustiness of these prototype handhelds a turn-off, but personally, this is how I want all new computers to look - like potent, forgotten relics of a civilization that perished of disease aeons ago, after all the people in charge of basic sanitation got hooked on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a>. I would watch a lot more Youtube unboxing videos if the unboxing process were akin to carrying out an archaeological dig. Imagine somebody like Marques Brownlee working the soil with a toothbrush for seven hours in order to get at the latest iPhone. You can have that idea for free, Marques.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/07/ea-confirms-next-battlefield-reveal-will-come-this-summer-still-on-target-for-release-before-gta-6/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>EA’s latest financial report has confirmed their plans for the next <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlefield">Battlefield</a> game. Having already started <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/03/battlefield-labs-is-a-community-playtest-collab-for-the-next-battlefield/">closed public playtesting</a> earlier this year, the next Battlefield will be revealed this summer. Additionally, the game is still on target for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/05/the-next-battlefield-is-set-to-release-before-april-2026/">a release in fiscal year 26</a>, which ends at the start of April 2026, meaning that it will beat GTA 6 to market – a title that EA was doing their best to avoid.</p>
<p>Andrew Wilson, CEO of Electronic Arts, said, “As we look to the future, we’re confident in our ability to execute across a deep pipeline — beginning this summer with the highly anticipated reveal of Battlefield, a pivotal step in delivering on our next generation of blockbuster entertainment.”</p>


<p>In following statements during a Q&amp;A with investors, Wilson added “Relative to Battlefield, what we have said all along is we’ve been building towards a window that we thought made the most sense for Battlefield, but we wouldn’t launch into a window that we thought truncated the value that we’ve invested into the franchise, or the value that we think our players will derive from it once they jump in and start playing.</p>
<p>“I think now, without going too far, we believe that window is clearer than it was before and we feel very good about launching Battlefield in [financial year] 2026.”</p>
<p>He is, of course, referring to GTA 6 having vacated this fiscal year. Take-Two had repeatedly stated that GTA 6 was on target for a release before the end of 2025, but has now <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/02/gta-6-gets-a-release-date-but-its-been-delayed-to-2026/">pushed GTA 6’s launch back by around half a year with a 26th May 2026 release date</a>. EA have always stated that the next Battlefield is aiming for a FY26 release, giving them flexibility to avoid GTA 6 if it had launched this year. It’s likely that EA were targeting the end of 2025 to try and snatch the Christmas spending rush, but with leeway to fall back to the following year if it was advantageous, or they could have always had early 2026 in the crosshairs.</p>

<p>The next Battlefield is in development under the collective brand Battlefield Studios, which encapsulates Criterion, DICE, Ripple Effect and Motive Studios. With the launch of Battlefield Labs playtesting earlier this year, we got a glimpse of actual gameplay from the next Battlefield, featuring a map in the Middle East with modern combined forces as tanks and soldiers battle through the streets. There’s an emphasis on flashy map destruction and degradation, building up to a whole building facade being blown up with an RPG.</p>

We want to build our games with our communities, inviting players to be a part of our development process through early access playtests,” an anonymous statement from the team reads. </p><p>Made up of developers who worked on <em>Destiny</em>, <em>Halo</em>, <em>League of Legends</em>, <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Roblox</em>, and <em>Rec Room</em>, teamLFG’s first project is described as “a team-based action game that draws inspiration from fighting games, platformers, MOBAs, life sims, and frog-type games.” Hmmm. It goes on to call the world players will inhabit “lighthearted” and “comedic,” and the overall aesthetic “mythic” and “science-fantasy.” Sounds like it’s aiming to be the kind of vibrant mishmash you’d expect from, say, Blizzard. </p><p>The only thing that really sticks out is the “frog-type” descriptor.

Maybe teamLFG’s first game will wrap all of that into an MMO-like experience where just hanging out in the world (and spending money in it) is as much a part of the experience as completing objectives. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The company says that it will roll out an age-verification process starting May 20, and failure to do so by July 2026 could result in a player's account being suspended, notifications paused, and their friends list deleted. The process for this will be required during login or when a new account is created.</p><p><a href="https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/news/detail/155805" rel="nofollow ">HoYoverse says</a> it is now required by US law to verify the age of US-based players.

            <p>Sony has revealed a new developer that's joined PlayStation Studios, originating from Bungie and working on a new team-based action game.</p>
<p>The studio, teamLFG, comprises industry veterans from the Destiny and Halo studio, as well as developers from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, Roblox, and newcomers.</p>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-developer-bungie-lays-off-220-staff-roughly-17-percent-of-workforce">Bungie laid off 220 staff</a>, representing roughly 17 percent of its workforce. At the time, Bungie CEO Pete Parsons stated one of its early-development projects would be moved to PlayStation Studios to form a new studio.</p>

<p>"The 'LFG' in 'teamLFG' stands for 'Looking For Group'," explains a message from the studio on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/07/welcome-teamlfg-to-the-playstation-studios-family/?sf277193480=1">PlayStation Blog</a> (as opposed to "let's f**king go"). </p>
<p>"We are driven by a mission to create games where players can find friendship, community, and belonging. We want our players to feel excited when they log on to discover their teammates already hanging out online. We want our players to recognise familiar names and to make myths and memes out of each other. We want our players to love remembering that one time where they pulled off That Play that changed the whole story of the match. As we say on the team - dat's da good stuff."</p>
<p>The studio will make "immersive multiplayer worlds propelled by action games that players can learn, play, and master for countless hours," the message continues, adding player communities will be invited to early access playtests as part of the studio's development process.</p>
<p>"It's critical that we stay nimble enough to react to player feedback, not just in our lead-up to launch, but throughout live service as we continue to grow the game and community for years to come," the studio said.</p>
<p>"Our first game is a team-based action game that draws inspiration from fighting games, platformers, MOBAs, life sims, and frog-type games. Players will inhabit a lighthearted, comedic world set in brand-new, mythic, science-fantasy universe."</p>
<p>Presumably, this game is the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-cosy-moba-is-codenamed-gummy-bears-and-features-smash-bros-mechanics-to-target-younger-players">rumoured Gummy Bears that leaked earlier this year</a>.</p>
<p>PlayStation has certainly struggled with live-service games in the past couple of years.</p>
<p>Back in 2022, the company aimed to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plans-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-before-march-2026">launch over 10 new live service games</a> by March 2026, as part of a strategy from former Sony exec Jim Ryan.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">Concord was a high profile failure</a> for the company, and at the start of this year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">two live service projects were cancelled</a>, resulting in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-layoffs-at-playstation-following-live-service-cancellations">further layoffs</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-buying-bungie-for-usd3-6bn">Sony announced it would acquire Bungie</a> in February 2022 for $3.6bn, partly with the intention of it supporting the company's live-service ambitions.</p>
<p>It would appear teamLFG's new project will showcase the results of that acquisition, alongside Bungie's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-finally-shows-off-marathon-heres-everything-you-need-to-know">forthcoming multiplayer shooter Marathon</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
