            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It's no secret that Bungie's mammoth shooter, Destiny 2, the game that used to be one of the exemplary models for other publishers on how to build a live service game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-selling-worse-than-expected-sony-records-impairment-loss/">has been struggling</a>. Players know it, people who follow games but don't play Destiny 2 know it, and of course, Bungie knows it. However, in a recent interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-dont-want-to-be-a-dead-game-destiny-2s-directors-on-reassessing-the-shooters-future">IGN</a>, game director Tyson Green and core creative director Ben Wommack spoke about how they believe they can build a strong future for the game, starting with Destiny 2: Renegades.</p>



<p>Green was up front with what he believes happened following the conclusion of The Final Shape. While the expansion was, overall, a well-received ending to a decade-long saga, the drop-off in players that followed wasn't exactly part of the plan, and the release of Destiny 2's last expansion, Edge of Fate, didn't help bring players back.</p>



<p>"<em>The Final Shape brought things to a crescendo, where it's like a fantastic ending that tied off a lot of threads,</em>" said Green. "<em>People were pleased and satisfied with what they played, and then the big [downwards] spike in population [came after]. That happened because we ended the saga. So you get what you pay for, right?</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>That wasn't the plan from the business perspective. We still want to keep making Destiny; we still have many stories to tell in this universe. There are still lots of things to do, and we have to keep building the game. Unfortunately, it was not gracefully managed, but we had to try something.</em>"</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Destiny 2: Renegades | Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PqicEwg2qEc?start=144&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Continuing on about the Edge of Fate expansion, Green said, "<em>We looked at the problem we had [after The Final Shape], and we said, 'We think there's a route here,' which is leaning into more systems of pursuit, getting new tiers of gear, armor sets, and power progression, and things like challenge customization. These things that can allow a core audience of players to really say, like, 'I'm really gonna take this game and put it through its paces, and get good rewards for it.'"</em></p>



<p>"<em>It sounds great on paper, but it didn't work. I think we've been taught a bunch of hard lessons about what our players want, and there are really two kinds of live games: those that listen to the players and respond, and those that don't. And we don't want to be a dead live game, we want to keep building Destiny. So we're listening to our players, and what our players are telling us is that they don't want to chase a simple number that goes up, they want real rewards</em>."</p>



<p>According to Green and Wommack, the listening and adapting to what their players are asking for begins with Destiny 2's upcoming Star Wars-inspired expansion, Renegades, which is releasing on December 2, 2025.</p>



<p>The studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-showcases-destiny-2-renegades-expansion-ahead-of-launch-next-week/">showcased the expansion in more detail earlier this week</a> ahead of its upcoming launch, showing off new elements of the game, including the syndicates, new weapons like the Blasters, and the lightsaber-inspired Praxic Blades. According to Wommack, elements like the Praxic Blade are a sign of Bungie pushing outside its "<em>usual boundaries</em>" for Destiny 2, while Green affirms that Renegades is "<em>still fundamentally a Destiny expansion</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>When you're making something new, you often have a bunch of conventions and boundaries that you have to consider, especially for games that have</em> <em>been around for a long time like Destiny</em>," said Wommack. "<em>It's tempting to stick to those conventions as being the boundaries of the rules, but the truth is that you need to re-examine all of them every single time when trying to really create something special and make a splash. This is especially true when working with Lucasfilm.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>We looked at how we made the sandbox stuff we've done, we now have blaster weapons that will stay with us going forward, seeing how the Praxic Blade turned out, and we have the various new syndicates that turned out well. There are things that we definitely wouldn't have done, but we had to accept and push past those usual boundaries to do these things, and as long as it's still fun and people are responding to it, the feel is there,</em> <em>then it's the right decision</em>."</p>



<p>It's good to hear that directors like Green and Wommack feel confident in their thinking with how they are trying to chart Destiny 2's path forward, but how players respond to Renegades when it arrives in a few days will be a turning point for the franchise. Even if it's a massive success, there's still an argument to be made that Bungie would be better off moving on from Destiny 2, to try and move the series forward in a new way.</p>



<p>Perhaps that's why we're seeing rumors appear about <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-3-in-extremely-early-development-according-to-bungie-leakers/">Bungie working on Destiny 3</a>, because the studio is aware that, after over a decade of Destiny since its release in 2014, and nearly a decade of Destiny 2 being the face of the series, it's time to move on to something new. Renegades being a success along the way would definitely be a nice boost for the company, but <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-player-count-steam-record-low-ahead-of-star-wars-expansion-bungie/">considering how much the game has been struggling</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-studio-head-pete-parsons-leaves-23-years-justin-truman-take-over/">considering all the internal problems</a> Bungie has, <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-marathon-not-dead-closed-technical-test-sign-ups-open/">even with its non-Destiny titles</a>, a fresh start, or at least an attempt at one, feels inevitable.</p>



<p>At least it sounds like Bungie is open to trying for one.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon Pushes Anker’s 3-in-1 MagSafe Charger to a Record Low Amid a Wave of Apple Deals, Despite Being Newly Released]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/cut-down-on-cable-clutter-with-this-3-in-1-prime-magsafe-charger-for-apple-devices-2000648208</link>
            <guid>1367251</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Topping all your essentials up in one go shouldn’t be a hassle. If you’re done dealing with cable clutter and plugging different devices into different outlets across the room, it’s time for an upgrade.</p>
<p>Anker makes some of our favorite charging solutions, and this Black Friday is a great time to upgrade your setup with one for less. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6036/">Right now, Apple users can grab its 3-in-1 Prime MagSafe Charger for iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods for just $150, down from $230</a>. You’re saving an impressive 35% on a wireless charging solution that’s safe to use, plus much faster and efficient than other options in the same range. It’s also its lowest price we have seen on it since launch.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6036/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Smart, Plus Powerful</h2>
<p>The 25W ultra-fast charging makes it around 6 times faster than most similar options out there, while TEC cooling keeps heat-related slowdowns at bay. An iPhone 17 Pro can hit 50% in just 22 minutes, so it’s much quicker than a standard charger. Support for iPhone, AirPods, and Apple Watch means you can juice all three up without the usual wait and clutter. Just toss them on before dozing off, and wake up to everything ready to take on the day with you. It also makes it great for when you’re in a rush and don’t have the time to plug everything in separately. Best of all, you won’t forget any of them, since all will be sitting right there next to each other.</p>
<p>The phone charger is flexible, and you can place your iPhone both horizontally and vertically; however you like. Planning to watch something at it charges? Go for the horizontal mode and let it double as a stand. There’s a built-in 1.65-inch HD display on the charging station to keep you in the loop about power, temperature, and charging status. The screen is customizable, and even shares safety alerts if something feels off.</p>



<p>Three power modes deliver different power levels for different routines. Boost Mode offers high-power charging for quick top-ups, and the Ice Mode keeps the devices cool as you use them while they charge. Finally, the Sleep Mode disables cooling and dims the display for quiet, safe overnight charging. Switching between the modes is made easy with the dedicated app, which also lets you schedule day and night times to enter or exit the sleep mode automatically. You can use it to customize your screensaver and view charging details just as well.</p>
<p>ActiveShield 5.0 performs over 10 million temperature checks a day to prevent overheating and maintain the battery health of your devices. As for compatibility, the charger plays nicely with iPhone Series 12 through 17, almost all the old and new Apple Watch series, plus AirPods 2, 3, 4, Pro, Pro2, and Pro 3. Just note that it’s not compatible with iPhone 16e. The box comes with the charger itself, a 65W GaN foldable adapter, a 5 ft USB-C to USB-C cable (10,000-bend tested), a welcome guide, 24-month warranty for some extra peace of mind. That’s everything you need to get started with it right away.</p>
<p>If you’ve been on the lookout for a smarter, no-fuss charging solution for all your important gadgets, this 3-in-1 Anker Prime MagSafe charger does a great job at that. It provides the power they need, plus maintains your battery health while it’s at it. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6036/">This deal takes $80 off its $230 price, letting you grab it for just $150.</a> The offer applies to both white and black color options, so you can pick the one that suits your aesthetics the best.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Escape from Tarkov Review—The Ultimate Extraction Shooter]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-review-ultimate-extraction-shooter/</link>
            <guid>1367245</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Escape from Tarkov is one of the most divisive games of all time. It has suffered under the weight of controversy, been spoiled senselessly by swathes of cheaters, and, at times, proven to be an elating title that has spearheaded the growth of one of the most exciting genres in modern gaming.</p>



<p>Battlestate Games recently pushed Escape from Tarkov into a state of graduation, moving from a ten-year alpha and beta cycle into the very long-awaited 1.0 version that’s now occupying the market and dominating the genre once again.</p>



<p>What follows is my comprehensive Escape from Tarkov review, compiled after five years of playing this punishing extraction shooter and, along with hundreds of thousands of others, finally reaching version 1.0.</p>







<h2 id="h-escape-from-tarkov-is-a-rollercoaster">Escape from Tarkov is a Rollercoaster</h2>



<p>‘Rollercoaster’ was one of the first words that came to mind when I was thinking about how to sum up all that Escape from Tarkov is. It’s a tumultuous, emotional cacophony of a title that will leave you feeling ecstatic after a phenomenal raid, then will happily send you plummeting into a pit of despair after a brutal failure.</p>



<p>It’ll have you reaping the rewards of a solid streak of resolving quests and winning fights, then have you ruing the day you invested in the game and cursing all that Battlestate Games holds dear after being devastated by a cheater while on a banger of a run.</p>



<p>From tasks that take mere seconds to challenges that only 0.01% of players will ever achieve, Escape from Tarkov has one of the most diverse spectrums in gaming history, but regardless of which end you’re sitting on, one thing remains axiomatic: this is not a game for the faint of heart.</p>



<p>In the ten years that Escape from Tarkov has been in development, we’ve seen immense overhauls that have changed the face of the game, and crushing blows dealt by the community and the team behind the title that have left the extraction shooter in shambles. It probably has one of the most storied lifecycles <strong>ever</strong>, and that’s not an exaggeration.</p>



<p>Love it or hate it, Escape from Tarkov has <strong>aura</strong>.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Play as a PMC or a ‘Scav’ character; the result is often the same…</figcaption></figure>







<p>Without the success of Escape from Tarkov, the extraction shooter bubble, which continues to grow as you read this, wouldn’t be anywhere near the size that it is today. Escape from Tarkov’s monumental and generational run began around 2020, when streamers contributed to the mass popularization of the game.</p>



<p>All of a sudden, this intriguing, hyper-challenging, and borderline milsim game from a mysterious Russian developer started taking over social and streaming platforms, and everyone was switched on to something <strong>new and terrifying</strong>: a genre where a single bullet can mean the loss of absolutely everything.</p>



<p>Over the years, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-beaten-to-steam-arena-breakout-infinite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">many challenges have arisen</a> to face Battlestate Games and Escape from Tarkov, but while they’ve come and gone, the pioneering title has remained firmly at the top of the table. It’s only in recent months, with the arrival of games like ARC Raiders, that worthy competitors have surfaced.</p>



<p>In the last ten years, the face of Escape from Tarkov has drastically changed. New maps have been introduced, and old maps have been expanded. The game’s arsenal has swollen to epic proportions, and the quest list has grown in kind. More traders have been added, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-arena-tempus-campionum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiplayer arena spin-off</a> was released (and synced up), and the game’s core mechanics have been upgraded, altered, and adapted time and time again.</p>



<p>The complexity of Escape from Tarkov is reflected in that journey. This isn’t an arcade shooter where you have stacks of ammunition, can slide around the map, and will regenerate your health if you stay out of combat. This is something much more punishing, and that presents a barrier to casual gamers – but still, Escape from Tarkov has greatly succeeded in the face of that potential blocker.</p>







<h2 id="h-tarkov-is-challenging-but-incredibly-rewarding">Tarkov is Challenging, But Incredibly Rewarding</h2>



<p>Escape from Tarkov is <strong>supposed to be </strong>extremely difficult. Aside from the fact that Battlestate Games has pushed the envelope in terms of realism and survival elements, the game’s lore has characters left behind after an evacuation of a war zone, which results in a desperate fight just to stay alive and scrape by with whatever resources can be looted or bought.</p>



<p>To that end, players must suit up, load into a map, fight other players and AI enemies, complete quests, secure loot, and finally, extract from that map. If they fail to get out in time or are killed by any entity, they lose everything they took in and everything that they found during the raid. That’s the core gameplay loop, and it’s not for everyone (but what game is?)</p>



<p>Healing mechanics are intricate and require working knowledge of different solutions, from tourniquets and splints to bandages and painkillers. The game’s ballistics and weapon handling mechanics are so granular that using a sub-par type of ammunition in a particular magazine attached to a certain gun can mean the difference between a kill and armor eating up your shots.</p>



<p>In terms of deeper immersion, players can loot resources to build up a hideout that gives them various benefits, all while working through skill paths that have rewards the higher the player ascends through them. There’s a lot to soak up, and this is only scratching the surface, which I feel is fully indicative of what’s in store for new Escape from Tarkov players.</p>



<p>There are no maps with markers, no guiding lines to follow, and no icons above your teammates’ heads. You don’t have a UI telling you how much ammunition you have left, and you have a finite amount of space in your pockets and backpack, so inventory management is another metagame to conquer.</p>



<p>If you’re not put off yet by the compelling complexity of Escape from Tarkov, then read on – we’re only going deeper.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-look-the-feel-the-atmosphere">The Look, The Feel, The Atmosphere</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Escape from Tarkov’s boss characters only increase the struggle…</figcaption></figure>







<p>Escape from Tarkov is a good-looking game, provided you have a powerful enough PC to run it correctly. It has all the bells and whistles of graphical customization you’d expect, and it offers a fairly diverse array of maps that feature what you might refer to as ‘biomes’. For instance, there are two maps themed around the concept of heavy forests, while another is a sprawling city. There’s a map that’s a tight-knit factory environment, and another that’s a coastline with a huge industrial influence.</p>



<p>There are night raids, which are almost suffocating in how much they increase the game’s difficulty level, and day raids, both of which can be impacted by a rotation of weather effects <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-tarkov-update-btr-seasons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and a ‘season system’</a> that changes from winter to spring, to summer, and to fall.</p>



<p>Each of those seasons has unique attributes. In the winter, crunchy snow lines your boots and presents a horrific inability to camouflage yourself. In the fall, trees and bushes are stripped of their leaves, offering less cover, and in the spring, noisy rain deafens you.</p>



<p>These seasons are delivered in addition to regular updates, which, before the 1.0 release of Escape from Tarkov, were known as ‘wipes’. These global resets would, every six months or so, push players back to a clean slate, allowing everyone to rebuild over and over again. In lieu of that going forward, Battlestate Games has promised seasons to remain consistent, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-dlc-scav-life/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DLC-based expansions</a> will also be released.</p>



<p>But back to the atmosphere of Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>When it all works properly, the sound, dynamic weather, visuals, and effects are sublime. If you get trapped in a high-octane, energetic gunfight in Escape from Tarkov, you’ll come away with your heart pounding and your hands shaking. However, over the years, plenty of issues have surfaced with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-patch-overhauls-immersive-audio/">the game’s audio</a> and performance that have left players, more often than you’d like, with a sour taste in their mouths.</p>



<p>In Escape from Tarkov’s 1.0 update, Battlestate Games included hundreds of improvements, bug fixes, and overhauls to various elements of the game, like the UI and trader interactions, trying desperately to boost the game into a space where very little was wrong with it.</p>



<p>They mostly succeeded, but nothing is perfect, and that includes the most popular extraction shooter ever made.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-s-on-offer-in-escape-from-tarkov">What’s on Offer in Escape from Tarkov?</h2>



<p>Escape from Tarkov represents hundreds of hours of potential. It’s a lengthy game, and you never know which way any raid will end up going. As you die so much, you’ll likely spend longer than expected resolving a single quest, and that naturally stretches things out a bit.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-story-will-have-four-endings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">core storyline added with 1.0</a> is <strong>huge </strong>and sits nicely alongside side missions and daily and weekly objectives given to you by the game’s traders.</p>



<p>You can play with friends in Escape from Tarkov, or run solo, but it’s a game that’s always better with people by your side. It can become a horror game when playing solo, as the silence around you is suddenly shattered by a single shot that takes the top of your head off. As you explore Escape from Tarkov, you’ll come to appreciate that at least 100 hours are needed to fully comprehend the game’s mechanics, maps, and the core gameplay loop, and that’s not a joke.</p>



<p>It’s by no means a game that you can play if you don’t have much time on your hands. If you load into a raid on Streets of Tarkov, for instance, and you stay there for the duration, that one run will cost you up to an <strong>hour </strong>off your life, if you include loading and preparation times.</p>



<p>But that’s just another example of the meat on the bones of Escape from Tarkov. Sure, that meat can sometimes be a little rotten, and the AI might not always function correctly, or you might run into a cheater, but many feel that the game is still worth playing, as those delightful highs combat the crushing lows so nicely.</p>



<p>And at the end of the day, if you don’t want to experience Escape from Tarkov from a PvP perspective and fight other players, you can invest a little more and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-pve-player-numbers-nikita/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">obtain the PvE product</a>, which is <strong>the exact same game</strong>, but exclusively populated with AI enemies.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-escape-from-tarkov-worth-it">Is Escape from Tarkov Worth It?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Are you ready for the unparalleled atmosphere?</figcaption></figure>







<p>Escape from Tarkov is one of the most confusing games I’ve ever played. I’ve fallen in and out of love with it, it has given me intense anxiety (like, legitimate heart-racing anxiety), and it has introduced me to some great folks over the years. I’ve hated it, I’ve adored it with an immense passion, and I’ve gone so far as to get a piece of it inked on my skin for life.</p>



<p>I’ve also put €400 into Battlestate Games’ coffers because I’ve upgraded my ‘edition’ of the game so many times.</p>



<p>But for all the negativity and controversy (<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-unheard-edition-escape-from-tarkov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">read: The Unheard Edition</a>), Escape from Tarkov remains a phenomenal experience that can absolutely alter your vision of the games you know and love. Before Escape from Tarkov, I was a Call of Duty and Battlefield fan, but this extraction shooter loop filled me with a desire to seek out a greater challenge and understand the breadth of this game’s complexity.</p>



<p>If you have a PC (because Tarkov <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-console-version-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">isn’t on console <em>yet</em></a>), you have most likely <strong>considered </strong>playing Escape from Tarkov. Now that the 1.0 version is out and represents a full, finished product, <strong>and </strong>it’s on Steam, it’s officially the best time to start playing the game. Bear in mind that you’re letting yourself in for something extremely unwelcoming, and you should do just fine.</p>







<h2 id="h-verdict-5-5-masterpiece">Verdict = 5/5 (Masterpiece)</h2>



<p>I might be biased, as I have around 2,000 hours in Escape from Tarkov, but even with <strong>zero hours played</strong>, I could identify that this is the ultimate extraction shooter. In that space, it’s a household name, and it has stood above all others and weathered everything thrown at it. The graduation to 1.0 is nothing but a representation of the diehard dedication Battlestate Games has poured into this title over the last decade, and it’s a wonderful thing to behold as a long-time fan of the game.</p>



<p>Through thick and thin, Escape from Tarkov has prevailed. It’s an enormous, deep, and rich game that’s still evolving, it offers unparalleled emotional experiences, and it looks, sounds, and feels great while doing all that. It’s the most punishing game you’ll ever play, but if you put enough hours into understanding this gem of a title, you’ll come to appreciate that it is a generational masterpiece of the extraction shooter market.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 Is Going Even Lower Than Its Planned Black Friday Price to Compete With AirPods and Galaxy Buds]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-drop-to-its-lowest-price-yet-for-black-friday-2000647626</link>
            <guid>1367236</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>With Black Friday happening, retailers have push the go button in the backend of their websites to have all their deals go live right now, ahead of schedule. If you’re still hunting for the right gift this holiday season for a friend, family member, or loved one, right now seems to be the best time to do so. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6032/">Amazon happens to have Google’s latest noise-cancelling premium earbuds—the Pixel Buds Pro 2— on sale for its lowest price yet</a>. The in-ear headphones and charging case normally clock in at $229, but ahead of November’s massive sales days, the price has come down to just $169. That 26% discount ends up saving you a whole $60 for a limited time.</p>
<p>The Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 come in five different color option, three of which are lucky enough to be part of the ongoing early Black Friday sale. You can chose between hazel, peony, or porcelain. Wintergreen and moonstone are either out of stock or absent from the discount. The color you choose only affects the buds themselves, as all color options come with the same white case with black interior.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6032/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>These earbuds are being toted by Google as its most comfortable earbuds yet. They are small, light, and have a secure fit in any ear size or shape. You can use a twist-to-adjust stabilizer which locks your earbuds in place which is great for a high-intensity workout. Then twist the other way to loosen them a bit for all-day comfort.</p>
<p>What separates the Pro model from the standard Pixel Buds is support for noise cancellation. The Buds Pro 2 are able to silence unwanted sounds from your surroundings so you can focus in only hearing only what you want to hear, be it music, a podcast, or audiobook. Active noise cancellation is enhanced further with the help of Googles Silent Seal 2.0 which is able to cancel up to twice as much noise as the original Buds Pro.</p>



<h2>Conversation Detection</h2>
<p>Now what happened when you don’t want to eliminate those environmental sounds anymore? Like maybe you’ve been waiting in line for Starbucks—kicking it to “Radio” by Bershy on loop, which you discovered from the awesome soundtrack of <em>Dispatch</em>—and now you’re up next to order. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6032/">The Google Pixel Buds Pro 2</a> are equipped with Conversation Detection. This will automatically pause your music and switch your earbuds to transparency mode when you start talking. Transparency mode basically filters in outside sounds in through the in-ear speakers, and you can activate it just by speaking. That means you don’t have to take out you earbuds, nor do you even need to awkward hold or tap while trying to strike up a conversation.</p>

            <guid>1367227</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="6ee639dfecc91"><a title="Mario &amp; Luigi: Partners In Time" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6ee639dfecc91/mario-and-luigi-partners-in-time.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>For many years, it felt like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/mario_and_luigi_partners_in_time">Mario &amp; Luigi: Partners in Time</a> was the redheaded stepchild of the Mario &amp; Luigi series. People criticised it for its more linear structure, overly long boss battles (at least in the US version), having to purchase items to use Bros. Attacks, and slightly cumbersome gameplay, among other areas.</p>
<p>Being released between the two most critically acclaimed games in the series certainly didn't help. It even got skipped over for the remake treatment, unlike <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/mario_and_luigi_superstar_saga">Superstar Saga</a> (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/mario_and_luigi_superstar_saga_plus_bowsers_minions">+ Bowser's Minions</a>) and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/mario_and_luigi_bowsers_inside_story">Bowser's Inside Story</a> (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/mario_and_luigi_bowsers_inside_story_plus_bowser_jr_s_journey">+ Bowser Jr.'s Journey</a>). Even if it may not reach the lofty heights of those two, I’d argue Partners in Time is still a fine game in its own right—and even more so two decades later, in light of subsequent entries.</p>
<div><p>The game’s titular time travel shenanigans begin pretty much from the outset. Professor E. Gadd has invented a time machine, and Princess Peach wants to be the first to test it. In a twist that surprises virtually no one, upon the time machine’s return from the past, the Princess is nowhere to be seen. Now, time holes are popping up all over Peach’s castle, and it’s up to Mario and Luigi to race to the past and find her. But that’s not all. They’ll also need to recover the shattered pieces of the Cobalt Star, a Macguffin said to be able to repair the rift in spacetime.</p><p>

Oh yeah, and did I mention the Mushroom Kingdom of the past is also under invasion by the Shroobs, a race of monstrous, mushroom-like aliens? Even today, these guys rank among the most ruthless villains in Mario’s roster.</p></div>
<figure data-uuid="2cb9631eaad01"><a title="Mario &amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2cb9631eaad01/mario-and-luigi-superstar-saga.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>A great start, but PiT is up there with it — <em><span></span> Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>In addition to having no qualms with levelling entire cities, they revel in sucking out the life force of their victims, turning it into energy to power their flying saucers. Said victims get better—this is a Mario game, after all—but arriving in the past only to be greeted by lifeless Toads among the ruins of their ravaged town sets a sombre tone and cements the Shroobs as opponents Mario and Luigi do <em>not</em> want to take lightly. The game’s generally darker tone among <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-mario-rpgs-of-all-time">Mario RPGs</a> remains widely celebrated among fans.</p>
<p>Mario and Luigi have their hands full, but thankfully, they’re not alone on their quest. Their baby selves are caught up in the Shroob invasion as well, and they immediately show they’re more than capable heroes, even at such a young age. You also encounter younger versions of series staples like Princess Peach, Professor Gadd, Bowser, and even Toadsworth, who, for the first and thus far <em>only</em> time ever in a Mario game, is actually useful for something.</p>
<p>The time travel element allowed developers AlphaDream to utilise Mario lore in unique ways, unlike any other in franchise history. Of course, we’ve seen baby versions of the Mario crew before, but now we really get to see their characters shine. Baby Mario and Luigi, in particular, could easily have been <em>monumentally</em> annoying. It wouldn’t be without precedent, considering how ear-grating Baby Mario was in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_world_2_yoshis_island">Yoshi’s Island</a>.</p>
<p>Instead, they hold their own right alongside their adult counterparts, providing the occasional comic relief without drifting into the realm of burdensome. If you don’t get the warm fuzzies seeing Mario and Luigi coddle and play with them—their antics punctuated by delightfully squeaky sound bites by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/soapbox-charles-martinet-made-gamings-greatest-accident-a-real-character">Charles Martinet</a>—you might want to check and see if a Shroob has drained <em>your</em> life force.</p>

<p>The addition of the DS' 'X' and 'Y' buttons to the standard two-button Mario and Luigi formula was another calculated risk, but the gameplay is intuitive and easy to pick up, even for less nimble players like myself. Control Mario and Luigi with 'A' and 'B', and their younger counterparts with 'X' and 'Y'. Overworld traversal is a joy with a wide variety of incredibly creative moves, both new and returning. My personal favourite is the aptly-named Baby Cakes, in which Mario and Luigi roll up into a ball and flatten their baby selves like pancakes, allowing them to fit into tight spaces (no, it’s not baby abuse; they like it!).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I consider brevity to be one of Partners in Time’s greatest strengths [...] compared to later titles that are twice as long yet somehow contain no more plot.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's the game’s turn-based battles that really put this new four-button system to the test. Mario and Luigi are the main attackers and defenders, with the babies acting as backup. In a design choice unique to this game, your Bros. Attacks are consumable items.</p>
<p>I’ll readily admit this change does strip away a layer of strategy to battles, though I personally enjoy not having to stress about regularly replenishing my Bros. Points to restore my abilities. While Superstar Saga’s Bros. Attacks were all basically glorified jump and hammer combos, this game introduces the flashier moves the series is known for, such as Koopa Shells you ricochet off enemies, Fire Flowers that let you pelt enemies with fireballs, and Trampolines enabling potentially endless jump attacks.</p>
<p>As you unlock new attacks, they become increasingly fun and satisfying to pull off. Some, such as the Red Shell and Copy Flower, have no cap, meaning the attack will continue, increasing in speed, until you miss a button input. With fast enough reflexes, you can wipe out many of the game’s bosses in only a handful of turns.</p>

<p>This alleviates what I feel is one of the unwarranted criticisms: bosses having too much HP. Fan outcry was so prevalent that, in the European and Japanese versions of the game, boss HP was significantly reduced. As a US-based gamer who owns the original version, I can say that, aside from the final boss, not one of them took me more than several minutes to defeat, especially later when you gain access to moves that can easily rack up 400-plus damage per turn. I’ve spent more time dodging overly drawn-out enemy attacks in later games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/mario_and_luigi_dream_team">Dream Team</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_and_luigi_brothership">Brothership</a>, where it feels like the developers prioritised excessive spectacle over crafting well-balanced fights that respect the player’s time.</p>
<p>In fact, I consider brevity to be one of Partners in Time’s greatest strengths. A playthrough typically clocks in at a respectable 18 or so hours, compared to later titles that are twice as long yet somehow contain no more plot.</p>
<p>Partners in Time is about as streamlined a Mario and Luigi experience as you can get. The plot moves at a refreshingly brisk pace, telling the story it wants to tell without succumbing to the excessive bloat of later entries. It forgoes side quests and exploration in favour of linear, more self-contained hub worlds—a valid point of contention, but one I feel can be argued further enhances the game’s tightened focus on story and gameplay.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/mario-and-luigi-partners-in-time/">On Metacritic</a>, Partners in Time remains the third-highest-rated game in the Mario &amp; Luigi series, and on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-mario-rpgs-of-all-time">Nintendo Life's Mario RPG list</a>, too (without factoring in remakes), cementing its continued status as an overlooked gem. It may not have as rich a world as Superstar Saga or reach the epic highs of Bowser’s Inside Story, but looking at it two decades and several hit-and-miss Mario &amp; Luigi games later, I still rank Partners in Time up there with the series’ best.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/the-tightest-briskest-mario-and-luigi-game-turns-20-today-and-deserves-more-love]]></content:encoded>

		<p>It feels like I’ve spent most of this week playing the game ‘avoiding the Christmas crowds’, but I did get to enjoy my own version of Thanksgiving where I just watched NFL for six hours, and didn’t have to think about turkey for another month. In terms of gaming, I’ve been playing a truckload of Octopath Traveler 0, as well as some more <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/21/tomb-raider-definitive-edition-nintendo-switch-2-review/">Tomb Raider Definitive Edition</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/19/kirby-air-riders-review/">Kirby Air Riders</a>. Besides that, I’ve been checking out Assetto Corsa Rally, and messing with GeForce Now across a bunch of platforms to see how it performs.</p>

<p>First up this week, <strong>Gamoc</strong> has played <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/27/sweet-surrender-review/">Sweet Surrender</a> for review, as well as Halls of Torment and Red Dead Redemption 2.</p>
<p>Bizarrely keen to try and take on the Marvel Rivals PlayStation Cup challenge next week, <strong>Ade</strong> has been practicing by polished off his review of the retro-styled scrolling beat ’em up Marvel Cosmic Invasion. The embargo for that is on Monday, so check out his review then!</p>


<p>Meanwhile, <strong>Jim</strong> has had a much quieter week. After flitting between a glut of new multiplayer games, he’s back to Ghost of Yotei as he focuses on finishing the main quest.</p>
<p><strong>Aran</strong> has been playing Duskpunk for review, which is a mix of Citizen Sleeper meets the rough life in a town full of opportunities and misfortune. Sounds great to me!</p>

<p><strong>Steve</strong> has been playing the natural pairing of Terrifier: the Artcade game and Spongebob Square pants: Titans of the Tide. This weird gaming concoction has had mixed results, with Steve telling us, “The first was unfortunately pretty rubbish but the second is a solid, albeit short, 3D platformer” He continued, “With those wrapped, I’ve moved onto an indie space horror that’s been years in the making and is wonderfully atmospheric.”</p>
<p>And finally,&nbsp;<strong>Tef</strong> has been curling himself up into a ball for an upcoming review, while also dabbling with some upcoming Warhammer 40,000: Darktide DLC, and dipping into some cheap Black Friday sale pick ups, like Loop Hero.</p>
<p>And what about you? Have you played anything this week? Why not tell us about it!</p>

			<p>The most significant announcement made at Tokyo Game Show 2025 was arguably <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-is-coming-to-pc-xbox-consoles-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 6</a>. The massively successful open world racing franchise is returning next year to PC and Xbox consoles, featuring the long-coveted Japan setting.</p>



<p>When is it launching, though? Looking back at previous franchise entries, every Forza Horizon game has been released so far between September and November. However, <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1994108555780297089#m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to insider Nate the Hate</a>, that trend might change with Forza Horizon 6, because UK developer Playground Games is targeting a launch at some point in the first half of 2026.</p>



<p>The Fall launch window has worked wonders so far for the franchise. The most recent game, Forza Horizon 5, <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-5-40-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reached over 40 million players as of July 2024</a> and has since grown further, thanks to its launch on the PlayStation 5 console, where the title even <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-5-best-selling-game-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">outsold Sony's own first-party games for a while</a>.</p>



<p>However, 2026 is definitely a peculiar situation given that the release of the proverbial elephant in the room, Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto VI, has been postponed from May 26, 2026 to November 19, 2026. Quite literally every triple-A game developer (and most indie ones, too) will want to distance their games as much as possible from that all-consuming void. Sure, Forza Horizon 6 belongs to a different enough genre, but why risk it? Of course, that all hinges on the game being ready to launch by then. </p>



<p>If the game is released in the first half of 2026, it will have been four and a half years since FH5, by far the longest gap between releases in the franchise. Playground Games may actually launch two games next year, given that their other big gamble, Fable, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-delayed-2026-stunning-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was delayed from 2025 to a generic 2026 window</a>. Fable might be released toward the end of next year (provided there isn't <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-rumored-missing-2026-launch-window/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another delay into 2027</a>).</p>



<p>The developers have yet to reveal many details about Forza Horizon 6, although we already know the following:</p>



<ul>
<li>The map is designed around three key regions: the dense city of Tokyo, coastal areas, and mountain tōge roads. Playground Games is focusing less on raw size and more on density and verticality, especially in Tokyo, utilizing layered, multi-level roads inspired by <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-5-hot-wheels-expansion-launches-on-july-19/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 5's Hot Wheels expansion</a>.​</li>



<li>Map design emphasizes tight city streets, multi-story highways, mountain passes, and rural rice-field backroads, providing a diverse range of driving experiences within one map that include typically Japanese car races, such as urban street racing, mountain drifting, and high‑speed coastal runs.</li>



<li>The campaign progression harkens back to Forza Horizon 1's structure, where players start with slower cars and earn their way up, with faster tiers unlocking as they progress rather than being showered on them from the get-go.</li>



<li>The car roster in Forza Horizon 6 will be heavily expanded with Japanese flavor, including kei cars and kei vans, which appear both as drivable garage vehicles and AI traffic.</li>



<li>The open world will '<a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-blow-away-fans-open-world-japan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blow fans away</a>', between the inherent beauty of Japanese environments and the tech improvements made to the engine.</li>
</ul>



<p>While the game has only been announced for PC and Xbox Series S and X, a PlayStation 5 version is inevitable given the success encountered by its predecessor. The only question is whether it will be released later in 2026 or in 2027, but we'll keep you up to date on those rumors and news as soon as they become available.</p>

            <p>Pre-release builds of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a> recently unearthed at a shop in Utah contain rare files which could be "incredibly useful" to expanding what modders can do with the RPG. Well, at least they doe in the estimation of the folks who claim to have found them, a group of preservationists whose current online presence only looks to have popped up last month.</p>

<p>According to the group, who go by Games' Past, they picked up these builds by buying some dev-kits which had been sitting around on a shelf for a year. They cite the betas contained in the kits as being from July 21st and August 22nd, 2010, with some bits of a build from April that year also having been found. For reference, New Vegas came out in October 2010.</p>
<p>The video mainly focuses on the July build, showing off a bunch of cut content it includes. Some of this stuff, like Mr House's robo-girlfriend Marilyn, has previously been <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/72209">unearthed and restored</a> by modders, but other bits don't immediately come up if you search 'cut content' on New Vegas' Nexus Mods page.</p><p>There's an encounter with a wasteland adventurer who spoils the fun right after you leave Goodsprings by telling you in no uncertain terms that heading north through Quarry Junction's a bad idea, a less annoyingly-voiced Oliver Swanick, and an early version of Mr House's screen which makes him look a lot more like a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a> character. The video also flips between versions of the game, showing off some minor differences in how certain locations look.</p>
<p>Cool, but things get more interesting later in the video, when its narrator Ventura claims the builds could play a key role in helping expand what's possible with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-new-vegas-latest-modathon-has-flying-robots-evolving-gear-and-cheeky-waving-in-its-pockets">current day New Vegas modding</a>. "All three builds came with intact PDBs (program database files), which have never been leaked before for any version of Fallout New Vegas, or for any game before <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> for that matter," they asserted. "For those who aren't aware, the PDB file is an extremely important file to modders, as it is a file generated while the game is being built that contains much additional debugging information, which is incredibly useful for reverse engineering the game and understanding not only how the game functions, but the engine behind it as well."</p>
<p>We'll have to see if that comes to pass, but unless they've previously gone by a different name, this looks to be the first act of publicly visible preservation Games' Past have done. Their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GamesPastOrg">YouTube channel</a> only hosts this one video, while both it and their <a href="https://x.com/GamesPastOrg">Twitter account</a> were only created in October 2025. That doesn't necessarily mean anything, but it does make me a bit more hesitant to immediately trust their modding assertions than I would be if they were an established organisation with a visibly substantial track record for this kind of thing.</p>
<p>Perhaps, like the wastelander who's keen not to see you become Deathclaw food, time'll prove I'm just being a bit too cautious.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-christmas-tree-hit-80k-sales-this-black-friday-festive-set-now-goes-for-peanuts-2000648384</link>
            <guid>1367212</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Christmas approaches rapidly and LEGO rushes to clear remaining holiday inventory before the season passes and these seasonal sets lose immediate relevance. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5554/">Christmas tree set just dropped to $25 from $44, hitting a record-low 44% discount for Black Friday</a> on Amazon. If you want a compact Christmas tree that survives annual storage cycles without shedding needles, wilting branches or requiring disposal after the holidays, this is a great investment.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5554/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>2-in-1 Design</h2>
<p>The set lets you build either <strong>one big Christmas tree display or two smaller mini trees</strong>, depending on how much space you have and what you like to decorate with. The <strong>bigger version is more than 11 inches tall</strong> and makes it a great choice for mantel displays, dining table centerpieces, or office desk decorations that really stand out. The dual mini tree option makes one 9-inch tree and one 6-inch tree. This lets you display them together with other decorations or spread holiday cheer throughout several rooms.</p>



<p>Each type of tree has <strong>intricate decorations, candles, and yellow star toppers</strong> that give LEGO’s unique blocky style a classic Christmas tree look. The ornaments use colored round pieces that look like glass baubles, and the candles use special pieces to make shapes that are easy to recognize, even though LEGO’s shapes are limited. <strong>The yellow star on top of each tree</strong> is made in the same five-pointed way that every Christmas tree needs, which gives it a classic look.</p>
<p>Building things is a fun activity that can be done alone or with family during the holidays when relatives want to do more than just eat and talk, and kids 12 and older can build things on their own using clear, illustrated instructions. The moderate number of pieces and easy-to-follow assembly instructions <strong>make it possible to finish in 1 to 2 hours</strong>.</p>



<p>The small size works in places where full-size trees don’t work like apartments, dorm rooms, office cubicles, or homes with aggressive pets and curious toddlers, where regular trees can be dangerous. Put them on desks without taking up too much space, on mantels next to other decorations without crowding, or on dining tables as centerpieces that spark conversation.</p>
<p>The <strong>gift potential is broad because it appeals to a wide range of people</strong>. Connecting kids, teens and adults who love LEGO and like to build complicated things that look like holiday decorations. Kids get fun building projects that last, teens like Instagram-worthy decor to make their dorm rooms feel more like home, and adults know that quality home accents are worth showing off all year long, not just during the holidays.</p>
<p>The aggressive 44% Black Friday discount from $44 to $25 makes LEGO’s Christmas tree set cost less than many holiday decorations that can only be used once and then thrown away. If you want Christmas decorations that will last for decades and provide fun and conversation, this is the deal for you.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dji-osmo-pocket-3-creator-combo-2000648172</link>
            <guid>1367209</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Vlogging cameras, especially those offering incredible stability and quality video, both day and night, usually sit well over $800. DJI makes some of our favorite vlogging and action cameras out there, and all thanks to Black Friday, picking up one today doesn’t cost an arm and a leg.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6033/">We just spotted the DJI Osmo Pocket 3 creator combo going for $669 on Amazon right now.</a> It typically sits around $979, so you can save more than $300 on it if you act right now. The deal is available to all shoppers, whether you’ve got the Prime subscription or not.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6033/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Stable, High-Quality Footage</h2>
<p>It’s a tiny, travel-friendly vlogging that fits in your palm and slips into your pocket for easy portability. Superior stability comes from Pocket 3’s advanced 3-axis mechanical stabilization, while ActiveTrack 6.0 keeps you in focus at all times. Trying out a new dance move or chasing a furry friend around, you can bid shaky, headache-inducing footage goodbye. The camera even locks onto your subject, which can come in handy when filming some action-packed sequences.</p>
<p>The built-in 2-inch full-color OLED rotatable touchscreen moves both horizontally and vertically to give you the perfect shots. When it comes to picture quality, the camera records in 4K resolution at an impressive 120fps. There’s a 1-inch CMOS sensor to capture clear highlight-shadow details, meaning you will be able to show the world what you’ve been up to even after the shadows fall. It’s smart enough to fine-tune exposure for different skin tones on its own, giving you a glow like never before. Pair this with background bokeh that makes the subject stand out, and you’ll have stunning, professional videos ready to be uploaded on YouTube right away. Speaking of YouTube, you can also use the camera to live stream on different platforms, and even use it for online meetings as a webcam. Basically, it takes care of all your video needs, both personal and professional, like a pro.</p>



<p>Sound quality is another strong selling point. Pocket 3 actively reduces background noise to capture what you’re saying clearly, even in noisy, chaotic settings. The sound is pretty solid on its own, but you can always pair the camera with a compatible DJI microphone for a more premium experience.</p>
<p>Battery life is impeccable. A single charge lets you film in 1090p/24fps for over 2.5 hours; perfect for longer journeys where you want to take your online family along. Recharging won’t take long either, as Pocket 3 hits 80% in just 16 minutes. Best of all, tweaking settings and editing the content won’t be a hassle, thanks to the dedicated smartphone app. The platform lets you play around with filters, plus convert 3-second videos into photos on iOS devices.</p>
<p>Included in the box are the Osmo Pocket 3 starting set, the DJI Mic 2 Transmitter, battery handle, Osmo mini Tripod, and more. The battery charger, however, is sold separately. All things considered, if you’ve been on the lookout for a portable camera that makes it easy to record your adventures and share your everyday life with the world, the Pocket 3 Creator Combo is an excellent option to consider.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6033/"> On a regular day, it would run you around $979, but this rare Black Friday deal drops the price to just $669</a>. We know it’s still a bit of an investment, but one that’s definitely going to pay for itself in the long run. Just be sure to get your orders in quick, as discounts this massive don’t stick around for long.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon Offloads All Flagship Phones This Black Friday, Including OnePlus 13 Now at New Record Low]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-offloads-all-flagship-phones-this-black-friday-including-oneplus-13-now-at-new-record-low-2000648375</link>
            <guid>1367182</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Black Friday’s main day arrives with Amazon delivering massive discounts across every product category to maximize shopper satisfaction. iPhone 17 models are still absent from Amazon’s catalog but flagship Android devices receive substantial markdowns <strong>including the Galaxy S25 Ultra, Google Pixel 10, and OnePlus 13</strong>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6045/">OnePlus 13 costs $799 in its 512GB configuration during Black Friday on Amazon, down from $999</a> and hits a record-low price that explains its bestseller status. The 20% discount makes flagship specs (including Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, 6,000mAh battery, 120Hz QHD+ display and Hasselblad camera system) accessible at pricing that approached mid-tier phones.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6045/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Snapdragon 8 Elite Performance That Rules</h2>
<p>The Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite processor is the <strong>best Android mobile silicon out there</strong>. It has maximum clock speeds of 4.32GHz and is made using cutting-edge 3nm technology which gives it desktop-level performance, and it can handle demanding games at their highest settings, professional photo and video editing, and extreme multitasking across dozens of apps without the slowdowns that happen with less powerful processors.</p>



<p>The <strong>6.82-inch ProXDR display has a QHD+ resolution of 3168 x 1440 pixels</strong> and an <strong>adaptive refresh rate of 120Hz</strong> that smoothly switches between 1Hz for static content and 120Hz for scrolling or gaming. The LTPO technology makes this variable refresh possible while also making the battery last longer by automatically adjusting based on the type of content, and the ProXDR name means that the screen is brighter with a peak brightness of up to 4,500 nits for HDR content.</p>
<p>Dolby Vision support makes video from Netflix, YouTube, and Disney+ look amazing by giving it a lot of contrast. The 10-bit color depth shows over 1 billion colors, so there are no banding issues with smooth gradients, and the display is just as good for work as it is for play with clear text and detailed spreadsheets, bright colors, and deep blacks.</p>
<p>The huge <strong>6,000mAh battery is one of the biggest in flagship phones and really lasts for two days of normal use</strong>, not just the optimistic marketing claims that say you need to use airplane mode and not much else. Heavy users who stream video, play games and use apps all the time can go full days without worrying about their batteries dying. Moderate users can go two evenings before needing to charge their phones. The <strong>80W SuperVOOC wired charging fully charges the battery in about 35 minutes</strong>&nbsp;so you don’t have to wait until the next day to charge it. Instead, you can charge it during your lunch break or morning routine. The 50W AirVOOC wireless charging is as fast as many wired charging options and lets you charge your phone at your desk or nightstand without having to deal with cords in the dark.</p>



<p>The<strong> fifth-generation Hasselblad camera system has three cameras with 50MP sensors on the main, ultra-wide, and telephoto lenses,</strong> and gives you a lot of options for shooting. The main sensor captures incredible detail thanks to its large 1/1.4-inch size, which lets in more light than smaller sensors in other phones. This makes it work better in low light and gives it a shallower depth of field.</p>
<p>The ultra-wide lens handles wide-open spaces with little edge distortion, and the telephoto lens lets you zoom in on things that are far away without losing quality, which is a problem with phones that only crop. <strong>Hasselblad’s color science makes pictures that look real</strong> with accurate skin tones and balanced saturation, instead of the over-processed look that phones that try to look good on social media have.</p>
<p>OnePlus’s<strong> custom interface for Android 15 with OxygenOS</strong> combines the clean look of stock Android with useful features like gesture navigation, gaming mode, and a wide range of theme options. The interface stays fast and responsive because it doesn’t have much bloatware and manages resources well, which keeps it from slowing down like heavily skinned Android versions do. OnePlus promises to give the phone four years of major Android updates and five years of security patches.</p>
<p>The 512GB model is on sale for a record-low price of $799 on Black Friday, down from the usual price of $999. This makes OnePlus’s flagship specs competitive with mid-range phones that cost about the same but have much better performance, display quality, battery life, and camera capabilities.</p>

            <p>
These days, developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a> is perhaps best known for its wonderful work on last year's stupendous <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> remake, but the studio's horror oeuvre goes much farther back. And it's bringing its first big hit - and its ship-bound sequel - to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> very soon. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/layers-of-fear">Layers of Fear</a>: The Final Masterpiece Edition comes to Nintendo's platform on 19th December.
</p>
<p>
Announced back in October, Layers of Fear: The Final Masterpiece Edition is a version of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/layers-of-fear-remake-launching-15th-june-on-pc-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs">Bloober's 2023 Layers of Fear remake</a>, with a few added extras thrown in. The remake, if you're unfamiliar, was a bit of an unusual proposition, taking both Layers of Fear games (plus new story bits and old DLC) and weaving them together into a single, interlinking narrative.

<p>
That means you got Layers of Fear 1 and its surreal first-person horror trip through the ever-shifting mansion of a tortured painter; its Inheritance DLC and a brand-new chapter featuring the painter's wife; its 2018 sequel - inspired by the golden age of Hollywood - which followed a brand-new protagonist on an avant-garde journey through the innards of an ocean liner and their troubled past, plus a new framing device focusing on a lighthouse-bound character known as The Writer, tying the whole thing together. All with enhanced visuals and new gameplay elements, including a lantern to ward off shadowy terrors.
</p><p>
Switch 2's The Final Masterpiece Edition includes all the above, plus the remake's Final Prologue chapter which originally released as post-launch DLC. It also promises HDR, ray tracing, and dynamic lighting, alongside support for touchscreen and motion controls. It's a whole lot of Layers of Fear, in other words - which is fine by me. The series might be a little rough around the edges compared to Bloober's more recent stuff, but I'm a sucker for any game that goes all-in on the sheer hallucinatory spectacle - and Layers of Fear's ever-shifting spaces make for a wonderfully disorientating, gleefully surreal time.
</p>
<p>
Layers of Fear: The Final Masterpiece Edition <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/exclusive-bloober-team-is-bringing-layers-of-fear-to-switch-2-next-month">comes to Switch 2</a> via Nintendo's eShop on 19th December, where it'll cost $39.99. Its arrival follows the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bloober-team-has-plans-for-more-horror-games-on-switch-2-could-silent-hill-2-be-next">launch of Bloober's sci-fi horror Cronos: The New Dawn on the platform</a>, and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horror-dev-bloober-has-a-switch-2-exclusive-in-the-works-and-a-new-version-of-layers-of-fear-for-nintendos-console-this-year">studio has also confirmed an unnamed Switch 2 exclusive is on the way</a>.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/meta-quietly-offloads-ray-ban-gen-1-via-amazon-smart-wayfarer-now-goes-for-what-regular-sunglasses-cost-2000648328</link>
            <guid>1367170</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Meta launched a second generation of Ray-Ban smart glasses with incremental improvements but the original model remains compelling through proven functionality and dramatically lower pricing. The <strong>Gen 1 Ray-Ban Meta featuring 12MP camera, open-ear speakers, and AI assistant integration</strong> delivers the core smart glasses experience without the premium that newest hardware commands.</p>
<p>The price gap tells the story clearly: Gen 2 models cost $410 while these <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6031/">Gen 1 Wayfarers hit $262 during Black Friday on Amazon (down from $329) which is roughly 40% savings for hardware</a> that differs minimally in daily use. <strong>All coloris and frame styles</strong> receive identical discounting and the<strong> #1 bestseller status in tech glasses</strong> validates that buyers love it.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6031/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>12MP Camera That Shows Different Angles</h2>
<p>With the built-in 12MP camera, <strong>you can take pictures and videos hands-free from your exact point of view</strong>: This makes content that smartphones can’t make without awkward arm extensions or obvious filming. Parents keep track of their kids’ soccer games, recitals, and everyday moments by looking them in the eye and being present instead of watching through phone screens. Perspective shots that show what you really saw instead of what cameras picked up from hand-held positions that were slightly off from your line of sight make travel photography more real.</p>



<p><strong>Video recording can last up to 60 seconds per clip in 1080p resolution</strong>, and this is long enough to capture important moments without using too much storage space or battery life that would come with unlimited recording. Birthday cake presentations, scenic overlooks, and quick tutorials all fit easily into the 60-second window. This limit encourages people to film on purpose instead of filming for hours and hours and hours of footage that needs to be edited. The Meta View app automatically syncs the captured content to your phone, keeping everything organized without the need for manual file management or card readers.</p>
<p><strong>Open-ear speakers send sound</strong> in a way that only you can hear at normal volumes: This lets you listen privately without the isolation or discomfort that comes with wearing earbuds for a long time. You can still hear podcast episodes, directions, phone calls, and music while being aware of conversations, traffic, and other sounds that are important for safety. <strong>This technology is great for walking, biking, or any situation where complete audio isolation could be dangerous</strong> or lead to bad behavior.</p>



<p>Meta’s software lets <strong>you use voice commands to control photos, calls, messages, and information queries</strong> without having to touch your phone. You can ask the glasses to take a picture, make a call, send a message, or answer factual questions by speaking naturally, which is easier than trying to use your phone. The hands-free feature is useful when cooking, working out, or doing anything else where it’s hard or impossible to reach your phone.</p>
<p><strong>Ray-Ban’s classic look is kept with the iconic Wayfarer style</strong> which is better than the obvious tech-forward designs that scream “smart glasses” and cause problems in social situations. The matte black frames and polarized gradient graphite lenses make these look like high-end sunglasses first and wearable technology second. This means they can be worn in both professional and social settings where tech that stands out is not appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>The battery lasts through full days of moderate use</strong> which includes taking a few photos, making a few videos, streaming music, and making calls without having to charge it in the middle of the day. The charging case that comes with it lets you charge it more than once on trips that last more than one day when there aren’t many wall outlets available.</p>
<p>There is a $148 difference between the Gen 1 models, which cost $262, and the Gen 2 models, which cost $410, and most users won’t even notice the improvements in their normal use. This record-low price makes smart glasses available without the usual trade-offs or extra costs for early adopters.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed: Shadows</a> won't be receiving a second expansion to follow Claws of Awaji, unlike previous games in the series. Instead, Ubisoft is working on "chunkier updates", similar in size to the Attack on Titan crossover released earlier this week.</p>
<p>Since the launch of 2017's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-origins">Assassin's Creed Origins</a>, releasing at least two expansions has become the norm for the series. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-mirage">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a> was even originally planned as a further expansion to Valhalla, before becoming a standalone game.</p>
<p>Yet that won't be the case with Shadows, released earlier this year. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-dlc-release-date-announced-new-game-plus-coming-next-week">Claws of Awaji was released back in September</a>, but that will be the only expansion for the game.</p>

<p>"As of now, at this moment for Year Two, there is no expansion on the size of [Claws of Awaji] that is planned, currently," said associate game director Simon Lemay-Comtois in an interview with YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/5Iijrbz8XBc">JorRaptor</a>. "We're still working on content for post-launch and supporting it, but it's not a full-on DLC the way a season pass would have had in previous years."</p>
<p>Lemay-Comtois did admit the situation could change, but for now Ubisoft's plan is to keep updates "small and reactive and see how the community feels about it".</p>
<p>He continued: "We're trying to re-adjust for Year Two a little bit. There's learning from Year One that we can apply to Year Two. Any content we want to do in Year Two is probably going to be more sparse, so not a drip-feed like you said but chunkier updates that shake things up a little more. I'm not announcing anything at this point but the strategy for Year One was to be quick and reactive, so it means smaller drops often. For Year Two we don't need to put fires out or anything, so it's more about what good, chunky little piece of meat... we can drop and have people come back to it and enjoy it."</p>
<p>Since its release, Shadows has already received a number of updates with fan-requested features, addressing the "fires" Lemay-Comtois mentioned. Now, the team is free to add more sizable updates, just not at the size of a full expansion.</p>
<p>Instead, those updates will be "something like yesterday's update plus, something at minimum this size".</p>
<p>That would be the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-lands-unexpected-crossover-with-anime-attack-on-titan-but-its-only-available-for-one-month">Attack on Titan crossover added earlier this week</a>, though it's only available for a limited time. Still, the reaction online to this addition hasn't been overly positive, with <a href="https://x.com/NikTek/status/1994083060103696842?s=20">posts on social media</a> noting poor quest design and animations.</p>
<p>The game will soon arrive on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/want-to-know-how-assassins-creed-shadows-works-on-switch-2-ubisoft-details-console-specific-features-and-more">Ubisoft yesterday detailing its features</a>.</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Mirage, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-mirage-to-get-surprise-free-story-dlc-later-this-year">received a surprise free story DLC recently</a>, reportedly backed by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund.</p>

            <title><![CDATA["A Very Polished Experience" - Digital Foundry Checks Out Kirby Air Riders]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/a-very-polished-experience-digital-foundry-checks-out-kirby-air-riders</link>
            <guid>1367155</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> has been out for a little over a week now, and our good friends over at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAp4jrKkp9w">Digital Foundry</a> have been busy diving into the nitty-gritty to deliver a technical analysis of the pink puffball's latest adventure.</p>
<p>Right from the jump, DF states that Air Riders "nails" the fundamentals, with super fun racing, <strong>Smash Bros.</strong> vibes, and super detailed new tracks.</p>
<p>From a technical perspective, the lighting is the game's first win, utilising Nvidia's RTXGI to light dynamic objects and keep the characters looking super smooth. Sure, this pushes ray-traced lighting to the side in favour of more simplistic light maps, but the entire performance benefits as a consequence. The finer details might not be the finest you've ever seen if you stop and look at them in isolation, but, as Digital Foundry repeatedly points out, Air Riders isn't a game where you'll be doing a lot of stopping.</p>
<p>Engine-wise, the game runs in a new 'SOL-AVES' engine. While DF notes that we'll likely see far more impressive uses of it in the future, the engine produces something visually unique with a strong performance — not a bad start, then!</p>
<p>Onto resolution, and it seems that Air Riders is <em>mostly</em> running at 1080p in docked mode, with some shots occasionally going north of that — particularly in Top Ride mode, where you may be looking at 1440p. In handheld, DF found that things often sat at 900p, but they registered anything from 720p-1080p.</p>
<p>HDR implementation, on the flip side, is "exceptionally bad", with only the machines' particle effects seeming to make the most of the increased brightness. Everything else appears "washed out and dim" when using HDR, resulting in something that ends up looking "unnatural and borderline broken". <em>Yikes</em>.</p>
<p>Fortunately, performance fares much better. While there is no 120Hz option, the game delivers a "pretty much stable" 60fps, only occasionally dropping the odd frame (somewhat more frequently in City Trial mode). Three and four-player split screen aims for 60, but often ends up slightly lower, with City Trial, again, being the worst-hit mode at between 40-50fps — so, very admirable, but not quite there.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">our review</a>, we called Kirby Air Riders "a chaotic and frenzied racer, there's no doubt, but it's got depth for those who wish to learn and plenty of competition to be had both online and at harder difficulties for diehards". You'll find our full thoughts, as well as those from Digital Foundry's shiny new site, by following the links below.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/airpods-4-2000647084</link>
            <guid>1367149</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The biggest shopping event of the year is almost here, and you know what that means; saving big on items that rarely go on sale. It’s especially a great time to treat yourself to some Apple products, since we’re spotting iPads, audio gear, and even MacBooks dropping to their lowest ever prices.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6034/">One of the best discounts live right now is the Apple AirPods 4 with ANC marked down to just $99.99.</a> These typically retail for $179, so you’re saving a whopping nearly $80 on the pair. These have dipped to around $130 during past sales, but $99.99 is the lowest we’ve seen them go in a long time. Even crazier? <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6035/">The non-ANC AirPods 4 are nearly 50% off at just 69, which is an insane deal for the latest model.&nbsp;</a>The deal is open to all shoppers, whether you have a Prime subscription or not.</p>
<p>It’s best to get your orders in fast, as we’re not expecting the deal to stick around for long.</p>

<h2>Adaptive Noise Cancelation for an Immersive Experience</h2>
<p>Apple unveiled its AirPods 4 last year, after redesigning the pair for exceptional all-day comfort and greater stability. The redefined contour makes for a better fit, while the shorter stem keeps the frame minimal. The build is responsive, meaning you can just press the earbuds to control music and manage calls.</p>
<p>The pair is packed with Apple’s powerful H2 chip to unlock an immersive, rich audio experience with two modes; Active Noise Cancelation and Transparency. ANC blocks background noise and chatter, letting you vibe to your favorite songs or listen to podcasts without distractions. It’s great for noisy, chaotic public places where you just can’t seem to focus on what’s playing. Putting the buds on will disconnect you from the outside world, making it feel like you’re in a quiet room even when you’re packed into a subway.</p>
<p>Transparency mode does the opposite. It lets some ambient sound in, so that you can stay aware of what’s happening around while still enjoying high-quality audio. It’s better for public settings where you don’t want to miss when someone tries to interact. Even better, there’s Conversation Awareness that automatically lowers the volume of what’s playing when someone talks to you. You won’t have to awkwardly take the earbuds out just to hear the other person properly.</p>
<p>Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking is supported, too. It places audio all around you for a 3D experience, letting you enjoy your favorite movies and TV shows better.</p>



<p>Voice/video calls get a boost with Voice Isolation, a feature that reduces background noise while clarifying yours. Catch up with friends on the go, or hop on meetings in a cafe without having to repeat yourself or constantly apologizing for the background noise. It plays nicely with Siri, so you can use the voice assistant for hands-free convenience throughout the day. Just say “Hey Siri”, and ask it to play music, make calls, or check your schedule. It’s helpful when you’re behind the wheel and don’t want to take your attention off the road, or even when both your hands are busy typing and picking up the phone would break your flow.</p>
<p>On a single charge, AirPods 4 give you around 5 hours of listening in the standard mode, while up to 4 hours with ANC on. Drop them back into the charging case, and your total extends to 30 hours. The pair is also IP54-rated dust, sweat, and water resistant. Intense workouts in the gym or a few splashes here and there won’t affect the functionality.</p>
<p>All things considered, AirPods 4 are some of the best wireless earbuds out there. You’re getting impressive sound, two listening modes, and a reliable battery life, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6034/">all for just $99.99 (ANC)</a> and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6035/">$69 (without ANC) right now.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">A wave of speculation among fans of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/alan-wake-ii">Alan Wake 2</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/control">Control</a> developer Remedy Entertainment has been sparked by the filing of a fresh trademark, just days ahead of The Game Awards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As spotted by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/new-trademark-control-resonant-unearthed-ahead-tga" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MP1st</a>, a trademark for something named "Control: Resonant" was filed yesterday, November 27, by Remedy's legal firm, Nordic Attorneys at Law Ltd. This, it's stated, is the same group responsible for all of Remedy's other trademarks. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The obvious conclusion here is that Control: Resonant will be the title of Remedy's upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/control-2">Control sequel</a>, which the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/remedy-announces-control-2-for-playstation-5-xbox-series-and-pc">developer first announced for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S back in 2022</a>. Little else is known about the project, however. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The timing of the trademark's filing raises eyebrows, coming exactly two weeks before this year's The Game Awards broadcast on December 11. And Remedy has gone big at the show before, with a full dance number during the show's 2023 ceremony to celebrate Alan Wake 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, there's a possibility this isn't the Control sequel that fans are waiting patiently for. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/control-and-alan-wake-tv-and-movies-on-the-way-thanks-to-new-annapurna-partnership">Remedy also has ideas for film and TV adaptations cooking</a> in collaboration with Annapurna Interactive, or this could alternatively be some other kind of spin-off. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the sense among fans is that now is the right time for Control's full sequel to be revealed, two years after Remedy's last blockbuster game project arrived, and as a statement of intent following the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/remedy-admits-fbc-firebreak-underperformed-commercially-we-were-unsatisfied">disappointing performance of FBC: Firebreak</a>, the studio's scrappy attempt at a Control multiplayer experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has contacted Remedy for more, and will of course be reporting all the announcements from The Game Awards 2025 live.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>If you're hunting for the best offers this week, we're actively rounding up the strongest Black Friday deals on video games, tech, and more.

			<p>As a known lover of card games, it wasn’t especially surprising that Cross Blitz really appealed to me back <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/29/cross-blitz-early-access-review-hearthstone-with-the-heart-of-a-lion/">when I first tried its Early Access launch</a>. Two whole years later, does it still feel as good now that it’s fully released? To put it simply, yes.</p>
<p>Look, we’re all busy people, I’m not going to lead you on, so if that’s all you wanted to know, then you’re done here, but do feel free to leave the page open for a few minutes to help our metrics, and maybe open a couple of other articles too. Thanks!</p>

<p>Cross Blitz is an RPG deckbuilder with multiple modes and multiple stories to play through as campaigns, thanks to its cast of different characters. Each of these characters have their own starting decks, and different potential build options as you progress as well. You’re bound to find a character or two you love the most, but at the end of the day, I think they’re all very well-designed and a lot of fun. It’s incredibly cool to nip around maps getting not only upgrades, but also more story about them all as well.</p>


<p>Along with that though, there’s also a roguelike mode, and it’s what can give Cross Blitz a near unlimited lifespan, whether you’ve finished the stories and find yourself wanting a bit more, or just want to snack on the gameplay and aren’t in the mood for reading. Yes, reading is very good for all of us, but some of us get four hours sleep, work too much, and just wanna demolish some enemies, you know?</p>
<p>One thing that didn’t quite hit me in with the Early Access release is just how much Cross Blitz feels like a really polished Game Boy Advance game. I think it’s the visual style mostly, but the whole vibe could easily have been from 20 years ago, and I mean that as a truly gargantuan compliment. Cross Blitz just feels like it’s laser-focused on its core gameplay and deck-building, doing a lot without wasting excess tech on stuff it doesn’t need. It masters mechanics to allow you to min-max, and it wants you to do so to push through some of the hardest battles as well.</p>

<p>Cross Blitz is an even better game now as it has even more to do, which is usually how these things go. The full release brings with it a new story campaign, which is in a similar vein to what’s come before, and it remains a lot of fun. The result is a more complete experience with even more cards and mechanics to mes around with, and just so much variety. It feels like you’re getting into the weeds with a really good TCG, but you don’t need to pay for all of it.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Cross Blitz is a beautifully made deck builder that feels not only incredibly inventive, but also mechanically dense, and just very satisfying to sink into. On top of that, the looks are exceptionally charming, the music is good, and the vibes are just on point. If you love a good deckbuilder, then you’ll love this, but the campaign modes also mean that this could be the one that grabs you if you’ve only ever bounced off of others due to the roguelike focus.	</p></div>

            <p>The Let it Die sequel - Let it Die: Inferno - which is coming out next week (4th December), seems to have been built using a considerable amount of generative AI.</p>
<p>Let it Die: Inferno is the somewhat surprising sequel to Suda51 studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/let-it-die-is-grasshoppers-refreshingly-different-return-to-form">Grasshopper's quirky 2016 action game Let it Die</a>, which mixed action and base infiltration and asymmetric multiplayer to novel effect. There was also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battle-royale-deathverse-let-it-die-dev-to-temporarily-suspend-the-game-just-four-months-after-launch">a purely multiplayer follow-up called Deathverse, which flopped</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2576150/LET_IT_DIE_INFERNO/">The Let it Die: Inferno Steam page</a> now discloses: "AI-generated content has been used and then edited by our team for certain parts of the in-game voices, music, and graphics." This content apparently includes background signboard textures, records illustrations, infocast videos and voices and music.</p>
<p>To what degree each of those parts of the game uses AI, we don't know, but the areas outlined - art, video, voice and music - are large areas, so the game's AI use could be substantial.</p>

<p>Inferno was only announced to the world a couple of months ago, during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-announced-in-playstations-latest-state-of-play-showcase">a September PlayStation State of Play</a>, so it hasn't had much of a marketing campaign. Perhaps that suggests a project sped to release, which is, of course, something AI could help achieve.</p>
<p>Grasshopper isn't involved with the sequel, which is entirely developed by Supertrick Games, co-developer of the original game. And the core of the game has shifted slightly to PvEvP, meaning real-time multiplayer will be a thing here.</p>
<p>Were it not for Steam's AI disclosure policy, we likely wouldn't have known about AI use in Inferno until people bought and played it, and noticed it, and reports spread around. In that regard, it's a helpful tool for shoppers, should they care. But <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-boss-tim-sweeney-says-steam-ai-disclosures-make-no-sense">there are people who think AI disclosures aren't necessary, such as Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney</a>, who believes AI use will be so commonplace there's "no sense" in making every game disclose how it's been used. Does it affect your buying decision?</p>
