<p>The MindsEye project began as part of the universe of Everywhere, a massive and experimental game developed by Build A Rocket Boy. However, due to its ambition, it became an independent title, focused on an engaging narrative experience with a lot of action elements. Check out the gameplay trailer below:</p>

<p>The game synopsis says the following:</p>



<p>“Introducing Jacob Diaz, a former soldier fitted with The MindsEye, a mysterious neural implant that haunts him with fragmented memories of a covert mission that changed his life forever. Fight to uncover the truth in a world where AI, high-tech experimentation, and unchecked military power shape every encounter. Jacob isn’t the only one searching for answers, forces working in the shadows may be more powerful and dangerous than he ever imagined. Get ready for intense combat – on foot, behind the wheel, and in the air – where every decision can mean the difference between survival and defeat.”</p>

            <p>Publisher Nacon and developer Rogue Factor have shared a release date for their new action-adventure IP, Hell is Us.</p>
<p>Hell is Us will release later this year, on 4th September, across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and PC.</p>
<p>We also got a new trailer for Hell is Us during this evening's State of Play, which you can see below. There may just be a voice you recognise.</p>

<p>Yep, that was Elias Toufexis chatting away during today's Hell is Us trailer, aka Adam Jensen from the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deus-ex">Deus Ex</a> series. Toufexis is voicing the game's protagonist, Rémi.</p>
<p>"I'm delighted to join my friends on Hell Is Us," Toufexis said in a press release following news of his participation. "I wanted to take this role because Rémi is particularly interesting: while he may seem cold or reserved at first, we gradually discover the complexity of his character, and the events that have shaped his personality.</p>
<p>"The world of the game is so endlessly fascinating. I can't wait for people to play it!"</p>
<p>If you also can't wait to play, you can pre-order yourself Hell is Us. Pre-orders are now open on the PlayStation Store and will open in the coming days for those interested in playing on either Xbox or PC.</p>
<p>Our Lottie had a little shot with Hell is Us last year. "The narrative already has me hooked - the human story of a country drowned in war, its people barely surviving, running alongside a supernatural mystery of unknown horrors emerging from the dark - while combat mechanics show excellent promise for when Hell is Us is released," she wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atmospheric-slasher-hell-is-us-abandons-maps-and-quest-markers-and-channels-brilliant-immersion-in-return">Eurogamer's Hell is Us Gamescom preview</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Housemarque, the studio behind the sublime likes of Nex Machina and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/returnal">Returnal</a>, has unveiled Saros - a third-person action game that's coming to PS5 next year.
</p>
<p>
Details on Saros are slim right now, but we do know it's a single-player game set on a "hostile, shape-shifting planet, haunted by an ominous eclipse." It stars The Fall of the House of Usher's Rahul Kohli in the lead role, with its gameplay said to build on the third-person action seen in Housemarque's critically acclaimed Returnal.
</p>
<p>
Saros' <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK4W-hBrSZs">cinematic announcement trailer</a>, which incongruously opens with the sound of laughing children, sees Kohli waking on a beach beneath a shrouded alien sun, only to encounter a terrifying multi-limbed creature rising from beneath the pitch-black water. "Every time the sun dies," Kohli's character intones in voiceover, "madness reigns, then everything begins again. But after every death, I always come back stronger."
</p>
<figure>

<p>
That final sentence - reflected in the game's Come Back Stronger tagline - certainly implies Housemarque will be revisiting the roguelite structure seen in 2021's acclaimed Returnal (and the bullet hell swirl of Kohli's subsequently unloading weapon is a classic Housemarque touch), but whether Saros has anything more than a spiritual connection to Returnal remains to be seen.
</p>
<p>
Saros launches next year for PlayStation with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> enhancements also promised, and Housemarque says it'll be sharing a first look at gameplay later this year.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/civilization-vii-is-well-hrm-um-yeah.1107699/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/civilization-vii-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You'd think <em>Sid Meier's Civilization</em>--a game built on the same successful foundations for 34 years now--would be one of the most dependable video game series on Earth. The one game you could always count on to get it right, every time. And yet, here we are.</p><p>You've probably read a bunch of <em>Civilization VII</em> reviews by now. You've maybe been assaulted by Angry Thumbnail Guys on YouTube's front page over the last week. You may even have seen the news articles about the game’s Steam page being flooded with negative feedback. Whatever you've seen or heard, the word on the street is that a lot of people think this is a bad video game!</p><p>And I mean, it is. But it's also more complicated than that.</p><p><em>Civilization VII</em> isn't a bad video game in the way that,<a href="https://aftermath.site/millennia-4x-paradox-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> say, <em>Milennia </em>was</a>. There's a bedrock here making it impossible for <em>Civ</em> to ever suck in the truest sense of the word. It's a cliche, and as much a hallmark of the turn-based genre's psychological manipulations as anything to do with <em>Civ </em>itself, but it's also true: <em>Civilization VII </em>has, if nothing else, still got that "one more turn" thing going on. Despite everything I'm about to say, I have played this game almost non-stop for the past week, even when I haven't had to.</p><p>It is, however, "bad" in the sense that since 1991 a number of <em>Civilization </em>games vastly superior to this one have been released, which still look and play great. <em>Civ VII</em> gives us very little reason to give them up for the newest entry in the series, which could and should have improved things, but has instead regressed in many ways and outright confounds in others.</p><p><em>Civ VII</em> is "bad" because I was continually frustrated while playing it, was rarely kept motivated or interested for long sessions, and often ran into bizarre, uncharacteristic bugs and oversights. Despite playing it all week I've rarely found myself enjoying my time with it, and have indeed<a href="https://aftermath.site/sid-meiers-colonization-pc-windows-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> found more comfort this month in a 30 year-old spinoff</a> than in playing this brand new edition.</p><p>But I don't think it's a <em>bad video game</em>. I just think it's a rushed, disorganised mess, more a victim of weird management decisions and AAA release pressures than anything wrong with <em>Civ's</em> patented take on the 4X genre itself.</p><figure><figcaption>This is the American faction art, which is used when you select them then also...when you win a space race victory.</figcaption></figure><p>There's a lot wrong with <em>Civilization VII</em>. Some of it is clear in a vacuum; other issues are only visible--but perhaps more pressing as a result--if you're a long-time fan of the series. Whether you've been with <em>Civ </em>from the onset or just <em>Civ VI</em>, though, the end result is the same: almost every aspect of the experience has stagnated or gone backwards here, even from <em>Civilization VI</em>, which<a href="https://www.lukeplunkett.com/civilization-vi-the-re-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> I thought was itself a misfire</a>.</p><p>Let's start with diplomacy. <em>Civilization </em>is a series that has lived and, more recently, died with its diplomacy. Even as far back as the first game, a combination of character art, writing and personality has made your allies and enemies feel alive. I can't understate how important this was to placing your own civilization and efforts into context. For most of this series' history it felt like you were playing against <em>rivals</em>, not just the AI.</p><figure><figcaption>The new diplomacy system, where rivals speak to your character model instead of directly at the player, is a huge downgrade from previous Civs</figcaption></figure><p><em>Civilization VII</em> has reduced diplomacy to an endless series of transactional nuisances. A new diplomacy system has commoditised everything in the game, while at the same time removing the way Civs would often pop in just to say hi, exclaim at your progress or just threaten you, which makes the entire experience feel so much lonelier than previously. I never felt like I was one part of a wider human race in this game, more like one player tending to their little zen garden while everyone else tended theirs.</p><p><a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/520793/civilization-7-firaxis-responds-mixed-reviews" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">If you've seen any of the negative feedback for this game, you've probably seen people blaming "bad UI"</a> for many of <em>Civ VII's</em> woes, and yes, the interface sucks, but "bad UI" has also become an unfortunate catch-all criticism for some problems that run deeper than some grey boxes. Civ VII's UI doesn't tell you things you need to know, continually tells you things you don't need to know, is slow and glitchy, is incapable of differentiating between what's a bother and what's important and is just generally a massive disappointment, functionally and visually, from its predecessors.</p><p>It's clear something has gone very wrong during the game's development. There are now multiple<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1i3wpql/vii_release_ui_spotted/#lightbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> examples</a>, both from early demos in 2024 and hidden in the final game's<a href="https://imgur.com/a/y4pQqYr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> code</a>, of <em>Civ VII</em> once having an almost <em>entirely </em>different interface. For that aspect of the game to have been overhauled so close to release sure would explain why things look so bland and rushed--one of my earliest notes from playing this was "looks like an iPad version of <em>Civ V</em>"--and why the interface was the first thing <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/news/message-from-firaxis-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Firaxis have said</a> they'd be fixing, because what if they're not really fixing it at all, but just...finishing it.</p><figure><figcaption>Lots of menus and screens that used to be adorned with custom art and thematic flourishes in older games are now just these drab grey slabs</figcaption></figure><p>Another thing that is bad, but also not <em>bad</em>: the game's art. Not its characters or map, both of which are gorgeous, but the game's set-dressing, the illustrations that adorn its faction screens and key moments. These appear, to put it gently, rushed, to the point where some civs like the French feature near-complete illustrations depicting their national character, while others, like America, look like they were done on a lunchbreak.&nbsp;</p><p>The art manages to disappoint when it's not even there. In 1991's <em>Civilization</em>, for example, completing the scientific victory path earned you a lengthy cutscene depicting your people's journey through the stars. In 2025's <em>Civilization VII</em>, when I won the same victory with America, I got a two-line speech from actress Gwendoline Christie (who is admittedly excellent here overall) and an animated rendition of the same 18th-century artwork used at the faction select screen.</p><p>My main issue with <em>Civilization VII</em> is that, whether it was rushed or not, it doesn't know what it is. <em>Civilization V</em> had a clear direction. <em>Civ VI</em> did as well, even if I didn't end up liking it. <em>Civilization VII</em> feels like a game where it tries some stuff, cuts some other stuff then thinks about some other tweaks as well, but little of it feels like it's in the service of making the series <em>better</em>.</p><figure><figcaption>The way continents become megacities doesn't just look ridiculous, it robs each city and building of the ability to be scanned at a glance</figcaption></figure><p>It's as though <em>Civilization</em>, the Godfather of the genre,<a href="https://aftermath.site/humankind-re-review-amplitude-impressions-pc-sega-4x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> looked at <em>Humankind </em>copying <em>Civ</em></a><em> </em>and decided for some reason--<em>Humankind </em>wasn't great!--to copy <em>Humankind</em> in return. <em>Civilization VII</em> features <em>Humankind's </em>mid-game civ-switching, for example, which is <em>ruinous</em>, robbing the game of any sense of continuity or character. It has <em>Humankind's </em>meditative flow, where slow-moving units are queued up while they crawl across the map and city growth is tended to on a tile-by-tile basis, which is streamlining and relaxing to a point, <a href="https://aftermath.site/strategy-game-turn-based-tactics-movement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">but also saps <em>Civilization </em>of much of its essential busywork</a>. It even has <em>Humankind's </em>town system, only here, for reasons listed above, it fails to properly explain it.</p><p>Ever since making the leap to a hexagonal map with <em>Civilization V</em>, and drawing in more and more board game influences in its wake, this is a series that has lost touch with its roots. With each successive game and expansion over the past 15 years <em>Civ </em>has been looking increasingly at stuff like numbers, optimisation and metas and lost sight of what made the series so special in the first place. The numbers in <em>Civ</em> were never the point, they just ran under the hood. The point was getting to see and play with the stuff they were in service of: that feeling of taking a tribe out of the literal darkness and into space, building cool stuff along the way and dealing with rivals who felt like rivals.</p><p>Now, with so much of the <em>Civ </em>experience devoted to the board game-like optimisation of numbers and combos, and with so much of its busywork streamlined--worker units, one of my favourite pastimes, are gone entirely from <em>Civ VII</em>--it barely even feels like <em>Civ </em>anymore. If you'd told me <em>Civ VII </em>was a spinoff of the series, or a competitor's attempt at cloning it, I would 100% have believed you.</p><figure><figcaption>This glimpse at an earlier interface not only shows hovering tooltips, something sorely missing from the February 2025 release, but also a different banner for settlements as well.<span></span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1i3wpql/vii_release_ui_spotted/#lightbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit</a></figcaption></figure><p>It's been a huge bummer writing this much negative stuff about a new <em>Civilization </em>game, so in the interests of saying <em>something </em>nice, I'll say that perhaps the game's biggest swing for the fences--the new era system--has at least partly paid off. By splitting the game into three distinct ages (Ancient, Exploration and Modern), each with a different scope and objectives, <em>Civ VII </em>games feel expertly-paced during their opening few hours. The Age of Exploration in particular is fantastic, as it broadens the game world itself, increasing the size of the map and the number of leaders on the board, helping to bring a real sense of weight to this particular moment in history.</p><p>I can't help being this negative, though, because nearly everything else new or changed here is for the worse. Of course <em>Civ VII </em>has that "one more turn" pull here, a basic sense of perpetual motion brought on by the progression of tech and the expansion of borders, because that's a psychological plot every <em>Civ </em>game can bring to bear. But I can get the same thing from other <em>Civs </em>already, without any of <em>Civ VII's</em> multiple missteps bogging the experience down.</p><p>It's sobering, <a href="https://aftermath.site/call-duty-modern-warfare-impressions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in kinda the same way we've seen with <em>Call of Duty</em> in recent years</a>, that such a seeming home run can be botched in today's AAA release environment. This game had all the time in the world to come out, yet here it is, clearly rushed and busted and unfinished and getting the reception such a release deserves. During my repeated downtime with this game, I couldn't help but wonder, If a new <em>Civilization </em>game can stumble and trip out of the gates like this, what hope do so many other legacy series have in the same environment?</p><p>Indeed the only optimism I can salvage here is that, like I've said, while there are some strategic missteps, many of <em>Civ VII's</em> other issues don't necessarily make it a bad video game. It's just not finished. And if we went nine years between <em>Civs</em> last time around, Firaxis have plenty of time to at least try and tie a bow on this one.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/common-side-effects-adult-swim-max-hbo"><h3>You Should Be Watching Common Side Effects</h3></a><p>The difficult-to-Google Adult Swim show takes aim at the healthcare industry</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/beyond-citadel-indie-retro-shooter"><h3>Beyond Citadel Is Gory, Obscene, And Almost A Masterpiece</h3></a><p>Inspired by Lucasarts' Outlaws and Bungie's Marathon, Beyond Citadel is mechanically one of the best indie shooters I have played in years and absolutely not for everyone.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Housemarque has revealed Saros, their next new IP and an evolution of the time looping shooter action that was last seen in their PS5 debut <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/returnal">Returnal</a>. Saros is in development for PS5 and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>, and it’s coming out in 2026.</p>
<p><iframe title="Saros - Cinematic Announce Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rK4W-hBrSZs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This latest tale takes players to the planet carcosa, with an ominous eclipse and the end of the world sending poor Arjun Devraj (portrayed by Rahul Kohli) into a deadly time loop. He’s a Soltari Enforcer, looking for answers on a lost off-world colony.</p>
<p>Saros will feature a permanent progression system where death reshapes the world and gives you new upgrade possibilities to defeat the challenges you face. That’s a wordy way of saying it’s going to be a roguelike.</p>
<p>It’s also confirmed that it will be another third-person action game, again looking to evolve the gameplay from Returnal.</p>

<p>Gameplay will be revealed in due course, but we’re immediately rather excited for this one!</p>
<p>Looking back on Returnal,<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/04/29/returnal-review-ps5/"> our glowing 9/10 review</a> of the PS5 launch window game said, “It feels immensely satisfying to be sat here in 2021, eons after playing Super Stardust HD on PS3, and see just how far Housemarque has come. Offering a visual bullet hell spectacle, a showcase for the DualSense controller and a rewarding sci-fi narrative woven around the roguelike loop, we can say with unflinching confidence that Returnal is the PS5’s best game to date.”</p>

		<p>Konami and developer ZDT have revealed Darwin’s Paradox, a side-scrolling platformer adventure with an abducted octopus as its star. The game has been confirmed for PS5, coming out in 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Darwin's Paradox! - Reveal Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TbgsjUFIBOw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The game looks like it draw influences from other platformer adventures of the last decade, such as Playdead’s Inside and Limbo, or Tarsier’s Little Nightmares, but gives it a more humorous, lighter tone thanks to much more colourful grahpics, a 1950s sci-fi style and animation in keeping with modern movies.</p>
<p>Writing on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/12/darwins-paradox-makes-a-splash-onto-ps5/">PS Blog</a>, the team explain:</p>
<p>Our protagonist Darwin has all the evolutionary features of an octopus including the ability to climb almost any surface, camouflage himself, and also the skill to shoot ink to evade his enemies. Haptic feedback on the DualSense controller’s triggers will give you the satisfying feeling of firing off multiple shots of black ink to hit hard-to-reach levers and buttons, or to blind security camera feeds to plan your escape. When swimming in underwater scenarios, the ink shot disperses into the water, creating a perfect back smokescreen to help you get past searchlights without being spotted – just like octopi do in the real world when they feel threatened by a predator in the wild.</p>

<p>Keeping a close eye on your environment is key if you want to survive. As a typical octopus is known to do, Darwin can also morph his skin to match the spot he’s in – essentially creating camouflage to hide and avoid detection.</p>
<p>Darwin’s movements across the world are meticulously tracked with controller vibrations, giving you a sense of connection to our curious cephalopod everywhere he climbs. When you get hit, you feel it.&nbsp; In a world as dangerous as the one Darwin dares to explore, there will be short-circuit shocks, crushing machines of twisted metal, and roaming packs of rabid rats looking to make Darwin a tasty meal.</p>
<p>Certainly one to keep an eye on, if you ask me!</p>

			<p>One of the most impressive games we saw at Gamescom 2024 was Tides of Annihilation. We haven't been able to talk about it until now, but the long embargo is finally over as the project was just revealed during the latest State of Play broadcast.</p>
<p>Powered by Unreal Engine 5 and developed by Chengdu-based studio Eclipse Glow Games, this is a single player narrative-driven action/adventure game originally codenamed Ghosts of Fog. The setting features modern-day London mixed with many fantasy elements, some of which are explicitly borrowed from the Arthurian and Knights of the Round Table myths.</p>
<figure>

<p>The main character is Gwendolyn, seemingly the only human survivor roaming in a post-apocalyptic London, who embarks on a journey to reclaim her legacy and her homeland. Eventually, she gains the ability to summon two Knights of the Round Table to fight at her side. In the footage, the combat&nbsp;looked fast, frantic, and meaty. The developers promised that the skills would be customizable, too.</p>
<p>Tides of Annihilation clearly takes some cues from games like Monster Hunter and Shadow of the Colossus, as there are some gigantic bosses that are practically like their own level. Gwendolyn can climb on and explore them. Level design as a whole is inspired by the Metroidvania genre, featuring interconnected levels and shortcuts to unlock between them. London itself is also meant to be a character of sorts in the game. The developers likened it to a tree, with each branch being an iconic landmark, albeit transformed.</p>
<p>The team had around 100 developers during Gamescom 2024, although it planned to increase the size to 130 by the end of 2024 as Tides of Annihilation approached its beta phase. The employees have several years of experience at triple-A studios like Sega, Ubisoft, and Gameloft. For example, the game's producer designed combat in Yakuza 0, while the lead programmer worked on technologies used in Assassin's Creed and Prince of Persia games.</p>

<p>The team also clarified that, much like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/black-myth-wukong-a-compelling-journey-into-chinese-tradition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Myth: Wukong</a>, Eclipse Glow Games has received an investment from Tencent but is not owned by Tencent. Moreover, they already have plans to expand the IP to other mythologies, such as Egyptian, Chinese, and Japanese, if it is as successful as they hope.</p>
<p>Tides of Annihilation is currently in development for PC and consoles, with no publicly announced release window. You can find more info in <a href="https://wccftech.com/tides-of-annihilation-qa-2026-tentative-launch-30-hours-light-rpg-elements-exclusive-screens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our Q&amp;A with the developers</a>.</p>

			<p>Housemarque Games, the studio behind some of the best shooter games released in the past few years, announced today their next project called Saros.</p>
<p>The new game, which was announced during today's State of Play with a cinematic trailer and will launch sometime next year, is being built on the features of the studio's latest game, Returnal, to offer the ultimate evolution of the Housemarque trademark gameplay where every death will reshape the world while offering new upgrades to the player. Judging from the game's description and what happens in the trailer, there's little doubt that the game will feature some roguelike mechanics.</p>
<p><iframe title="Saros - Cinematic Announce Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rK4W-hBrSZs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><em>SAROS features permanent progression systems, where every death reshapes the world while offering new upgrades to overcome challenges. With a haunting story, deep third-person action, and a grounded performance by Rahul Kohli, SAROS presents the next evolution in Housemarque's gameplay-first experience.</em></p>
<p>Saros is currently in development for PlayStation 5, and will release sometime next year. You can learn more about Returnal, the game upon which Housemarque is building their next title, in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/returnal-in-my-restless-dreams-i-see-that-house/">review</a>.</p>
<p><em>Save for an ending that crashes nearly as hard as Helios' entry onto Atropos, Returnal checks all of the marks for what a best-in-class roguelike should aim for: a gameplay loop that rewards the player for innovation and mastery, loot that can synergize to create some unstoppable character builds, and most importantly, weapons that simply feel right in the player's hands. Without a doubt, Returnal is one of the finest PlayStation 5 exclusives available in 2021 and those that are eager for the next great challenge can find plenty to look forward to with Selene's first steps onto the alien planet again and again.</em></p>

            <p>Chinese developers Eclipse Glow Games have revealed Tides Of Annihilation, a fantasy hack-and-slash set in a "twisted", modern yet Arthurian version of London. It casts you as Gwendolyn, a baby-faced blood-letter who must defeat <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avalon">Avalon</a>'s demi-gods by *checks notes* throwing the Knights of The Round Table at them.</p><p>I'm interested in the game partly because it's a Chinese interpretation of London, complete with a tipped-over Millennium Wheel and cheery red phone booths, and I'm always eager to see my own plague-ridden cultural inheritance reflected in the eyes of artists from overseas. I already have some pointers for Eclipse Glow. For instance, the River Thames looks <em>far</em> too clean, massive fish demons notwithstanding, and there aren't nearly enough sexshop fliers in those phone booths.</p>
<p>I also like the bits in the announcement trailer where bosses growl about "doomed fates", then do a martial breakdance at you with mild overtones of Cat.exe Has Stopped Working. Love a good flamboyant boss. There are over 30 of them in the game, including a beefy bloke with floaty dreadlocks and a lady who seems to have borrowed Gilgamesh's Gate Of Babylon ability from Fate/Stay Night. Gwendolyn, for her part, comes equipped with combos, juggles, invisi-dodges and the aforesaid ability to project spectral knights to smash things up or light them on fire.</p>

<p>The press release cites <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/devil-may-cry">Devil May Cry</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nier">Nier</a> Automata as comparisons. They could have chucked Final Fantasy 16 in there, too - the knight-summoning mechanics remind me of the latter game's Eikons. Also, God Of War 3 or Shadow Of The Colossus, given that Tides Of Annihilation's London is full of wandering, armoured titans who serve as "dynamic, interconnected vertical challenges". </p>
<p>The developers - who are funded by Tencent, and include former Sega and Ubisoft people - say it'll take you at least 30 hours to finish. The thing I like least right now is Gwendolyn's acting. It's like somebody left Morphydd Clark's Galadriel in the fridge. I guess we can't all be Cate Blanchett. Anyway, you can read more about Tides Of Annihilation on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3292470/_/">Steam</a> (page not live at the time of writing). There's no release date yet.</p>

<p>Eclipse Glow Studios has revealed ‘Tides of Annihilation’ during the PlayStation State of Play showcase. This developing title promises to plunge players into a post-apocalyptic rendition of London, <strong>transformed </strong>by an ‘otherworldly invasion’. It’s a single-player, story-driven game that has ties to Arthurian myth and the Knights of the Round Table.</p>



<p>During Gamescom 2024, I sat down with the team from Eclipse Glow Studios – which has since undergone a rebrand – to learn about and see exclusive, pre-alpha footage of Tides of Annihilation. Back then, it was called Ghosts of Fog, and it won me over in an instant.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-tide-is-coming-in">The Tide is Coming In</h2>



<p>Per the game’s description, Tides of Annihilation blends ‘intense, breakneck combat, an immersive narrative, and an unforgettable setting.’</p>



<p>Players assume control of Gwendolyn, a powerful protagonist and the sole survivor of the devastated human race, poised to battle incredible enemies in her bid to turn back time. She’ll be able to summon spectral knights and wield the powers of ancient beings in her fight for good.</p>



<p>Here’s a snippet from the game’s description:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Players will encounter hordes of enemies, unforgettable bosses, and vertical levels in the form of gigantic knights roaming the landscape.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>And here’s the impressive first trailer for the game:</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>







<p>Eclipse Glow Studios is a Chinese company headquartered in Chengdu. The team is made up of industry veterans who have contributed to games like Assassin’s Creed, Yakuza, and For Honor.</p>



<p>One of the topics I discussed with Eclipse Glow Studios’ representatives at Gamescom was how they could make the game more appealing to a Western market. This included making Gwendolyn appear as more of a strong, formidable lead than simply making her ‘eye candy’ like other, similar games have done in recent years.</p>



<p>The trailer that debuted today at the State of Play showcase represents that perfectly, and Gwendolyn looks like a phenomenal main character. This is comparable to a cross between Stellar Blade and Elden Ring.</p>



<p>Do you like the look of Tides of Annihilation, which is coming soon to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and PC? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>At today’s PlayStation State of Play event, Konami confirmed the previously leaked release date of August 28, 2025, for Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A few days ago, a PlayStation Store listing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-3-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">leaked</a> Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater’s release date. The date was leaked alongside a new trailer featuring gameplay and narrative-based sequences. The same trailer was shown at today’s Play event, and excitingly, it also had the ‘Ape Escape Mode’ tease at the end. &nbsp;</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Details about Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater have already been revealed. The game features two new perspectives, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-3-remakes-difficulty-will-vary-for-new-style-and-legacy-modes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘New Style’ and ‘Legacy Style,’</a> and the difficulty levels for each mode. Players have also been told about the latest battle systems, which reflect bullets and battle wounds on the body, with some permanent marks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, the story, characters, voice acting and music have all been remade for modern consoles, with new intuitive controls that provide a more immersive stealth survival experience. Alternatively, you can always go back to the classic controls. There is an additional game mode called Snake Vs Money, where players will round up escaped apes as Snake.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, a recent claim stated that Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater will also be released for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-to-release-on-nintendo-switch-2-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 this year</a>. Konami has also indicated that it would be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-1-would-be-hard-to-remake-konami-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hard to remake Part 1</a>.

                <p>In PlayStation's February 2025 State of Play, Supermassive Games announced that The Dark Pictures Anthology: Directive 8020 is releasing on October 2 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>Directive 8020 follows a crew on a spaceship called Cassiopeia, which is on a journey to find a new home for humanity. It crash-lands on the planet of Tau Ceti f, which is 12 light-years away from Earth. The crew on the ship is brought out of hypersleep early and each of them must survive an unknown alien threat.</p><p>One of the crew members, Brianna Young, is portrayed by Lashana Lynch, who is best known for playing Maria Rambeau in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, as well as roles in Bob Marley: One Love and The Woman King.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a_VXgNSfME" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4a_VXgNSfME" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Like the franchise's previous entry, The Devil in Me, players will be able to use a variety of tools in Directive 8020, including a new scanner. The scanner is used to detect aliens that can mimic the appearances of Cassiopeia's crew. There's also a screwdriver that can be used to distract enemies by activating electronic devices nearby. A new utility strap on the characters' wrists can be used to control a flashlight, but the aliens will be able to spot it, so players will need to be careful.</p><p>Directive 8020 is the latest entry in The Dark Pictures Anthology and takes inspiration from other media such as The Thing, with a mix of both stealth and horror.</p>

These techniques are all in addition to standard sword strike, thrust, and parrying maneuvers, and Miyamoto has a set of special skills from his Oni Gauntlet, a magical glove that appeared in previous Onimusha games to grant its wearer unique powers.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_mbG9YbwM8" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/i_mbG9YbwM8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Onimusha: Way of the Sword launches sometime in 2026 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam.</span></p>
