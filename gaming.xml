Like many fresh ideas, the concept of a deck-building game is startling in its simplicity. Card games where you build a custom deck before you play have been around a while. In a deck-building game, though, you build the deck <em>while </em>you play. Starting with a hand of currency cards, you cash them in for other, more interesting cards, and make a deck on-the-fly you think is good enough to win.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It wasn't just gamers who got bowled over by the brilliance of the concept: It was designers, too. Gaming was soon awash in copycat games, many of limited interest. Since then, the mechanic has seen redeployment into other genres of game with mixed results, but there are loads of awesome examples. These are the best deck-building board games out there right now.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">TL;DR: The Best Deck-Building Games</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games#slaythespire">Slay the Spire</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games#heat">Heat: Pedal to the Metal</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games#arnak">Lost Ruins of Arnak</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games#star-wars">Star Wars: The Deck-Building Game</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games#dune">Dune: Imperium</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games#el-dorado">The Quest for El Dorado</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games#cubitos">Cubitos</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games#quedlinburg">The Quacks of Quedlinburg</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games#underdark">Tyrants of the Underdark</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games#legendary">Legendary: A Marvel Deck Building Game</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games#dominion">Dominion</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games#aeons-end">Aeon's End</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games#clank">Clank!

So it's entirely appropriate that there's now a board game version of that game to close the circle. Rules-wise it's very close to its source material as you choose an adventurer and refine their combat deck through a series of tough encounters and merchant visits, climbing the titular spire to fight a terrifying boss. However the parent game is solo only, and a lot of the fun in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/slay-the-spire-the-board-game-review">Slay the Spire: The Board Game</a> comes from the fact that you get to venture into the unknown and battle the gribblies with friends along for the ride.</p></div><p id="heat-pedal-to-the-metal"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Heat: Pedal to the Metal">Heat: Pedal to the Metal</h2></p><div catalogid="b34c3d5f-862d-4b67-ae09-2df14512bd66" id="195818"><div id="195818" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Heat: Pedal to the Metal</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In Heat: Pedal to the Metal, your deck represents the engine of your car, with most cards showing a number of spaces to move. On your turn you can switch gears and then must play the corresponding gear number of cards from your hand, trying to avoid taking corners too fast and spinning off, in a nail-biting race to the finish on your choice of included tracks. Deck building in the basic game is limited to managing heat cards that you take in exchange for extra actions but which clog up your deck, however there's an advanced variant that lets you tinker with your engine deck in all sorts of other satisfying ways for a deeper strategic experience.</p></div><p id="lost-ruins-of-arnak"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Lost Ruins of Arnak" id="arnak">Lost Ruins of Arnak</h2></p><div catalogid="12b47414-1a47-426c-9d08-c534eb78cc53" id="180361"><div id="180361" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Lost Ruins of Arnak</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph" id="star-wars">Given the ongoing popularity of the Indiana Jones series, it's perhaps surprising that more board games haven't riffed on the adventurous archeaologist, but at least this one that does is an absolute cracker. Players race to gather equipment and companions to make expeditions deeper and deeper into the jungle, braving strange guardians and plundering ruins before feeding their gains back into the next expedition in a cool interplay of daring and forward-planning that's surprisingly strategic once you peel back its interlocking mechanics. One of those is your trusty deck of cards that you'll get to add to by spending your loot, before playing as you plan and execute your expeditions.</p></div><p id="star-wars-the-deckbuilding-game"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Star Wars: The Deckbuilding Game" id="star-wars">Star Wars: The Deckbuilding Game</h2></p><div catalogid="def0fa37-840a-4faa-9a9a-34e7e08852fd" id="177415"><div id="177415" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Star Wars: The Deckbuilding Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">At first sight, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-the-deckbuilding-game-review">Star Wars: The Deckbuilding Game</a> looks like a typical example of the genre where you start with a few cards that give you resources, which you spend to buy more cards to beef up your deck. In this instance, you’re looking for offensive cards that damage your opponent’s base as a route to victory. But there are some really fun tweaks to the formula beyond the appealing theme. For starters, you can attack cards before your opponent buys them, denying them good options and earning you a reward. There’s also a very deep well of card variety, with tons of interesting combos between their effects you can explore. Finally, destroying one base isn’t enough: you need three, and you get to pick which ones you use, with their special effects adding another layer to the game’s strategy.</p></div><p id="dune-imperium"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Dune Imperium" id="dune">Dune Imperium</h2></p><div catalogid="78ef26ef-33d1-4276-b2fd-590cf3dddef9" id="155275"><div id="155275" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Dune Imperium</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-imperium-board-game-review">Dune: Imperium</a> your deck represents resources that your noble house can draw on as you seek power and influence in the universe of Frank Herbert’s sci-fi epic. It’s married to another classic mechanic, worker placement, as each card play sends one of your agents to a board space, either courting influence with a faction like The Guild or The Fremen, or to the planet’s surface, to harvest spice or do battle for territory. It’s a clever melange of thematic and abstract concepts that mesh to create a fascinating whole with many parts to master. There’s also a whole new concept for deckbuilding called reveal turns where you discard your remaining cards to get a secondary effect, meaning you’re building and playing your deck on two different levels at once.</p></div><p id="the-quest-for-el-dorado"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="The Quest for El Dorado" id="el-dorado">The Quest for El Dorado</h2></p><div catalogid="a4337eee-9d52-427c-b50e-2db0194e4867" id="198605"><div id="198605" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Quest for El Dorado</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is what you get when Reiner Knizia, possibly the most prolific and talented game designer of all time, turns his considerable skills onto deck-building. The result is a seamless blend of deck management and race game as players compete to be the first to make it across the map, matching cards from their deck to terrain hexes on the board in order to move. But of course that’s only half the story: there are hidden surprises in many spaces to upend your strategy and powerful one-shot cards in the market that can make or break your game if timed correctly. Easy to learn, fun to play, but full of interaction and challenge: all the hallmarks of yet another Knizia classic that’s worth its weight in gold.</p></div><p id="cubitos"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Cubitos" id="cubitos">Cubitos</h2></p><div catalogid="52477445-7671-4979-b7a1-7265ba9a1593" id="198606"><div id="198606" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Cubitos</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Since Dominion spawned the whole deck-building subgenre, various games have switched from a deck to a bag of cubes, but Cubitos<em> </em>takes things one step further and allows you to build a collection of actual dice. Your aim is to propel a running racer across the finish line first, but it’s the dice that do the propulsion when you roll the appropriate symbols to move. Other symbols let you buy more dice, thin your collection, even attack and defend with other players. But best of all are the blank faces, which do nothing except let you re-roll them unless you roll all blanks, in which case it’s turn over. With the thrill of rolling huge buckets of dice, the strategy of combining dice types to suit the action, and the addictive terror of push your luck, you’ll be winning with Cubitos even when you lose.</p></div><p id="the-quacks-of-quedlinburg"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="The Quacks of Quedlinburg" id="quedlinburg">The Quacks of Quedlinburg</h2></p><div catalogid="17284768-0988-43e6-bfce-b1a1d8b45546" id="157129"><div id="157129" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Quacks of Quedlinburg</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Each turn of this game (which you may also find re-branded as just plain Quacks), you’ll get the opportunity to add new ingredients to your secret bag, from which you’ll then draw counters to mix in your cauldron in a quest to create the most powerful potion. But watch out: Draw too many bomb counters and your mixture for the round will explode, ending your turn early. This simple premise is set into flight by the fact that you can change the effects of the other counters each game, choosing from a palette of different abilities that dovetail in new and interesting ways, adding more power to your potion and your purchasing ability as you race with your opponents to make the best brew. Add in a slew of other strategic levers to manage, and you’ve got the makings of a modern classic. And once you've mastered the contents of the base game there are all sorts of expansions to mix in, as we explain in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-quacks-of-quedlinburg-buyers-guide">Quacks of Quedlinburg buyer's guide</a>.</p></div><p id="tyrants-of-the-underdark"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Tyrants of the Underdark" id="underdark">Tyrants of the Underdark</h2></p><div catalogid="54095bdc-7b22-49e7-9e3b-df59a14ac86c" id="155296"><div id="155296" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Tyrants of the Underdark</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tyrants-of-the-underdark-board-game-review">Tyrants of the Underdark</a> is another game where your deck corresponds to assets belonging to a noble house, only this time they’re minions in the employ of Dungeons &amp; Dragons’ fiendish dark elves. Card play spreads your troops, assassins and influence from your starting city over a network of Underdark locations from the well-known fantasy novel trilogy <a href="https://zdcs.link/MgPPg?object_uuid=aaf7ba4e-1b6f-4b88-85fa-863291be3836&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Legend of Drizzt</a>. There’s a real sense of struggle as you tussle for territory with other players, card and counter-card adding and removing pieces from the board. Many of the cards represent iconic characters and monsters from the role-playing game with art to match. And there are multiple card sets to combine for new and interesting strategic and tactical options with every play. </p></div><p id="legendary-a-marvel-deck-building-ga"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Legendary: A Marvel Deck Building Ga" id="legendary">Legendary: A Marvel Deck Building Game</h2></p><div catalogid="ba64de19-1607-413b-9d01-11cb5d637c32" id="164693"><div id="164693" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Legendary: A Marvel Deck Building Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Legendary does a couple of interesting things with the deck-building formula. For starters, it’s cooperative, with all the players working together to defeat a supervillain, although if you defeat them you can tally points and declare a top, legendary, player. Second, the villain has a deck too, which functions as a game engine and a scenario which dictates the win and loss conditions. You’re not, as you might expect, playing as individual Marvel heroes but rather controlling them as a group with your card plays, recruiting new cards and attacking the villain’s henchmen. It’s a riot of replayability with so many different combinations out of the box, plus it’s fast and smooth with lots of options to fine-tune the challenge level to your group’s needs. There’s a whole series of Legendary games built on the same mechanical engine, including the excellent <a href="https://zdcs.link/kv00W?object_uuid=aaf7ba4e-1b6f-4b88-85fa-863291be3836&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Legendary Encounters: An Alien Deck Building Game</a>.</p></div><p id="dominion-2nd-edition"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Dominion: 2nd Edition" id="dominion">Dominion: 2nd Edition</h2></p><div catalogid="912e22f5-6a33-452d-bf80-12fd40392a7a" id="198818"><div id="198818" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Dominion: 2nd Edition</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Or you could start with the deck building game that started it all. Dominion wasn't only novel: It was also simple, with quick, three-step turns. All the complexity is on the cards themselves. The goal is to use the starting copper cards to buy better cards, allowing for more money and actions, working up to buying victory point cards. Strategy comes down to honing your deck into the leanest card-buying machine you can manage. With 25 card options, of which 10 got chosen for use in each game, it also has impressive replay value. Yet it's popular enough to have spawned a slew of expansions, of which <a href="https://zdcs.link/vwMMb?object_uuid=aaf7ba4e-1b6f-4b88-85fa-863291be3836&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dominion: Intrigue</a> is often considered the best, but we have a full <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dominion-buying-guide-expansions">Dominion buyer's guide</a> if you want to shop around.</p></div><p id="aeons-end"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Aeon's End" id="aeons-end">Aeon's End</h2></p><div catalogid="c4e046c8-ff49-43e8-bfd5-9b9ba7fd94d9" id="201955"><div id="201955" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Aeon's End</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Aeon's End takes deck-building into the popular category of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">cooperative games</a>. It's a smart move: deck-based games are often low on interaction, and having players work together is a solid solution. Here, you're all wizards working together to save a fantasy city from a marauding evil. And there are plenty of cards to heal and buff your fellow players, so there's plenty to think about. Its particular genius, though, is that you flip your discard pile over rather than shuffling when it's empty. This makes the order of card play critical, allowing you to set up combos for the next time you run through your deck. With other timing-based innovations and a tense random turn order, it's thrilling and challenging in equal measure. You can now choose from a variety of sets as we run down in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/aeons-end-board-game-buying-guide">Aeon's End buyer's guide</a>, from facing off against demons in the original box to taking on the undead in a longer, more complex campaign with the new <a href="https://zdcs.link/VxPPY?object_uuid=aaf7ba4e-1b6f-4b88-85fa-863291be3836&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Legacy of Gravehold</a>.</p></div><p id="clank-catacombs"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Clank!

Catacombs</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Numbers are at the heart of what makes deck-building work, and they're at the heart of what makes the Clank! series special. Players are adventurers seeking to loot a dungeon and escape before a dragon wakes up. The engine of each hero is their deck, which lets them move and fight, open doors and spend gold. These are just abstract numbers that you use to overcome challenges: The real game is the frantic race in and out of the dungeon. That's where all the themes and thrills are. By separating the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games">strategy</a> from the theme, Clank! manages to satisfy fans of both camps with a winning combination. Clank! Catacombs is the latest and greatest iteration of this series, adding more deck control, more variety and a dungeon built of randomly-drawn tiles to re-create the thrill of exploring the unknown. </p></div><p id="undaunted-normandy"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Undaunted: Normandy" id="undaunted">Undaunted: Normandy</h2></p><div catalogid="f73d6c06-70d4-4669-8a3a-3e6e0df5d169" id="158884"><div id="158884" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Undaunted: Normandy</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Deck-building has proved a surprising proxy for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games">warfare</a> in several games. Undaunted is the best of them, using the flow of cards from your deck as a way to simulate casualties and command confusion on the battlefield. It's a great fit, giving players a real sense of running an infantry platoon from simple rules. Atop the deck-building strategy, there's the extra dimension of moving pieces on the map. This isn't so realistic, but it's still a ton of fun as you tussle over tiles using tactics and dice. A selection of scenarios and troop types ensures there's plenty of replay puzzling as you work the game's layers to gain the upper hand. There are multiple editions of the game to choose from. <a href="https://zdcs.link/Ly1rZ?object_uuid=aaf7ba4e-1b6f-4b88-85fa-863291be3836&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Undaunted: Normandy</a> focuses on squad-level combat in France while <a href="https://zdcs.link/pPb1R?object_uuid=aaf7ba4e-1b6f-4b88-85fa-863291be3836&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Undaunted: North Africa</a> moves the action to single-soldier special forces and adds rules for vehicles, and for those who'd prefer to avoid the military theme <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/undaunted-2200-callisto-board-game-review">Undaunted 2200: Callisto</a> is set in a far-future mining colony.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Deck-Building vs Deckbuilding</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Deck-building is a confusing term because it applies to both a genre and a gaming activity, and it means slightly different things in each case. The term originates in collectible card games, the best known of which is Magic: The Gathering. In this realm, deck-building means the process of deciding what cards from your collection you’re going to use in a deck with which to play the game. In the very earliest days of collectible games, before access to the internet was widespread, this was a key part of the strategic appeal of these titles as you had to decide which cards would work well together. Nowadays, it’s increasingly common for players to get deck-building suggestions from the internet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In 2008 there was a minor revolution in game design with Dominion, which invented deck-building as a genre. It took inspiration from deck-building as an activity but instead of building a deck before you play from a collection, in these games you build your deck while you play, from a market of cards. In many such games, like Dominion itself or Star Wars The Deckbuilding Game, your starting cards include currencies with which to buy new cards. It’s increasingly common to link deck-building to other game mechanics, as Dune: Imperium does, in which case the resource to buy cards may come from one of those other game elements. Either way you’ll get more and more powerful cards as the game progresses and, often, there will be ways to get rid of your weaker starting cards, too, linking the strategy and tactics of deck construction in new and interesting ways.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re a fan of deck-building in both senses, you might also want to check out <a href="https://zdcs.link/8BVZ8?object_uuid=aaf7ba4e-1b6f-4b88-85fa-863291be3836&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Millennium Blades</a>, which uses the deck-building genre to simulate the process of building a collectible card game collection and using it to build decks. It works surprisingly well, is full of fun pop culture references, and features literal wads of paper money to spend. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you like these, be sure to check out of picks for the overall <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time">best board games</a> and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-game-deals">best board game deals</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-multiplayer-how-does-it-work/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Schedule 1 is taking the world by storm, topping the charts on Steam and pulling in hundreds of thousands of players. It’s a shock hit that has come out of nowhere, and it’s dominating the gaming world despite having a bizarre theme. In this guide, we’re looking at whether Schedule 1 is multiplayer, and <strong>if it is</strong>, we’ll break down how to play with friends.</p>



<p>If you’ve been trying to play Schedule 1 co-op, read on to find out how it all works.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-co-op-in-schedule-1">How to Play Co-Op in Schedule 1</h2>



<p><strong>If you want to play Schedule 1 with your friends, you’re in luck – you can do so in both the free demo and the paid version of the game</strong>. To invite friends to your game, you’ll need to open the ‘Lobby’ menu that can be found in the top-right corner of the game scene. From there, you’ll utilise Steam’s friend mechanics to invite someone to your game.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-does-schedule-1-multiplayer-work">How Does Schedule 1 Multiplayer Work?</h2>



<p>In Schedule 1 multiplayer modes, the host has all the power.</p>



<p>They’re responsible for saving the game, and any progress you make in someone else’s co-op lobby won’t impact your single-player adventure. That means if you buy Schedule 1 and boot it up and jump straight into your friend’s game, you’ll end up unlocking <strong>nothing in your single-player game</strong>.</p>



<p>You won’t even have a save file.</p>



<p>If you’ve already kickstarted a solo venture, you won’t be able to invite any friends to revel in your drug manufacturing madness.</p>



<p>It gets a little trickier when it comes to finances, too. Every dollar you earn and bank with your friends in Schedule 1 multiplayer is added to a collective pot – but the cash in your pocket is <strong>yours alone</strong>. Also, items can’t be shared between players unless they’re placed in storage.</p>



<p>Put simply, you need to put something down before another player can pick it up.</p>



<p>Oh, and you can only have a maximum of four players in both the demo and the paid version of Schedule 1.</p>



<p>That’s effectively everything you need to know about Schedule 1 multiplayer – have fun making drugs together!</p>

<p>"You just know Fortnite is next," Richtman wrote in the deleted tweet. "There was already talk of a Fortnite movie, but some studios passed on it. That’s obviously gonna change now."</p>
<p>Sweeney shot down the speculation with a succinct "False".</p> <div>

<p>Despite trying to clarify which specific part of the statement was incorrect, at the time of writing, Sweeney has yet to respond to Richtman's follow-up tweet (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/epic-games-ceo-fortnite-movie-response-video-game-adaptations/">TheGamer</a>).</p>
<p>Sweeney wouldn't be blamed for considering it, though; earlier today, we reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-opens-with-biggest-us-domestic-opening-weekend-ever-for-a-video-game-adaptation">A Minecraft Movie has generated $301m worldwide</a> - that's £233m - on its opening weekend. That's the biggest US domestic debut of any video game movie adaptation ever, with an opening weekend of $157m (£121.5m).</p>

<p>Whilst characters from The Walking Dead TV show such as Rick, Michonne and Daryl have previously popped up in Fortnite as player skins, this latest crossover with Robert Kirkman's zombie franchise will add antihero Negan, as well as his infamous baseball bat, Lucille.

<p>The Gatekeeper expansion is also now available. This one includes five new Survivors with unique perks and five new Killers with 10 "hauntingly-detailed miniature figurines" to customise your experience.</p>
<p>As for the video game itself? Most recently, developer Behaviour Interactive confirmed Pinhead - and his Hellraiser Chapter DLC - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-by-daylights-hellraiser-dlc-is-getting-yanked-from-sale-soon">would be yanked from sale on 4th April</a>.</p>
<p>As explained in Behaviour's announcement earlier this month, he's only retreating from digital storefronts - existing owners can continue playing with him after 4th April, but no new purchases of the Hellraiser Chapter DLC would be possible. Behaviour didn't explain why the DLC was being removed from sale, but as Matt posited at the time, the answer is almost certainly licensing-related.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/rainbow-six-siege-turn-based-tactics-game-reportedly-in-development-at-ubisoft/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Earlier today, Tom Henderson revealed that Ubisoft is developing a turn-based tactics game set in the world of Rainbow Six Siege. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-turn-based-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to the report</a>, this game is expected to launch in 2026 or 2027 on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and 'possibly' Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>Henderson's sources mentioned that it will feel a lot like XCOM, albeit with more cinematic cutscenes and the like. Players will select operators with different skill sets based on the current mission. The campaign is said to last between 25 and 30 hours, though that could change since the development is still ongoing.</p>
<p>Rainbow Six Siege has been one of the most successful Ubisoft games in the last decade, and it's still being updated, so it's not surprising that the publisher is doubling down on the IP. It was also handpicked alongside Far Cry and Assassin's Creed to be handled separately as part of the new subsidiary that was <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-forms-new-subsidiary-based-on-the-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-and-franchises/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> recently with the financial help of Tencent.</p>
<p>In a couple of months, Rainbow Six Siege <a href="https://wccftech.com/rainbow-6-siege-x-launches-in-june-bringing-the-biggest-evolution-in-the-games-history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will also be overhauled</a> with X, a new version featuring improved graphics and new gameplay elements such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>New destructible items</li>
<li>Smoother rappel navigation with improved controls</li>
<li>Revamped audio experience with better propagation and reverberation</li>
<li>Refreshed onboarding experience to help new players master the basics through tutorials and field training before jumping into their matches</li>
<li>A new communication wheel to easily communicate with teammates</li>
<li>An updated Pick and Ban system injects a new layer of strategy by allowing teams to react and adapt to enemy strategies. Simultaneous bans every round will speed up the process</li>
<li>R6 ShieldGuard, a unified approach to all existing anti-cheat initiatives that also introduces new technologies to protect the game, including live security updates that will occur without the need for scheduled maintenance, making it harder to create cheats</li>
<li>An improved reputation system to ensure players behave appropriately during matches</li>
</ul>

<p>"Minecraft hardly needs a film in the first place - it's already a phenomenon, a Pandora's Box, an essential formative aspect of the childhoods of millions of people around the world.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-arena-battle-pass-and-skins/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We never thought we’d see a battle pass or traditional season structure in Escape from Tarkov – and we’re kind of <strong>still not. </strong>But Escape from Tarkov: Arena, the session-based multiplayer arena shooter, is getting a battle pass system along with cosmetics and skins soon. On social media, Battlestate Games has spent the past couple of days teasing just that.</p>



<p>In a new post on Twitter, players are given a glimpse at the CQCM Mask, a favourite item amongst the game’s W-key spamming Chads, with a <strong>custom skin</strong>.</p>



<p>It starts with Arena – will it bleed into Escape from Tarkov proper?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-geared-up">Geared Up</h2>



<p>The <strong>free </strong>battle pass that’s coming to Escape from Tarkov: Arena is expected to behave exactly as you’d imagine. It’ll reward players with exclusive items, skins, and boosts in exchange for cold, hard XP grinds. The more you play, the more you’ll unlock.</p>



<p>That’s right, I said it’s <strong>free</strong>. That was something confirmed by Battlestate Games’ Nikita Buyanov two days ago.</p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov: Arena isn’t free – you need to pay for that as it’s a spin-off from the core extraction shooter title.</p>



<p>Here’s the post on social media that revealed a snippet of the CQCM skin:</p>











<p>Players are now wondering how any crossover impact will ripple throughout the wider Escape from Tarkov ecosystem. Will there be a linking function allowing users to run their skins and cosmetics in Escape from Tarkov’s extraction shooter platform? I, for one, hope so. I’ve wanted to customise my gear more in Tarkov for the longest time.</p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov uses a ‘wipe’ pattern that typically involves resetting the game once every six months. That could easily pivot to a season structure equipped with a battle pass of sorts, but it would need BSG to pack it with content for it to be interesting. Given that it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/months-add-escape-from-tarkov-gun/">takes months to add a single gun</a> to the game, that’s a <strong>huge </strong>ask that probably won’t be delivered.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98a-minecraft-movie%E2%80%99-made-301-million-during-its-opening-weekend.1156581/</guid>

<p>‘A Minecraft Movie’ has now become the biggest-ever opening weekend for a video game movie with a staggering $301 million.</p>



<p>The movie completely shattered analysts predictions, who forecasted that movie would only generate $70-$80 million domestically in its opening weekend – A Minecraft Movie hit $157 million opening domestically and $144 million overseas for a global start of $301 million.</p>



<p>Domestically, at $157 million for its opening weekend now puts A Minecraft Movie as the biggest day one and weekend video game adaption, passing the previous record set by The Super Mario Bros. Movie at $146.4 million domestically over three days. A small caveat is that The Super Mario Bros. Movie released on a Wednesday, but even so earned $204 million by Sunday.</p>



<p>The movie has also become the highest-grossing movie during the opening weekend for any film releases in 2025 so far.</p>



<p>A Minecraft Movie’s success means that the movie has already become highly profitable, with the film having a $150 million production budget plus marketing and distribution costs, so it wouldn’t be too surprising to see if a sequel is already being planned.</p>



<p>The video game has sold over 300 million individual copies worldwide since its release in 2011, with its success attracting the eyes of Microsoft, who purchased Mojang (Minecraft’s developers) in 2014 for $2.5 billion.</p>



<p>The film stars Jack Black, Jason Momoa, Danielle Brooks, Emma Myers, Sebastian Eugene Hansen and Jennifer Coolidge.</p>



<p>It’s numbers become even more impressive after new leaks online show that a version of the film is already circulating online in its entirety, meaning that piracy has already become a huge issue for the blockbuster title.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-direct-7-biggest-surprises<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">New video game hardware announcements can become somewhat predictable. With each new generation of consoles you can expect to see near-certain staples like better graphics, faster load times, and new takes on beloved, plumber-and-turtle-oriented franchises.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even Nintendo, which has done this consistently across several generations, from the N64 analog controller, tiny GameCube discs, wacky Wii motion controls and Virtual Console, the Wii U tablet screen, and the Switch’s built-in portability, has delivered these improvements with the Switch 2. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But being Nintendo, the company again unveiled a few genuine shockers during the Switch 2 Direct.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">It's 2025 and we finally get online play.</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">When I was four years old in 1983, my babysitter used to roll footballs at me like Donkey Kong rolling barrels at Mario. I would jump over them, making a Donkey Kong sound effect in the air, then grab a toy hammer and smash them like Mario. That’s how long I’ve been a Nintendo fan. So I say this from a place of long-suffering experience: it’s going to be impossible to talk about this awesome reveal without revealing a little loving bitterness. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo, as we all know, does not really play online well. Satellaview and Metroid Prime: Hunters aside, Nintendo has barely scraped the surface of what’s possible with a unified multiplayer platform like those created by Sony and Xbox. It’s never as easy to find and talk with friends on a Nintendo platform. Even the Switch required a separate app for voice chat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shockingly, change appears to be here now. During the Direct, Nintendo unveiled GameChat, and it looks... really neat?! It's a four-player chat that supports noise suppression, video cameras for showing friends’ faces, and screen sharing across consoles, allowing you to keep an eye on up to four different displays inside a single screen. We know from the new Switch 2 accessibility features page that GameChat also supports text-to-voice and voice-to-text, allowing players to communicate multiple ways. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now we haven’t seen what, if any, unified matchmaking interface might tie into this just yet. But it’s already a big step, and I’m hoping it means the last nail in the coffin for the abominable friend code forever. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Miyazaki is bringing new blood exclusively to Nintendo</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">When I saw the first frames of this trailer, I thought I was seeing Bloodborne 2. The ambiance, the character design, and the environments all screamed the FROM Software house style. Thanks to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bloodborne-fans-react-to-nintendo-switch-2-exclusive-the-duskbloods"><u>Eric Van Allen at IGN</u></a>, I now know that I was watching footage from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-exclusive-the-duskbloods-7-things-we-learned-from-nintendos-interview-with-director-hidetaka-miyazaki">The Duskbloods, a multiplayer PvPvE game </a>designed by the softly-smiling monarch of video game masochism, Hidetaka Miyazaki. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I do not know where this man found time to direct a Nintendo-exclusive game. I’m starting to think that he may never leave his office nor sleep, much like one of his own confused, hollowed characters wasting away in the high tower of some gothic prison. But I’m grateful. FROM doesn’t really miss anymore, so I’m anticipating a tasty treat.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of people who need a vacation, apparently Super Smash Bros. director Masuhiro Sakurai has moved on from Smash to a new Kirby game? Did not see that coming. Get that man a nap!  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The original Kirby's Air Ride was, to put it bluntly, a pleasant-looking but aggressively unfun Kirby racer for GameCube. But Sakurai has made no secret of his deep affinity for Nintendo’s round, pink elder god, and it’s practically a certainty that a Sakurai-helmed take on the franchise will be a far more refined and enjoyable experience. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Control issues</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It was almost a throwaway moment, but the Pro Controller 2 sounds genuinely Pro this time around when Nintendo announced the Pro Controller 2 has an audio jack now, which is another feature that’s welcome about a decade later. More importantly, they’ve added two mappable extra buttons. I LOVE customizable buttons, so this tiny surprise actually tickled me pink. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">No Mario?!</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">This one genuinely shocked me. Near as I can tell, a lot of Nintendo’s Mario makers have been locked up in a secret bunker for years working on his next 3D adventure, which I assumed would be the big summer game for Switch. I was very wrong. Turns out the Odyssey team <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-first-hands-on-preview"><u>is the force behind Donkey Kong Bananza</u></a>, the captivating new 3D platformer with a focus on destructible environments. Nintendo is once again playing against expectations as it so often does, trusting hardcore fans to flock to Donkey Kong’s biggest game in generations and saving Mario for another day.  </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Switch will also launch with extensive third party support and Mario Kart World. While World looks like a system-seller, I figured it would be timed as a Christmas-window family game. Nintendo usually leans on Mario, Zelda, or both to sell to their biggest fans during a console’s first year. But Nintendo is looking at Mario Kart 8’s record sales with confidence, betting their most popular party game, alongside Bananza, will help move enough Switch 2 units to make launch a success.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Forza Horizon x Nintendo was not on my bingo card</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Open-world Mario Kart is here, whether it be for good or for ill. I’m betting on good, as the zany physics, weird vehicles, and combat mechanics of Mario Kart should lend themselves well to navigating between and across tracks battling friends and sewing chaos. The short look we got seems to indicate a continuous world a la Bowser’s Fury, but much larger and supporting myriad drivers. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">It’s very expensive</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/does-the-price-of-the-switch-2-overshadow-its-reveal">The Switch 2 costs too much.</a> I get that everything is expensive right now, as tariffs go up, the yen goes down, and American inflation reignites. But $449.99 USD is a hefty price by any standard, and Switch 2 is the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-does-switch-2s-price-compare-to-the-cost-of-other-nintendo-consoles-at-launch-spoiler-its-not-the-most-expensive">most expensive launch in Nintendo’s 40-plus US sales history</a>. In fact, Switch 2 costs $150 dollars more than its predecessor’s launch price, and is $100 dollars more than the next-most-expensive Wii U. Successful Nintendo consoles and handhelds have often relied on lower prices as a differentiator, but Switch 2 will be looking to succeed without a price advantage. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jared Petty is a former IGN editor who likes writing about how wonderful and silly video games are.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/tech/643886/joystick-drift-tunneling-magnetoresistance-tmr-hall-effect-gaming-solution<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The Nintendo Switch may be remembered as much for repopularizing portable gaming as it will for a hardware issue that affected millions of gamers: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/31/23571821/nintendo-switch-joy-con-joystick-drift-button">joystick drift</a>.</p><p>Drifting is the most common term for an issue where joysticks detect false inputs — even when no one is touching a controller — causing unwanted movements to happen in a game. The issue also affects controllers from Sony, Microsoft, and third-party accessory makers.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/22/23566353/switch-joy-con-drift-solution-nintendo-gulikit">Hall effect sensors</a> emerged a few years ago as a potential solution to the problem, but there’s an even better option out there that’s easier to retrofit into existing controller designs. That solution is tunneling magnetoresistance, or TMR, a technology that revolutionized hard drives two decades ago using quantum mechanics and magnets.</p><p>Like Hall effect sensors, TMR sensors avoid the fundamental problem with more traditional joysticks: their sensors wear down as a matter of their design. The controllers that ship with the last few Xbox consoles, the PS4 and PS5, and the Switch are all built around sensors like this — potentiometers, a component that can be used to change or measure electrical resistance.</p><div><p>Solid objects rubbing against each other isn’t an ideal approach to longevity</p></div><p>As <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/48944/heres-why-ps5-joysticks-drift-and-why-theyll-only-get-worse">iFixit explained in 2021</a>, inside the two potentiometers that are used to detect up-and-down and side-to-side movements in each joystick is a semicircular strip of carbon film with terminals at each end that pass an electrical current through it. As the joystick is moved, a component called a wiper slides back and forth along this strip, measuring the voltage where it makes contact. Since the voltage predictably changes across the length of the strip, the wiper’s voltage measurements can be used to accurately measure the movements of a joystick.</p><p>But solid objects rubbing against each other isn’t an ideal approach to longevity. That strip of carbon film inside a joystick’s potentiometer can wear down over time, affecting the flow of current and the accuracy of voltage measurements. Dirt on the film, either from moving components wearing down or dust and food crumbs finding their way inside a controller, can also contribute to inaccurate measurement and drift.</p><p>That’s why controller manufacturers are now turning to sensors that don’t rely on components rubbing together: Hall effect and TMR, both of which rely on magnetism instead. As <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Wiki/Hall-Effect_Joysticks">iFixit explains</a>, Hall effect joysticks replace resistive strips and wipers with magnets and sensors that never make contact, using a phenomenon first discovered by Edwin Hall in 1879.</p><p>Inside a Hall effect sensor is a conductive material called a “Hall element” that has an electrical current flowing through it. Normally, electrons flow straight through this conductor, but the presence of a magnetic field can interfere and divert the electrons to either side, like an invisible obstacle diverting the flow of water in a stream. As the magnet attached to the joystick moves closer and farther away, the Hall effect sensor measures the resulting voltage changes in the conductor. Those measurements are translated into movements in a game with more accuracy and reliability than you get with potentiometers, and without any wear and tear.</p><p>Hall effect sensors have been in use for over 50 years — and were even used by Sega in the Saturn 3D and Dreamcast’s controllers that debuted in the mid-’90s. GuliKit repopularized the use of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/25/24279435/8bitdo-ultimate-mobile-gaming-controller-android-hall-effect">Hall effect sensors in gaming hardware</a> after debuting a controller with it at E3 2021. But they’re still not widely used in gaming hardware because potentiometer-based joysticks are cheaper to manufacture. They also have higher power demands, which is something controller manufacturers need to account for.</p><div><p>What makes the TMR effect useful in electronics isn’t the tunneling itself</p></div><p>The solution for that may be TMR sensors, which come out of more recent discoveries. In 1988, physicists Albert Fert and Peter Grünberg independently discovered a phenomenon called the giant magnetoresistance effect (GMR), which earned them both the Nobel Prize for physics in 2007. They found that the presence of a magnetic field applied to ultra-thin films made up of a conductor — such as copper or aluminum just a few nanometers thick — sandwiched between two magnetic materials would affect the direction of spin of electrons and their ability to easily flow from one side of the film to the other.</p><p>“If you put two magnets right next to each other… very close to each other with a spacer material, if the magnets on this one have a spin A and the same spin is on the other one, it’s easy for the electrons to move to the next one. But if the other one has a misaligned spin… the electrons want to move, but there’s no easy way to move the other electrons as well, and that causes a change of resistance,” Riyan Mendonsa, senior staff engineer at Seagate, explained to <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>TMR works in a very similar way to GMR. The presence of a magnetic field aligns the spin direction of electrons, making it easier for them to flow from one side to the other. But while GMR uses a conductive material sandwiched between two magnetic layers, TMR, counterintuitively, uses an insulating material that acts as a deliberate barrier.</p><p>To flow from one side of the film to the other, electrons rely on a quantum mechanical phenomenon called quantum tunneling to pass through that in-between insulator. The idea of particles passing through a barrier they shouldn’t be able to is not easy to wrap your head around, but it can happen when certain materials — such as aluminum or magnesium oxide — are just a few atoms thick. And thanks to physicists like Erwin Schrödinger, the phenomenon isn’t a complete mystery. We have equations that can accurately predict when it will occur.</p><p>What makes the TMR effect useful in electronics isn’t the tunneling itself. It’s that adding and removing a magnetic field produces a measurable change in resistance. For years, hard drives relied on read heads with a design similar to the wire coils used in speakers and microphones, according to Mendonsa. In 2005, Seagate adopted TMR technology in read heads, which could not only be made much smaller but also were far more sensitive at detecting the presence of a magnetic field.</p><div><p>“TMR sensors generally have higher sensitivity and more linear response compared to Hall effect sensors.”</p></div><p>This allowed the magnetic bits on hard drives to also be made much smaller, dramatically increasing the density and storage capacities of 2.5-inch drives to 120GB. Various forms of TMR technology are expected to still be used in hard drive manufacturing for years to come.</p><p>Although the underlying science is different, Hall effect and TMR sensors can both be used to detect a joystick’s movements through the use of non-contact magnets, but TMR sensors have some key advantages.</p><p>“TMR sensors generally have higher sensitivity and more linear response compared to Hall effect sensors,” says Jack He, GuliKit’s business director. That could allow for the use of smaller magnets, making TMR joysticks easier to manufacture. But leveraging the higher sensitivity for improved joystick accuracy will depend on manufacturers and the hardware they use. “The resolution mainly depends on the sampling precision of the backend MCU, and is not closely related to the joystick itself,” says He.</p><p>Compared to Hall effect sensors, TMR sensors typically have lower power consumption, but the advantage there isn’t improved battery life. “The original design of Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo game controllers uses traditional resistive film joystick technology with a constant power supply design, with a power capacity limited to about 1 mA,” He says. Hall sensors can consume anywhere from 0.5mA to up to 2mA of power, while TMR sensors only consume between 0.1mA and 0.3mA. This allows joysticks with TMR sensors to be installed on current controller hardware “as a perfect 1:1 replacement without any other circuit modifications.” That could help speed up adoption and bring down the price of the technology by simplifying manufacturing.</p><p>TMR sensors also offer more performance stability over a wider temperature range — an advantage that’s especially useful for a product often being gripped by warm hands for several hours.</p><div><p>Although the TMR technology hasn’t yet been adopted by companies like Nintendo, Microsoft, and Sony, there are several third-party manufacturers already selling gamepads with TMR joysticks, including <a href="https://www.pbtails.com/collections/crush-controller">PB Tails’ Crush controller</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/8/24262029/gamesir-tarantula-pro-controller-switch-pc-ios-android-steam">GameSir’s Tarantula Pro</a>, and 8BitDo, which uses it in its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/619229/8bitdo-ultimate-2-wireless-controller-tmr-anti-drift-joysticks">new Ultimate 2 controller</a>. In 2024, GuliKit was the first company to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/13/24177912/gulikit-hall-effect-dualsense-dualshock-4-xbox-series-switch-joystick">release upgrade kits bringing the TMR technology</a> to PS5, PS4, Xbox, and Switch controllers.</p></div><p>But it will still be a few years for TMR technology to become mainstream in gaming hardware. “TMR sensors are often more expensive than traditional Hall effect sensors, especially in smaller volumes,” He points out. “However, as TMR technology matures, the cost difference is expected to decrease.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-update/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Schedule 1’s sole developer, Tyler, has said that the next update for Schedule 1 is scheduled to go live tomorrow.</p>



<p>In an update on X, Tyler said that the “next update is almost ready to go” and is set to be fully released on Monday. Its said that the next update in Schedule 1 will include boutique store, a pawnshop, wall decorations, and “some other fancy stuff.”</p>



<p>However, Tyler’s most recent update (which came at the time of writing) said that the v0.3.4 open beta is “taking a bit longer than expected”, and will release first thing in the morning. For those unaware, Tyler is from Australia, so players should expect the BETA update to come sometime in the afternoon for east coast players and later at night for those in the UK.</p>



<p>Schedule 1 has proven to be a massive success for the games single developer, going on to achieve <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-is-a-sleeper-indie-hit-dominating-steam-with-nearly-half-a-million-concurrent-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">414,000 concurrent players</a>, with that number likely to be smashed later today.</p>



<p>It’s success hasn’t come without its issues, though, as the developer is now reportedly <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-being-investigated-for-ip-copyright-infringement-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">facing IP copyright issues and is currently being investigated for infringement</a>. As for what those issues are remains to be seen, but the developer is yet to comment on the matter.</p>



<p>Evidence on the investigation surfaced on the website&nbsp;<a href="https://biznes.pap.pl/wiadomosci/firmy/movie-games-sa-172025-podjecie-decyzji-o-rozpoczeciu-dochodzenia-wzgledem-tworcow" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">papbiznes,</a>&nbsp;featuring a document entitled: “MOVIE GAMES SA (17/2025) Decision to commence investigation against the creators of the Schedule 1 production for claims regarding the infringement of the Issuer’s IP and related to committing an act of unfair competition against it.”</p>



<p>Are you excited for the next Schedule 1 update? Have you played the game? Let me know what you think in the comments or on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/reasons-why-fallout-76-is-good-now/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fallout 76 was released in 2018 to a paltry reception. It was a shell of a game, boasting a bleak open-world environment (even for an apocalyptic game), and ultimately, Bethesda Game Studios had fallen short of its promises for this overly ambitious game. </p>



<p>It was an enormous change to the well-established Fallout formula to introduce an MMORPG to the scene, and five years after its launch, plenty of potential players and uninformed gamers still wonder if Fallout 76 is good now.</p>



<p>Let’s break into a snapshot list and break down the reasons why Fallout 76<em> </em><strong>is </strong>good now.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-fallout-76-good-now">Is Fallout 76 Good Now?</h2>



<p>Fallout 76 has experienced a lengthy turnaround that has lasted half a decade, and it just keeps on going today. With countless changes having been made to the platform and dozens of updates having been applied, it’s not the same game that it was when it was released in 2018.</p>



<h3 id="h-1-it-has-content-now-and-npcs">1. It Has Content Now – and NPCs!</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Back in the day, Fallout 76 launched with very little content – it almost lacked a core campaign, it was devoid of any NPCs, and overall, it felt dead and bland. Now, following several sizeable updates, Fallout 76 is more of a living, breathing game, and it has had several lengthy questlines, factions, and some large settlements injected into the core of it.</p>



<p>Bethesda Game Studios has worked hard to keep up the content stream in Fallout 76, expanding the map and adding new world events, quest branches, and endgame activities, such as running caravans, fishing, and participating in C.A.M.P. build contests.</p>







<h3 id="h-2-it-takes-you-outside-the-map">2. It Takes You Outside The Map</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>It started with The Pitt – an ‘Expedition’ that takes players back to Fallout 3’s ‘The Pitt’ expansion. In this Expedition, players are charged with flying hundreds of miles in a ‘Vertibird’ to take on missions outside of the base map – and that’s a concept that Bethesda Game Studios is expanding on over time.</p>



<p>After that, the team introduced Atlantic City, another out-of-the-map expansion that players enjoyed quite nicely. It was after <strong>that </strong>that the team at BGS started expanding the core map of Appalachia, many years after the game hit the market.</p>



<h6 id="h-related-dev-diary-expands-on-fallout-atlantic-city"><strong>Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-76-dev-diary-atlantic-city/">Dev Diary Expands on Fallout: Atlantic City</a></strong></h6>



<h3 id="h-3-it-has-heaps-of-lore">3. It Has Heaps of Lore</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s a canonical title and pumped full of the lore that Fallout fans the world over both know and love. From the cryptids to the mysterious wrongdoings of Vault-Tec, and from the iconic factions to a whole new host of mutated enemies, there’s a lot of lore and backstory to soak up in Fallout 76. </p>



<p>There are several events referenced in the game that have a huge impact on the complete timeline for the series.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-it-s-still-fantastic-with-friends">4. It’s Still Fantastic With Friends</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Admittedly, there are still thousands of Fallout fans who’ll say that Fallout 76 ‘isn’t a real Fallout game’ because it’s a multiplayer-only title, but that’s the beauty of it. It’s still remarkable to be able to venture out into this post-apocalyptic, mutated landscape, fight enormous creatures, loot buildings that are hundreds of years old, and complete entire questlines with your friends by your side. </p>



<p>It’s quite a unique experience, and going by the numbers preached by Bethesda Game Studios, it’s a popular one at that.</p>







<h3 id="h-5-it-s-more-resilient">5. It’s More Resilient</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Back before Fallout 76 was given any real attention, it was rather buggy and quite a chore to play. However, thanks to BGS pouring resources into the game’s development – which has included reaching out to third-party studios to give a little support – Fallout 76 offers up a much cleaner, resilient experience today. </p>



<p>It’s a visually pleasing game that manages to edge out Fallout 4 – especially when it comes to vistas – and despite being an always-online game, it’s rare that any network issues are present.</p>



<h3 id="h-6-truthfully-it-s-all-they-ve-got">6. Truthfully, It’s All They’ve Got</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Frankly, Fallout 76 is good now because Bethesda Game Studios has probably realised that this is it for the foreseeable future. There are no other Fallout games in development, and Fallout 5 – the ‘one-pager’ game – likely won’t be released for around another decade or so. </p>



<p>This ‘live service’ model is perfect for Bethesda, as it means the firm can simply keep updating it as time goes on, adding in more content, more questlines, fresh Expeditions, and more ways to experience the post-apocalyptic wasteland with your friends.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[EXCLUSIVE – Ubisoft is Developing a Turn-Based Tactics Game Set in The Rainbow 6 Universe]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-turn-based-game/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-%E2%80%93-ubisoft-is-developing-a-turn-based-tactics-game-set-in-the-rainbow-6-universe.1156485/</guid>

<p>Ubisoft is developing a new turn-based tactics game set in the same universe as Rainbow 6 Siege.</p>



<p>It was said that the new Rainbow 6 Siege game is likely one or two years out, but is aiming to be released as a current-generation console title for the Xbox Series S|X, PlayStation 5, PC, and possibly Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>Two sources, who have knowledge of the game said that the camera is a top-down view somewhat similar to Diablo 4 or XCOM and would see the player take control of Rainbow Six Siege operators. One source said, “just watch some XCOM gameplay if you want to get an idea, I’d say it’s an updated version of that with cinematic cutscenes and so on.”</p>



<p>It’s gameplay loop was said to be similar to Rainbow 6 Siege in a lot of ways, where the players would have to select different operators based on their skills to raid buildings, save hostages, etc. </p>



<p>The total time of the game was said to be aiming for approximately 25-30 hours depending on player skill, but that could change if gameplay content, cinematics, etc. are cut, it was said.</p>



<p>Although the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-is-forming-a-new-subsidiary-with-tencent-valued-at-4-3-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">current plan for Ubisoft’s new subsidiary with Tencent</a> is currently up in the air, some staff working on the project said that it could move to the new business as it falls under the Rainbow Six IP, while others said they currently did not know.</p>



<p>Rainbow 6 is one of Ubisoft’s biggest IPs, with Rainbow Six Siege surpassing well over 50 million players. The last mainline title in the series, though, Rainbow 6 Extraction, failed to meet Ubisoft’s internal expectations and support was quietly removed.</p>



<p>What do you think of a XCOM-style Rainbow 6 game? Let me know what you think in the comments or on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
