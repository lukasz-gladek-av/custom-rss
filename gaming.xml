Glad to have been wrong on this one.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Garry's Mod (@gmodofficial) <a href="https://twitter.com/gmodofficial/status/1862466757589418048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 29, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">In September, Garry’s Mod was named the best-selling PC exclusive of all-time by the Guinness Book of Records, beating out the likes of World of Warcraft and its expansions. At the time, <a href="https://x.com/gmodofficial/status/1834185126206488932" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Newman joked</a> that he “never imagined becoming a world record holder and not be prawn cocktail crisps related.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Garry's Mod lets you play with models from Valve games developed on the Source engine, and its enduring popularity has seen it remain in steam’s top 100 most-played games list for years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In July, Newman said the “Skibidi Toilet guys” had hit him with a DMCA in a wild bit of litigious irony. But soon after, an account purporting to be Skibidi Toilet creator Alexey Gerasimov (DaFuq!?Boom) said he wasn’t behind the claim, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/garrys-modskibidi-toilet-dmca-claim-has-been-resolved-creator-garry-newman-says">Newman then told IGN that the matter had been “resolved.”</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Newman had shared the news about the Skibidi Toilet DMCA, including pasting a screenshot of the letter he was sent. The copyright holder the letter was attributed to was <a href="https://inviz.tv/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Invisible Narratives</u></a>, the film and TV production studio that’s partnering with Michael Bay <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/skibidi-toilet-film-reportedly-in-the-works-from-michael-bay"><u>on a Skibidi Toilet film</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The letter Newman posted specifically cited Skibidi Toilet characters Titan Cameraman, Titan Speakerman, and Titan TV Man, saying they were "all registered copyrights that are unique and representative of our brand." Sure enough, <a href="https://cocatalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?v1=1&amp;ti=1,1&amp;Search%5FArg=Titan%20Cameraman&amp;Search%5FCode=TALL&amp;CNT=25&amp;PID=Gr6jPAL716R1MnV450HxzbpYaFF0b&amp;SEQ=20240730153403&amp;SID=1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a public catalog search reveals</u></a> that Invisible Narratives had indeed claimed a copyright for Titan Cameraman and three other unpublished works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The letter added that “significant revenue is being generated by unauthorized Skibidi Toilet Garry's Mod games that are being advertised everywhere." The irony was not lost on Newman, who declared: “can you believe the cheek?” Skidibi Toilet, of course, is largely made with assets from Half-Life 2, and was originally created in Garry’s Mod.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/garrys-mod-removing-all-nintendo-content-from-steam-workshop-after-takedown-request">Facepunch removed all Nintendo-related content on Garry's Mod</a> - what amounted to 20 years of uploads - from Steam Workshop after receiving a takedown request from Nintendo. Newman is currently working on a successor to Garry's Mod called S&amp;box.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/loser-lane<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I just wrote about what a <a href="https://aftermath.site/parcel-corps-bike" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coward</a> (read: prudent cyclist) I am as a city biker these days. Browser-based game <a href="https://marieflanagan.com/loserlane/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Loser Lane</em></a> is reminding me why.</p><p>Creator Marie LeBlanc Flanagan <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/omarieclaire.bsky.social/post/3lbhxpml3ms2z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">calls</a> the game “a tiny protest game about the terrifying reality of biking in Toronto without bike lanes.” Using your left and right arrow keys, you navigate a little bike between parked cars, moving cars, pedestrians, mass transit vehicles, and road features. Most of my runs have ended swiftly due to car doors; longer runs have fallen victim to having to choose between hitting a pedestrian and getting taken out by mass transit, or between flipping over the back of a parked car or getting hit from behind by a car swerving out of its lane. You’re basically constantly being put in impossible situations with only moments to react, and the narrow play space really captures the way it feels to navigate busy roads with no bike infrastructure. When you die, you get a counter of how long you lasted, what killed you, and the words “Thanks Doug,” presumably a reference to Ontario premier Doug Ford.&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><p>A link in the game takes you to the contact info for current MPPs, whom you could email angrily about bike lanes if you live in Canada. (Or even if you don’t, I guess!) As a political game, it’s great: it really brings the problem to life through play, and is something I wish I could make every bike lane opponent in <a href="https://x.com/StreetsblogNYC/status/1861111490213769501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my own city</a> play.</p><p>My longest run has been 146 seconds.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-combat-will-lean-towards-resident-evil-dead-space-featuring-a-special-mechanic/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Bloober Team is currently in their redemption arc, as they managed to pull off a brilliant remake of one of the best survival horror games ever made. You can read our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/">Silent Hill 2 review from Chris Wray here</a>. Shortly after the release, Bloober Team unveiled their upcoming horror game named Cronos: The New Dawn. The reveal didn't particularly provide any in-depth looks at the gameplay. Instead, the reveal focused more on the atmosphere and the theme of the game, which shows that it looks somewhat similar to games like Resident Evil, Prey, and Dead Space.</p>
<p>In an&nbsp;<a href="https://mp1st.com/news/bloobers-cronos-the-new-dawn-combat-will-lean-towards-resident-evil-will-feature-a-special-mechanic-to-spice-things-up" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exclusive interview with MP1st</a>, Cronos: The New Dawn's Game Director, Wojciech Piejko, spoke about what to expect from the upcoming horror game and that the combat will be leaning towards that of Resident Evil and Dead Space.&nbsp;They've also said that they will be implementing a combat mechanic that will "spice" things up but didn't state what that mechanic may be. There have been many survival horror games throughout the years that have a unique combat mechanic. This has been seen in games like Dead Space, Alan Wake, and, to some degree, even Scorn.</p>
<p>In the interview, Piejko states that while there will be combat involved in the game, the team is "still storytellers at heart," saying that there will be a strong emphasis on story and atmospheric exploration. Some of the most well-known games from Bloober Team include Layers of Fear and Layers of Fear 2, which are very story-heavy. Those games are predominantly walking simulators where you pick up items and solve puzzles to reveal more of the story. However, they have also created games like Observer, Blair Witch, and The Medium. Some of their games have performed better than others, but overall, their reputation prior to the Silent Hill 2 remake wasn't fantastic.</p>
<p>During the interview, Piejko did give away a few minor details about the game and what to expect. "The Traveler relies on suit, weapons, and abilities but is still very vulnerable to the monstrosities lurking in the ruins of an old world. You will be outnumbered, and you need to be careful to stay alive. Resources are limited and the monsters hit hard."</p>
<p>While this doesn't provide much, it does give an insight into how hard they plan on leaning into the survival horror element of the game.</p>
<p>Cronos: The New Dawn is due for release in 2025 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>
<p>Will you be picking this game up?</p>

            <p>Is your Zone more Anomaly-rich than it should be? Are your corpses uncannily airborne? Do your comrades have dodgy teeth, and not in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2s-first-patch-is-coming-next-week-though-my-favourite-parts-are-still-the-imperfections">a good way</a>? Do bits of your HUD keep disappearing? Be of good cheer, for GSC Game World have released the first proper <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2-best-guns">S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2</a>: Heart Of Chornbyl update, which patches out over 650 different bugs and issues. These range from more significant problems such as crashing and progression-blockers in certain missions, to relatively negligible stuff like wonky NPC voice volume during storms.</p><!--more-->
<p>The update makes a few changes to the game’s NPC AI, but the developers note that they’re still “working on fixing the A-Life bugs, which will be addressed in future patches”. "A-Life" refers to the game’s sprawling NPC life simulation, whereby factions of wasteland survivors and packs of mutants move around and scrap over living space without the player’s intervention. That’s the idea, anyway. As Brendy wrote earlier in the week, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/%E2%80%9Dhttps://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2-devs-insist-complex-ai-simulation-of-enemy-patrols-is-in-the-game-its-just-broken%E2%80%9D">A-Life isn’t working as desired right now</a>, to the point that some players think it’s all a massive wind-up.</p>
<p>The developers have also tweaked the balance somewhat, reducing the HP of certain enemies while pumping up limbshot damage and melee swinging distance. That’s on top of tweaks to weapon and armour pricing and repair costs.</p>
<p>You can find a partial list of the many, many changes in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/4455844537830474617">this Steam post</a>. In keeping with recently invented RPS tradition, I’m going to pluck the stranger bullet points from the changelog‘s shrapnel-riddled carcass and display them below as my very own Greatest Hits. It’s not quite Baldur’s Gate 3 levels of eccentricity, but I enjoy the idea of several of the below happening simultaneously:</p><blockquote><p>

- Fixed stretched or missing limbs on humanoid corpses.
</p>
<p>
- Fixed physics issues with destructible and movable objects, including those floating in the air.
</p>
<p>
- Added missing footage to TV displays in the final cutscene.
</p>
<p>
- Fixed issue when combat music was still playing while combat was finished.
</p>
<p>
- Fixed issue when NPCs would move to A-pose or start flying after death.
</p>
<p>
- Fixed issue when NPCs could not track whether a target in cover was covered from shots, which caused them to shoot into cover.
</p>
<p>

- Fixed a bug that allows to sell items to the trader for more money that they actually cost.
</p>
<p>
- Fixed issue when Burer could drop any mission items out of the player's hands.
</p></blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/buffer-weight-stock-in-black-ops-6-guide-how-to-unlock-how-to-use-what-it-does/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Buffer Weight Stock attachment in Black Ops 6 is another in a long line of optional gear you can add to your favorite guns. It doesn’t apply to all though, and there’s confusion about how it works. This guide covers the Buffer Weight Stock unlock requirements, how to equip it, and explains its effects.</p>



<p>I yearn for the old days of CoD where attachments were limited. You relied more on your skill and the default characteristics of the weapon, rather than turning it into a bespoke beast. Nevertheless, each new Call of Duty title has a mountain of attachments available for each gun, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/">Black Ops 6</a> has added the Buffer Weight Stock to add to the possibilities.</p>



<p>This new attachment links directly to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-hit-list-event-release-date-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hit List Event</a> in Black Ops 6, and there’s plenty to dive into.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-does-the-buffer-weight-stock-attachment-do-in-black-ops-6">What Does the Buffer Weight Stock Attachment do in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Sweet recoil control. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>Black Ops 6’s Buffer Weight Stock offers <strong>huge increases to Vertical and Horizontal Recoil Control</strong>—making any respective weapon it’s attached to much more accurate.</p>



<p>Here’s the pros and cons of the attachment.</p>



<h3 id="h-pros">Pros</h3>



<ul>
<li>Vertical and Horizontal Recoil Control x3</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-cons">Cons</h3>



<ul>
<li>Aim Down Sight Speed x1</li>



<li>Aim Walking Movement Speed x1</li>
</ul>



<p>Stock attachments usually help ADS, hip-fire spread, and other movement stats. This makes the Buffer Weight Stock extremely unique, and along with a Barrel attachment—and other accuracy-aiding attachments—you can turn your gun into a veritable laser beam.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-buffer-weight-stock-attachment-in-black-ops-6">How to Unlock Buffer Weight Stock Attachment in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p><strong>The Buffer Weight Stock automatically unlocked</strong> once Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 players collectively <strong>reached 8 billion Community Eliminations in the Hit List Event.</strong></p>



<p>The Hist List Event is the first proper event of Black Ops 6. A bunch of rewards and bonuses await those who take part. The super-secret <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-the-veteran-perk-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Veteran Perk</a> is one, and the Buffer Weight Stock is another.</p>



<p>Here’s a quick look at the scoring system, and what everyone needed to do to reach 8 billion community Eliminations:</p>



<ul>
<li>A Black Ops 6 multiplayer kill counts equals one Elimination.</li>



<li>Five Black Ops 6 Zombies kills equals one Elimination.</li>



<li>One Warzone kill equals five Eliminations.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-how-to-equip-buffer-weight-stock-attachment-in-black-ops-6">How to Equip Buffer Weight Stock Attachment in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>Only three guns in Black Ops 6 are compatible with the Buffer Weight Stock: The <strong>XM4 Assault Rifle</strong>, <strong>XMG Light-Machine Gun</strong>, and <strong>DM-10 Marksman Rifle</strong>.</p>



<p>Here’s a quick guide on how to add it to your gun:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the Black Ops 6 multiplayer menu screen.</li>



<li>Scroll across to the <strong>Weapons </strong>tab.</li>



<li>Press on <strong>Loadouts</strong>.</li>



<li>Choose the loadout you want to use the Buffer Weight Stock attachment with.</li>



<li>Select the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-xm4-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/">XM4</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-xmg-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XMG</a>, or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-dm-10-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DM-10</a> as your primary weapon.</li>



<li>Click on the weapon’s <strong>Gunsmith</strong> option.</li>



<li>Scroll across to <strong>Stock </strong>and press on it.</li>



<li>Finally, go down the list until you get to Buffer Weight Stock and click on it to equip it!</li>
</ol>

		<p>Slow Game Club has opened its doors today, and it is a brand new subscription venture set up by Into Games. Unlike other subscription services, Slow Game Club is more like a book club and will provide subscribers with one new game a month, plus access to a Discord channel to discuss the games, and a video podcast where the developers of each month’s game will talk about its development.</p>
<p><iframe title="Slow Game Club Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZcQh2SZYRS0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Slow Game Club will have a limit on the number of memberships available, with Into Games confirming that there will only ever be a maximum of 1500 subscribers to the service. Into Games is a non-profit organisation with all the subscription fees going back into helping young people from low income backgrounds to build a career within the games industry. There are two membership types up for sale. The first is the Noir &amp; Mystery Annual sub, which will give access to the 12 games for 2025, access to the Discord, the developer podcasts, and the bonus game of The Holy Gosh Darn. This is discounted to £29.99, but the regular price is £44.99. The Noir &amp; Mystery Gift bundle includes all of the features of the annual sub, plus a Slow Game Club tote bag and Christmas card. This is currently priced at £49.99 with a regular price of £49.99.</p>
<p>All of the games that will be part of the Slow Game Club Noir &amp; Mystery package will have a RRP of £19.99 and a 70% or more review rating. All games will only be redeemable through Steam. Into Games has also stated that if a game you receive is one you already own, there will be no refunds but you are free to gift the code to someone else. The keys will always be sent on the first of the month via email, except for January’s which will be sent on the 3rd of January.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-player-count-5m</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-player-count-hits-5m.1048224/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-player-count-5m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Focus Entertainment has announced that the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>player count has hit a pretty impressive milestone just under three months after the game's initial launch.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/Focus_entmt/status/1862442675590377854" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post on social media platform X</a>, Focus says that&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>has attracted five million players since its release on September 9th. The studio specifically hasn't framed this number as sales, so it's possible it includes those who are streaming the game as part of subscription services like GeForce Now.</p>

<p>Still, five million players is pretty solid, and it's likely the bulk of that number is players who've bought the game, so Focus and Saber can rest assured that they've kept the legacy of original&nbsp;<em>Space Marine&nbsp;</em>developer Relic Entertainment (which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sega-relic-entertainment-layoffs" rel="nofollow">recently went independent</a>) intact.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-player-count-fight.jpg?itok=GRYEJTDP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-player-count-fight.jpg?itok=-T3M2HQp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>proves there's still an audience for good old-fashioned games.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>was originally announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-announcement-from-game-awards-2021" rel="nofollow">during the 2021 Game Awards ceremony</a>, alongside the likes of Bokeh Game Studio's&nbsp;<em>Slitterhead&nbsp;</em>and Remedy's&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2</em>.</p>

<p>It sees original game protagonist Captain Titus making a return, although this time, he's not battling the greenskin hordes; instead, he's fighting Tyranids, as well as Chaos Space Marines.</p>

<p>Story-wise, the game sees Titus disgraced following the events of the original game. After serving his penance, Titus is admitted back into the Ultramarines chapter, where he's tasked with exterminating a Tyranid infestation on the planet of Kadaku.</p>




<p>In gameplay terms,&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>&nbsp;is, much like its predecessor, a third-person shooter that emphasises both ranged and melee combat. Titus has access to a variety of&nbsp;lore-faithful weapons, including the all-important bolter, as well as a chainsword and a range of explosives.</p>

<p>Alongside its single-player campaign (which can also be enjoyed in co-op),&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>also offers a co-op Operations mission mode and PvP multiplayer, and Focus and Saber have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-roadmap" rel="nofollow">pledged to update the game regularly with new content</a>. What's more, these updates will <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-marine-2-no-microtransactions" rel="nofollow">never take the form of microtransactions</a>.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2183900/Warhammer_40000_Space_Marine_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/warhammer-40-000-space-marine-2/9n9pczwhvp2l" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review" rel="nofollow">check out my review here</a> to find out whether Titus' second adventure is a fitting tribute to his glorious Emperor.</p>

            <p>
Six weeks after Microsoft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-pulls-11-xbox-game-pass-trial-ahead-of-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-release">yanked its £1/$1 Game Pass trial</a> in the run-up to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>'s release, the deal has now been reinstated as part of the company's Black Friday and Cyber Monday promotions - but only for PC.
</p>
<p>
As was the case prior to the offer's removal, that £1/$1 <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-gb/xbox-game-pass">provides 14 days</a> to explore PC Game Pass' catalogue (sadly, Microsoft isn't reverting to the month-long variant <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-11-xbox-game-pass-offer-cut-from-a-month-to-14-days">last seen in August 2023</a>). After that, trial members will be automatically signed up to a recurring monthly subscription unless they disable auto-renewal ahead of time.
</p>
<p>
Microsoft's next big first-party release, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-developers-super-thrilled-its-headed-to-playstation">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, arrives on 9th December, meaning it'll be available to play as part of PC Game Pass' newly revived trial. Console players, however, will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-confirms-big-changes-for-xbox-game-pass-ditching-day-one-releases-for-basic-tier">need to pay full whack for Xbox Games Pass Ultimate</a> if they want to play via subscription on launch day.

<p>
The PC Game Pass trial is one of a number of discounts Microsoft has announced as part of its Black Friday/Cyber Monday promotion. It's also knocking <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/d/xbox-series-s/942j774tp9jn?icid=Cat-Xbox-CC1-XSS512GB-White-P93113-Holiday25-BF25&amp;activetab=pivot:overviewtab">£50 off the 512GB Xbox Series S</a> and Xbox Series S Family &amp; Friends bundle, and there's <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/d/xbox-series-x-certified-refurbished/8zj26xj5cr3q?icid=Cat-Xbox-CC3-XSXBSKU-P92988-Holiday25-BF25&amp;activetab=pivot:overviewtab">£40 off refurbished consoles</a> too.
</p><p>
Additionally, there's 20 percent of a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/store/collections/xboxcontrollers?icid=Cat-Xbox-CC2-XWLC-P93114-Holiday25-BF25">selection of Xbox controllers</a> - including the Sky Cipher and Ghost Cipher variants - plus <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/d/xbox-series-x-console-wraps/8x08lwws1qh7">50 percent off the Xbox Series X Mineral Camo wrap</a> if you happen to live in a coral reef and are looking to try and disguise your machine.
</p>
<p>
Finally, those searching for something to play on their gently discounted new consoles can get "up to" 55 percent off a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/store/deals/games/xbox?icid=Cat-Xbox-CC6-XboxDigitalGames-DGS-Holiday25-BF25">variety of digital games on the Microsoft Store</a>. Mostly, these are older, lesser-known indies, but you'll find a couple of Like a Dragon titles in their too.
</p>
<p>
Microsoft notes its hardware offers will come to an end on 2nd December, but it sounds like the PC Game Pass trial will be sticking around for longer.

            <p>Back when Digital Extremes were largely known for collaborating with Epic Games on the Unreal Tournament series, they made a little game called Dark Sector. Released in 2008, it's part of the fine tradition of post-Gears double-A actioners that basically consist of taking a gruff man, throwing him into a world of grit, gravel and burning oil drums, and handing him a murderous gimmick. Dark Sector's gimmick was the glaive, a pointy boomerang you could use to scoop up objects, solve puzzles, and kill stuff in third-person view.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The result? A pretty forgettable video game. This is the first time anybody at Rock Paper Shotgun has ever posted specifically about Dark Sector, in fact. But Dark Sector's stature, if not its quality, has swelled in hindsight - for it's sort of the 'original version' of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warframe">Warframe</a>, the absurdly over-dressed free-to-play shooter that hopefully needs no introduction. If you're a Warframer who's up for a roady-run down memory lane, Digital Extremes are <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/29900/Dark_Sector/">currently giving Dark Sector away on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Dark Sector takes place in an approximately real-world, present-day setting, albeit one full of "Technocyte" bioweapons, but it was once envisaged as a sci-fi, outer-space affair in which you'd play a character with an exotic mechsuit.</p>
<p>Digital Extremes eventually dialled the sci-fi elements back to make the story more relatable to players of the era - this was the mid-noughties, don't forget, when every game had to vaguely resemble a less-good Bruce Willis film. But after releasing Dark Sector, they dug up their original notes and spun them out into the concept for Warframe. There are a few reverential nods to Dark Sector in the latter, including a fancier species of glaive.</p><p>If you're enticed by Dark Sector's sheer OK-ness, you'll want to get your skates on. It's free only till Saturday November 30th at 9am PT, 12pm ET, 5pm GMT and 6pm CET. The thinking behind the discount is to celebrate Warframe's forthcoming 1999 expansion, which takes the story back in time. Look out for that in December. I'm personally <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/soulframe-has-the-bones-of-a-great-action-rpg-but-im-enjoying-it-partly-because-it-feels-too-late-to-enjoy-warframe#comments">more interested in Digital Extremes' fantasy RPG Soulframe right now than Warframe</a>, largely because after 10 years of updates, Warframe feels too knotty to get my head around.</p>
<p>If you're unconvinced by Dark Sector, even at the low, low price of nada multiplied by nothing, I have a bonus ancient Digital Extremes game to share - The Darkness 2, which <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/67370/The_Darkness_II/">is currently 80% off</a>. This one's a sequel to the Starbreeze game about the trenchcoat gangster with snake hands, and it's actually quite decent - decent enough to make Alec Meer's (RPS in peace) old <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-average-action-games-on-pc">Celebration Of Perfectly Average Action Games</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The release date of the upcoming Intel Battlemage graphics cards has seemingly been leaked. According to <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/exclusive-intel-arc-battlemage-to-launch-december-12th" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VideoCardz</a>, the first set of next-gen GPUs from Intel are set to release on December 12.</p>



<p>The date would back up the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/intel-battlemage-gpu-to-be-announced-next-month-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent rumors of a reveal</a> coming before the end of the year.</p>



<p>Videocardz’s report claims that the announcement of Intel Battlemage will happen on December 3. The first launch of the Limited Edition GPU along with first reviews will happen on December 12. That will be quickly followed by board partner reviews on December  13.</p>



<p>As far as what graphics cards are releasing, it’s expected to first be the Intel Arc B580 and B570. Over the last few weeks, specs for the Intel Arc B580 have regularly leaked out through various means. The GPU is expected to feature 20 Xe2 cores with a 2.8 GHz clock speed and 12GB GDDR6 VRAM. The Arc B570, on the other hand, has been relatively unknown aside from an expected core count of roughly 18 Xe2 cores. </p>



<p>While the Arc B580 and B570 are expected to be the mid-range offerings from Intel this generation, there’s been no mention of a lower-end or higher-end model from the company. Should those exist, they could either be revealed during the December 3rd announcement, or during a separate reveal altogether.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Intel for comment on the Battlemage release date claims. As of publishing, no response has been received. </p>

            <p>Yet another <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> Ultimate Raid world first challenge has been scuppered by cheaters, who were busted due to a single pixel.</p>
<p>Ultimate Raids are the toughest missions in the MMORPG, with many groups competing to be the first to complete them in an unofficial, community-led challenge. The recent patch 7.1 added another Ultimate Raid, Futures Rewritten, which became the third in a row to be impacted by scandalous cheaters.</p>
<p>The winning team was<a href="https://x.com/FrostyMog/status/1862341016126124204"> GRIND</a>, as shared by MogTalk creator and World Race tracker Frosty, at least initially. It soon transpired the team had been using a cheat hack, which was spotted due to a single pixel.</p>

<p>The incriminating pixel, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/final-fantasy/final-fantasy-14-world-first-raiders-busted-immediately-for-cheating-thanks-to-a-single-pixel-in-a-screenshot-making-it-the-3rd-scuffed-ultimate-race-in-a-row/">PC Gamer</a> explained, is indicative of the Pixel Perfect Plus plugin, which shows a character's exact hitbox. That's particularly useful when dodging AoE attacks in an Ultimate Raid, where the sheer number of attacks across battle arenas increases the difficulty dramatically.</p>
<p>Of course, third-party plugins are not allowed in Final Fantasy 14. As a result, Frosty has disqualified GRIND from the race.</p>

<p>Instead, <a href="https://x.com/FrostyMog/status/1862403138772189577">Kindred</a> has been awarded the world first clear of Future Rewritten. Frosty does note, however, that conversations must be had around the community-led challenge. Not all challengers stream their attempts (they wouldn't want others to copy), but that certainly makes it harder to police cheaters.</p><p>What's remarkable is that this is the third Ultimate Raid challenge in a row to be impacted by cheaters. Last year's world first clear of The Omega Protocol was revoked once it transpired the raid group was using third-party mods; the year before's Dragonsong's Reprise was a similar story.</p>
<p>After both of those challenges, director and producer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/naoki-yoshida">Naoki Yoshida</a> shared his disappointment at the use of third-party mods.</p>
<p>"It is extremely disappointing for me personally to see this commotion surrounding third-party tools once again in the wake of what happened with Dragonsong's Reprise (Ultimate)," he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naoki-yoshida-extremely-disappointed-in-final-fantasy-14-mod-use">wrote last year</a>. "As the individual who is entrusted with full supervision over Final Fantasy 14, it is my responsibility to enact countermeasures and police the use of these tools, as well as educate people to not use these types of third-party tools - this is especially unfortunate when I, as a gamer, am cheering on everyone who is learning this content by trial and error and putting in the effort to clear."</p>
<p>No such statement has yet been made following this year's controversy.</p>
<p>Back in 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-cracks-down-on-final-fantasy-14-mods-as-director-promises-to-enhance-hud">Yoshida said the Final Fantasy 14 team</a> would "review the most prominent tools, and in order to discourage their use, endeavour to enhance the functionality of the HUD". And yet two years on, the use of these tools prevails.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tencents-light-of-motiram-has-strong-we-have-horizon-at-home-energy.1048173/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/light-of-motiram-announced-tencent-horizon<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Tencent and subsidiary Polaris Quest have announced&nbsp;<em>Light of Motiram</em>, an open-world survival-crafter coming to PC, PS5, and mobile devices sometime next year, and it bears more than a passing resemblance to a certain PlayStation franchise.</p>

<p>In a press release, Polaris Quest and Tencent describe <i>Light of Motiram&nbsp;</i>as an "open-world multiplayer survival game" set in a "lush world dominated by mechanical beasts". I'm sure that you can guess <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn" rel="nofollow">which PlayStation franchise</a> it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/horizon-forbidden-west" rel="nofollow">jostling against</a> from that description.</p>

<p>Said press release also promises a "dynamic, impactful combat system" in&nbsp;<em>Light of Motiram</em>, as well as "saga-worthy boss fights" with elemental weaknesses you'll have to exploit alongside your "mechanimal" friends.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/light-of-motiram-tencent-horizon-creatures.jpg?itok=7HTzJn3g 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/light-of-motiram-tencent-horizon-creatures.jpg?itok=Uu3FjUHb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Light of Motiram</em>'s PC and console release is on the...uh, the cards for next year.</figcaption></figure><p>It's probably worth pointing out at this stage that if you haven't figured it out already, the PlayStation franchise with which&nbsp;<em>Light of Motiram&nbsp;</em>seems to share its mechanical DNA is, of course, Guerrilla's&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>series.</p>

<p>The game's "mechanimals" are strikingly similar to&nbsp;<em>Horizon</em>'s creatures, right down to the soothing blue light that appears to represent their vision and the articulated limbs and appendages the creatures seem to have.</p>

<p>However, gameplay-wise, it seems like&nbsp;<em>Light of Motiram&nbsp;</em>will differ quite a bit from Guerrilla's series; it won't be a single-player action-adventure game with RPG elements, but a free-to-play survival-crafter with base-building and a multiplayer focus. Whether that's an improvement, I'll leave up to you to decide.</p>

<p>Polaris Quest and Tencent are promising "realistic physics simulation" in which every object in the game is subject to a physics engine, as well as weather systems you'll need to respond to in order to emerge victorious against the mechanimals and survive in&nbsp;<em>Light of Motiram</em>'s world.</p>




<p>Tencent's game will also differ in a few other key ways; you can enlist mechanimals to help you in combat and crafting, for instance, and you'll also unlock new crafting recipes as you take down bosses, so it looks like you can throw&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>into the mix as well. Jolly good!</p>

<p><em>Light of Motiram&nbsp;</em>is set to launch on PC and "console platforms" next year. Some reports based on Chinese social media&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/11/mechanimal-open-world-survival-crafting-game-light-of-motiram-announced-for-pc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">seem to indicate</a> this means PS5 only, and that the game is coming to mobile devices too, but the press release doesn't specify. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3319630/LIGHT_OF_MOTIRAM/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wishlist it on Steam right now</a> if you like.</p>

            <p>If you don't secretly spend most afternoons plotting an eventual career change to one where you're surrounded by animals, then I'm sorry, but you're just not welcome in the RPS treehouse. Today, Kiera is taking a definitive step forward in that plan: she's departing RPS for a new playthrough of life, one where the animal sliders are all cranked up to max. Join us in saying fare-thee-well below.</p><!--more-->
<p>Kiera joined the guides branch of the treehouse just over a year ago, and along with fellow new hire Jeremy she was promptly baptised in that familiar river of hot magma known as "this year's Call Of Duty". <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-2023">50-odd gun guides later</a>, she solo-led our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-tips-and-tricks">Avatar: Frontiers Of Pandora</a> guides coverage with a series of clear and carefully-written guides that made it look like she'd been here for years, not weeks. I'm planning a playthrough of Avatar soon and I'll for sure be dipping into her guides for that.</p>
<p>Then the new year came around, and thank goodness Kiera was around so she could help us tackle the googly-eyed mammoth that was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworld-tips-and-tricks">Palworld</a>. Kiera spent a brain-melting number of hours delving into that gigantic game, resurfacing only to send me a new link to another expansive guide on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworld-best-ice-pals">best Ice Pals</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworld-best-electric-pals">best Electric Pals</a>, even comprehensive lists on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworld-pal-list">where to find all 137 Pal types</a>... It can't have been easy, nor particularly fun I'd wager, but the quality of her work never wavered. And then she went through the same thing with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragons-dogma-2-walkthrough">Dragon's Dogma 2</a>, churning out excellent guides like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragons-dogma-2-romance-gifts">this one on the game's romance and affinity systems</a>.</p>
<p>The same was true for the countless updates and refreshes of older guides that Kiera took care of over these past 12 months. Everything from our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/starfield">Starfield</a> primers to our vast number of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a> guides has been improved over the past year, thanks largely to Kiera's tireless work to keep everything as up-to-date and easy to follow as possible. Juggling new releases, old update projects, and the ever-present burden of thinking up hints every day for our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wordle">Wordle</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/connections">Connections</a> guides is far from easy, but she always got it done, and she did great work every time.</p><p>Despite the workload, she also found time for some lovely bespoke pieces on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-made-the-witchy-cottage-of-my-dreams-in-tiny-glade">making a witchy cottage in Tiny Glade</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-tried-to-recreate-stray-in-lethal-company-with-disastrous-results">attempting to recreate Stray in Lethal Company</a>. It's a shame that 2024 dropped so many gigantic bombshells of work upon us, like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-best-weapons">Shadow Of The Erdtree</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-wars-outlaws-best-syndicate">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-age-veilguard-romance-options">Dragon Age: Veilguard</a>, because I'd have loved Kiera to have had more time to write more of these weird and wonderful posts throughout the year. That said, even in the midst of a stupidly busy and tumultuous year, Kiera still found time to write great guides on smaller games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palia-money-making-tips">Palia</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lightyear-frontier-carrying-capacity-upgrade">Lightyear Frontier</a>, games which we can't often cover but still deserve love and attention.</p>
<p>Please join me in saying farewell to Kiera in the comments below. We usually say that once you leave the treehouse you're dead to us, but in this case, we'll welcome her back every so often in exchange for some good doggo photos, and more pictures of exquisitely painted miniatures with large froggy posteriors.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Calling fellow trainers, the Venusaur Drop Event has landed in Pokémon TCG Pocket. We knew it was coming, and the content drop has graciously brought unreleased Promo-A cards, the chance to open more Packs, and a whole lot more—and this detailed guide covers everything you need to know.</p>



<p>The Lapras EX Drop Event in early November was a big success in Pokémon TCG Pocket. New battles were added, and we all had the chance to earn special Promo Cards—including a very viable Lapras card. As we head to the Christmas season, Pokémon TCG Pocket has dropped an early present with the Venusaur Drop Event, and we knew it was coming thanks to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-next-expansion-rumors-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">future expansion leaks</a>.</p>



<p>It has lots in common with the Lapras Drop Event but offers entirely new rewards and opportunities in Pokémon TCG Pocket. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-venusaur-drop-event-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">What is the Venusaur Drop Event in Pokémon TCG Pocket?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Let’s get these cards. Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Venusaur Drop Event is a limited-time promotion in Pokémon TCG Pocket offering new <strong>Solo Battles</strong>, <strong>rewards</strong>, and <strong>Promo-A cards</strong>, that haven’t been available until now, <strong>starting on Nov. 29</strong> and finishing on <strong>Dec. 12</strong>.</p>



<p>With the Venusaur Drop Event lasting two weeks, there’s plenty of time to get involved. FOMO shouldn’t apply here, but in any case, make sure you complete the battles and try to earn all possible rewards.</p>



<p>Keep an eye on your Event Stamina, because if you run out, <strong>you have to wait to try another battle!</strong></p>







<p>Five new Promo A cards can be gotten in Pokémon TCG Pocket: <strong>Venusaur, Greninja, Haunter, Onix, </strong>and <strong>Jigglypuff</strong>.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-promo-10-mewtwo-card-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mewtwo 10 Promo Card</a> still isn’t ready; however, you can grab these new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-promo-a-cards-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket-how-to-unlock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Promo A cards</a> for your collection.

<p>Completing Venusaur Drop Event Solo Battles rewards you with <strong>Promo Packs</strong>, <strong>Shinedust</strong>, <strong>Shop Tickets</strong>, <strong>Event Hourglasses</strong>, <strong>Pack Hourglasses</strong>, and <strong>Wonder Hourglasses</strong>.</p>



<p>Each difficulty level in the Venusaur Drop Event grants “First-time Rewards,” “Chance Rewards,” and goodies for successfully beating Battle Tasks. Regardless of the difficulty, the Chance Rewards stay the same:</p>



<ul>
<li>1x Promo Pack A Series Vol. 2</li>

<p>That's according to the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c748ww9y9nno">BBC</a>, which said an investigation into the top 45 highest-grossing games on the Google Play store discovered just two games correctly advertised that they contained randomised in-game purchases.</p>

<p>Of the 45 investigated, 26 games were labelled in the online store as including loot boxes, 22 of which "were being actively advertised at the same time". Only two of those 22 games properly disclosed loot boxes in their advertising, with the Play Store's highest-grossing game, Monopoly Go, "among those not to mention random in-game purchases in its adverts".</p><p>"In the absence of robust regulation in gaming, it is essential for games to provide clear and transparent information about their features, allowing both parents and gamers to make informed decisions," said Dr Jane Rigbye, chief executive of Young Gamers and Gamblers Education Trust, adding the findings were "deeply concerning".</p>
<p>In a separate statement, the ASA told the BBC: "This is an ongoing area of our work, and we're closely monitoring the sector to discover the scale of compliance and act accordingly."</p>
<p>This time last year, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-games-industry-to-restrict-access-to-loot-boxes-for-children">UK games industry agreed to restrict access to in-game loot boxes for children</a> via a set of industry guidelines.</p>
<p>The industry's trade association UKIE worked with the UK government to draft 11 Industry Principles as part of "improved protections for children, young people and adults following concerns raised about loot boxes". The Principles include the need to flag the existence of loot boxes in a game prior to purchase, a clear list of the probabilities for loot box contents, and the need for an easy refund policy.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-inquisitions-final-expansion-originally-forced-you-to-blow-up-skyhold</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-age-inquisitions-final-expansion-originally-forced-you-to-blow-up-skyhold.1048134/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-inquisitions-final-expansion-originally-forced-you-to-blow-up-skyhold<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
An early plan for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-inquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a>'s climactic Trespasser expansion would have seen players forced to blow up their beloved base, Skyhold.
</p>
<p>
Skyhold is where the bulk of Inquisition is set - a towering, upgradable and expandable castle that fills up with your close companions and other followers, and acts as a hub for the Inquisitor in their fight back against Corypheus. It's the game's equivalent to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>'s Normandy, and is a big reason why many fans love the game.
</p>
<p>
Newly-posted concept art from Trespasser's early days shows Skyhold was once set to be sacrificed during the events of the expansion in dramatic style - something that would have fitted the add-on's narrative arc, perhaps, though would also have been heart-wrenching for players after 100 hours building it up.
</p>
<p>
Writing on social media, Dragon Age veteran Matt Rhodes <a href="https://x.com/mattrhodesart/status/1862140792527085614">revealed</a> that Skyhold was due to be blown up in "an earlier version of the story". 
</p>
<p>
"Sten would arrive to arrest you for meddling with magic, but Dagna has reverse engineering their explosives," Rhodes wrote. "You leave a trap for when they return, sacrificing Skyhold in the process."
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">From Inquisition’s Trespasser DLC<br>An earlier version of the story. Sten would arrive to arrest you for meddling with magic, but Dagna has reverse engineering their explosives. You leave a trap for when they return, sacrificing Skyhold in the process. <a href="https://t.co/0gTrLB4fiI">pic.twitter.com/0gTrLB4fiI</a></p>— Matt Rhodes (@mattrhodesart) <a href="https://twitter.com/mattrhodesart/status/1862140792527085614?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 28, 2024</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
Long-term Dragon Age fans will remember Qunari warrior Sten from earlier games. Ultimately, he did not appear in Inquisition or Trespasser at all.
</p>
<p>
At a guess, it sounds like this might have happened at the start of Trespasser, which ultimately still does not feature Skyhold. Instead, it begins with the action moved elsewhere from the off.
</p>
<p>
The launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> has brought back a wave of nostalgia from developers who worked on the series previously, with insight from franchise creator David Gaider recently shining a light on the characters of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-writer-probably-cried-harder-than-i-ever-have-in-my-life-writing-dorians-story">Dorian</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-creator-discusses-taking-on-inquisitions-cassandra-after-original-writer-left-amidst-abuse">Cassandra</a>.
</p>
<p>
Rhodes, meanwhile, previously shared concept art showing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-had-dragon-age-the-veilguards-look-nailed-10-years-ago">BioWare had the look of Dragon Age: The Veilguard's Minrathous nailed down a decade ago</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-fortnite-chapter-6-trailer-leaks-early-shows-off-godzilla/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new Fortnite Chapter 6 launch trailer has leaked early, and has revealed that Godzilla and some other bosses will be making their way into the incredibly popular Battle Royale. The trailer has yet to be officially released by Epic Games, but data miners did what they do best and found it within the game files, as seen on the <a href="https://x.com/Guille_GAG" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X account Guille_GAG</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fortnite Chapter 6 Official Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gwo6rD62Gsc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In this new gameplay trailer, you get to see a glimpse at some of the new skins and bosses that will be available in the upcoming Chapter. You also get to see Godzilla, who is walking around the map, according to the trailer. At the moment, it's uncertain whether Godzilla is a boss that you'll be able to take down in Fortnite, but considering that the new map is Japan-inspired, it seems likely that he will be. Some of the other bosses you get to see in the trailer include a samurai, a demon mask, and a giant turtle. Although considering how cute the giant turtle is, it's more hopeful that it's a form of transportation rather than something you have to take down.</p>
<p>Chapter 6 is going to be a pretty big deal in the Fortnite community, as it's set to revamp the game significantly. However, there are some features that are being brought back in this chapter that are familiar and have been in the game previously. This includes Samurai swords. From what little is seen in the trailer of them, it seems that they are used functionally the same as they were when they were previously in the game.</p>
<p>A Japan-inspired map isn't exactly new to Fortnite either, as there was a Japanese-themed biome in Chapter 4, and some of the architecture seen in the trailer feels very similar to the buildings in Chapter 4.</p>
<p>Moving on from similarities, Big Hero 6's Baymax will also be coming to Fortnite and will be available via the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-crew-grants-all-fortnite-passes-and-more-from-december-1/">Chapter 6 Season 1 battle pass</a>, where you'll get to do his signature 'Balalala' as an emote. There also seem to be some new Mask items that players will be able to get, as well as the ability to wall jump. This all seems very much to do with the Samurai vibe that they have going on in this new Chapter and will allow a new way to engage in combat as players will be able to climb over a wall and immediately start shooting or swinging their swords, as seen in the trailer.</p>
<p>Chapter 6 is set to launch this weekend, and it's likely we'll see some more details emerge about the upcoming Chapter in the next day or so.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[MTG's 10 Best Commander Decks of 2024]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/best-commander-decks-of-2024</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mtgs-10-best-commander-decks-of-2024.1048110/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/best-commander-decks-of-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="page-content">
  
          
      
<article role="article">

  
    

  
  <div>
      <div><p>As we reach the end of 2024, it’s a perfect time to look back on the year and take stock of what <em>Magic: The Gathering </em>products have released throughout the year. Here, we’ll be taking a look at the best Commander decks that Wizards of the Coast has released this year.</p>

<p>In that timeframe, there have been 24 main new Commander decks released, and we’ll be looking at the best ten commander pre-constructed decks of 2024. Evaluation will consider several factors including:</p>

<ul><li>Playability out of the box</li>
	<li>Uniqueness</li>
	<li>Value (in reprints and new cards)</li>
	<li>Best Cards (new and old)</li>
</ul><p>The list will give a brief run through of the deck, and mention five of the best cards in it, though we will be omitting general staples unless there is a reason to mention it specifically. No one needs me to tell them 10 times why <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dsc/94/sol-ring" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Sol Ring">Sol Ring </a>is good after all. Archetype staples are fine, but color or generic ones aren’t going to be mentioned here. Reprinted decks (like the <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/the-lord-of-the-rings-tales-of-middle-earth-returns-with-commander" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Lord of the Rings Commander Decks return">Lord of the Rings </a>ones), and secret lair ones, were left out of the consideration.</p>

<h3>#10 Tricky Terrain</h3>



<p>A number of decks were on the edge of the top ten here, but Tricky Terrain wins out due to the high reprint value, and that there’s some exceptional lands in the deck including combinations like <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/m3c/334/dark-depths" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Dark Depths">Dark Depths </a>and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/m3c/395/thespians-stage" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Thespian's Stage">Thespian’s Stage</a>. While the deck plays out in many ways more like a typical Simic ramp deck, there are a lot of good cards, and a number of them are worth a fair value. You can easily modify it to play more uniquely, or take advantage of the unique abilities of <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/m3c/2/omo-queen-of-vesuva" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Omo, Queen of Vesuva">Omo, Vesuvan Queen</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Best Cards</strong></p>

<ul><li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/m3c/395/thespians-stage" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Thespian's Stage">Thespian’s Stage</a>: The premiere utility copying land, Thespian’s Stage is a strong card in land focused decks by becoming an extra copy of whatever land you want.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/m3c/334/dark-depths" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Dark Depths">Dark Depths</a>: With Thespian’s Stage and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/m3c/404/vesuva" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Vesuva">Vesuva</a> in the deck, Dark Depths is even more easily able to create a <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tm3c/11/marit-lage" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Marit Lage token">20/20 Merit Lage token </a>that is indestructible and flying.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/m3c/409/yavimaya-cradle-of-growth" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Yavimaya, Cradle of Growth">Yavimaya, Cradle of Growth</a>: A high value land, which helps mana fixing a lot by turning everything into forests.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/m3c/132/planar-nexus" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Planar Nexus">Planar Nexus</a>: Able to be all non-basic land types makes Planar Nexus a perfect fit for decks that care about multiple land types.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/otc/187/avenger-of-zendikar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Avenger of Zendikar">Avenger of Zendikar</a>: Ending games for land decks since its release, Avenger of Zendikar is still a premiere end-game threat for these decks.</li>
</ul><h3>#9 Deep Clue Sea</h3>



<p>I talked about how to <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/deep-clue-sea-review-and-improvements" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" MTG Commander Deep Clue Sea Review and Improvements">upgrade Deep Clue Sea</a> earlier this year, but I think it’s one of the best preconstructed decks of the year, and the best of the Murders at Karlov Manor ones. Some very good reprints are combined with a clear plan to create clues, draw cards, and profit. It has the ability to go tall, go wide, or win outside of combat in ways that work with the core engines of the deck with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mkc/3/morska-undersea-sleuth" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Morska, Undersea Sleuth">Morska, Undersea Sleuth</a>. The value here is pretty high in reprints, but many of the new cards are narrow.</p>

<p><strong>Best Cards</strong></p>

<ul><li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/otc/251/academy-manufactor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Academy Manufactor">Academy Manufactor</a>: Great in decks that want artifact tokens, the Manufactor might be the best card for the deck overall, as it turns all your clue creation into mana and life too.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mkc/57/bennie-bracks-zoologist" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Bennie Bracks, Zoologist">Bennie Bracks, Zoologist</a>: A good valued reprint, here Bennie will be drawing you cards on your clues, so you can draw cards while you prepare to draw cards.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mkc/190/tireless-tracker" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Tireless Tracker">Tireless Tracker</a>: Turning all your land drops into clues is pretty good, but Tracker also grows, giving you another go-tall option beyond Morska, Undersea Sleuth.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mkc/213/koma-cosmos-serpent" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Koma, Cosmos Serpent">Koma, Cosmos Serpent</a>: Making strong tokens each upkeep, while being difficult to destroy is why Koma is one of the iconic cards from Kaldheim.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mkc/198/adrix-and-nev-twincasters" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Adrix and Nev, Twincasters">Adrix and Nev, Twincasters</a>: A lot of competition for this spot, but Adrix and Nev’s ability to double all tokens, while having ward makes it notable as a strong card here.</li>
</ul><h3>#8 Animated Army</h3>



<p>From Bloomburrow, comes the powerful racoon <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/blc/1/bello-bard-of-the-brambles" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Bello, Bard of the Brambles">Bello, Bard of the Brambles</a>, who leads an army of high priced non-creature artifacts and enchantments to beat down on opponents. For a deck that is reliant on its commander, there’s precious little protection for him, but a lot of good artifacts, enchantments, and big, high powered beaters like <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fdn/194/etali-primal-storm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Etali, Primal Storm">Etali</a>, and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fdn/222/ghalta-primal-hunger" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Ghalta, Primal Hunger">Ghalta, Primal Hunger </a>to beat down on your opponents. The deck plays well out of the box, but it can suffer from relying on Bello, and some amount of divided focus, with sub themes of treasure, token, and ramp.</p>

<p><strong>Best Cards:</strong></p>

<ul><li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/khm/169/esikas-chariot" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Esika's Chariot">Esika’s Chariot</a>: A great vehicle from Kaldheim, this reprint brings the Freya-inspired chariot here, where it can be crewed by creatures, or be animated by Bello.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/blc/8/wildsear-scouring-maw" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Wildsear Scouring Maw">Wildsear, Scouring Maw</a>: This is a Bello deck, but Wildsear might be the stronger card, and much as a RG big Enchantment/Artifact deck is unique, an RG Enchantress deck is too.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/blc/26/pyreswipe-hawk" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pyreswipe Hawk">Pyreswipe Hawk</a>: Another of the new cards, Pyreswipe Hawk gets bigger from your big artifacts, and if you cast big spells with it in play, you can swipe your opponent’s artifacts.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/blc/223/greater-good" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Greater Good">Greater Good</a>: A classic enchantment from Urza’s Saga, Greater Good is a welcome reprint always, and here it works well with the high powered creatures to draw cards.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/blc/242/tendershoot-dryad" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Tendershoot Dryad">Tendershoot Dryad</a>: A great token card that quickly spirals out of control with saproling counts as it adds another each turn, including your opponent’s turns.</li>
</ul><h3>#7 Endless Punishment</h3>



<p>Led by one of the most popular new commanders of the year in <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dsc/6/valgavoth-harrower-of-souls" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Valgavoth, Harrower of Souls">Valgavoth, Harrower of Souls</a>, Endless Punishment is a group slug type deck that seeks to constantly pain your opponents, and profit from it. Each turn when your opponent’s are hurt for the first time, you grow your commander and get more cards to keep on going. There’s fairly good value in Endless Punishment with good reprints and desirable new cards, and a powerful commander, as long as you know you’ll probably be public enemy number 1.</p>

<p><strong>Best Cards</strong></p>

<ul><li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dsc/144/kederekt-parasite" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Kederekt Parasite">Kederekt Parasite</a>: An <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/thb/121/underworld-dreams" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Underworld Dreams">Underworld Dreams</a> on a small creature, this little guy is a constant pain in your opponent’s sides, even if they are drawing a lot of cards.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dsc/142/gray-merchant-of-asphodel" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Gray Merchant of Asphodel">Gray Merchant of Asphodel</a>: Affectionately known as Gary, the Merchant here is a good black win con, and while this deck isn’t abusing him as many do it’s still a strong card.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dsc/158/syr-konrad-the-grim" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Syr Konrad, the Grim">Syr Konrad, The Grim</a>: Whenever a creature goes to the graveyard, Syr Konrad is spotting it and giving thin cuts to your opponents, in a way that supercharges Valgavoth.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dsc/29/star-athlete" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Star Athlete">Star Athlete</a>: One of the better new cards, as his ability to play politics, be a punisher, and be an early evasive threat are all valued.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dsc/25/suspended-sentence" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Suspended Sentence">Suspended Sentence</a>: One of the recurring suspend spells, this one in black lets you keep killing a key creature every few times, and is a nice card only found here so far.</li>
</ul><h3>#6 Miracle Worker</h3>



<p>While Valgavoth, Harrower of Souls stole the spotlight of the Duskmourn Commanders, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dsc/1/aminatou-veil-piercer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Aminatou, Veil Piercer">Aminatou, Veil Piercer </a>leads what is probably the superior deck. Playing around with miracles, getting massive discounts on big enchantments, whether cheated in via miracles or by recursion. Aminatau is strong as a commander as an enabler for her own strategy with surveil, and there are some strong reprints included.</p>

<p><strong>Best Cards</strong></p>

<ul><li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dsc/4/the-master-of-keys" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="The Master of Keys">The Master of Keys</a>: The secondary commander for the deck is also very strong, and has even seen peeks from the competitive EDH scene, as a cheap enchantment reanimator.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dsc/137/demon-of-fates-design" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Demon of Fate's Design">Demon of Fate’s Design</a>: If you end up drawing a high cost card and can’t miracle it, you can use this to let you pay life instead of its mana value attached to a strong creature.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dsc/221/inkshield" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Inkshield">Inkshield</a>: One of the strongest <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ema/167/fog" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Fog">Fog</a> variants, Inkshield turns each point of damage prevented into a 2/1 Inkling for you to counter-attack with.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dsc/283/hall-of-heliods-generosity" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Hall of Heliod’s Generosity">Hall of Heliod’s Generosity</a>: The enchantment version of <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/2xm/309/academy-ruins" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Academy Ruins">Academy Ruins</a>, this card is great here at setting up dead enchantments to be miracled into play.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dsc/138/doomwake-giant" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Doomwake Giant">Doomwake Giant</a>: One of the strongest constellation cards, Doomwake Giant for one black is almost unfair, and this giant will keep creatures well under your thumb.</li>
</ul><h3>#5 Scrappy Survivor</h3>



<p>Everyone’s favorite <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/pip/2/dogmeat-ever-loyal" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Dogmeat, Ever Loyal">post-apocalyptic dog </a>leads the Scrappy Survivor deck and its brand new <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tpip/15/junk" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Junk">Junk </a>tokens that allow you to impulse draw. This deck is all about suiting your creatures up to battle with enchantments and equipment. This theme manages to hold the deck together despite its wide variety of legendary creatures representing different parts of <em>Fallout</em> lore with their own things going on often. A low mana curve, workable theme, and solid card advantage from the command zone make it play pretty well. There’s a lot less reprint value in this deck (outside of <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/pip/202/heroic-intervention" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Heroic Intervention">Heroic Intervention</a>), but instead there’s a whole bunch of new cards, and everything has new art.</p>

<p><strong>Best Cards</strong></p>

<ul><li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/pip/14/codsworth-handy-helper" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Codsworth, Handy Helper">Codsworth, Handy Helper</a>: For white voltron type decks, Codsworth is destined to be a staple. Have him give <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/building-ultimate-captain-america-first-avenger-mtg-deck" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Building The Ultimate Captain America, First Avenger MTG Deck">Captain America some gear</a> for some cross universe synergy.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/pip/8/preston-garvey-minuteman" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Preston Garvey, Minuteman">Preston Garvey, Minuteman</a>: Done harassing you in <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/fallout-4" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Fallout 4"><em>Fallout 4 </em></a>to do your chores, Preston is here to give you lots of extra mana with your enchanted lands by untapping them.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/pip/140/pip-boy-3000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pip-Boy 3000">Pip-Boy 3000</a>: A powerful modal equipment, Pip-Boy 300 will often net you extra mana on attack, but sometimes it might grow a creature or loot a card for you.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/pip/142/silver-shroud-costume" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Silver Shroud Costume">Silver Shroud Costume</a>: A protection spell tacked onto an evasion equipment, the flash makes this a good alternative to <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dsc/257/whispersilk-cloak" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Whispersilk Cloak">Whispersilk Cloak</a>.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/pip/698/puresteel-paladin" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Puresteel Paladin">Puresteel Paladin</a>: One of the best equipment support cards, Puresteel Paladin draws cards, and makes equipping free if you have enough artifacts.</li>
</ul><h3>#4 Squirreled Away</h3>



<p>Holy Bat… I mean Squirrel Girl look at that reprint value. Squirreled Away combines a popular typal theme, with tokens and food, with a lot of really good value. A strong archetype works well to make it playable, even if the deck is sometimes a bit indecisive about how it wants to use its tokens. If you can get it for retail price, this deck is a steal valuewise.</p>

<p><strong>Best Cards:</strong></p>

<ul><li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/blc/209/chatterfang-squirrel-general" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Chitterfang, Squirrel General">Chitterfang, Squirrel General</a>: Probably better than <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/blc/2/hazel-of-the-rootbloom" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Hazel of the Rootbloom">Hazel</a> in many squirrel decks, Chitterfang is still the definitive Squirrel commander.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/blc/247/beledros-witherbloom" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Beledros Witherbloom">Beledros Witherbloom</a>: A valuable reprint that makes tokens all the time, and lets you untap your lands by using excess life that you have.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/blc/118/beastmaster-ascension" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Beastmaster Ascension">Beastmaster Ascension</a>: This is one of the best go-wide finishing cards, and included here as a way to make your creatures all super pumped, so only 3 Squirrels can kill <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/2x2/1/emrakul-the-aeons-torn" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Emrakul, the Aeons Torn">Emrakul</a>, <a href="https://cardboard-crack.com/post/79521250941/emrakul" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Cardboard Crack 15 Squirrels vs Emrakul Meme">rather than 15</a>.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/blc/20/swarmyard-massacre" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Swarmyard Massacre">Swarmyard Massacre</a>: One sided board wipes are strong, and doing it for 5 mana is extra strong.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/otc/251/academy-manufactor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Academy Manufactor">Academy Manufactor</a>: Still one of the best token makers in business, and this deck creates a decent amount of food, with this turning that into treasure and clues too.</li>
</ul><h3>#3 Hail, Caesar</h3>



<p>An aristocrats deck, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/pip/1/caesar-legions-emperor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Caesar, Legion’s Emperor ">Caesar, Legion’s Emperor</a> is a powerful commander who sacrifices his minions for more minions, cards (knowledge), or damaging opponents. The deck has many other cards that also benefit from this, or create tokens. One thing holding this deck back a bit is that there are some cards that don’t fit as cleanly as they tried to represent various characters, notably <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/pip/7/mr-house-president-and-ceo" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Mr. House, President and CEO ">Mr. House, President and CEO</a> who is a good dice roll deck leader, but doesn’t fit here.</p>

<p><strong>Best Cards:</strong></p>

<ul><li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/pip/187/pitiless-plunderer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pitiless Plunderer">Pitiless Plunderer</a>: A classic for aristocrats decks, this little guy makes you treasures whenever your stuff dies, paying you off for sending your troops to an early grave.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/pip/23/securitron-squadron" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Securitron Squadron">Securitron Squadron</a>: Squad returns from the Warhammer pre-constructed decks here letting you make copies of it, and all of them will make future tokens bigger.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/pip/210/assemble-the-legion" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Assemble the Legion">Assemble the Legion</a>: A super appropriate reprint that makes you more and more tokens each turn to overrun your opponent.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/pip/711/black-market" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Black Market">Black Market</a>: Like Pitiless Plunderer, Black Market tracks creature deaths and gives you mana, but instead of a one time payout, this enchantment gives you mana each round.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/pip/220/ruinous-ultimatum" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Ruinous Ultimatum">Ruinous Ultimatum</a>: 7 Mana, destroy all your opponents stuff. It’s very clean, simple, and powerful.</li>
</ul><h3>#2 Eldrazi Incursion</h3>



<p>From Modern Horizons 3, we bring you the second eldrazi deck of the past two years, this one led by the powerful <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/m3c/4/ulalek-fused-atrocity" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Ulalek, Fused Atrocity">Ulalek, Fused Atrocity</a>. Ulalek is very strong, and lets you double up on all your eldrazi for a low cost of two mana, while that trigger also doubles any other abilities and spells on the stack. There’s a good range of mid-range eldrazi in the deck, working with the copious amounts of ramp to get them out, and pay to copy them. The deck plays really well out of the box, although it does have some complexity with Ulalek - go with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/m3c/5/azlask-the-swelling-scourge" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Azlask, the Swelling Scourge">Azlask </a>for a more straightforward approach.</p>

<p><strong>Best Cards:</strong></p>

<ul><li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mh3/7/glaring-fleshraker" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Glaring Fleshraker">Glaring Fleshraker</a>: A cheap eldrazi, who makes <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tmh3/38/eldrazi-spawn" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Eldrazi Spawn">eldrazi spawn</a> whenever you cast a colorless spell, and pings your opponents when colorless creatures enter the battlefield.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/m3c/152/all-is-dust" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="All is Dust">All is Dust</a>: First printed back in Rise of the Eldrazi, All is Dust is still the best sweeper for colorless decks, as a 7 mana one sided board clear of almost everything.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/m3c/157/morophon-the-boundless" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Morophon, the Boundless">Morophon, the Boundless</a>: Created as a lord of whatever creature type you want to run, Morophon is also a pretty good card itself, and fits in here pretty well, making Ulalek free.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/m3c/156/endbringer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Endbringer">Endbringer</a>: A pinging, card drawing, pacifying eldritch abomination that untaps itself each turn is very strong.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/m3c/160/ugin-the-ineffable" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Ugin, the Ineffable">Ugin, the Ineffable</a>: Make your spells cost less as a planeswalker, has what is both a token and draw ability for +1, and has a flexible removal ability.</li>
</ul><h3>#1 Mutant Menace</h3>



<p>Back to the <em>Fallout </em>decks, my choice for the best commander deck of 2024 is Mutant Menace, led by <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/pip/4/the-wise-mothman" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="The Wise Mothman">The Wise Mothman</a>. Mixing a variety of counters, proliferation, graveyard play, and everything all together is for a really strong deck, with a bunch of new cards, and valuable reprints. Mothman himself is a very strong commander, and is a powerful enabler for the deck.</p>

<p><strong>Best Cards:</strong></p>

<ul><li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/pip/6/the-master-transcendent" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" The Master, Transcendent ">The Master, Transcendent</a>: While not as simply powerful as Mothman, <a href="https://techraptor.net/series/fallout" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Fallout Series Page"><em>Fallout 1</em>’</a>s final boss, The Master offers interesting combo type approaches to things.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/pip/87/watchful-radstag" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Watchful Radstag ">Watchful Radstag</a>: Don’t underestimate this seemingly innocent creature, as it serves as basically a <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dsc/197/scute-swarm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Scute Swarm ">Scute Swarm </a>for counter decks, and grow out of control quickly.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/pip/47/nuclear-fallout" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Nuclear Fallout">Nuclear Fallout</a>: A board wipe that also radiates players, it fits here extremely well and can work in a variety of decks.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/pip/37/radstorm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Radstorm">Radstorm</a>: Not at its best here, but this storm spell is powerful in the proper deck, as mass proliferation can kill&nbsp; opponents with poison or any number of things.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/pip/177/inexorable-tide" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Inexorable Tide ">Inexorable Tide</a>: One of the best proliferation enablers, this will grow your creatures and the radiation counts just as you play the game.</li>
</ul><p><br>
It’s been a fairly good year for <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> preconstructed decks, with a rich variety of decks. Share your thoughts on this year’s preconstructed decks in the comments, and if you are looking at picking up a commander deck for Christmas (for yourself or someone else) I hope this helped.</p>
