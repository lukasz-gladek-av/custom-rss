<p>Marvel Rivals has released the official trailer for their Season 1 Battle Pass, Darkhold; here’s all you need to know.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals Season 1: Eternal Night Fall is all set to release tomorrow, January 10, 2025, and ahead of that, the developers have provided players with a glimpse of this season’s battle pass. The new battle pass, Darkhold, will consist of double the Season 0’s pass content featuring 10 new skins along with other related cosmetics. The list of characters receiving new costumes in the Darkhold battle pass can be found below:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Loki – All Butcher</li>



<li>Wolverine – Blood Berserker&nbsp;</li>



<li>Rocket – Bounty Hunter&nbsp;</li>



<li>Magneto – King Magnus&nbsp;</li>



<li>Iron Man – Blood Edge Armor</li>



<li>Adam Warlock – Blood Soul</li>



<li>Scarlet Witch – Emporium Matron</li>



<li>Peni Parker – Blue Tarantula&nbsp;</li>



<li>Namor – Savage Sub-Mariner</li>



<li>Moon Knight – Blood Moon Knight&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Players already knew about the skins arriving with this battle pass as <a href="https://x.com/RivalsAssembled/status/1876765775555354662" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">RivalsAssembled</a> on X (formerly Twitter) leaked all of the Marvel Rivals Darkhold Cosmetics for Season 1 early.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s the official description for the Darkhold battle pass:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The Darkhold contains two powerful spells that have aroused interest in opposing forces: The Vampiric Verses can create creatures of the night, while the Montesi Formula can eliminate them. When Eternal Night descended upon New York, the Darkhold’s pages were scattered across Manhattan. Now, the race is on to prevent its dark power from falling into the wrong hands. Join us in the battle in Marvel Rivals and help recover the lost pages!</p>

            <p>
Six minutes of developer Splash Damage's unreleased <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/transformers-reactivate">Transformers: Reactivate</a> have leaked online following the studio's announcement it was ending development earlier this week.
</p>
<p>
Transformers: Reactivate - an online action game for up to four players, featuring some of the franchise's most iconic characters - was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/brink-developer-splash-damage-developing-transformers-reactivate">unveiled for PC and consoles</a> during The Game Awards back in 2022. Little has been seen of the title since then - and it seemed that would likely remain the case after Splash Damage this week confirmed its cancellation.
</p>
<p>
Now, however, six minutes of leaked gameplay footage has appeared on social media, shared by an <a href="https://x.com/DpzLuna/status/1877095975665242277">anonymous Transformers fan account</a>. There's no word on how the footage was acquired, but it features a combination of third-person gunplay and vehicular traversal across an unfinished, open-world style city - seemingly from a work-in-progress developer build.

Splash Damage <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splash-damage-cancels-transformers-reactivate-says-roles-at-risk-of-redundancy">announced Transformers: Reactivate's cancellation on Wednesday</a>, saying the studio would be "scaling down" in order to refocus its efforts on other projects - leaving a "number of roles" at the company "potentially at risk of redundancy" as a result.
</p><p>
"While not being able to see the game through to release is painful," it wrote in a statement, "having to say goodbye to friends and colleagues hurts even more. We're now focused on doing everything we can to support them through this tough period, just as we are committed to caring for those who will stay with us as we build a stronger Splash Damage for the future."
</p>
<p>
The studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/brink-dev-splash-damage-teases-aaa-open-world-survival-game-project-astrid">previously announced</a> it was working on a new "AAA open-world survival game", codenamed Project Astrod, in collaboration with streamers Mike "Shroud" Grzesiek and Chris "Sacriel" Ball. However, no further updates have been shared since its unveiling in March 2023.

That includes the <strong>8BitDo Ultimate</strong> controller, which has dropped to a record low $29.99 ($15 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CSP5BB7Y?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://howl.link/r6ia22zmu2c1t">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://shop.8bitdo.com/products/8bitdo-ultimate-wired-controller-for-xbox-and-windows">8BitDo</a>. The DualShock-like <strong>8BitDo Pro 2 </strong>is also on sale<strong> </strong>at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CYZKNSS1?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://shop.8bitdo.com/products/8bitdo-pro-2-wired-controller-for-xbox-%E5%A4%8D%E5%88%B6">8BitDo</a> starting at $29.99 (about $15 off), which is only $2 more than the lowest price to date.</p><div><p>The newest 8BitDo Ultimate Wired Controller for Xbox includes Hall effect analog sticks and triggers, plus two rear buttons, customizable mapping and sensitivity, and is also compatible with PC and mobile devices.</p></div><div><p>The latest 8Bitdo Pro 2 wired controller for Xbox and Windows offers a DualShock-like shape and layout with Hall effect triggers and sensors, software customization, and two mappable rear buttons.</p></div><p>8BitDo’s wired Xbox controllers have been on the market for a few years now, so even if you already have one, you may have missed the refreshed Hall effect models. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/8/22966831/8bitdo-ultimate-wired-controller-for-xbox-announced-price-release-date">The older ones</a> have ALPS-based sticks, which are commonly used in the standard controllers that ship with major consoles. They use mechanically moving parts and sensors to read the sticks’ positioning, which can eventually degrade and cause misreads to the point that your in-game characters can move even when you’re not touching the controller.</p><p>Hall effect sticks, instead, use magnetism and the sensors don’t have moving parts, and while they aren’t completely immune to eventually getting stick drift, they should last much longer. That doesn’t mean you can’t still break a controller from excessive sweaty rounds of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337409/marvel-rivals-fantastic-four-season-1-date-trailer"><em>Marvel Rivals</em></a>. The triggers on both controllers benefit from similar technology and also include dedicated vibration motors.</p><p>The 8BitDo Ultimate and 8BitDo Pro 2 offer other perks that are nice to have at this price point, too, like dual rear buttons, software-based remapping (the 8BitDo Ultimate supports on-the-fly switching between three profiles using a dedicated button), and configurable sensitivity and vibration settings. In addition to Xbox One, Series X, and Series S, you can also use the controllers on Windows PCs, Android, and iOS devices by plugging them in using the detachable USB-C cable.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p> / <span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Otherwise no price, no description, not even a glimpse of the finished product outside of the single D-pad brick. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/looks-like-legos-making-a-brick-built-nes-that-plays-ma-1844361085&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/looks-like-legos-making-a-brick-built-nes-that-plays-ma-1844361085">The last Lego Nintendo system</a></span> was the NES, which released in 2020. That set’s replica console, game cartridge, controller, and TV consisted of 2,646 bricks with a price tag of $200. I imagine the Game Boy set will be somewhat smaller and potentially cheaper as a result. After all, you can get an actual Nintendo Switch Lite that plays actual Game Boy games for $200. </p><p>Which raises another question. Will the Lego Game Boy play actual games? None of the other Lego consoles have, not the replica Atari 2600 and not the <em>Pac-Man</em> arcade machine. And actually running <em>Tetris</em> would require a screen, an emulation device of some kind, and a battery pack. So probably not. </p><p>Still, the Lego Game Boy is coming at the perfect moment to capitalize on retro handheld nostalgia.

                <p dir="ltr">Nintendo announced its next big Lego collaboration is a set based on the original Game Boy handheld. The new kit joins Lego's line of other video game system replicas like the NES and Atari.</p><p dir="ltr">Lego and Nintendo revealed the upcoming Lego Game Boy kit with <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1877400996462166302" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a short teaser trailer on X (formerly Twitter)</a>. While the Lego Game Boy's design was not fully revealed, the teaser video previewed recognizable components like the classic purple face buttons, black D-pad, and pieces of the gray case. Assuming the sizes of the teased pieces are the final design, it's looking like this new Lego display set could be roughly the same size as the original Game Boy DMG handheld.</p><p dir="ltr">The short teaser concludes with confirmation that the Lego Game Boy set will launch in October, but no specific date or pricing information was given. We'll be sure to update this post when more information is announced, including preorder availability.</p><p dir="ltr">In the meantime, you can pick up several of Lego's other Nintendo display models for adults right now, including the new Legend of Zelda Deku Tree 2-in-1 set for $300 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Legend-Zelda-Great-Deku/dp/B0DF857JZ9?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLEGO-The-Legend-of-Zelda-Great-Deku-Tree-2-in-1-77092%2F6778801956%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Flego-just-announced-an-official-nintendo-game-boy-set-releases-this-october%2F1100-6528723%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Walmart</a>.

Blizzard writes. "Undermine(d) is seeing Marksmanship lose their pet functionalities and it is instead joined in battle by a unique eagle pet that will exist outside of the game space but continue to support you in combat in a uniquely Marksmanship way."</p><p dir="ltr">Considering pets have always been a major part of the class as a whole, having them disappear entirely from Marksmanship is a big move. As for the eagle, it factors into a number of new active and passive abilities. One, Harrier's Cry, sees it descend from the sky and gives a 30% haste buff to party and raid members for 40 seconds. A passive ability, Eyes in the Sky, makes it so abilities empowered by Precise Shots have a chance for the target to be marked by the eagle, increasing Aimed Shot damage against the target.</p><p dir="ltr">Marksmanship Hunter's talent tree is, unsurprisingly, getting an almost complete overhaul. A total of 19 talents are being removed, though a few of their effects (like Pin Cushion) are being added to existing abilities like Steady Shot. Multi-shot, once a talent, will now instead be learned baseline by Marksmanship Hunters at level 10.</p><p dir="ltr">Many other talents have been adjusted, while a whole slew of new talents have been added. One new talent, Ohn'ahran Winds, gives a 25% chance when applying a Spotter's Mark to apply it to three additional enemies, while another, Double Dap, makes it so casting True Shot causes the next Aimed Shot to fire a second time or the next Rapid Fire to fire 100% additional shots during its channel. Numerous Marksmanship abilities like Aimed Shot, Rapid Fire, and Steady Shot are all receiving significant damage buffs as well.</p><p dir="ltr">The Undermine(d) update doesn't have a release date just yet, but when it does arrive, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-the-war-within-next-major-update-is-going-full-goblin-mode/1100-6527723/" data-ref-id="1100-6527723">goblin-themed update</a> will let players explore the new Undermine zone in their own customizable hot rod.

Each year, <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/01/08/california-fire-rare-climate-change-factors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unprecedented weather events</a> become significantly more precedented, and the culprit couldn’t be clearer: climate change.

Just one state over from California, they’ve spent the week putting on the <a href="https://x.com/DanaWollman/status/1876453533228454205" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dumbest possible parade</a> in generative AI’s honor.&nbsp;</p><p>The Consumer Electronics Show is taking place in Las Vegas right now, and predictably, AI is (once again) this year’s big buzzword. A quick roundup of some of the brilliant inventions that have crowded the spotlight:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEKUSMqrbzQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The <em>PUBG </em>Ally</a>, a “co-playable character” that draws on Nvidia AI NPC tech to “communicate using game-specific lingo, provide real-time strategic recommendations, find and share loot, drive vehicles, and fight other human players using the game’s extensive arsenal of weapons.” So basically, it’s a soulless, subservient husk you can play the battle royale with if you don’t have any friends. And given <a href="https://aftermath.site/ai-npcs-nvidia-unity-ubisoft-convai-inworld" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">what we’ve seen from other AI NPCs</a>, I’m sure it will work exactly as intended and definitely not lose the plot the second you push it too far.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Inworld AI, Logitech, and Nvidia’s “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24335356/virtual-ai-intelligent-streaming-assistant-inworld-streamlabs-nvidia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Intelligent Streaming Assistant</a>,” an AI cohost for livestreamers that the companies say can understand what’s happening in games and “highlight a well-timed build, provide commentary during a dramatic Victory Royale, or shoutout audience members for sending tips.” In short, it can awkwardly insert itself into the vital alchemy that streamers and chat produce together, adding a third voice where streamers have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53RoOAZXPqs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already demonstrated</a> that they don’t really want one.

		<p>The RGG Like a Dragon Direct gave us a good long look at <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii">Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</a> gameplay, showcasing the game’s various locations, combat systems (on land and on sea), crew building and more. Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, Xbox One and PC on 21st February 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="RGG Like a Dragon Direct | 1.9.25" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/viAEO_cMqfU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii really leans in on the craziness that is Goro Majima, who now takes the lead on this latest spin-off. Washing him up on the shores near Hawaii he is quickly confronted by pirates and goes off on an off-kilter adventure filled with buccaneer brawling, crew building and ship-to-ship combat.</p>
<p>On land, Goro has multiple combat styles to use in battles that might start to nudge this series into the realms of a musou. Mad Dog style will look and feel relatively familiar to the classic Yakuza series, emphasising fisticuffs and short swords with speed and agility, dodging and blocking, taking to the air, before unleashing charged moves, whirlwind slashing, building up to the ultimate Suspicious Men move, summoning shadowy doppelgangers to fight alongside you.</p>
<p>Sea Dog style then leans in on dual wielded short swords, grapple hooks, muskets and the like. You can fling the cutlasses like boomerangs, chain hook to close the gap, and blast away with pistols. Whip out guitar, violin and saxophone in a pinch to summon Dark Gods – Curse of the Man-Eating Shark, Curse of the Electrifying Jellyfish, Curse of the Sadistic Ape, Curse of the Cyclonic Avian. Crazy stuff.</p>

<p>On the seas, you’ll build up your grand galleon as you see fit and then hire a crew to man it. You can train them, deepen bonds through song, drink and adventure, and more. Of course, your ship needs to be armed to the teeth with broadside cannons, front-firing rocket launchers, lasers miniguns, walls of flame and more. Assign crewhands strategically to max out the attack and defence stats.</p>
<p>The ship combat looks like a ridiculous over-the-top modern take on Black Flag, if I’m honest, and you can crash into enemies and board rival ships to take out their captain.</p>
<p>It’s not all fighting, and you can retreat back to base at Rich Island. This is where Goro woke up with no memories of who he is, teaming up with Noah Rish and tiger cub friend Goro. Rest up here, restock supplies, rehabilitate animal friends, and more.</p>
<p>Alternatively head to other nearby islands like Madlantis, where pirate lords make their home. This is the hub for minigames with gambling, minigolf, and the Pirates’ Coliseum where you can test your crew against all comers. Nele Island is home to ex-Yakuza who’ve moved there… to help clean up nuclear waste, of all things. And there’s always Hawaii itself, as seen in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth">Infinite Wealth</a>.</p>
<p>It looks huge and completely ridiculous, and we can’t wait for this to land next month!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Beyond Citadel Review - Proclaimers and Disclaimers]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/beyond-citadel-review-proclaimers-and-disclaimers</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/beyond-citadel-review-proclaimers-and-disclaimers.1078398/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/beyond-citadel-review-proclaimers-and-disclaimers<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Get used to messing up the correct year on your documents for a while, because 2025 is hot on its heels after the true trash fire that was 2024. Still, you should always look to the start of the year to set your standards for what’s to come, and if <em>Beyond Citadel</em> is anything to go by? Well, then the year is going to get <em>weird</em>.</p>

<p>This is the latest title from solo Japanese developer Doekuramori, and the long-awaited sequel to their 2020 <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/doom-2016" rel="nofollow"><em>DOOM</em></a>-like FPS <em>The Citadel</em>. You play as “The Martyr”, humanity’s only hope against a heavenly mandate which has caused the near-extinction of Earth’s population, reducing it to a meager 144,000. After the Martyr’s brother sacrifices himself to save her from an angelic demise, she sets it upon herself to settle the score against heaven and hell, with both parties having used what’s left of the world for separate nefarious gains.</p>

<p>Got all that? Good, because the game will rarely mention it again. What’s transcribed from the story is settled between small, somewhat scanty NPC conversations and loading screen tips, and even then, the clarity is dubious. At times, it works in the game's favor, mostly due to some fantastic world-building efforts from Doekuramori, demonstrating how well and truly bunged up Earth is in the aftermath of these events.</p>



<p>Still, it must be said that <em>Beyond Citadel</em> does suffer from some rather unfortunate translation errors, which can distort the presentation of some character moments and story beats. It’s never something truly egregious that can ruin the mood, but with the aforementioned scanty storytelling, your mileage may vary in regards to how an unusual vernacular or punctual typo can ruin your immersion.</p>

<p>Not that this gets in the way of the gameplay, as <em>Beyond Citadel</em> sets its sights on some truly tactical combat, the likes of which you rarely see in this format. The 2.5D sprite work and blocky maps return from the original, with a lot of upgrades in regards to firearm functionality, and accurate weapon handling. Doekuramori cites, among the more obvious <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/genre-advancing-shooters-marathon" rel="nofollow"><em>Marathon</em></a>, the oft-forgotten LucasArts FPS <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/outlaws-game-series-wed-like-to-see-resurrected" rel="nofollow">Outlaws</a> </em>when it comes to <em>Beyond Citadel</em>’s inspirations, and that becomes a true statement when your first weapon is a beastly carbine repeater.</p>

<p>The actual flow and cadence of combat is fantastic. Once you get into the routine of unloading, reloading, and pulling the bolt back, you will have some outrageously fun firefights, punctuated by some varied arenas and adequate pacing to suit. The AI isn’t nearly as tactical as the gameplay around it, which is why <em>Beyond Citadel</em> focuses more on enemy placement and weapon variety to elevate the intensity this combat can exhibit.</p>



<p>When it works, it’s some of the best combat in this boomer-shooter/<a href="https://techraptor.net/originals/tightwads-brutal-wolfenstein" rel="nofollow"><em>Wolfenstein</em></a>-esque space.&nbsp; When it doesn’t, that’s when you’ll be dealing with the bosses, who bookend each separate act in their biblically accurate format. It’s a tried and true testament that most boomer-shooter bosses tend to deflate the excitement that precedes it, and <em>Beyond Citadel</em> is no exception, relying mostly on an overwhelming battalion of ads to punctuate each fight against some of God’s rowdiest outliers.</p>

<p>It’s not like the game is hard either. Where the difficulty lies in how well you gel with the weapon handling mechanics, as infinite lives and checkpoints exist within each level, so the name of the game is endurance. Both thematically and mechanically, <em>Beyond Citadel</em> is about rhythm, struggle, and the sheer unbreakable will of human survival.</p>

<p>Mind you, it’s not all perfect. Despite some fantastic pacing toward the second half of <em>Beyond Citadel</em>’s firefights, the final act is a gimmick in and of itself, introducing a brand new movement mechanic that plays awkwardly in the 2.5d format. At the game's worst, it becomes a firing range, and nowhere is it showcased better than in its final steps.</p>



<p>When you compare <em>Beyond Citadel</em> and <em>The Citadel</em> side-by-side, it’s easy to see what’s been kept thematically relevant, what’s improved, and what appears to be a downgrade. The biggest outlier of the supposed downgrades is the visual design, with the game favoring much greyer and constricting skyboxes in their fidelity and saturation. With that said, <em>Beyond Citadel</em> seems to favor scale in this instance, with whole cities to traverse in mechs and pulls it off brilliantly.</p>

<p>There’s also the elephant in the room, which is the applied anime style of “ero-guro”, or erotic gore. Ultraviolence is expected in the medium, sure, but watch with a certain horror as each enemy you face, and indeed yourself, is likely to become a well-drawn, albeit horrifying gibbed cadaver of a young woman beneath their battle armor and angelic upgrades. On top of that, <em>Beyond Citadel</em> also has a gallery, which expands as you find secret artwork within the levels, including art that is either narratively relevant or softcore pornography.</p>

<p>Is it exploitative? Yes. Can it be mean-spirited? At the worst of times, yes. Is it a downgrade from <em>The Citadel</em>? No, don’t be silly. In the 4 years since the original, it’s clear Doekuramuri is maturing, well past the teething phase as they truly get to grips with the world they’ve created, and find themselves focusing more on removing pretension. More importantly, there’s an effort on how to apply the context of this ero-guro aesthetic to the narrative without feeling like both occupy different spaces for different reasons.</p>



<p>It can be off-putting at first, but once <em>Beyond Citadel </em>is given some space to breathe and expand, not even inaccurate translations can dissuade the genuinely inspired posturing of a crisis of faith. Whether or not The Martyr is a good catalyst for this becomes a side-show considering the uhh, blasphemous reasons as to why they’re here in the first place. What takes the Martyrs’ place is an argument of individuality, exasperation at the supposed will of the chosen people, mixed in with some mildly juvenile nihilism.</p>

<p>After all, man proposes, but God disposes.</p>

<p>Still, this isn’t to say that the ero-guro elements have an objectively adequate element to exist alongside this philosophical - potentially pretentious - pondering, pertaining to processing Pantheism. In its purest essence, this is a mileage-may-vary FPS depending on whether or not you can stand one element enough to subject yourself through the rest. The answer to that being just as nebulous as <em>Beyond Citadel</em> itself.</p>

<h2><em>Beyond Citadel </em>Review | Final Verdict</h2>

<p>From most standpoints taken, <em>Beyond Citadel</em> is a clear improvement on its 2020 counterpart, both narratively and mechanically. It’s still not leaps and bounds beyond, as the game struggles to truly let its FPS core roam free, and the storytelling tends to waver in its briskness, but there’s a world here that seeks to be worthy. As we all seek to be.</p>

The ol’ dog was introduced in the 2017 <em>Doctor Strange </em>comics as the sorcerer’s pet. Strange cast an enchantment on Bats allowing him to communicate with people, but this was short-lived as the dog soon passed away due to a heart attack after a confrontation with Loki. Bats would later return to Strange’s side as a ghost, however, maintaining his speech capabilities and acting as the hero’s companion.</p><p>In the trailer for <em>Marvel Rivals’</em> new season, which includes a map based on Doctor Strange’s base of operations, NetEase teased that Bats would make an appearance, and now that some players are exploring the inner halls of the Sanctum Santorum, it’s been revealed that Bat hangs out in the lobby.</p><p>I’m a casual Marvel fan and most of my exposure to its heroes comes from the MCU and video games, so I had no idea that Bats existed until recently. It seems like that’s the case for a lot of <em>Rivals </em>fans who are also finding out about the ghost dog’s existence through the shooter. Longtime comic fans are excited to see a more niche side of the Marvel universe represented. I just met Bats but I would die for him, and seeing so many fans share cute moments between him and Marvel heroes has endeared him to me real quick. Also, he’s a Spider-Man fanboy? NetEase, please put in some kind of interaction between the two if a Spidey player is in the room with him.</p><p><em>Marvel Rivals </em>has a pretty expansive roster already, but within its maps and lore drops, it’s found ways to integrate other characters beyond the ones pushing payloads and capturing objectives. So thank you to NetEase for bringing Bats into my life. Let me pet him in the spawn room.</p><p>For more on <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975">check out <em>Kotaku</em>’s review</a></span>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A CS2 skin wear rating is a crucial component in determining the value of the skin itself. Counter-Strike’s massive skin economy is made up of hundreds of thousands of skins. The wear rating of a skin can determine whether a skin is worth tens, hundreds, or even thousands of dollars.</p>



<p>Let’s take a deep dive into what CS2 skin wear rating is, what determines it, and how it affects a skin’s price.</p>



<p><em>Before you jump below, consider&nbsp;<a href="https://trk.clash.gg/click?o=2&amp;a=47&amp;c=11&amp;sub_id1=Best4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trying your luck on Clash.gg</a>&nbsp;– you could turn your unwanted skins into something much more valuable (18+ only)</em></p>

<h2 id="h-what-is-cs2-skin-wear-rating">What is CS2 Skin Wear Rating?</h2>



<p>A wear rating is <strong>a numerical value, ranging from 0.0 to 1.0, that determines the amount of wear on a specific CS2 skin</strong>. The higher the wear rating, the more used and rugged it appears. The lower the wear rating, the more new and clean it appears. Wear rating is also commonly referred to as float value.</p>

</figure>



<p>The wear rating directly determines what a skin’s exterior classification is:</p>



<ul>
<li>Skins with a wear rating of <strong>0.00 to 0.07 are considered Factory New</strong>.</li>



<li>Skins with a wear rating of <strong>0.07 to 0.15 are considered Minimal Wear</strong>.</li>



<li>Skins with a wear rating of <strong>0.15 to 0.38 are considered Field-Tested</strong>.</li>



<li>Skins with a wear rating of <strong>0.38 to 0.45 are considered Well Worn</strong>.</li>



<li>Skins with a wear rating of <strong>0.45 to 1.00 are considered Battle-Scarred</strong>.</li>
</ul>



<p>For virtually all skins, items that are Factory New buy and sell for much higher than any of the other exteriors. Then it’s usually a sharp drop to Minimal Wear prices, and then another sharp drop to the higher wear exterior prices. Skins that are closer to the 0.00 rating will sell for much more, even more than other Factory New skins. If you’re looking at Factory New skin listings on the marketplace, the cheapest ones are the ones closest to the 0.07 threshold.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-determines-cs2-skin-wear-rating">What Determines CS2 Skin Wear Rating?</h2>



<p><strong>A CS2 skin’s wear rating is determined when it is opened from a case</strong>. Skins are not guaranteed to be Factory New or Minimal Wear when opened from a case. It’s also a common misconception that CS2 skins degrade over time with use. Wear rating does not increase over time with use.</p>



<p>Many skins can only be opened within a specific exterior classification. Doppler knives, among <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/most-expensive-counter-strike-skins-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the most expensive CS2 skins</a>, can only be opened as Factory New or as Minimal Wear, for example.</p>

			<p>Hitman World of Assassination has officially reached over 75 million players worldwide, which means that this game is the most successful Hitman game of all time. This new was announced today by IO Interactive, the developer and publisher behind the incredibly popular franchise. Since its launch, Hitman World of Assassination has now surpassed 75 million players worldwide. This milestone is just another checkmark for the team, as they have known the success of the game since it was first released. This title has achieved the franchise's highest Metacritic score with the release of Hitman III in 2021.</p>
<p>Compared to previous games in the franchise, Hitman World of Assassination is a bit more unique, as it allows players to be stealthy while also getting stuck into dramatic action, and allows players to come up with a multitude of ways to assassinate a target or knock them out and hide them.</p>
<p>The game has plenty of interesting characters to get to know or even assassinate, and there are tons of opportunities to carry out a contract. Hitman World of Assassination doesn't seem to be slowing down anytime soon, either.</p>
<p><iframe title="HITMAN: World of Assassination - The Splitter  (featuring @JCVDWorld ) Mission Reveal" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9xS2zKlpYVM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Since the release of this game, there have been a ton of updates, adding in new live content that contains new locations, contracts, events, and even collaborations with famous people who then get to become a contract in the game. December saw a million active players, and the game continues to remain popular and played by many. 2025 will get more missions for players to run through, as new updates are released by the team hard at work.</p>
<p>Most recently, players were given the opportunity to see Jean-Claude Van Damme in Hitman World of Assassination as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/hitman-cut-ties-with-conor-mcgregor-after-court-ruling/">Elusive Target</a> Max Valliant, who is a former ICA operative and others already thought he had been eliminated years ago, but was found to be alive and dealing with secret organizations. This particular mission has been completed by 40% of the players, with a fair few getting far in the mission but struggling to take down the target thanks to his skill set.</p>
<p>One player in particular took more than seven hours to complete the mission, to make sure that they were as thorough as possible in the mission before assassinating the target. Contrasting this playthrough, the fastest player ended the mission within 21 seconds.</p>
<p>The Splitter will be available in Hitman World of Assassination until January 12, giving players the opportunity to try out <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1659040/HITMAN_World_of_Assassination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the new mission</a> before it disappears.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Ubisoft are delaying <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> again, but this time, not just out of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-as-ubisoft-try-to-recover-from-softer-than-expected-star-wars-outlaws-launch">concern about the quality of Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>. The French publisher are pushing back release of the new samurai-era open worlder from 14th February to 20th March 2025 while they look into "various transformational strategic and capitalistic options to extract the best value for stakeholders", with news of a possible major "transaction" to follow. </p><!--more-->
<p>Quite what this means is open to speculation, but it was recently rumoured that Ubi's First Family the Guillemot brothers have been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-and-guillemot-family-considering-buyout-of-ubisoft-report-says">conspiring with Tencent to buy the company out</a>, while minority shareholders displeased by the company's falling share price have been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-ubisoft-investor-wants-to-dethrone-ubisofts-founders-so-ubisoft-can-lay-more-developers-off">clamouring</a> for the board to "take Ubisoft private or allow it to sell to a strategic investor". So this could be Big. Bigger than a single video game's delay, anyway.</p>
<p>"Following the strategic and execution reviews initiated by the Executive Committee a few months ago, Ubisoft is taking decisive steps to reshape the Group in order to deliver best-in-class player experiences, enhance operational efficiency and maximize value creation," reads a <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/1wUjJWUQSIVMlZbKQ2707e/c0b1cd1c71ab30838e51d5e24764577f/Press_release_09_01_2025_vfinal.pdf">"strategic update" from Ubisoft</a>, posted this afternoon.</p>
<p>"Ubisoft announced today that it has appointed leading advisors to review and pursue various transformational strategic and capitalistic options to extract the best value for stakeholders," it continues. "This process will be overseen by the independent members of the Board of Directors. Ubisoft will inform the market in accordance with applicable regulations if and once a transaction materializes."</p><p>Ubisoft have been somewhat up the creek financially for a while, losing almost half their share value in 2024, partly due to the "soft" performance of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>. As such they've been cutting back. In December, Ubisoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-shut-down-multiplayer-shooter-xdefiant-and-lay-off-hundreds-who-worked-on-it">discontinued PvP shooter XDefiant and laid off around 277 people</a>. According to today's statement, shuttering <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-xdefiant">XDefiant</a> involved the closure of "three production studios in high-cost geographies" - as in, regions where wages are higher.</p>
<p>The company "will continue to drive significant cost reductions, together with a highly selective approach to investments", the statement goes on. Ubisoft now expect to reduce their "fixed cost base" (in other words, costs that consist of more predictable, recurring business expenses, like employee salaries) by €200 million for the fiscal year 2025-2026, compared to 2022-2023 on an <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/annualize.asp">annualised</a> basis.</p>
<p>And then there's the delaying of Shadows, a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-is-actually-two-games-competing-for-your-affections">moderately promising historical opus</a> which appears to have far too much riding on it in the wake of Outlaws.</p>
<p>"Additionally, as part of the renewed focus on gameplay quality and engaging Day-1 experiences, it has been decided to provide an additional month of development to Assassin's Creed Shadows," Ubisoft write. "This additional time will allow the team to better incorporate the player feedback gathered over the past three months and help create the best conditions for launch by continuing to engage closely with the increasingly positive Assassin's Creed community. The game is now scheduled for March 20."</p><p>I do not have the insight to play soothsayer about Ubisoft's fortunes here. I will end instead by pointing you towards <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-say-theyd-consider-being-bought-if-someone-offered">this bracingly weary Alice0 (RPS in peace) article from 2022</a>, in which CEO Yves Guillemot talks up Ubisoft's independence while also stating that, of course, they'd happily sell the farm to anybody with a really, really large amount of money.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

If you thought 2025 might finally be the year you managed get through that pesky games backlog, signs aren't looking good. You can now chuck more onto the pile, with Amazon having announced it's bringing another 16 titles to Prime Gaming in January.
</p>
<p>
This month's offerings - as is customary for Prime Gaming - arrive over the course of several scheduled content drops. That starts right now with acclaimed undersea shooter sequel <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock-2">BioShock 2</a> Remastered, side-scrolling action-RPG Eastern Exorcist, surreal puzzler The Bridge, 2D hack-and-slasher Spirit Mancer, and aeronautical arcade game SkyDrift Infinity.
</p>
<p>
Then, as January continues, Prime Gaming subscribers can look forward to the likes of celebrated deck-building fantasy RPG SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech, acclaimed retro stealth FPS Blood West, Zombie Army 4: Dead War, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-meat-boy-forever">Super Meat Boy Forever</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deus-ex">Deus Ex</a>: Game of the Year Edition.
