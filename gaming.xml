			<p>Mere days after its debut, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 already has a thriving modding community. We previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-mod-roundup-unlimited-saving-and-increased-convenience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">covered</a> a lot of convenience mods to make the game a bit less tedious for those who don't enjoy that side of the franchise. Now, it's time for the first graphics enhancement mods. Nexus Mods user SweeJ24 has uploaded a 3.4GB <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/263?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4K skins mod</a> that greatly increases the skin details of the game's characters by replacing all faces and all body diffuse textures for both males and females. There are reportedly minor seams at the moment, but the detail enhancement is already big, making it more than worthwhile. The default textures in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 are 1K, so the mod offers a 4x resolution improvement.</p>
<p><iframe title="CRT FACES" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ACAvdOyjbDo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>According to the author, the initial load might be a little longer, but afterward, it should be the same as vanilla. They also did not report any performance impact, although that was with the GeForce RTX 4090 graphics card.</p>
<p>No doubt there will be many more graphics mods coming to Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. The game was a resounding success both critically and commercially (it has already <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sells-1-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> one million units, recouping development costs). The game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received a perfect score</a> here on Wccftech from Chris Wray:</p>
<p><em>If I were honest with myself, I don't think I've ever enjoyed an open-world game in the same way I have Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. Or, more accurately, the last time a game ever felt this transformational as to what I would expect from an open-world RPG of this nature was The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion almost twenty years ago. The Witcher III is up there, but even that doesn't feel as responsive as this.</em></p>
<p><em>[...] I would genuinely argue that this could be judged as a benchmark on how to do an open world, and even though I'm over fifty hours in, there's more I want to do and see. There are side quests to complete, easter eggs to hunt, wenches to fornicate with, and bandits to kill. I didn't want to write this review now, not in the slightest; I wanted just one more day to give even more context, and I know I would have wanted just one more day after that.</em></p>

            <p>Would you like the good or the bad news first? Obviously I can't actually respond to that, so I'll just do the bad news first and if you chose differently you can always tip your monitor upside down, hang from the ceiling, or just work your way up the article from the bottom: tributary <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> demake <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bloodborne-psx">Bloodborne PSX</a> is no more. As reported by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/607803/sony-copyright-claim-bloodborne-psx">The Verge</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/607803/sony-copyright-claim-bloodborne-psx">PC Gamer</a>), LW Media's Lilith Walther has received a copyright takedown notice from firm MarkScan on behalf of Sony Interactive, accusing Bloodborne PSX of 'digital piracy'. The game was previously available on <a href="https://b0tster.itch.io/">Itch</a> for three years without issue.</p>
<p>This follows a recent DMCA takedown of a YouTube video promoting Bloodborne PSX, as chronicled by noted good modsman Lance McDonald below. As McDonald mentions, MarkScan were also responsible for another recent strike against his own 60fps <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bloodborne">Bloodborne</a> mod, which had been <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/manfightdragon.bsky.social/post/3lh2cipa4rk2v">available without issue since 2021</a>.</p>

<p>Here is <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/b0tster.yeag.gay/post/3lhjt5ufa722a">an animated recap</a> of events by Walther herself.</p>
<p>These events seem doubly abrupt and misguided in light of the fact that Sony previously gave Walther their blessing to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bloodborne-kart-will-scrub-the-branding-off-after-being-contacted-by-sonys-lawyers">release Nightmare Kart following a few changes</a>, notably the title from '<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bloodborne-kart">Bloodborne Kart</a>'. Could MarkScan perhaps be acting a touch overzealously here? From The Verge:</p>
<blockquote><p>MarkScan has previously made headlines for <a href="https://www.wired.com/2014/07/markscan-takedown/">taking down World Cup sites that weren’t even streaming the World Cup</a>, and asking Google to <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/sony-flags-its-own-website-for-repeat-copyright-infringements-220724/">remove <em>some of Sony’s own websites</em> on Sony’s behalf</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>As is generally the case whenever they see a.) a cathedral in real life b.) a British person looking a bit under the weather or c.) a normal rat, some fans have broken out the Bloodbornium and declared these events undeniable portents that it is, once again, huffin' season. A brief mention of Bloodborne in Sony's recent <a href="https://youtu.be/KkmonzpHVRg">30th anniversary video</a> helped stoke these fires.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>New ideas and directions are hard to find in the gaming peripheral space. Controllers do what controllers do, and for many people, the official PlayStation and Xbox controllers are as far as it goes. However, there’s a healthy competition for our fingers and thumbs rumbling away, with controllers now one of the most hotly contested sectors in gaming. Turtle Beach have come a long way from being purely a headset maker, and their latest, the Stealth Pivot, ploughs a new direction by having what can only be described as a split personality.</p>
<p><iframe title="Turtle Beach® Stealth Pivot Wireless Smart Controller: Rank Up To Revolutionary Control" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZROD3n_VBNw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>I loved the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/04/turtle-beach-stealth-ultra-pro-controller-review/">Stealth Ultra Pro</a>, cementing the fact that Turtle Beach are onto A Good Thing in the controller space. Where that brought in new technology in the shape of a colour OLED screen for a bit of high-tech gloss, the Pivot is more of a Swiss Army Knife of controllers, letting you switch between a standard controller layout or a fighting/retro focussed one. It’s a brilliant idea, even if it’s answering an unasked question for many gamers.</p>


<p>The Pivot looks pretty familiar, taking its overall design influence from the Official Xbox Controller. Despite that, it’s primarily aimed at PC and Mobile players with Xbox functionality available if you’re wired up. On PC the best performance comes either wired or via the 2.4gHz USB-A wireless dongle, while Bluetooth will let you hop in with your mobile or Apple TV-esque device. In the hand, it’s weighty and solid, fashioned from good quality plastics.</p>
<p>The magic comes with its namesake. It’s called the Pivot for the two pivoting sections on the face of the controller. These rotate between a standard asymmetrical Xbox-esque layout and a six-button lineup, shifting the D-pad into a more accessible position for your thumb. All you need to do is flip the controller over, release the locking switches and rotate the controller faces to your desired position.</p>

<p>It’s an ingenious bit of tech, a more practical and immediate cousin to the Thrustmaster eSwap’s controller modules, and it’s super satisfying just to tinker with. I have to admit, I’ve found myself messing with it before starting a game, even if I don’t need the fighting game layout.</p>

<p>So that this all fits into one controller, there’ve been two necessary changes, and they do affect how the Pivot feels in your hand, and in use. Firstly, the Pivot is a bit on the chonky side. In order for the pivoting mechanism to fit in, they’ve had to make it thicker, and if you’ve got smaller hands, it is a noticeable change. Personally, it didn’t affect my time using the Pivot, but I noticed it every single time I picked it up.</p>
<p>The second alteration is to the analogue sticks. As we’re seeing with more and more controllers, these are anti-drift Hall Effect sticks, which means they should last you a heck of a lot longer than the sticks in either the DualSense or Xbox Controller thanks to their magnetic technology removing the physical friction that wears on traditional sticks.</p>
<p>However, the sticks need to fit within the body of the controller when you rotate them away, with a twisting mechanism releasing them so that you can be tucked inside. It’s clever, and feels pretty solid, though I have to wonder whether it removes the advantages given by the Hall Effect sticks if you’re the kind of person – like me – to mess with the controller’s layout every single time you play. Being so weirdly enjoyable that you want to mess with it, increasing the wear on all the parts around he sticks, is probably a problem that the designers haven’t spent too much time on.</p>

<p>Because they need to be rotated away, both sticks are noticeably shorter than you’ll be used to. It’s far more noticeable to your muscle memory than the rest of the controller’s body, and it’s an oddity that may well be too much for some players to get over. On top of that, the sticks’ resistance is lower than I would like, giving less feedback to your movements and reducing the premium feel.</p>
<p>There’s some benefit to the reduced resistance and shorter sticks though, particularly the ability to change direction quicker, and if you’re a fighting game fan that prefers an analogue stick input, this could make it easier to fire off your directional inputs. That comes at a cost to precision, so if you’re into competitive FPS titles, you might want to look elsewhere. That’s backed up in our testing, with Gamepad Tester delivering a worrying 13.4% accuracy error, with the circularity over-emphasising the four main directions.</p>
<p>That’s not to say it doesn’t have some shooter chops, as the Pivot boasts the near essential short trigger stops for your analogue triggers – seriously, every controller should have these. Further up on the back of the Pivot, you’ll find two easily identified toggles, each of which shortens the travel of the triggers so that they effectively become buttons. There’s only two trigger stop settings, instead of the more typical three, with the standard analogue trigger travel being shorter than you’d find elsewhere.</p>
<p>Hopefully, this improves your reaction speed when you’re lining up a headshot, and through plenty of rounds of Overwatch 2, the Pivot was no slouch. However, not having a longer travel similar, for example, to an Xbox controller can reduce the precision you want for racing games.</p>

<p>The Stealth Pro isn’t the only Turtle Beach controller with a screen, as the Pivot steals one of its killer features. This is a much smaller version though, and monochrome, but it still lets you make a series of on-the-fly changes to your controller’s setup. You can receive alerts from your mobile phone, change the mapping for the buttons and D-pad, and also switch the plastic slider’s functionality, though only for audio controls and not any of the central buttons – this seems a missed opportunity.</p>
<p>No matter which face button layout you’ve gone for, each of the membrane buttons feel good in use, with an expected level of travel. Both D-pads feel great, and given the attention that’s been lavished on them, it feels safe to say that the Pivot is aimed squarely at the fighting game crowd, with the option to play anything else at the flick of a switch.</p>

<p>Beyond the expected buttons, the Pivot also has a pair of extra rear buttons that are a placed unusually, but do still sit just underneath your middle fingers. I think this is actually my preferred layout for back buttons, though, and only having two reduces the chance of accidental activation – if you’re a fully-immersed back button/paddle aficionado, you might want a couple more.</p>
<p>The Pivot isn’t the only controller taking this unusual approach to variety gaming. The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/27/victrix-pro-bfg-controller-review/">Victrix Pro BFG</a>&nbsp;is a great option, though its alternative button layouts need to be screwed in and out of the controller housing so it doesn’t have the immediacy of the Pivot. The trigger lockouts are a lot more finicky too. My personal favourite solution to this question remains the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/19/thrustmaster-eswap-x2-pro-controller-review/">Thrustmaster eSwap X2 Pro</a>, whose magnetic units are a doodle to swap in and out, and it comes in at the same £119.99 pricepoint, though it’s only available as a wired option which won’t be for everyone.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nvidia-rtx-kit-with-neural-shaders-is-out-now-mega-geometry-and-neural-texture-compression-demos-available/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A few days after the originally intended launch window of late January, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-rtx-kit-shows-how-neural-rendering-will-power-the-next-visual-leap-in-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA RTX Kit</a> has finally been released to the public for the most part. NVIDIA RTX Kit can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA-RTX/RTX-Kit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via GitHub</a>, though each component also has a dedicated repository. This includes what was arguably the most exciting and future-facing technology: RTX Neural Shaders, now abbreviated as <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA-RTX/RTXNS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTXNS</a>. Here's the excerpt from its dedicated GitHub page:</p>
<p><em>The sample is intended as a starting point for developers interested in bringing Machine Learning (ML) to their graphics applications. It provides a number of examples to help the reader understand how to train their own neural networks and then use those models to perform inference alongside their normal graphics rendering.</em></p>
<p><em>RTXNS uses the Slang shading language and it utilises the Vulkan Cooperative Vectors extension to provide access to the GPUs ML acceleration.</em></p>
<p>RTX Neural Materials is not yet available as part of the RTX Kit suite, but practically everything else is. For example, RTX Neural Texture Compression includes a demo sample that can be compiled to demonstrate the memory-saving technology. Compusemble did just that, finding massively reduced memory consumption (from 272 to 11.37 MB), although there is a performance cost associated when enabling the NTC AI inference model.</p>
<p><iframe title="First Look At RTX Neural Texture Compression (BETA) On RTX 4090" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z9VAloduypg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Similarly, RTX Mega Geometry (<a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA-RTX/RTXMG" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTXMG</a>) can be tested by compiling a new sample. This is the only technology that's already been used in a game (<a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-rtx-mega-geometry-performance-vram-improvements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alan Wake 2</a>), but the tech demo is nonetheless interesting.</p>
<p><iframe title="NVIDIA RTX Mega Geometry Tech Demo" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Js-ps14csLM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>RTX Character Rendering (<a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA-RTX/RTXCR" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTXCR</a>) is also available, providing a sample of how to render path traced hair and skin. Hair is particularly interesting because, with the new GeForce RTX 50 graphics cards, NVIDIA introduced hardware support for a new hair data structure called Linear-Swept Sphere (LSS). According to NVIDIA, this delivers high performance in tracing and BVH updates while maintaining exceptionally low memory consumption. Compared to Disjoint Orthogonal Triangle Strips (DOTS), rendering animated hair on humans is about 2x faster with LSS and requires one-fifth of the VRAM. We'll see the first example of RTX Hair with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-to-get-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-and-rtx-hair-with-february-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle February update</a>.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The RTX Kit also includes one technology that NVIDIA had not previously discussed at CES 2025: RTX Texture Filtering (<a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA-RTX/RTXTF" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTXTF</a>). According to NVIDIA, RTXTF randomly samples textures after shading and filters difficult volumes, reducing artifacts and improving image quality.</p>
<p>Lastly, NVIDIA also <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/Streamline/releases/tag/v2.7.2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">updated its Streamline SDK to version 2.7.2</a>, adding support for DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation and the new models for Ray Reconstruction, Frame Generation, and Super Resolution. This means we might soon see the first DLSS 4 mods.</p>

            <p>Dragon Quest 12 is still in development, series creator Yuji Horii has confirmed.</p>
<p>The latest in the long-running RPG series was first announced back in 2021 but little has been seen since beyond the initial teaser trailer.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, though, Horii held a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfikAAlgNsw">livestream</a> with this radio show group KosoKoso Hōsō Kyoku (thanks <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/dragon-quest-12-is-still-fully-in-development-new-information-to-be-revealed-little-by-little-says-series-creator/">Automaton</a>) where he confirmed the development team is "working hard on Dragon Quest 12".</p>

<p>Further details are expected to be released little by little, though nothing more was revealed at this time.</p>
<p>Back in May last year, <a href="https://x.com/YujiHorii/status/1794984625107832939">Horii also acknowledged Dragon Quest 12</a> on social media, stating the development team wanted to make a game "worthy of the final contributions of the two people who passed away".</p>
<p>Those two people are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tributes-shared-as-dragon-ball-creator-akira-toriyama-passes-away">Dragon Quest character designer Akira Toriyama</a> and composer Koichi Sugiyama, who had worked on every game in the series before their deaths.</p>
<p>Horii's comments came shortly after Dragon Quest series producer <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/report-yu-miyake-stepping-down-as-producer-on-dragon-quest">Yu Miyake stepped down from his role</a> to oversee <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s mobile game division, putting Dragon Quest 12's development into question.</p>
<p>Now, in his livestream, Horii apologised for confusion around the game's development and denied it had been cancelled.</p>
<p>Little else is known about Dragon Quest 12, though at the series' 35th anniversary livestream Horii stated the classic turn-based battle system will be altered and the tone will be darker and aimed at adults.</p>
<p>In its latest earnings report, Square Enix stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-exceeded-square-enix-expectations-but-game-sales-drop-overall">Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake exceeded sales expectations</a>. Previously it reported sales of 2m copies, with the game becoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-already-best-selling-game-in-japan-for-2024-after-just-one-week">2024's biggest game in Japan</a> after just a week on sale.</p>
<p>While similar remakes of Dragon Quest 1 and 2 are expected this year, anticipation is building for the next full release in the series to build on the success of Dragon Quest 3.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

While the crowd cheered to spins on hits from records like DAMN and GNX, appearances from stars like Samuel Jackson and SZA helped take the show to new heights. Of course, there were plenty of references to Lamar’s infamous 2024 beef with Drake, too, but what audiences didn’t expect was how the Super Bowl performer chose to finally close the door on the former Degrassi star. As the lights went down, the words “Game Over” could be seen illuminated on the side of the stadium, while the stage was revealed to feature PlayStation’s iconic cross, circle, triangle, and square symbols.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lamar’s Super Bowl halftime show was always going to be seen as a victory lap when it came to his beef with Drake, but bringing Sony into the fight to finally close that chapter in grand fashion felt especially brutal. Although it’s not quite clear why the To Pimp a Butterfly artist chose to seemingly channel PlayStation for the end of his year-long fight, music and gaming fans have taken to social media to share their appreciation for the dig nonetheless. At the very least, Lamar’s already great performance might be better on rewatch once you realize the stage is one big video game reference.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Kendrick Lamar brought out the PlayStation symbols and said "Game Over" 😭<a href="https://t.co/MfkDEJ1F9G" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/MfkDEJ1F9G</a></p>— KAMI (@Okami13_) <a href="https://twitter.com/Okami13_/status/1888766562750148721?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 10, 2025</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">the stage for Kendrick Lamar's Super Bowl performance has the PlayStation controller buttons 😭😭😭 <a href="https://t.co/DnkrJGRDtI" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/DnkrJGRDtI</a></p>— Radec (@realradec) <a href="https://twitter.com/realradec/status/1888764872353022049?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 10, 2025</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Serena Williams, Samuel Jackson, PlayStation references, the GNX, the whole stadium yelling "AMINORR" ugh the dancers in red, white &amp; blue, SZA?!

Aside from its surprise spot in the Super Bowl halftime show, the gaming company found itself making headlines on Friday and Saturday morning when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/is-psn-down-february-2025">gamers were locked out of accessing PSN for an extended period of time</a>. The unscheduled event saw fans unable to play any online titles for around a full day, resulting in one of the longest periods of downtime since the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/04/21/one-year-later-reflecting-on-the-great-psn-outage">infamous outage of 2011</a>. PlayStation was eventually able to bring PSN back online later yesterday and has stated it will be gifting PlayStation Plus users an additional five days onto their subscriptions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, the Super Bowl still has time to go, and that means more trailers and commercials for some of the biggest movies and TV shows of 2025. Highlights so far include teasers for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/jurassic-world-rebirth-super-bowl-trailer-reveals-more-dinosaur-carnage-ahead-of-summer-premiere">Jurassic World Rebirth</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mission-impossible-the-final-reckoning-super-bowl-trailer-packs-in-nostalgia-and-more-tom-cruise-stunts">Mission Impossible: The Final Reckoning</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/thunderbolts-reappears-with-action-packed-super-bowl-trailer-and-a-first-look-at-sentry">Thunderbolts*</a>.

    <p>
      Bismuth explains the unreasonable luck needed for a record-setting Tyson fight at around the 56:30 mark in this 2024 video.

          </p>
  </div>
</figure>
<p>Summoning Salt says Tyson here gave him a "perfect pattern" during his first phase of endless uppercuts, something that happens only 1 in 1,600 bouts. And later in the fight, the game's random-number generator cooperated by adding only an extra 16 frames of delay (~0.8 in-game seconds) compared to a "perfect" run. Combined, Summoning Salt estimates that Tyson will only punch this quickly once every 7,000 to 10,000 attempts.</p>
<p>"It's over," Summoning Salt <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2376320266">said live on Twitch</a> when the record-setting match was finished, in a surprisingly even tone that came over what sounds very much like a dropped controller. "I thought I'd be a lot more excited about this. Holy shit, dude! It's fucking over... Dude, am I dreaming right now? ... I'm sorry I'm so quiet. I'm kind of in shock right now that that just happened."</p>
<h2>Where do we go from here?</h2>
<p>With his near-perfect combination of both skill and luck, Summoning Salt's new record surpasses <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_wvPExoOg8">his own previous world record</a> of precisely 2:00.00 on the in-game clock. That mark, set just eight months ago, was just three frames off of displaying 1:59 on the in-game timer for the first time.</p>
<p>Summoning Salt was also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YMOqycF2yQ">the first runner to break the 2:01 barrier on Tyson</a> in 2020, a feat he has since replicated just 15 times over tens of thousands of attempts. "There's essentially no difference between all of those [2:00.xx] fights and this one, except I got better luck from Tyson on this fight," he writes. "Finally, after nearly half a decade, the 1:59 has happened."</p>
<figure><p><iframe allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TBR9ypSOTGQ?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></iframe></p><div>
    
    <p>
      Summoning Salt discusses the difficulty of beating 2:13 on Tyson in 2020, months before setting a then-record time of 2:00 himself

          </p>
  </div>
</figure>
<p>Ironically, just before posting his first 2:00.xx fight in 2020, Summoning Salt <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBR9ypSOTGQ&amp;t=2440s">posted a video</a> discussing in part just how difficult it was for speedrunners <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELep5djy_kU">to beat Matt Turk's 2007 record of 2:13 on Tyson</a>. "For years it was just this impossibly fast time that the top players just couldn't get close to," Summoning Salt said at the time. "Of course, other top players fought Tyson years later, but their best efforts came up short... they couldn't touch it. It stood alone."</p>
<p>Summoning Salt is now just over a second off of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sgQ7BuEpIM">the tool-assisted speedrun record of 1:58.61</a>, which uses emulated gameplay to fight a theoretical "perfect" bout every time. But after spending years on what he writes "is the greatest gaming achievement I have ever accomplished," Summoning Salt seems ready to hang up his virtual boxing gloves for good.</p>
<p>"I have no plans to ever improve this time," he writes. "It will be beaten by somebody one day, likely by matching this fight and then getting better luck in phase 3. I have no interest in competing for that but am extremely proud to have gotten the first sub 2 ever on Mike Tyson."</p>

<p>Whilst it remains unclear, what, exactly, the collaboration will be, noted Fortnite leaker HypeX said the status change likely comes because "they probably made a lot of progress and moved into the next roadmap milestone".</p>

<p>Team Vitality are the champions of IEM Katowice 2025, after upsetting top-ranked Team Spirit in a surprising 3-0 fashion in the grand final. Vitality claims their first big trophy since IEM Cologne 2024, and their first since signing former FaZe star Robin “ropz” Kool.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-spirit-fails-to-defend-katowice-title">Spirit Fails to Defend Katowice Title</h2>



<p>Vitality came out firing, stealing away Spirit’s first map pick of Dust2. Robin “ropz” Kool had easily his best map since joining the team, notching 26 kills against only 9 deaths, and dominating on the T-side in the second half. On Nuke, it was the legend Mathieu “ZywOo” Herbaut who stepped up, delivering 26 kills against only 6 deaths, while rarely using the AWP he was once synonymous with.</p>



<p>On Mirage, Vitality went into half-time with the lead for a third straight map. Spirit lost their sixth pistol round to kick off the second half, having failed to win a single pistol round all series. Trailing 11-4 and with their backs against the wall, Spirit finally showed some life in the second half, stringing together 7 straight rounds to tie it. Vitality finally got to 12 thanks to Shahar “flameZ” Shushan, and he opened the kills again in the pivotal final round of regulation to secure the map, <a href="https://www.hltv.org/matches/2378917/vitality-vs-spirit-iem-katowice-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the series</a>, and the trophy.</p>



<p>For Vitality, this represents the first time that the organization has lifted the trophy in Katowice in more than half a dozen tries. The team’s leader Dan “apEX” Madesclaire had never won in Katowice in the tournament’s 11 year history until today. ZywOo also ties the legendary Oleksandr “s1mple” Kostyljev for most tournament MVP awards with 21.</p>



<p>Is Vitality the new favorite to lift the trophy <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-blast-tv-austin-cs2-major-dates-times-and-schedule/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at the next Major</a>?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/wccftech-awards-24-best-games-of-2024-and-most-anticipated-of-2025-from-staff-and-community/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's time to officially announce the winners of the Wccftech Awards' 24. The list features the best games released last year and the most anticipated titles due this year, as voted by our staff and community through polls based on our respective category lists.</p>
<p>While 2024 wasn't quite as outstanding as 2023 when accounting for the overall game releases, there were certainly some standout launches. The best arguably arrived late in the year, with Indiana Jones and the Great Circle from MachineGames being the only game to snatch three prizes (the Adventure award from both staff and community and the Game of the Year award from the staff).</p>
<p>The rest of the best of 2024 stopped at two awards. This includes Final Fantasy VII Rebirth (voted the best RPG according to both staff and community), Tekken 8, Black Myth: Wukong, Frostpunk 2, Astro Bot, and Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree. Only in four cases out of thirteen categories was there a different winner between the staff and community polls, showing a great alignment between the tastes of our writers and our readers.</p>

<p>Our yearly Wccftech Awards also include the outlook for the next year, in this case, 2025. Here, the misalignment was much greater, with nine out of thirteen winners being different between staff and community polls. It's no wonder, though, as the games haven't been released yet, and these votes are based on current information only.</p>
<p>Arguably, the standout is that our staff isn't very excited about Grand Theft Auto VI as a whole, though perhaps that will change when Rockstar Games actually shares some gameplay details.</p>

		<p>The co-creator of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/back-to-the-future/">Back to the Future</a> franchise, Bob Gale, has hinted that a video game based on the films could be on the way. However, he is very vague and it doesn’t even seem like anything has been formalised just yet.</p>
<p><b>“</b>We’ve got a shot at a new video game based on ‘Back to the Future.'” he told <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/2024/05/back-to-the-future-co-creator-bob-gale-on-why-disney-rejected-script-possible-sequel-or-reboot-more.html">Cleveland.com</a>. “I don’t want to tell you any more than that because I’m not allowed to, but this is something I’ve wanted to do for a long time. Knock on wood that it will happen.”</p>


<p>The last Back to the Future game, created by Telltale Games, arrived in 2010 and it was re-released with additional content for PS4 and Xbox One in 2015.&nbsp; When the movies were originally in cinemas there were also tie-in games for the likes of the ZX Spectrum and Commodore Amiga, as well as a few titles for the NES and Super Famicom, but none of them were particularly good.&nbsp; The Telltale Games version had <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/back-to-the-future-the-game-episode-i-its-abo/critic-reviews/?platform=pc">fairly favourable</a> reviews and the point-and-click style adventure seemed to be the best way to adapt the movie, but that style of game has fallen out of favour and whoever is making the new title faces a big challenge.</p>
<p>2025 is the 40th anniversary of the original movie – yes, you are old – so there will be some sort of celebrations, maybe they will formally announce the game this year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/what-should-battlefield-6-take-from-battlefield-5/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In February 2025, Electronic Arts divulged the future of the Battlefield franchise alongside a reveal of ‘Battlefield Labs’. This all-new testing initiative promised to invite fans into the fold to have them trial Battlefield products long before they are released to the open market.</p>



<p>It was also when we got <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-learned-from-the-new-battlefield-game-footage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our first look at Battlefield 6</a> – or whatever it’ll end up being named. It got me thinking about the games that came before, more particularly <strong>Battlefield 5, </strong>which I often consider to be the last <strong>good </strong>Battlefield game. </p>



<p>Don’t hate me.</p>



<p>Without further ado, here’s what I think Battlefield <strong>6 </strong>should take from Battlefield <strong>5</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-does-battlefield-6-need-to-have">What Does Battlefield 6 Need To Have?</h2>



<p>There are many features and mechanics unique to Battlefield 5 (or defined by Battlefield 5) that I feel would be right at home in Battlefield 6 – not that the title or numbering has been confirmed, of course.</p>



<p>Here they are.</p>



<h3 id="h-battle-royale">Battle Royale</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Let’s get that controversial one out of the way right off the bat. I think Firestorm was a fantastic addition to Battlefield 5 but it was underappreciated and poorly utilised. It dropped in May 2019, just months after Respawn Entertainment released Apex Legends and around a year before Call of Duty Warzone hit the market.</p>



<p>It was a tough time for the competition in the battle royale space, but Firestorm had potential – and guess who developed it? Criterion Games, in conjunction with EA’s DICE. Both of these studios are working on the next Battlefield game, and the rumours are that Battlefield 6 <strong>will feature </strong>a battle royale.</p>







<h3 id="h-destruction-mechanics">Destruction Mechanics</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Battlefield 5’s destruction mechanics were monumental, and through artillery, missiles, bombs, tanks, planes, and everything else in between, users could raze the entire map to the ground. Entire villages would fall under the weight of devastating explosions, tanks could crawl through buildings, and even now, the sound of a V2 bomb buzzing over fills me with impending dread.</p>



<p>There was a huge backstep in Battlefield 2042 that stripped almost every ounce of destruction from the game. It was a defining feature of the Battlefield franchise, and it was last done best in Battlefield 5. From what we saw in the first pre-alpha trailer for Battlefield 6, the game <strong>will feature </strong>intense destruction mechanics.</p>



<h3 id="h-con-struction-mechanics"><em>Con</em>struction Mechanics</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>There’s a fantastic ability written almost into the background of Battlefield 5, and it allows players to whip out a toolbox and start building defences around their objectives. It’s a neat little feature that adds extra immersion to an already immersive title, and it allows players to get a little more strategic when defending a flag or a building.</p>



<p>It’s a basic thing – players can click or hold a button to lay down sandbags, dig trenches, reinforce windows, set up tank traps, or roll out walls of razor wire. It can turn a simple farmhouse into a well-defended objective in just a few minutes, and I believe that if expanded upon, it could be a fantastic returning feature in Battlefield 6.</p>







<h3 id="h-multi-dimensional-campaign">Multi-Dimensional Campaign</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Battlefield 5 was the last game in the series to have a core campaign, which was built around the typical model – various theatres of war around the world during a major conflict. Battlefield 5’s campaign was cinematic and emotional, and it revealed some of the more ‘secret stories’ of the Second World War, much like Battlefield 1 exposed subtones present in World War I. </p>



<p>When Battlefield 2042 debuted without a campaign, many millions of players believed the game was nursing a gigantic hole front and centre. It has been promised that Battlefield 6 will have a solid campaign like the one of days gone by, but the proof will be in the pudding.</p>







<h3 id="h-another-realistic-theatre-of-war">Another Realistic Theatre of War</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>It wasn’t just the campaign that was gritty and raw – it was the entire war itself. From map to map, players experienced the brutality and totality of the Second World War, travelling from Africa to France and from Norway to Japan. In Battlefield 2042, the lack of ‘realism’ was an issue, as up until that point, Battlefield had more or less become synonymous with the realistic portrayal of war.</p>



<p>With the introduction of robot dogs, fantastical wing suits, instant zip-lines, and all manner of futuristic technology, Battlefield 2042 – for a while – didn’t feel like Battlefield at all. If Battlefield 6 is going to succeed, I’d like to suggest that it’ll be because it’s rooted in realism, whether that be modern combat or another revisiting of an older conflict.</p>



<p>The early trailer released to showcase pre-alpha gameplay of Battlefield 6 led us to believe that it’ll be set in a present-day theatre of war, which is good.</p>







<h3 id="h-squads-soldiers-and-platoons">Squads, Soldiers, and Platoons</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Battlefield 5 was much better for the player who <strong>loved </strong>Battlefield. It allowed them to form ‘Platoons’, it encouraged better squad-based play and saw players fill leadership roles, and it didn’t need to rely on Specialists (all with unique abilities, like a ‘hero shooter’) to fill out the ranks.</p>



<p>Many of these elements didn’t port over to Battlefield 2042, and it felt for a while like EA had stripped the community aspects from the series.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[I Wish Games Still Had Interesting Companion Apps]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/wish-games-still-had-companion-apps/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-wish-games-still-had-interesting-companion-apps.1104405/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/wish-games-still-had-companion-apps/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>I had a burst of nostalgia the other day. I was playing Dying Light to celebrate the game’s 10th anniversary and my mind flicked back to when the game was fresh on the market. One of my fondest memories of Dying Light is the game’s super helpful <strong>companion app</strong>, which allowed users to send scouts on virtual missions, which they’d claim rewards for later when they played the base game.</p>



<p>It had a few more features besides that, and it was a neat way to stay connected, still experience Dying Light’s universe on the go, and earn rewards without touching the game itself. It was discontinued a couple of years ago, but playing Dying Light got me thinking about the best companion apps for games that have long since disappeared.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-beyond-the-numbers">Beyond The Numbers</h2>



<p>I’m not just talking about <strong>stat trackers</strong>, by the way – they’re a dime a dozen. Everything from League of Legends to World of Warcraft, and from EA FC to Destiny has a companion app, most of which is focused on tracking events, managing minor inventory mechanics, accessing account information, and sending messages in-game.</p>



<p>I miss when the best companion apps felt like games themselves – miniature versions of a top-tier title that would allow you to truly stay connected long after you’d logged off.</p>



<p>Dying Light’s companion app was a perfect example of this.</p>



<p>Players could utilise the app to run missions, arrange scouts to travel to the most dangerous parts of the game’s world, and progress through a chain of missions with progressively better rewards. They’d need to make sure they were picking the right runner for the job, and the rewards they scavenged could be collected later in the game.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Dying Light had a brilliant companion app</figcaption></figure>







<p>Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag had a similar mechanic.</p>



<p>The companion app for Black Flag was stellar, allowing users to control a full-fledged fleet of ships, sending them around the world on a multitude of missions. It was discontinued in 2015, but while it was online, it offered another angle to experience the pirating adventures found at the heart of this monumental Assassin’s Creed title.</p>



<p>It was inherently linked to the game, too. As you played Black Flag and added ships to your fleet, you could command those ships in real time through the companion app. Then, you could log into the game later on and reap the rewards of those missions.</p>



<p>GTA 5’s ‘iFruit’ app was also quite good. It featured mini-games that the player could use to train Chop, an in-game dog that belonged to Franklin Clinton, one of the game’s protagonists. It was entertaining enough, featuring three basic games and some additional features like car customisation and a stat tracker.</p>



<p>Sadly, it was discontinued in 2022, almost a decade after it surfaced alongside GTA 5. Will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-gta-6-coming-out-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA 6</a> have another version, considering it’s very social media-heavy?</p>



<h2 id="h-run-of-the-mill">Run of the Mill</h2>



<p>Most games that have a companion app typically offer a no-frills experience that might feature a codex, an interactive map, or some kind of news feed mechanic. The best example of this is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-2-has-set-another-new-all-time-peak-record-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>, which features just that. The map is nice enough, but it’s the most common thing for companion apps to feature.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Function over form, that’s for sure</figcaption></figure>







<p>How about if Red Dead Online had a companion app through which you could send bandits or buddies on missions while you were offline, allowing them to gather resources and cash for you to use when you next played? I mean, RDO is another microtransaction-packed game, so it’s unlikely that would happen – Rockstar wants you to purchase those gold bars.</p>



<p>Don’t get me wrong, some companion apps without engaging features like this are still plenty helpful. There’s a nice <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-escape-from-tarkov-wipe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Escape from Tarkov</a> companion app <a href="https://www.overwolf.com/app/treestn-tarkov_companion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">from Overwolf</a> with interactive maps, quest trackers, and guides for weapon presets and information on the latest updates. In a game that’s as complex as Tarkov, that’s a <strong>very welcome </strong>addition.</p>



<p>But imagine if you could use a companion app to ‘automatically’ run ‘Scav’ raids, having a timer count down at the end of which you’d see the loot secured by a Scav – if they were successful. It’d be a spin-wheel mechanic that would have a different result every time, and I could see Battlestate Games charging for ‘extra Scavs’, but I think it’d be a hit.</p>



<p>Nobody likes running Scavs <strong>really</strong>, so if you confine them to a companion app, allowing players to run them while in a regular PMC raid, everyone is happy.</p>



<p>I don’t know if I’m being hit with nostalgia or if there’s a genuine demand out there for better, more immersive companion apps.</p>



<p>It’s probably just me…</p>



<p>Let me know if there’s a particular app you enjoy using on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/fateforge-chronicles-of-kaan-and-epic-adventure-in-bite-sized-chunks<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><i>Naske, our emissary, has been taken captive and we've been summoned to get her back. She's being held in the city of Easafir, a far cry from our humble forest home. Her plea for help suggests this might be more than just a rescue mission, and her captor might have designs on a larger prize unless we can stop them.</i></p>

<p><em>Fateforge Chronicles of Kaan </em>was a successful Kickstarter back in 2022, and this month, they're launching the next KS for the second printing of the core set, and a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mightyboards/fateforge-chronicles-of-kaan-second-print-and-new-expansion" rel="nofollow">new expansion</a>. In this review though, we're just looking at the core&nbsp;<em>Fateforge Chronicles of Kaan</em> set. While this is our first foray into <em>Fateforge Chronicles of Kaan</em>, we've covered Mighty Boards products before. One of my earliest tabletop reviews on TechRaptor was the awesome <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/vengeance-review-so-any-more-subordinates-for-me-to-kill" rel="nofollow">Vengeance</a>. Along with the board game we're reviewing here, <em>Fateforge</em> also has a tabletop RPG and upcoming video game, which you can check out <a href="https://fateforge.org/en" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p><em>Fateforge Chronicles of Kaan </em>is&nbsp;an app-driven narrative cooperative adventure game that can be played solo, or with up to 4 players. Each player picks a character, and the app then guides you through a series of narrative options, battles, and side quests. Mighty Boards have deliberately focused the different elements into manageable chunks, with each combat taking around an hour, including set up, and the exploration and side quest elements between 15 and 30 mins.</p>

<p>The core<i>&nbsp;</i><em>Fateforge Chronicles of Kaan </em>set has 5 character options that most will recognize as fantasy archetypes. There's the Mercenary, Rogue, Forest Guard, Shaman, and Noble. Each has their own unique dice pool and style of play, along with character development along the way. The Forest Guard for example starts with 3 blue and 1 green dice, blue for ranged combat and green for intelligence. The dice themselves have different icons for movement, ranged and melee combat, misses, and also focus which can be used to activate skills and abilities.</p>

<p>During each combat turn, all players roll 4 dice which will indicate what actions they can do during their turn. Certain abilities will let you reroll misses and convert some icons into others. The shaman's power chant for example can turn a miss into a focus, which they can then use to heal other party members. As the characters develop, you'll be able to change your dice pool and add more abilities to give you better options and more powerful attacks.</p>

<p>The <em>Fateforge Chronicles of Kaan </em>app takes players through the story, detailing all the narrative elements and offering choices as players progress. It also details how combat missions are set up, and regulates the actions of the enemies, which are controlled by AI scripts on cards. I found the AI controls for the enemies to be extremely well handled. Most maps are close enough that you could feel the pressure of the enemies, and although they could be worked around (some enemies don't move, and will only attack if you're in their or an adjacent zone), it felt in keeping with the story.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I felt that the game did suffer from what all app-driven games suffer from, and that's the feeling that sometimes it could all be done on the app, or none of it, and the transition between the two, especially in combat can feel a little jarring. I forgot to progress the app during combat a few times, following the combat phase stages until the reaction phase of the enemies, which is detailed by the app. It does progress the narrative well, and the way it remembers and changes the narrative based on your actions is difficult to do with pure physical components.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, Mighty Boards have deliberately managed the timing of combats and narrative sessions in&nbsp;<em>Fateforge Chronicles of Kaan</em>, and the pacing feels great. In a full gaming night, you can get through several combats and their linked events, or if you're only able to meet for an hour or so, you can move slowly through the campaign that way and it won't feel like your campaign is stagnating if you can't meet for longer sessions.</p>

<p>The game is challenging as well, and your health doesn't fully regenerate between combats, making you manage it between combats, or deal with the scenarios differently. If you're low on health, you will have to choose to miss objectives, just punch straight through to the exit, or be a lot more tactical in avoiding combat and enemies. My Rogue and Forest Guard combination sees the Rogue rushing forward, stunning and removing enemies, and the Forest Guard trying to take out the rest at range. They had no healing between them, so if the Rogue's stealth failed and she took a beating, it meant us trying to avoid combat for the rest of that scenario, and possibly the next.</p>

<p>The story itself is a lot more engaging than I thought it would be, and the city itself, the characters you meet, and the choices you make feel very impactful, and is probably as close as you could get to a full roleplaying game without a Games Master.</p>

<p>I was surprised by&nbsp;<em>Fateforge Chronicles of Kaan. </em>I thought the dice combat was going to be annoying (I usually prefer to just choose my actions), but the different skills and abilities as you level up make it a unique and challenging puzzle, and although the enemies have set AI controls that can be worked around, it feels like part of the game. The setup and play time is fast and the story is extremely rewarding, and each of the different character options feels unique, and their development, along with that of the core narrative is extremely engaging.</p>

<p>The app is very prevalent, so if app-driven content isn't your thing, you can't avoid it here, but it does add to the game well, and although it does feel like the entire thing could be done digitally, without the need for physical components, having that physical element, especially with 2 to 4 players, helps keep it grounded in the moment.&nbsp;</p>
