<p>The developers of Pokémon TCG Pocket, DeNA, have revealed that they are aiming to release a ‘major update’ in 2025. </p>



<p>During the latest earnings <a href="https://ssl4.eir-parts.net/doc/2432/ir_material3/256980/00.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report</a>, DeNA revealed several details about Pokémon TCG Pocket’s progress over Q1 FY2025 and their future actions. The report states that average monthly active users for the first quarter were approximately 39 million. Close to 60% of the virtual currency consumption came from international markets, and subscriptions are seeing “steady demand”.</p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-tcg-pocket-s-major-update-will-focus-on-retention-and-login-frequency">Pokémon TCG Pocket’s Major Update will Focus on Retention and Login Frequency</h2>



<p>Regarding future actions, DeNA states that “New user acquisition remains steady”; however, the retention rate of existing users is decreasing compared to the initial launch period. Maintaining a monthly active user base has become a priority for them. The developers have recognised “initiatives to improve retention rate and login frequency, such as enhancement of collection experience.”</p>



<p>The developers are now planning and developing a “major update” for Pokémon TCG Pocket, which will focus on improving the retention rate and login frequency of users. The details of this update will be announced later; however, we do know that DeNA is planning to release it “within this calendar year”. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-is-getting-the-skywalker-saga-treatment-its-claimed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lego-batman-is-getting-the-skywalker-saga-treatment-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1266852/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A recent claim suggests that a LEGO Batman game inspired by LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is scheduled to release in 2026. </p>



<p>The last LEGO title players received was Horizon Adventures, based on PlayStation’s popular series. Since then, we have received a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-party-announced-for-september-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release date</a> for a new game, LEGO Party, which is an upcoming 4-player party game. Now, reports indicate that a LEGO Batman game is in development, scheduled for release in 2026. </p>



<h2 id="h-lego-batman-will-cover-multiple-movies-in-skywalker-saga-style">LEGO Batman Will Cover Multiple Movies in Skywalker Saga Style</h2>



<p>Details about the LEGO Batman title, following the style of The Skywalker Saga, come from LEGO Game News on <a href="https://x.com/LEGOTtNewsI/status/1954565600816107616" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter). The account had previously reported on a <a href="https://x.com/legottnewsi/status/1947420735846420926" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">rumour</a> that stated the next LEGO game by TT Games will follow multiple movies based on Batman. Moreover, the game could potentially be revealed at Gamescom 2025’s Opening Night Live. </p>



<p>Their new post follows up on the previous rumour, stating “The next Game is a Skywalker Saga styled LEGO Batman that is not connected to the original trilogy (Due Spring 2026).” In the comment section, the user has also stated that there’s a strong chance that this game will feature “one Gotham city and you can choose the era.”</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>ICYM: Here’s an overall review of the 2023 TT Games RUMORS that occurred in January of that year with little more extra context. </p><p> – LEGO Disney and the LEGO Marvel Guardians Game was cancelled</p><p> – A ‘Skywalker Saga’ styled LEGO Harry Potter Game was in the pitch stage, but… <a href="https://t.co/1Pz5PCH2xH">pic.twitter.com/1Pz5PCH2xH</a></p></div>— LEGO Games News (@LEGOTtNewsI) <a href="https://twitter.com/LEGOTtNewsI/status/1954565600816107616?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 10, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga was a title that allowed players to start playing from any trilogy and included all nine films. Players were also able to visit different popular locales from the Skywalker Saga films, with the game allowing them to unlock and explore 23 other planets. </p>



<p>The same post also provides players with information on other LEGO games that were cancelled. It seems LEGO Disney and LEGO Marvel Guardians of the Galaxy were scrapped. Furthermore, there was also “A ‘Skywalker Saga’ styled LEGO Harry Potter Game” being pitched, but it never went past it.” Players should approach these details about the LEGO Batman game and other titles cautiously, as they lack official confirmation.</p>



<p>In other news, a LEGO Nintendo Game Boy set is scheduled for release in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-nintendo-game-boy-price-pre-order/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">early October</a>. Also, here’s Insider Gaming’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-party-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-on preview</a> of LEGO  Party!

            <title><![CDATA[Crossfire: Rainbow Is a Horror-Themed New Entry in the Shooter Franchise]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/crossfire-rainbow-horror-themed-new-entry-shooter-franchise/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/crossfire-rainbow-is-a-horror-themed-new-entry-in-the-shooter-franchise.1266846/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Crossfire franchise is about to expand with a new installment that looks very different from most of its predecessors. The series was created by Smilegate in 2007 and had enormous success, especially in China, as a tactical first-person shooter centered on objective-oriented game modes. For a while, it was even reportedly the most played game in the world before League of Legends surpassed it in 2017.</p>



<p>Smilegate tried to conquer the West, too, with CrossfireX, a new entry made specifically for the Xbox One and Xbox Series S|X consoles with the help of Remedy Entertainment, who handled the single player campaign portions. The single player was premium, while multiplayer was free-to-play. Even so, CrossfireX  utterly failed, receiving negative scores from critics and shutting down around fifteen months after its launch. Here on Wccftech, Kai Tatsumoto <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/crossfirex-no-remedy-for-global-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rated the game 4/10</a>:</p>



<p><em>Remedy’s inclusion into CrossfireX’s single-player campaign is perhaps the best part of the package that I could recommend. With extremely dated multiplayer mechanics that have been bandaged up with all of the modern retention techniques to keep players coming back to the mediocre shooter fare, CrossfireX is certainly a title that I wouldn’t be looking to recommend for anyone looking for their weekend FPS fix. Once you take away Remedy’s campaign offerings and look purely at Smilegate Entertainment’s multiplayer component, you’re left with a shooter mode that ultimately feels cheap despite how much effort is spent into extracting money and time from the player.</em></p>



<p>After that attempt, Smilegate tried a real-time strategy game called <a href="https://wccftech.com/crossfire-legion-full-version-release-date-free-weekend/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crossfire: Legion</a> and made by the franchise veterans at Blackbird Interactive (Homeworld 3). That game received better reviews but didn't really gain a fanbase, either, and will be delisted next week on Steam.</p>



<p>Now, Smilegate has unveiled a new title called Crossfire: Rainbow. This is once again a first-person tactical shooter, but with a heavy horror theme, from the looks of it. It also only shows the main player, suggesting this won't be an online title, although it may still have multiplayer modes for all we know.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Indeed, only scant details are available online at this time, although an official website can be found <a href="https://cfh.qq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. We'll monitor any new information worth reporting on this intriguing project. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The first Battlefield 6 open beta has ended after an intense weekend of record-breaking action, but that’s not the end of the line for the game. Electronic Arts has lined up a second test that’ll come later this week, but <strong>when does the Battlefield 6 beta end </strong>for good? And when it does, what are your options?</p>



<p>Read on to learn everything you need to know about the Battlefield 6 beta end times and where it goes from there.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-beta-end-times">Battlefield 6 Beta End Times</h2>



<p>The next Battlefield 6 open beta is scheduled to run from August 14 (08:00 UTC) to August 18 (08:00 UTC). That means the end time for the next Battlefield 6 open beta is at 01:00 PT / 04:00 AM ET on August 18. You’ll get an entire four-day window to play Battlefield 6, but it could be your last chance until the game comes out on October 10.</p>



<p>That brings me to your options going forward.</p>



<p>Once you’ve enjoyed the Battlefield 6 beta, you’re free to sit back and wait until October to get your hands on the full game, <strong>or </strong>you can try your luck with Battlefield Labs, which <strong>should </strong>reopen following the end of the Battlefield 6 beta.</p>



<p>Here’s a guide explaining <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-sign-up-for-battlefield-labs/">how to get into Battlefield Labs</a>.</p>



<p>The Battlefield 6 beta went nuts during the first weekend of play, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-battlefield-6-conucrrent/">more than 500,000 players</a> joining the fun on Steam <strong>alone</strong>. It skyrocketed on platforms like Twitch, hitting almost 900,000 concurrent viewers, far more than any Call of Duty game (except Warzone) has ever managed.</p>



<p>The second round of the Battlefield 6 beta isn’t expected to be any different from the first, but feedback gathered during the opening window will help shape some of the balancing tactics going into the second stage.</p>



<p>Have you already been enjoying the game and are wondering when the Battlefield 6 beta ends? Let me know if you’re disappointed that it’ll be over soon on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bioware-wanted-a-dragon-age-trilogy-remaster-but-ea-wouldn%E2%80%99t-fund-it.1266828/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Dragon Age, like Mass Effect, didn’t have the best time when its most recent title was released. In October 2024, BioWare and Electronic Arts dropped Dragon Age: Veilguard, which wasn’t well received by audiences, much like 2017’s Mass Effect: Andromeda. However, Mass Effect has an advantage over Dragon Age in that the series boasts a trilogy remaster.</p>



<p>When recently challenged on why Dragon Age doesn’t have a trilogy remaster, or a ‘Legendary Edition’, former BioWare executive producer of more than 20 years, Mark Darrah, explained what’s up.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-do-it-with-the-money-you-have">‘Do It With The Money You Have’</h2>



<p>Mark Darrah departed BioWare in 2022 after spending 24 years rising through the ranks at the company. He saw some of the most popular games of certain eras go out the doors at BioWare, including the Mass Effect ‘quadrilogy’ and every Dragon Age game bar last year’s Veilguard.</p>



<p>In a recent interview with MrMattyPlays, Darrah got onto the topic of a Dragon Age trilogy remaster (not remake) in the vein of the Mass Effect Legendary Edition, explaining why it probably won’t ever be a thing:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I honestly think they should do – I don’t think they will – but I think they should do a remaster of the first three. One of the things we pitched at one point, pretty softly, was to retroactively rebrand the first three games as if they were a trilogy and call it the Champion’s Trilogy.</p>



<p>Maybe you do that, and as a first step, you take those three games (and maybe Veilguard), you shine them up, you re-release them, probably remaster, not a remake, see what happens, and then maybe go from there.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Darrah highlighted the stark similarities between the ‘states’ of the Mass Effect franchise and the Dragon Age franchise, but admitted that the latter is much harder to remaster than the former. Not only that, but there’s <strong>no money </strong>coming from EA to support the idea:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>EA has said this publically, they’re kind of against remasters. I don’t really know why, it’s strange for a publically-traded company to seem to be against free money, but they seem to be against it, so that’s part of it.</p>



<p>The other problem is that Dragon Age is harder than Mass Effect to do.</p>



<p>One of the earliest things was, let’s do Frostbite Tools, and then let’s find a mod house that seems talented and just uplift them and pay them to do a remake of Dragon Age Origins.</p>



<p>There were lots of pitches around it, is there a way we can bring Dragon Age Origins forward?</p>



<p>The studios ruin their financials within themselves. I think, to some degree, EA’s stance was, ‘Sure, go ahead and do it, but do it with the money you already have.’ We couldn’t do it with the money that we already have, because we’re doing all these other things.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The full interview can be seen here:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>Dragon Age: Veilguard scored well in the review stakes when it was released last year, but failed to resonate with the general audience, as reflected in its low aggregate scores on platforms like Steam. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-refused-pitches-for-dragon-age-origins-remake-or-remasters.1266696/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In a fresh interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pd9OG3HmN0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with YouTuber MrMattyPlays</a>, former BioWare veteran Mark Darrah revealed that Electronic Arts refused several pitches from the studio to remake or remaster Dragon Age: Origins and, potentially, the second and third game, too. </p>



<p><em>I'm not pitching a Dragon Age to EA right now. I don't know what I'd want to do, to be honest, to go forward with it. I mean, I honestly think they should do - I don't think they will, but I think they should do a remaster of the first three. One of the things that we pitched at one point, pretty softly so pitch is a massive overstatement, was to kind of retroactively rebrand the first three games as if they were a trilogy. We'd call it the Champions trilogy, so you have these big, larger-than-life heroes. You've got the Hero of Ferelden, you've got the Champion of Kirkwall, and then you've got the Inquisitor. I think as a first step, you take those three games, and maybe Veilguard, you shine them up, re-release them, and see what happens and go from there.</em></p>



<p>Darrah, an Executive Producer on the first three Dragon Age games and <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-mass-effect-team-helping-mark-darrah-advisor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a consultant on the fourth</a>, said that the publisher has been historically reluctant to do remasters. While they did the successful <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-legendary-edition-pc-highest-concurrent-player-count/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mass Effect Legendary Edition</a> a while ago, that was made easier by the fact that all those games were powered by Unreal Engine technology, whereas Dragon Age: Origins was powered by the proprietary Eclipse Engine, DAII by the Lycium Engine (an upgraded version of the Eclipse), and Inquisition by Frostbite.</p>



<p><em>EA has historically been, and I don't really know why but they've even said this publicly, they're kind of against remasters. I don't really know why. It's strange for a publicly traded company to basically be against free money, but they seem to be against it. That's part of it. The other problem is that Dragon Age is harder than Mass Effect to do; to some degree, unknowably harder. Maybe only a little bit harder, maybe a lot harder.</em></p>



<p><em>One of the very earliest things for Joplin was, let's do Frostbite tools, and then let's find a mod house that seems talented and just uplift them and pay them to do a remake of Dragon Age: Origins. There were lots of pitches around, 'Is there a way we can bring Dragon: Age Origins forward?'</em></p>

            <p>If you've been wondering just how <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>'s Secure Boot requirement and anti-cheat system Javelin have been holding up during Battlefield 6's gargantuan open beta test, AC from EA's Anti-Cheat team has revealed that during the Open Beta alone, Javelin has blocked over 300,000 attempted cheat efforts and reviewed 100K+ potential cheaters.</p>
<p>"Your reports help us zero in and lead us to finding up-and-coming cheat communities, reporting one actual cheater often can lead to new detection techniques and help us keep them from impacting your experience," <a href="https://forums.ea.com/discussions/battlefield-6-beta-feedback-en/update-battlefield-6-update-on-secure-boot--cheats/12439803">AC explained in a forum post updated over the weekend</a>. "Anti-Cheat isn't one and done, it's an ever-evolving battlefield, and what has worked for us previously or in different games doesn't always work in all of them."</p>

<p>"Since Open Beta Early Access’s launch, Javelin has prevented 330,000 attempts to cheat or tamper with anti-cheat controls, and [players have] reported 44,000 instances of potential cheaters during day one and another 60,000 so far today," AC added.</p>
<p>"We are already using these with our own Gameplay Integrity team to add and improve our detections for Battlefield 6. They are also working with the Battlefield Positive Play team, to actively remove those reported we confirm to be cheaters."</p>
<p>For those wondering why DICE was requiring Secure Boot in the first place, AC explained that Secure Boot "is not, and was not intended to be a silver bullet".</p>
<p>"Secure Boot is how you're helping us build up our arsenal. It’s another barrier that helps us make it harder for cheat developers to create cheat programs, and makes it easier for us to detect it when they do," AC wrote.</p>
<p>"Secure Boot prevents your machine from running with vulnerable drivers enabled. So if Secure Boot is running and we see those drivers loaded, we know something's a bit off."</p>
<p>Battlefield 6, is set to release on the 10th October. Everyone who requested access to Battlefield 6's Labs tests has been given access to these weekend tests, which - it turns out - is a lot of people. Don't worry if you can't get on this weekend, though; <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1954200952455544937">you can still complete the Weekend 1 challenges next week</a>, too.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6s-multiplayer-takes-a-bold-risky-new-direction">Connor's already spent some quality time with the highly-anticipated shooter, writing</a>: "[Playing Battlefield 6] leaves me in a state of cautious optimism. I think the building blocks for a truly fantastic Battlefield game are here with Battlefield 6 - perhaps even an all-time great - but I need to see a little more, need to play a little more. I need to see where the dice fall, whether the gamble of bold gameplay changes land well - where the hivemind of Battlefield's playerbase find new strategies beyond the this-beats-that approach of old, say - or whether they simply muddy an otherwise potentially brilliant experience."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6s-anti-cheat-system-has-already-prevented-330000-attempts-to-cheat-or-tamper-with-anti-cheat-controls]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Microsoft has "assured players that Turn 10 and Playground Games will continue to support Forza Motorsport and Forza Horizon 5".</p>
<p>In the wake of brutal cuts which saw <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-june-2025-tracking-the-situation-as-it-happens">over 9000 employees laid off from Microsoft last month</a>, including across its gaming divisions, the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rares-everwild-reportedly-cancelled-following-xbox-job-cuts">Rare's Everwild</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-and-new-zenimax-mmorpg-reportedly-cancelled-as-part-of-latest-microsoft-cuts">The Initiative's Perfect Dark reboot, and a new ZeniMax MMORPG were all cancelled</a>, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/candy-crush-developer-king-reportedly-replacing-laid-off-staff-with-ai-tools-they-helped-to-build">roughly 200 staff from Candy Crush developer King were laid off</a> and reportedly replaced by the AI tools they helped to build.</p>
<p>At the time, Microsoft told Eurogamer the layoffs were "necessary to position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace". A few days later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/forza-motorsport-is-no-more-claims-former-turn-10-employee-following-microsoft-cuts">we reported Forza Motorsport was "no more", according to a former employee at developer Turn 10 Studios</a>, though it was emphasised that the Horizon series will continue.</p>

<p>Now Microsoft has again stressed that support is ongoing, writing on social media: "Dear Forza Community, we know many of you have questions about what’s next for the Forza franchise, and we appreciate the support of our incredible community.</p>
<p>"We wanted to assure players that Turn 10 and Playground Games will continue to support Forza Motorsport and Forza Horizon 5. To start, here’s more info about what’s coming next to Forza Motorsport". The post then linked to a <a href="http://aka.ms/FMUpdate21Tours">webpage</a>.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Dear Forza Community, we know many of you have questions about what’s next for the Forza franchise, and we appreciate the support of our incredible community.

<p>Interestingly, Microsoft didn't outline what's next for the Horizon franchise, only pledged commitment to the latest in the series, Forza Horizon 5. As racing driver and content creator Steve Alvarez Brown, aka SuperGT, <a href="https://x.com/_SuperGT/status/1953515312621449397">pointed</a> out, "this offers zero clarity as to whether Forza Motorsport will continue beyond the current game."</p>
<p>Last month, we learned <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon-5">Forza Horizon 5</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-xbox-console-exclusive-forza-horizon-5-is-ps5s-highest-selling-game-of-the-year-so-far-says-analyst">was the highest-selling game on PS5 this year so far, surpassing 3 million copies sold</a>. Though previously an Xbox-exclusive, Forza Horizon 5 released on Sony's rival platform at the end of April.</p>
<p>By comparison, Forza Horizon 5 has been played by more than 45.5 million players across Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S, though predominantly via the Game Pass subscription, since its release in 2021. On Steam, it's sold a further 6.5m copies (also since 2021).</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-stresses-it-will-continue-to-support-forza-motorsport-and-horizon-5-despite-cuts-at-studio-turn-10]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-where-on-earth-are-the-switch-2-soundtracks-on-nintendo-music</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/talking-point-where-on-earth-are-the-switch-2-soundtracks-on-nintendo-music.1266651/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Music" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/499efa333a40a/nintendo-music.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life / Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p><em>Ohhhhh, Zeebraaaa, Zeebraaaaa, ZEEBRAAAAA!~</em></p>
<p>Here I am, tapping out once again to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6E0eAReCvU">the Zebra Bananza theme</a>. It's a song fit for Carnival, a blend of styles from all across Latin America — the Brazilian Samba, the Cuban Salsa, the Argentinian Tango. Every time DK beats his chest and transforms into the buffest Zebra you've ever seen, I attempt to sing along with Pauline, even though I don't understand the Kong language.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> is a game all about music, but if I want to go and listen to it on my downtime or while out for a drive? Well, it's time to pull out the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_music">Nintendo Music</a> app and rock ou... wait, <em>it's not on there?</em></p>
<p>Nintendo has a rich musical history, one that it's gradually celebrating and acknowledging via this app, which it introduced last year for NSO subscribers. It's a nice little bonus if you're already playing for those SNES and Game Boy games on your Switch.</p>
<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2be9e29c54860/donkey-kong-bananza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life / Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ideally, I'd rather Nintendo just released its music on the likes of Spotify and Apple, but I completely understand that the company wants complete control of its extensive library. And it's done a good job of supporting it with weekly updates to the library from its deep catalogue of tunes. This week, we got <em>all</em> of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/pilotwings">Pilotwings</a> music, not just the SNES one. Last week, it was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/mario_paint">Mario Paint</a> to coincide with the NSO release. I regularly pop on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/super_mario_galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> in the car.</p>
<p>But Nintendo is missing a trick. We know there's a gold mine of music to dig out from the archives, and far too many omissions to highlight. But where's the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> soundtrack? Where's the multi-genre delights of the Switch 2's launch game?</p>
<p>Mario Kart World is already two months old, yet if I'm jonesing to jig down the streets to the funky sounds of Crown City or sway to the smooth and slow arrangement of Steam Gardens, I have to go to YouTube in the hopes that fan uploads haven't been taken down yet.</p>

<p>When publishers, developers, and composers choose to share and sell their music is obviously up to them. Big hitters like <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/death_stranding_2_on_the_beach">Death Stranding 2</a> drop their OSTs the same day as the game is out. Atlus is particularly good at getting its soundtracks up as soon as possible; <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/raidou-remastered-the-mystery-of-the-soulless-army">Raidou Remastered</a> was available on launch day, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a> followed its PlayStation and Xbox release just a few months later. And there are so many indie titles that you can stream day-and-date, <a href="https://bandcamp.com/discover/video-game">or pick up on Bandcamp</a>.</p>
<p>The newest game soundtrack on Nintendo Music is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_4">Pikmin 4</a>'s, composed by Kenta Nagata, Asuka Hayazaki, and Soshi Abe — although you wouldn't know that from the app because the composers aren't credited. That game is two years old at this point; can you even buy the soundtrack in a store or online? Well, unless you can find and splash out on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C7mqZKKPr9F/?img_index=1">this lovely Mother Onion limited vinyl</a>, which contains 14 of the game's tracks? Nope. Admittedly, Nintendo is doing a lot better than it was when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-video-game-music-is-more-popular-than-ever-so-why-is-nintendo-so-behind">I ranted about video game music three years ago</a>. But its music app strategy is odd to me.</p>
<p>I don't really expect them to turn around and pop DK Bananza on there on Tuesday — that game just came out, and companies like Square Enix often wait a few months, sometimes years, before sharing game music on streaming services. I don't blame anyone for holding back on DK's melodic magic for a few months. But what better way to share the magic of something like Mario Kart World's open roads than dropping the Super Bell Hill rearrangement or the title music on the app? You don't even need to put the whole thing on there.</p>

<p>In the grand scheme of things, it's really just a tiny drop of annoyance in an ocean of problems. I care more about crediting artists, composers, and arrangers than having the shiny new music on my app, which I don't have to pay extra money for. And look, if Nintendo wants to charge an extra buck or two a month for NSO just to stick the brand new Switch 2 soundtracks on there? I'd consider it.</p>
<p>Nintendo could even pull a big Mario Paint and drop GameCube soundtracks along with NSO drops. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker">Wind Waker</a> is already available, but we're missing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/mario_smash_football">Super Mario Strikers</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/f-zero_gx">F-Zero GX</a>. Imagine getting both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/fire_emblem_path_of_radiance">Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</a> and its excellent soundtrack on the same day.</p>
<p>I do think Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bananza's music will eventually come to the app. It might take months, maybe a year, but they'll be there. More GameCube titles will also get their time in the sunlight, hopefully paired with their Nintendo Online release.</p>
<figure><a title="Mario Kart World Dino Dino Jungle" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e35b0117669f5/mario-kart-world-dino-dino-jungle.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life / Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I'd still love Nintendo to be a bit more proactive with its music, though. A video of the Kong Bananza song, complete with lyrics, on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_today">Nintendo Today</a> just isn't going to cut it. I need the Freezer Layer song to sparkle in my ears, or the Forest Layer theme to chill out to.</p>
<p>Plus, we've got a contender for one of the best soundtracks of the year in Mario Kart World, and maybe one of Nintendo's best OSTs of all-time, yet I can't even go out and buy the soundtrack, or any of the songs. Without fans, I'd be left scrambling to try and find how to listen to this music outside of the game. Is that really what video game music deserves?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>One player has gone viral for spending an astonishing $32,000 in NBA 2K25 in just five months on microtransactions.</p>



<p>The clip was posted to <a href="https://x.com/Troydan/status/1953657155896095112" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a>, which showed YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@2KOGGaming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">2KOG</a> going through his microtransaction purchases for NBA 2K25 on the PlayStation Store, where he revealed that he’s spent an astonishing $32,831.68 on the game.</p>



<p>The clip reveals that transactions started on March 31, 2025, and ended on August 5, 2025, the date the clip was recorded. All of the transactions are for the game’s Virtual Currency Pack, with the highest costing $160.48 each.</p>



<p>You can watch the full clip below:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The YouTuber himself revealed that he’s learned his lesson from spending such a large amount of money, and warned others that it’s not worth chasing cards or spending large amounts of money for content creation. </p>



<p>What’s worse is that despite him spending $32,000, he’s still not obtained all of the best cards in the game. In fact, just by watching his video, he would probably need to spend an equal amount of money to get near completion.</p>



<p>“One things for sure, I will not spend this much again, because you don’t get rewarded for it. As much as I spent, I should have everything in the game, but it’s not even close,” he said. </p>



<p>NBA 2K26 also releases on Setpember 5, 2025, which will make all of his purchases pretty useless if he was to move on to the next game.</p>

<p>Someone's sitting there, mate</p>
<p><strong>Version Reviewed:</strong> European</p>
</section><section><p>I'm the type of introvert who's made an art of choosing the right seat in public places. With such honed skills, I assumed a puzzler like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/is_this_seat_taken">Is This Seat Taken?</a> would be second nature, and I was <em>mostly</em> right. This adorable indie might not bring anything radical to the table, but it's a perfectly pleasant pick-up-and-play experience, that will undoubtedly scratch any low-stakes puzzle itches.</p>
<p>Strung together by a loose story about a rhombus with dreams of treading the boards (yes, really), Is This Seat Taken is about organising people into the right spots so that everyone's preferences are satisfied. This might be at the cinema or museum, a taxi or a boat, but each person (well, "shape" might be more accurate) has their own conditions to meet, and they can be rather fussy.</p>
<p>Things start simple: slot this handful of shapes into a taxi, and make sure persons A and C are sitting by the window. But each stage brings a new challenge. In the cinema screen, some guests will use their phones or chat. On boats, you'll get party groups who need to be kept separate from those who just want to sightsee. And everyone wants to steer clear of guests who forgot to shower.</p>
<p>The idea of performing such feats of organisation in the real world is enough to break me out in a cold sweat, but Is This Seat Taken couldn't be more chilled. There's no timer and no punishment for putting somebody in the wrong place. Heck, you can even finish the level without everyone sitting comfortably — though you'd lose valuable 'thumbs up' points, and my respect, in the process.</p>
<p>Busier stages can feel a little trial-and-error-y, and the absence of any kind of hint system meant I had to pull everyone from their temporary places and start from scratch on more than one occasion; I would love an undo/reset button for this kind of thing. Fortunately, no puzzle outstays its welcome. I polished off every level (in which there are five or six stages) in around six hours, and stages themselves are broken down into micro-challenges, primed for anyone who wants to squeeze in 10 minutes of gaming while the pasta's cooking. It feels tailor-made for precisely this.</p>
<p>The onscreen cursor is smooth and intuitive, the characters are cute, and you can even use touchscreen controls in handheld. If it all sounds rather mobile puzzler, that's because it is — I appreciated every new challenge and tweak when I'd come back to the game, but two or three levels on the trot felt a little repetitive.</p>
<p>All in all, Is This Seat Taken is solid pick-up-and-play puzzler. It may not do anything new or unique, but the condition-meeting gameplay loop is primed for anyone after a low-stakes distraction. It won't keep you occupied for hours on end, but it'll do an almighty job of reminding you that your seating preferences are not to be scoffed at.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/is-this-seat-taken]]></content:encoded>

<p>Before we head into this week's match-up, let's have a quick reminder of what went down <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-duel-the-hobbit-gba">last weekend</a>. It was a one-on-one face-off for the GBA's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/hobbit">The Hobbit</a>, which saw the gloomy North American/European cover go up against the colourful Japanese variant. Somewhat surprisingly to us, it was the latter that walked away with a comfortable win, taking 68% of the vote and leaving the NA/EU cover with the remaining 32% — an unexpected journey indeed!</p><div><figure data-videoid="bhK3W_3CW7w" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bhK3W_3CW7w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bhK3W_3CW7w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bhK3W_3CW7w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38e97fxpzulo&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhK3W_3CW7w" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>We've got another duel on our hands this time, as we mosey over to the first (and best) WarioWare game out there: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/warioware_inc_mega_microgameusd">WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgame$!</a>. Perhaps the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/ufo-50-gets-a-surprise-shadow-drop-on-switch-today">surprise launch</a> of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ufo_50">UFO 50</a> on Switch has put minigame collections on the brain (not that UFO 50 is anything like WarioWare, mind), but it got us in the mood to look back at this GBA classic, for which there are <em>two</em> drastically different covers.</p>
<p>It's another match-up between East and West this time, so let's get into it. Ready? Vote!</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/retro/related-articles:172660 @ 1754905993 -->
<h2>North America / Europe</h2>
<figure><a title="WarioWare GBA - NA/EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4f68052b54add/warioware-gba-naeu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/3917-warioware-inc-mega-microgame">Nintendo / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Gosh, talk about iconic covers, eh? The design used in Europe and North America is all about colour. The WarioWare logo is put front and centre, but Wario and all of his minigame crew take up sections around it, with their distinct looks and bright colouring making each and every one a real eye-catcher.</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure><a title="WarioWare GBA - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a1e4db5c6cfff/warioware-gba-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/3917-warioware-inc-mega-microgame">Nintendo / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Japanese cover goes for something... different. Gone is the <em>in-your-face</em> colour and multiple characters, here replaced by a calming light blue background, with Wario's distinct facial features adorning the middle. It's nothing like as hectic, nor as eye-catching, we'd say, but damn, it's a classy look.</p>

<p id="block-453f64e6-661d-42d2-9786-0b54c4994c69">ThrottleX is a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/8-best-roblox-games-to-play-this-summer-holiday/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox game</a> that lets players jump on a dirt bike and tear up the track. Like most games in Roblox, reward codes are bound to arrive sooner or later. Here’s everything we know so far.</p>



<h2 id="block-056631f1-ed98-4eca-b4a2-3d3e0278696e">Are There Any Active ThrottleX Codes Yet? (August 2025)</h2>

<p id="block-71facd75-48bc-4681-8b38-170ac6015e01"><strong>As of August 2025, there are no active Roblox ThrottleX codes.</strong></p>



<p id="block-5a6e016a-35cd-4f08-b847-96caa6e5c4f4">However, this likely won’t be for long, as Roblox games add new codes all the time, so check back soon to see if any have been added.</p>



<h2 id="block-cc81f0dd-6448-4e40-9013-a26c27d36bd9">How to Redeem Roblox ThrottleX Codes</h2>



<p id="block-f0fa097c-9cb5-43ac-9ccd-bff5fba6028a">To redeem codes in Roblox ThrottleX, follow the steps below:</p>



<ol id="block-a3f2ead8-16c2-48d2-9214-44dc9792f7b8">
<li><strong>Launch Roblox</strong> and then <strong>the <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/98412123623215/BETA-ThrottleX" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ThrottleX</a> game</strong>.</li>



<li><strong>Click on the ‘Codes’ option.</strong></li>



<li><strong>Type in the code you want and press Enter</strong>.</li>
</ol>



<p id="block-99f6bdc3-f646-412f-980d-0ab57bb6119b">If the code is still live, you’ll then receive the above reward. <strong>Don’t forget that every code can only be used once per player account.</strong></p>



<h2 id="block-21ed0763-3d64-40a1-9cda-f73b0be6d4e3">Are There Any Expired ThrottleX Codes?</h2>



<p id="block-4a71d319-73ea-4b45-91a4-006a34339f07"><strong>As no codes have been added to ThrottleX</strong> <strong>so none have expired yet.</strong></p>



<p id="block-8d8a8f92-42ca-4c2d-ab4b-bafeefd8d5f5">This is where we’ll keep a log of expired codes when we have some. </p>

</section></header><div><section>

<p>We heard earlier this year how <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/one_piece_pirate_warriors_4">One Piece: Pirate Warriors 4</a> would be getting more DLC, and now we've got an official update.</p>
<p>Bandai Namco and the game's developer Omega Force have revealed Character Pass 3. It contains six playable characters and is available to purchase on <strong>11th August 2025</strong>. The first part, arriving in <strong>Fall 2025</strong>, kicks off with Rob Lucci (CP0) and will be joined by two other characters.</p>
<p>In addition to this, the special survey pack (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/02/one-piece-pirate-warriors-4-is-getting-new-dlc-will-be-decided-by-fan-votes">a result of the user surveys conducted earlier this year</a>) will add Enel, King and Z in <strong>Early 2026</strong>. There'll also be a purchase bonus in the form of an additional skill for Shanks.</p>

<p>Last night, the Battlefield 6 open beta hit more than 500,000 concurrent players <strong>on Steam alone</strong>. It shattered records held by Call of Duty and pushed past 850,000 peak viewers on Twitch, widely representing the fact that <strong>Battlefield is back</strong>.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, the Battlefield team reiterated that this is the largest open beta in Battlefield history, as if we didn’t already know that. The hype is skyrocketing, the excitement is at unprecedented levels, and the future of Battlefield is (finally) looking bright.</p>

<h2 id="h-peak-times">Peak Times</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1954179027834474694" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a post</a> on social media, EA’s Battlefield Comms team wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This is Battlefield’s biggest Open Beta ever. </p>



<p>Peak time is approaching and queues will be expected. We’re working on entry times to the game, but appreciate your patience as you wait for your time to arrive. </p>



<p>We want everyone to experience a smooth and fair Open Beta, including those currently within the game too. </p>



<p>Thank you for your continued excitement for Battlefield 6’s Open Beta!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Even issues with Battlefield 6’s first cheaters haven’t hampered the fun too much. The Javelin anti-cheat engine is doing a great job at nipping that in the bud, with almost half a million attempts at cheating being caught by the system. <span>Some will inevitably</span> get through, but after many hours in the beta, I’m happy to say I’ve seen no suspicious behaviour.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 is set to drop on October 10, which could be mere weeks before the launch of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. The performance of the beta has given fans a renewed sense of adoration for the series, and there’s now a hope that this will be the year that Battlefield batters Call of Duty in the leaderboard stakes.</p>

<p>Someone at Ubisoft might have made a boo-boo by posting early about a Far Cry television series reportedly in development at FX. Eagle-eyed users spotted the post on the Ubisoft site and relayed it across social media, but the article was quickly removed and the link set to redirect to the site’s home page.</p>



<p>They weren’t fast enough for the avid internet users who captured snippets of the post, revealing some cast and crew information and a lowdown on the show’s envisioned season structure.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-darkest-and-most-absurd">‘Darkest and Most Absurd’</h2>



<p>Far Cry is a legendary series from Ubisoft, but it has been a fair few years since the series has had any time in the spotlight. Far Cry 6 emerged in 2021 and became regarded as one of the worst games in franchise history, so it seems Ubisoft is eager to take a little extra time finessing Far Cry 7 (or whatever it’ll be called).</p>



<p>In a recent post on <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ubisoft’s news site</a>, it was revealed (potentially prematurely) that a Far Cry TV show is in production at FX. The post has now been removed, but not before users could capture and share information on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/farcry/comments/1mlalqt/far_cry_series_adaptation_in_the_works_at_fx/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Mac (It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Mythic Quest, Welcome to Wrexham) and Hawley (Fargo, Alien: Earth) are the co-creators of the Far Cry series. Hawley will also serve as showrunner, while Mac is set to star in the show. The series will be executive produced by Mac, Hawley, and Jackie Cohn for More Better Productions; Michael Garcia for 26Keys Productions; Nick Frenkel for 3Arts Entertainment; and Gerard Guillemot, Margaret Boykin, and Austin Dill for Ubisoft Film &amp; Television.</p>



<p>“This collaboration is really an embarrassment of riches. Far Cry a psychological tailspin that doesn’t shy away from the darkest and most absurd parts of humanity, which aligns perfectly with FX’s bold and fearless storytelling style,” said Margaret Boykin, head of film and television content, Ubisoft Film &amp; Television.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s worth pointing out that while the article was deleted, the slug remains:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>far-cry-series-adaptation-in-the-works-at-fx</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That tells you all you need to know.</p>



<p>One of the most recent Far Cry stories to drop exclusively here at Insider Gaming concerned the extraction-based multiplayer shooter that’s in development at Ubisoft with the Far Cry name attached to it. In March, our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/far-cry-multiplayer-rebooted/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tom Henderson revealed</a> the game had been rebooted internally.</p>
