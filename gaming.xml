            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/where-is-vavaks-key-in-oratores-in-kcd2-answered/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Later in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, you’ll be tasked with getting a treasury key before a big raid can take place. It’s one of the most important steps in the run-up to one of the game’s most major missions, so it cannot be avoided. It’s simple – <strong>you need that key</strong>.</p>



<p>However, when it comes to trying to find Vavak’s key, you’ll most likely have a hard time given the size of the search area and the lack of direction towards where it might be. In this guide, I’ll tell you where and how to find Vavak’s key in Oratores, the all-important mission in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-find-vavak-s-key">How to Find Vavak’s Key</h2>



<p>Despite chatting with Christian in the guarded building in Kuttenberg, you’ll likely be searching the place for ages trying to find Vavak’s key. He doesn’t know where it is, either – it’s up to you to track it down.</p>



<p>Now, you could spend the next few minutes probing the building and the search area in a desperate attempt to find the critical key, or you could follow this guide and find it in a matter of seconds.</p>



<p>Firstly, you’ll need to get past the guards at the front of the building. If you have a high enough charisma level (and other skills are assigned), you can pass a skill check and you’ll simply be granted access to the site. It’ll surprise Christian, who is already inside, but if you did his earlier missions and aligned amicably with him, it won’t be a concern.</p>



<p>Otherwise, expect trouble – and more speech checks.</p>



<p>Now that you’re in the building, you’ll learn that Vavak has fled, but there’s a chance that the key might have been left behind. However, this building has several floors and rooms, along with plenty of chests and hidden nooks and crannies – it’ll take <strong>forever</strong> to search everything – and not everyone knows <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-lockpick-in-kingdom-come-deliverance-2/">how to pick locks</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Don’t</strong> do that.</p>



<p>Instead, head to the ground floor and out the back door, making a beeline for the toilet that sits in the rear courtyard of the building. Inside the toilet (yes, <strong>inside</strong>) you’ll find a key sticking out of a pile of waste. That’s where Vavak’s key is in Oratores – simple.</p>



<p>Once you’ve got the key, you’ll need to wash up in a trough, otherwise people will notice your stink. But that’s it – that’s how to find Vavak’s key in Oratores. Have fun!</p>

                <p>With the launch of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a>'s newest episode, Heresy, comes a brand-new way to earn loot. This time, players will be headed back to the Dreadnaught orbiting Saturn to hunt for secrets and special rewards in the Nether. Here's how it works and how players can earn rewards, including secret loot stashes.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Limited revives, ammo and health regen</h2><p dir="ltr">Nether delves are different from other activities in that player groups will have limited revives and health regeneration is disabled, meaning that players do not have passive healing after being out of combat for several seconds. Instead, enemies will drop white orbs that give back health, and all other healing effects, such as Support Frame auto rifles, Warlock Healing Rifts, and the Void Devour buff can still take effect. Special and Heavy ammo drops are also significantly reduced in this activity and can only be affected by weapon perks, armor mods, and shooting destructible pots to find more ammo.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to complete objectives in the Nether</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4439535-destiny2heresy-netherboss.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4439535" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4439535-destiny2heresy-netherboss.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4439535"></a><figcaption>A Tormentor boss in Destiny 2 channels some unknown power.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4439535-destiny2heresy-netherboss.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">When players first spawn into the Nether activity, they will notice objectives like "Destroy Weapon Systems" on the HUD. It's not immediately obvious what these are, but upon pulling out the Ghost, the HUD will show a diamond on-screen where the next objective is. Usually, these objectives will be guarded by a yellow-bar enemy with a name and a quick objective to complete around it.</p><p dir="ltr">Objectives can range from collecting pickups to defeating a miniboss, depending on which objectives were drawn for the run. They can be any of the following, or a combination of these:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Defend an objective by standing on plates or marked areas and defeating waves of incoming enemies that culminate in a miniboss.</li><li dir="ltr">Depositing relics that come from floating objects scattered around the room into a receptacle like a statue. These are marked on the HUD.</li><li dir="ltr">Popping large orange spores that glow. Typically, these are on walls and corners and they glow bright orange and pulsate. Players can deal damage to these with any weapon.</li><li dir="ltr">Defeating a large Tormentor boss protected by a small objective like destroying Taken Blights or picking up Resonance nodes.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Simply perform the objective and then collect Boons and loot at the end of each minor objective. When all three sub-objectives are complete, the boss will be vulnerable. The boss will usually consist of invincibility phases where players need to collect or destroy an object in the arena to make the boss vulnerable again. The Nether run will end upon defeating the boss, and loot will come from the last chest at the end.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to find secret loot in the Nether</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4439536-destiny2heresy-essentiapickup.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4439536" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4439536-destiny2heresy-essentiapickup.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4439536"></a><figcaption>A node of Fleeting Metastasized Essentia in Destiny 2</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4439536-destiny2heresy-essentiapickup.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There are tons of small secrets scattered around the Nether, including hidden loot and special collectibles. There are chests hidden around the entire location in corners and secret rooms that can reward materials for the Tome of Want, a seasonal armor piece, or a seasonal weapon. Here is everything that can be earned in a chest in Act 1:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Any piece of Apostate’s Blade armor; Arms, chest, legs, or class item.</li><li dir="ltr">Adamantite, a Strand Support Frame auto rifle.</li><li dir="ltr">Psychopomp, an Area Denial Frame grenade launcher.</li><li dir="ltr">Abyssal Edge, a Wave Frame heavy sword.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">There are also Metastasized Essentia nodes, large black and white spiked orbs that can be picked up for materials for the Shaping Mirror in Eris' apartment in the H.E.L.M. When picked up, they are first seen as Fleeting Metastasized Essentia.</p><p dir="ltr">These can be lost upon wiping in the Nether by running out of Revives or if players disconnect during a run. Only at the end of a Nether run will these turn into Metastasized Essentia that can be kept and used. Take a stack of 10 Essentia to the Taken Altar to Eris Morn’s apartment, which looks like a small stone pillar with a black orb in it next to a shelf, and you will be rewarded with the following:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">At least two reprised weapons</li><li dir="ltr">A stack of 10 Essence of Desire</li><li dir="ltr">Enhancement Cores and or Enhancement Prisms</li></ul><p dir="ltr">If players want to check out how to get more rewards during Episode Heresy, check out how they should use the Shaping Slab and the Tome of Want for gear curating and extra buffs in the Nether.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-art-of-wild-bastards-a-very-good-looking-video-game.1101489/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/wild-bastards-blue-manchu-art<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I'm sorry,<a href="https://aftermath.site/category/platform" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> it's been way too long since we ran a Platform blog</a>! So let's make amends by looking at one of the prettiest games of 2024, <em>Wild Bastards</em>, and chatting with the folks responsible for said prettiness.</p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/luke-plunkett-aftermath-game-of-the-year-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Wild Bastards</em> made my Games Of The Year list for several reasons</a>, but for Platform blog purposes it definitely helped that it was a continuation of developers Blue Manchu's commitment, across 2019's <em>Void Bastards</em> and now this, to an art style that's instantly recognisable for its sharp lines, memorable character designs and bold colours.</p><p>To learn more about how the game's visuals came together, I spoke with Blue Manchu's three artists: Ben Lee, Dean Walsh and Irma Walker.</p><p><strong>BEN LEE</strong></p><figure></figure><p>Ben served as Creative Director on the game, but indie dev being indie dev, he was also unofficially everything from art director to concept artist to a 2D illustrator.</p><p>Lee says that, as Creative Director, his chief influences came from about where you'd expect a game that looks like this to have come from. In video game terms, Lucasarts' classic <em>Outlaws</em>--a 90's first-person shooter that employed 2D sprites for its enemies in a 3D space, just like <em>Wild Bastards</em>--was of course a big inspiration, but Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Westerns also played their part.</p><figure></figure><p>"<em>Void Bastards</em> was very focused around looking like a literal comic page come to life", Lee tells Aftermath. "<em>Wild Bastards</em> moved away from this completely and leant more in a film/animation direction. It's much more widescreen and hyper-saturated looking.</p><p>"Given that I design the visuals in our games, and in most cases hand draw them myself, this means that the way I draw kind of naturally ties the games together, even when I don't necessarily want it to."</p><p>While Lee both designed <em>and</em> animated the enemies in <em>Void Bastards</em>, this time around the game's increased roster of bad guys meant some of that work was handed off to animation studio Look Mom Productions (part of Blue Ant), a shift that he says gave <em>Wild Bastards</em> its own "unique look".</p><figure><figcaption>"My favorite piece is the illustration that we eventually used for the game's cover. It sums up everything I wanted to see in this game", Lee says.</figcaption></figure><hr><p><strong>DEAN WALSH</strong></p><figure></figure><p>Dean Walsh was 3D Art Lead and Technical Artist on <em>Wild Bastards</em>. "I designed and implemented the asset pipelines for building and importing all the art", he tells Aftermath. "With such a unique game that tends to be a bit more involved; at Blue Manchu we model the 'linework' as geometry rather than as 2D textures applied to the surface of a 3D mesh like you would see with most games. I ended up building most of the shaders too, which define how the light and colour mixes."</p><p>Pointing out that both <em>Void Bastards</em> and <em>Wild Bastards</em> have a superficially similar look, I asked if the team has a label or firm structure for it. Nope, turns out it's just...vibes. "I wish we had a term but so far we tend to be describing it more project by project, because, while similar games, they certainly have different approaches."</p><figure></figure><p>"<em>Wild Bastards</em> is built around a dynamic sun-based light which also works with our inverted line work, so the lines when shaded swap to colour to give the unique shadow look. <em>Void Bastards</em> was much tighter sight lines, more black and all top-down lit via a dynamic low res light map, I was hand cutting in detail in shadows for that."</p><p>I asked Walsh if there was a single piece of work he did for the game that he was most proud of. "The enemy shader uses a second texture that we generate; it does a few things like tell the shader where they glow but also uses a thing called a signed distance field. This is a gradient that can make those lines thicker or thinner based on how far away they are in the level."</p><figure><figcaption>This is the effect Dean is talking about, where the ink lines surrounding enemies and buildings maintain their clarity over different distances</figcaption></figure><p>"It's a small thing but it keeps enemies from getting softer or less defined, since all the lines in the world do the same thing, so they look as if they are all inked in a comic with the same pen. As a non programmer and very much an artist, being able to fumble the tech to make stuff look the way we want is always a nice surprise."</p><hr><p><strong>IRMA WALKER</strong></p><figure></figure><p><em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></em>Walker was first brought onto the project to help out on some buildings. "Ultimately these would be deemed too bland to stay as they were", she says, "so as I continued working there my role expanded to creating models based on Ben's concepts and my own ideas, and running passes on the buildings to make them a bit more interesting."</p><p>From there, she worked on a bit of everything. "Our roles on the team were usually pretty flexible, we were such a small collection of people that we'd usually end up branching out to handle whatever needed doing; my title was 'Artist' but I would occasionally handle QA and was the go-to for a lot of the fiddly little tasks nobody really wanted to be doing (like checking sprites for tiny errors and hooking them up in-game).”</p><figure></figure><p>"The sawmill (pictured above, far right) is a really fantastic example of the dedication of our entire team to make the game as visually exciting as it could possibly be. As you can see, the first iteration of our big barn (far left) was not terribly exciting. It definitely did the job of being a big barn, but the details were very uniform, the space not terribly unique to run around in, and the model itself--by the nature of being built of a lot of individual pieces--was a bit haphazard and lacked cohesion."</p><figure></figure><p>"Over time we ended up basically re-working every single building and small model in the game. It took time, and added months to the game's production, but I feel like the extra effort was absolutely worth it. The big barn was also used as the base of the Sawmill, which ended up being one of my favourite models I worked on, and really contributed to the really handcrafted, cohesive and visually engaging style we shipped the game with. To me, it all demonstrates the value of iteration. Just because something 'works fine' doesn't mean you shouldn't play around with it; sometimes even small changes can make a drastic difference!"</p><figure></figure></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Now, Valve has a notice designed to warn Steam users when they visit an early access game’s store page if it’s been a minute since the last update. If the dev’s lofty goals for a 1.0 release were a little too lofty, then it’s probably time to do some due diligence before spending money on what may be abandonware.</p><p>Valve hasn’t formally announced the feature, but both <em><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-now-includes-a-warning-flagging-potentially-abandoned-early-access-games">Eurogamer</a> </em>and <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/platforms/steam-now-warns-you-if-that-early-access-game-youre-eyeing-up-has-been-abandoned-by-its-devs/"><em>PC Gamer</em></a> point it out as first highlighted by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/steamdb.info/post/3lhgj6fphkx2y">SteamDB</a>. One example where you can see this warning in action is the store listing for <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F321830%2FCavern_Kings%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Cavern Kings</em></a>, which flags that its developers have not updated the game in over eight years.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>A screenshot of the </em>Cavern Kings<em> store page on Steam shows its warning to players that it’s likely abandoned.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>That’s probably long enough to safely say the game is abandoned (though the developer has since worked on <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1184760%2FShovel_Knight_Pocket_Dungeon%2F" rel="sponsored">another title</a>).

<p>In December, MachineGames and Bethesda released Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, a critically acclaimed epic featuring the titular adventurer front and centre. For this spin around the whip, Indiana Jones was played by Troy Baker, one of the most instantly recognisable names in gaming.</p>



<p>Harrison Ford has made it clear that he’s more than happy to pass the torch to Baker, and in the past, he has praised the actor for his replication of the character. In a recent interview with the Wall Street Journal, the legendary actor once again showered Baker with adoration for his portrayal of Indiana Jones.</p>

<h2 id="h-nothing-but-good-things">Nothing But Good Things</h2>



<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle received positive reviews across the board when it was released on December 9. It looks great, plays better, and features the iconic tropes of the Indiana Jones series that are intensely familiar to fans of the franchise.</p>



<p>In an interview that took place before the game was released, Bethesda Game Studios’ <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/todd-howard-troy-baker-indiana-jones/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Todd Howard revealed</a> that he <strong>didn’t want Troy Baker </strong>to play Indiana Jones. He explained that the team cast a wide net when fielding auditions, but time and again, those vetting the ‘blind taste tests’ picked Troy Baker.</p>



<p>Recently, Harrison Ford sat down to speak to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/style/harrison-ford-shrinking-1923-captain-america-7b1f9b3f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the Wall Street Journal</a> about his acting career – which is still going strong despite the performer being 82 years of age.</p>



<p>Amid a deep conversation about the Indy franchise and Ford’s most recent work, including the upcoming Captain America: Brave New World, the topic turned to Baker’s performance of Indiana Jones in the December release:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>You don’t need artificial intelligence to steal my soul. You can already do it for nickels and dimes with good ideas and talent.</p>



<p>He did a brilliant job, and it didn’t take AI to do it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>With the mention of AI, Harrison Ford was talking about using ‘synthetic versions of famous actors’ to apply them to roles after they’ve passed on. This is something that, quite understandably, actors are wary of pursuing.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/steam-warning-buying-abandoned-early-access/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/steam-will-now-warn-you-before-you-buy-an-%E2%80%98abandoned%E2%80%99-game.1101378/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/steam-warning-buying-abandoned-early-access/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Valve has released a new update to the Steam interface that’ll offer users a prompt detailing how long it has been since an early-access game was last updated. This new feature is designed to prevent gamers from investing in a game that might be abandoned, or from buying one that might not be accurately represented by what’s detailed on the store page.</p>



<p>It’s not immediately obvious what the ‘cut-off point’ is for this label to appear, as not every early-access game has it. Most of them just have the typical breakdown that features an explanation from the developers as to why the game has been released in an early-access state.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-transparency-update">Transparency Update</h2>



<p>One of the most heartbreaking revelations you can have as a gamer is investing in an early-access game that has you excited, only to find that the developer hasn’t touched it in years. That’s the case with some early-access games on Steam that remain in that state for <strong>a very long time </strong>after hitting the digital storefront.</p>



<p>Valve’s latest update challenges that notion, letting users know if it has been several months (or more) since the last major update to the game. This change was noticed and publicised on social media <a href="https://x.com/SteamDB/status/1887107461879832746" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by SteamDB</a>.</p>



<p>For instance, Heartbound, which was released in 2018 and remains in early access, was last updated ‘over 13 months ago’. The game was once taken positively by the PC gaming community, but the recent review rating has dropped to Mostly Negative because of the lack of updates.</p>



<p>Another example is a game called ATLAS, which sees players take on an ambitious pirating adventure across the high seas. It looks good enough at first blush, but it has mixed reviews overall – some 36,000 in total. It too was released in 2018 but hasn’t been updated in more than 20 months:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Many early-access games ‘graduate’ from that state, becoming a full-release title that launches with a 1.0 version that’s often bursting with improvements and features. One great example is Sons of the Forest, which was released in early access in February 2023, graduating to a full release one year later and succeeding all over again.</p>



<p>This is a nice move by Valve – but what do you think? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

          <p>AMD announced its fourth-quarter earnings yesterday, and the numbers were <a href="https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1236/amd-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-financial">mostly rosy</a>: $7.7 billion in revenue and a 51 percent profit margin, compared to $6.2 billion and 47 percent <a href="https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1180/amd-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2023-financial">a year ago</a>. The biggest winner was the data center division, which made $3.9 billion thanks to Epyc server processors and Instinct AI accelerators, and Ryzen CPUs are also selling well, helping the company's client segment earn $2.3 billion.</p>
<p>But if you were looking for a dark spot, you'd find it in the company's gaming division, which earned a relatively small $563 million, down 59 percent from a year ago. AMD's Lisa Su blamed this on both dedicated graphics card sales and sales from the company's "semi-custom" chips (that is, the ones created specifically for game consoles like the Xbox and PlayStation).</p>
<p>Other data sources suggest that the response from GPU buyers to AMD's Radeon RX 7000 series, launched between late 2022 and early 2024, has been lackluster. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/videocard/">Steam Hardware Survey</a>, a noisy but broadly useful barometer for GPU market share, shows no RX 7000-series models in the top 50; only two of the GPUs (the 7900 XTX and 7700 XT) are used in enough gaming PCs to be mentioned on the list at all, with the others all getting lumped into the "other" category. Jon Peddie Research <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/discrete-gpu-sales-increase-as-intels-share-drops-to-0">recently estimated</a> that AMD was selling roughly one dedicated GPU for every seven or eight sold by Nvidia.</p>
<p>But hope springs eternal. Su confirmed on AMD's earnings call that the new Radeon RX 9000-series cards, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/new-radeon-rx-9000-gpus-promise-to-fix-two-of-amds-biggest-weaknesses/">announced at CES last month</a>, would be launching in early March. The Radeon RX 9070 and 9070 XT are both aimed toward the middle of the graphics card market, and Su said that both would bring "high-quality gaming to mainstream players."</p>
<h2>An opportunity, maybe</h2>
<p>"Mainstream" could mean a lot of things. AMD's CES slide deck positioned the 9070 series alongside Nvidia's RTX 4070 Ti ($799) and 4070 Super ($599) and its own RTX 7900 XT, 7900 GRE, and 7800 XT (between $500 and $730 as of this writing), a pretty wide price spread that is still more expensive than an entire high-end console. The GPUs could still rely heavily on upscaling algorithms like AMD's Fidelity Super Resolution (FSR) to hit playable frame rates at those resolutions, rather than targeting native 4K.</p>

            <p>
Call of Duty veteran Michael Condrey has reportedly been fired as the head of 2K Games studio 31st Union after its debut project, free-to-play hero shooter Project Ethos, recieved a muted reponse on its reveal toward the end of last year.
</p>
<p>
Condrey, who co-founded Call of Duty developer Sledgehammer Games, was confirmed to be leading 2K's 31st Union in 2019. A year later, Condrey <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/2k-rebrands-studio-headed-by-sledgehammer-co-founder-to-31st-union">teased</a> the studio was working on an "ambitious and inspired new IP" - but it wasn't until last October that the game, now known as Project Ethos, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-veteran-reveals-project-ethos-a-roguelike-hero-shooter-backed-by-2k">finally revealed</a>.
</p>
<p>
Project Ethos was officially described as a free-to-play "roguelike hero shooter", and featured a colourful art style reminiscent of Blizzard's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a>. Unfortunately, its unveiling came just months after consumer apathy led to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-shuts-down-concord-developer-firewalk-studios-game-will-remain-permanently-offline">rapid demise of PlayStation's Concord</a> - and it appears there wasn't much enthusiasm for Project Ethos either.

<p>
In a <a href="https://kotaku.com/michael-condrey-projet-ethos-31st-union-2k-games-1851756173">new report by Kotaku</a>, sources claim Project Ethos - which is said to have faced a "challenging and rocky development cycle" under Condrey - was revealed to "little fanfare or apparent player interest". That seemingly sparked a chain of events leading to Condrey's reported firing as 31st Union's studio head earlier this week.
</p>
<p>
In a statement provided to Kotaku, 2K confirmed Condrey's departure as 31st Union president, saying he would be "transitioning his role in the short term to focus on advising on the future of Project Ethos". The publisher also insisted it remains "very committed to the forward path for Project Ethos and the people and culture of the 31st Union studio."
</p>
<p>
"We are grateful to Michael Condrey," it added, "for the dedication, passion and work ethic it took to build an incredible team and shape the vision of 31st Union."
</p>
<p>
2K, of course, has packed slate of major releases over the next 12 months, with Civilization 7, Borderlands 4, Mafia: The Old Country, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> creator Ken Levine's Judas, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a> behemoth <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> all on the way.
