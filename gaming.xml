		<p>Redemption Road Games has delayed Kingmakers just before its anticipated early access release date of October 8th, and the studio has not stated when the game is now expected to release. This is the second delay for Kingmakers, which was originally scheduled for early access in Q1 2025. If you need a refresher of what Kingmakers is, it is a game where you go 500 years back in time, fighting in a medieval battle to change the course of history using modern weapons and tech.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kingmakers - Early Access Release Date Trailer | tinyBuild Connect 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/52u8LIuzA-Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a statement, Redemption Road Games said, <em>“After much contemplation, we realize that the scheduled Kingmakers launch of October 8 will no longer be possible. We want to apologize to all of the fans who are eagerly anticipating the game. We are sorry for letting you down. Why is Kingmakers being delayed? In short, it’s an incredibly ambitious, uncompromising game, and we don’t want to cut any planned features, for the sake of getting it out of the door earlier. Our goal, from the start, has been to create something that’s nothing like anything else on the market, in terms of gameplay, scale, scope, and interactivity.</em></p>
<p><em>With Kingmakers, we set out to push the Unreal Engine codebase to its absolute limits, while still providing true 60fps to midrange PCs, without the need for fake frames. We are an 80% engineering team, who got into this business to push technological barriers. We currently have tens of thousands of soldiers, each with AI and pathfinding that rivals what you’d expect from a AAA third person shooter. When you walk away from a battle, it continues to play out. Nothing is faked. We have giant 6 story castles, where every room can be entered, and every wall, floor, and ceiling destroyed. When you build a Lumbermill, it’s a real place that can be entered, or in an enemy invasion, turned into a combat arena.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p><em>When you drive a car into a tree, you’re ejected through the windshield, the tree breaks from its stump, and then rolls over whatever hapless soldiers are along its path. Every mission takes place in a massive map that each player on the server is free to explore- with or without their thousands of soldiers. We set out to do all of this, with full drop in/drop out 4 player multiplayer support, and we have. We just need a bit more time on content polish before we feel good about charging money for it. So this is what we’re doing now. We’re making sure everyone who buys the game is enthralled and feels like their money was well spent. We want this to be the case whether you have a top of the line rig or a PC that’s seen better days. Thank you so much for all of your love and support. We hope we are doing everything we can to earn it. We will be presenting a half hour long deepdive on Kingmakers gameplay very soon, with a comprehensive overview of everything we’ve been working on.”</em></p>

<figure data-uuid="2f35e20433ff4"><a title="Switch OLED" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2f35e20433ff4/switch-oled.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Update [<time datetime="2025-10-07T14:45:00+00:00" data-format="D jS M Y, g:ia">Tue 7th Oct 2025, 3:45pm</time>]:</strong> If you cast your mind back to last November, you might recall Nintendo of America was on track to pick up another lawsuit win after accused Switch "pirate" James 'Archbox' Williams failed to plead or defend himself when called to do so in court. The case 'entered default', granting NOA the right to take the full requested amount in damages as a result, though we didn't know what the final sum would be. Until now, that is (thanks for the heads up, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/oatmealdome.bsky.social/post/3m2f3jyovbe2a">@OatmealDome</a>).</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.336727/gov.uscourts.wawd.336727.25.0.pdf">updated court document</a> dated 24th October 2025, Nintendo concludes that it is seeking $4,500,000 (roughly £3,355,000) in damages from Williams and a permanent injunction to prevent the defendant from piracy again.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067sjzowr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

<p>One section of the document reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>NOA has been, and continues to be, damaged as a direct and proximate result of Williams’ conduct. NOA has reason to believe that Williams has engaged in the infringing and unlawful reproduction and distribution of hundreds or thousands of copyrighted Nintendo Switch Games, and that through the various Pirate Shops, he has distributed or facilitated the distribution of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of unauthorized copies of such Nintendo Switch Games. NOA also has expended and continues to expend significant resources to halt or stem video game piracy, including through developing, implementing, and updating its TPMs and policing and investigating reports of piracy such as Williams’.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the document, Williams has remained silent on the matter. NOA states that it was contacted by a lawyer claiming to represent the defendant back in January 2025 with a message that read “Mr. Williams understands that Nintendo may have a right to obtain documents in support of its motion for default judgment”, though there has been no further communication in the months since.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether Williams will pay up to Nintendo's demands, but the Big N is showing no signs of backing down any time soon.</p><hr><p><strong>Original Story:</strong> Back in July, Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/07/nintendo-files-two-new-lawsuits-in-continued-clamp-down-on-switch-piracy">dished out a handful of lawsuits</a> in its continued clampdown on Switch piracy. Four months on, one of these legal claims has come back as another win for Nintendo after the defendant failed to plead or otherwise respond within the court's given time.</p>
<p>The case in question was against James 'Archbox' Williams, the lead moderator of the r/SwitchPirates subreddit, who Nintendo accused of offering "massive libraries of pirated Nintendo Switch games" via several "pirate shops".</p>
<p>According to the initial case, Williams was a self-confessed "pirate" who had previously publicly stated that he "[isn’t] going to give Nintendo $50 for a game”. The lawsuit (as shared by <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/nintendo-archbox.pdf">TorrentFreak</a>) saw Nintendo request "actual or maximum statutory damages" for several violations should he be found guilty.</p>
<p>However, no such ruling has had to take place. In a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.336727/gov.uscourts.wawd.336727.18.0.pdf">new court document</a> filed by the Superior Court of the state of Washington on 8th November, it was revealed that the case has now 'entered default' after Williams "failed to plead or otherwise defend within the time prescribed by the Federal Rules of Civil<br>
Procedure".</p>
<p>A default judgment can be reached early on in legal proceedings if the defendant fails to take the required actions. In this instance, the claim can be passed without a court hearing, usually granting the claimant the full requested amount plus interest and costs.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.336727/gov.uscourts.wawd.336727.15.0.pdf">accompanying more detailed document</a> from Washington's District Court explains that Williams responded to a Nintendo cease and desist letter in March 2024 stating that he would "'comply and cooperate with any demands or requests . . . within [his] control' but denying any infringement of Nintendo’s intellectual property".</p>
<p>Nintendo then sent a court order to the same address (and another possible abode that the document describes as the "Surprise Address"), to which Williams did not reply within the prescribed time. And so we arrive at the default judgement.</p>
<p>The court can set aside this decision if it transpires that Williams <em>did</em> reply to the proceedings or if it rules that Williams has a strong enough defence. But, for the time being, at least, this looks like another line in the 'win' column for Nintendo.</p>
<p>A Nintendo lawsuit submitted around the same time as the Williams case was against <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/10/pour-one-out-for-the-modchip-seller-facing-nintendo-in-court-alone">modchip seller Modded Hardware</a>. This claim is now progressing to the next stage, with the alleged owner of the store, Ryan Daly, standing self-represented in court.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-debuts-new-animated-short-%E2%80%9Cclose-to-you%E2%80%9D-with-no-explanation-speculation-points-to-pikmin-tease.1318666/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Nintendo has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_Pb2cLqmk4">debuted a new animated short</a> titled "<em>Close to You</em>" with absolutely no explanation as to what it means. The short was simultaneously uploaded to the Nintendo Today app, the company's social media channels, and its YouTube channel, each with nothing more than its title to accompany it.</p>



<p>Of course, wild speculation online immediately followed the video's publishing, with fans going in a few directions based on the video's contents and what seem to be subtle hints regarding what it could mean.</p>



<p>The video itself is a nearly four-minute short of a baby following a magical soother around the room, accompanied by high-quality animation and visual fidelity, and some playful music which fans recognized as music from Pikmin 4. The music, along with the fact that a blurry Pikmin can be seen crossing the background of a shot at one point, has fans pointing to this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1o0f26r/new_pikmin_teaser/">being a Pikmin-related tease</a>. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Close to you" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C_Pb2cLqmk4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>But is it a tease for an upcoming Pikmin game? Or is it potentially a tease for a different Pikmin project, maybe even a Pikmin film or series? Or what if it's not a Pikmin project, and something else entirely?</p>



<p>It could be, as <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-posts-mysterious-close-to-you-animated-short-film/">VGC's deputy editor Chris Scullion speculates</a>, a tease at the origin story for Rosalina for the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-debuts-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-teaser-coming-april-2026/">Super Mario Galaxy movie</a>. Or it's still something entirely different, like potentially a new project featuring baby versions of Nintendo characters, and this is Rosalina, followed by Baby Peach, Baby Mario, Baby Luigi, and the rest of Nintendo's iconic characters all coming together in either a new game or a new Rugrats-style series featuring the various Nintendo babies.</p>



<p>Your guess is as good as mine or anyone else's at this point. Hopefully, we don't have to wait too long for Nintendo to explain more about "<em>Close to You</em>."</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-crucial-p310-ssd-now-costs-only-cents-per-gb-a-steal-for-steam-deck-or-rog-ally-storage-upgrade.1318660/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’re here in the thick of Prime Big Deals Day and there are some great opportunities to save on pretty much anything. Kitchen appliances, bedding, automotive tools, and, yes, even gaming hardware are on sale with huge discounts. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4568/">Right now, Amazon has the Crucial P310 internal SSD discounted by up to 49%</a>. The 1TB version — normally $135 — is now down to $80 while the 2TB version — normally $240 — is now down to just $122. That’s a savings of up to $188.</p>
<p>File sizes for AAA video games have been surpassing behemoth levels for some time now. Look at something like <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>. It requires a whopping 150GB of your storage to install. And that’s a game from 2018. I can’t even begin to imagine what absurd size requirement Rockstar’s upcoming&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> will have.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4568/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This PCIe Gen4 2230 NVMe M.2 SSD is smaller than your standard internal SSDs and that’s because it is designed with PC gaming handhelds in mind to help you bring your whole game library with you when you hit the road.</p>
<p>The Steam Deck has three models, each with a different internal capacity. The LCD version of the Steam Deck only comes with 256GB while with the OLED, you have a choice of 512GB or 1TB. The ROG Ally and all new ROG Xbox Ally each come with 512GB. If those numbers aren’t enough for the gaming you want to do on the go, then you can upgrade with the Crucial P310 SSD.&nbsp;Installation is easy and should only take you about five minutes of your time to get you started gaming with way more storage.</p>
<p>While the Crucial P310 SSD is made with the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally in mind, it is additionally compatible with certain laptops such as the Microsoft Surface or select Dell models.</p>



<h2>Extreme Performance</h2>
<p>The Crucial gaming SSD is capable of read and write speeds of up to 7,100 MB/s. You can expect fast load times. Power efficiency is always good to have with PC hardware both for environmental reasons and to keep the electric bill down. Here, though, there is an added benefit. Game longer. Better power efficiency means easier on the battery means you can play for longer before it dies.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4568/">For a limited time, you can expand the storage on your PC gaming handheld to a large capacity of either 1TB or 2TB with the Crucial P310 internal SSD.</a> The 1TB is down 41% to $80 while the 2TB is down 49% to $122.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4568/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

              <p><span>I finally broke the seal on </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>this past week because I am a mark for </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-fortnite-skins-rumi-mira-zoey-event-2000630221"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a> <span>and its trio of monster-slaying idols. Epic fast-tracked skins, cosmetics, and a reskinned mode themed around Netflix’s animated musical, and I paid for my first V-Bucks to play as Rumi and fight hordes of demons with shotguns and SMGs. Friends, it gave me the ick. I loathe </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span>’s brand of artless, cross-promotional excess, and even a solid social hub and battle royale can’t wash that away for me. You know what can, though? Watching the singing voices of Huntr/x get into </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span> now that their characters are in the game.</span></p> <p><span>Rei Ami, the singing voice of Huntr/x’s rapper Zoey, has been campaigning for a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a> <span>X </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>collaboration for months, and even </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@rei.ami/video/7555327877944839455"><span>got to reveal her character’s skin ahead of the crossover’s launch</span></a><span>. Now that she’s finally got it, she’s been playing </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>on streams and TikTok Lives as Zoey, and I haven’t seen a pop-off as hype as the first time she got a Victory Royale in the skin in a minute. My girl is out here emoting in real life.</span></p>

   <p><span>Ejae and Audrey Nuna, the singing voices for Rumi and Mira, aren’t </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>players, but they did shoot a promo video reacting to the skins in which the group jokes about taking a class on how to play Epic’s game.</span></p>

   <p><span>Well, it looks like those lessons are happening. Rei Ami posted a video during their ongoing promotional tour for </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters,</span></i><span> showing them spending some of their spare time playing </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span>. Ejae managed to get 36th place in her first battle royale match as Rumi, though she was killed by another player called WetPickle4996. I want to talk to that player. Do they know they just destroyed the Honmoon?</span></p>    <p><span>I’m obsessed with this, and I’m waiting for some talented animators and artists to draw Zoey teaching Rumi and Mira how to play </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span> like a new fandom in-joke. Huntr/x probably doesn’t have that much time to game these days, though, as the group is about to make their live debut on </span><i><span>The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon</span></i><span> as the musical guest. The trio is </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzuUNSf0bCg"><span>performing “Golden” on tonight’s episode</span></a><span>.</span></p>

                <p dir="ltr">It's dangerous to go alone, so developer Poncle is adding online co-op to Vampire Survivors this fall. Up to four players can fight against the undead together in the roguelike game when version 1.14 drops later this year.</p><p dir="ltr">Poncle revealed the new online co-op mode for Vampire Survivors <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTa_8nDjIo4">on YouTube</a>. The trailer--seen below--shows how players can either create or join a lobby, with an ID number seemingly utilized to group up. It's unclear whether there will be cross-play at this time. "Free roam the stages whilst your friend struggles to find their way through Astral Stair, or maybe see if you can all survive Room 1665 ... More players doesn't make it easier, or does it," Poncle wrote in the video's description.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Vampire Survivors Online Co-Op is Coming Soon | Announcement Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The Vampire Survivors video also features five different cards for version 1.14, with online co-op being the first one unveiled. Poncle stated that another announcement will occur next week. The developer teased that "we might finally answer a burning question that has been asked thousands of times."</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/vampire-survivors-adds-co-op-teases-adventures-mode-and-more/1100-6516980/">Vampire Survivors actually got local co-op</a> roughly two years with version 1.6. However, that requires sharing a single screen, while online co-op will let each player run off on their own if they want. In 2023, Poncle did <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-vampire-survivors-couch-co-op-details-revealed-and-online-co-op-could-be-coming/1100-6515861/">hint at online co-op</a>.</p><p>Earlier this year, Vampire Survivors got another <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/free-vampire-survivors-update-is-out-now-adds-several-saga-frontier-characters/1100-6530763/">free update that introduced characters from Square Enix's fantasy-RPG series SaGa</a>.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/powerwash-simulator">PowerWash Simulator</a> 2 will be launching on 23rd October, 2025. It'll be coming to PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>This was announced on the official PowerWash Simulator 2 X account, which posted a release date trailer. This not only introduces some of the grimey locations you'll be cleaning up, but also the home base you'll be hanging around in. This home base, obviously, has pet cats called Bubbles and Squeak.</p>
<p>The game is also coming to Game Pass, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-increases-price-of-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-despite-record-subscription-profits-last-year">so for those who are still subscribed even with the recent price changes</a>, you'll be able to play it as part of your ongoing subscription.</p>

<p>We do know <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-worry-powerwash-simulator-2-is-bringing-back-the-ludicrous-brilliant-lore">PowerWash Simulator 2 will be continuing the original games' ridiculous and brilliant lore</a>, which should give avid cleaners something more to delve into other than muck. Those interested in getting their hands dirty can wishlist the game now on Steam, or try out the demo first if they're curious as to what the hype is all about.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/powerwash-simulator-2-offers-more-of-the-same-relaxation-but-can-it-warrant-its-sequel-status">In Eurogamer's PowerWash Simulator 2 preview</a>, Ed Nightingale wrote: "With that in mind, this refined sequel provides FuturLab the perfect platform to continue tweaking and experimenting with its cleaning sim - as long as the dirt doesn't wear too thin. Perhaps we could even get some rug cleaning DLC to really get the ASMR tingles going - and monopolise my relaxation time for good."</p>

		<p>Yacht Club Games has announced that it is delaying Mina The Hollower, with the developer stating that the game will not be ready to release by October 31st. The delay is not expected to be too long, but Yacht Club Games is not going to commit to a new release date until it has been submitted to platforms and gone through all the necessary steps.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mina the Hollower Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Fx0aJCRRpE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a statement, Yacht Club Games wrote,<em>“This week, our team made a tough decision: we decided to delay Mina the Hollower. The entire crew has been working tirelessly day and night to finish development for release on Oct 31st, but we’re just not quite there yet.&nbsp; This isn’t a major delay, it’s just a stretch of time to apply some final polish and balancing to make the game truly shine. With that said, we would like to apologize! Nevertheless, we will not waver on our commitment to quality. Our goal is to make sure our development team has the time and resources to deliver an incredible adventure and we will be giving you just that. That’s no hollow promise!</em></p>
<p><em>We don’t want to announce another release date until it’s submitted to platforms, so please hang tight as we reach the finish line. The game is&nbsp;so&nbsp;close to being done- we’re playing it from start to finish every day. In the final hours, this is what the crew is working on:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Finalizing design, art, and sound</em></li>
<li><em>Overall game balancing</em></li>
<li><em>Implementing localization</em></li>
<li><em>Eating cheese</em></li>
<li><em>Testing, testing, testing… on all platforms!</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Thank you for your understanding and patience.”</em></p>

<p>Mina The Hollower was announced three years ago and is an action adventure game that has used the Game Boy 8 bit aesthetic as inspiration. Mina is a mouse, a whip-wielding inventor that uses this signature weapon for attacking enemies, and to whip walls and items in the world to destroy and manipulate them. The game is expected to release for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series, XS, Xbox One, Switch and Switch 2.</p>

<figure data-uuid="5478621784a18"><a title="Mario's Super Picross" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5478621784a18/marios-super-picross.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>New month, new NSO icons. With the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-online-missions-and-rewards-october-2025-dk-bananza-dlc-mario-galaxy-mario-party-3-marios-super-picross">Nintendo Switch Online Missions &amp; Rewards Program</a>, you can nab some rather unique icons for your Switch profile.</p>
<p>Now, you <em>could</em> grab some icons for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/mario_party_3">Mario Party 3</a> — and they're quite nice, too — but have you seen those <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/marios_super_picross">Mario's Super Picross</a> icons? No? Well just look at them! (Thanks to <a href="https://x.com/IconsNSO/status/1975373237623418889">NSO Icon Alerts</a> for highlighting them!)</p>
<p>These icons, shown below, are part of the monthly Play &amp; Redeem scheme for NSO members. All you have to do is boot up Mario's Super Picross on the SNES app and then you can purchase those icon elements using Platinum Points.</p>
<p>It doesn't even take 10 seconds if you have the SNES app downloaded already, so if you like 'em and you have the points... What's stopping you?</p>
<figure data-uuid="4311ccd07c8f1"><a title="Mario's Super Picross NSO Icons" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4311ccd07c8f1/marios-super-picross-nso-icons.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Mario's Super Picross was added to the Nintendo Classics service (formerly Nintendo Switch Online) back in 2020. Acting as a direct sequel to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/marios_picross">Game Boy original</a>, this one is largely the same, except once you beat the first level, you'll have access to Wario's version of the game, where you have additional rules to consider.</p>
<p>The game only launched in Japan on the Super Famicom, though it did launch on the PAL Wii and Wii U Virtual Console stores in 2007 and 2013 respectively.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the Switch Online release is available to everyone. Plus, If you have a Switch 2 (or a USB mouse) you can actually play it with mouse controls, too!</p>

			<p>While it initially sounded absurd to release the third title in a trilogy before the first two, thematically and chronologically, it makes perfect sense. If Dragon Quest III was a tale of the most famous Erdrick of the trilogy, Dragon Quest I and II both take up the helm generations after the fact and continue the work initially started to protect Alefgard from catastrophe. What we got to play at Tokyo Game Show 2025 was just a small taste of the opening hours of both titles that encompass the Dragon Quest I+II HD-2D Remake, which rounds off the trilogy. </p>



<p>Both of the first two Dragon Quest titles take a different approach to the hero's journey. For the first and inaugural Dragon Quest title, it's literally one man versus the world as the nameless Hero must acquire Wrdrick's legendary equipment to best the big bad Dragonlord before they can take over the world. In the second Dragon Quest title (and last in the trilogy chronologically, taking place roughly a century after the first game), it's up to a small party of Luminairies and family members to do the deed. Perhaps Square-Enix will fix some of the gear issues and give the Prince of Cannock something better to wear than a coffin all the time.</p>



<p>Fundamentally, Square-Enix and Armor Studio have given Dragon Quest I+II HD-2D Remake the same overhaul that <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the third title received last year</a>. This has the unfortunate side effect of making all three titles feel relatively homogenized compared to how the original trilogy both looked and played on the original NES. Dragon Quest I remains the largest outlier of the trilogy, with both a singular protagonist and a shorter runtime, but it still captures the same joy of JRPGs as the other two.</p>



<p>The original NES release of Dragon Quest, or Dragon Warrior in the West, was a very short adventure by modern standards. Even with the added necessity to groom in the US release of Dragon Warrior, players could expect to finish the adventure in roughly ten hours with only a few major plot points and dungeons along the way. Square-Enix has remedied that by including new story scenarios neatly into the gameplay in places that feel natural. For the first title, a new scenario was added to retrieve the Thief's Key from a merchant, only to have it be stolen by Robbin' 'Ood before the player can get to it. This leads to a small side quest in a dungeon that was originally optional in the adventure (Craggy Cave) and an encounter with the thief himself, one that players would recognize from the HD-2D Remake of Dragon Quest III and many other subsequent titles in the series.</p>



<p>Similarly, Dragon Quest II received a substantial amount of new content, with the majority that I was able to play in my short demo being that of an underwater map to recover Lorelai's Harp as well as a small lottery minigame. Dragon Quest II frequently was at the bottom of ranking lists across the entire series and was the most in need of a proper overhaul, so I'm glad to see that it's receiving all sorts of new content this time around, beyond just the fresh coat of paint. </p>



<p>Dragon Quest I+II HD-2D Remake will be out soon, with a release date set for October 30th, 2025 across PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch 1 and 2, Xbox Series S|X, and PC. With less than four weeks to go before release, that's the perfect time to jump into Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake and explore the foundations of the trilogy before diving into the next two titles.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/aloft-bloom-blight-update-set-to-bring-big-improvements-in-november.1318627/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Funcom and developer Astrolabe Interactive have announced the Bloom &amp; Blight update for cozy survival adventure&nbsp;<i>Aloft</i>, and it's set to bring big improvements to the game next month.</p>

<p>As revealed in a press release,&nbsp;<em>Aloft</em>'s Bloom &amp; Blight update will arrive on November 4th, and the two studios are talking a big game for the update; it's apparently set to improve "almost every facet" of the game.</p>

<p>According to Funcom and Astrolabe, Bloom &amp; Blight will "revamp and improve almost every aspect of [<em>Aloft</em>], including world generation, tech tree progression, exploration and travel, ecosystem restoration, and combat", so this is a pretty ambitious undertaking.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aloft-bloom-blight-update-cliff.jpg?itok=kwigv55z 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aloft-bloom-blight-update-cliff.jpg?itok=_Jing2EI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Aloft&nbsp;</em>is getting a very big update indeed soon.</figcaption></figure><p>Many of the changes coming as part of&nbsp;<em>Aloft</em>'s Bloom &amp; Blight update were outlined in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1660080/view/517473930105061675" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">developer blog</a> back in late September, and it does indeed look like the developers are pulling out all of the stops with this one.</p>

<p>Progression will be overhauled to be less confusing and directionless, and ecosystem restoration will be redesigned so that it feels more "engaging" and less "likely simply ticking items off a checklist".</p>

<p>It's not just content within the game that will be getting changes, however;&nbsp;<em>Aloft</em>'s developers are also working on the technical side of things, with the save data system getting a complete overhaul to "achieve long-term stability".</p>

<p>Suffice it to say that if you haven't played&nbsp;<em>Aloft </em>since its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/aloft-early-access-release-date" rel="nofollow">January Early Access release</a>, or even if you're new to the game, you should hopefully find a significantly improved and expanded version of the survival adventure after Bloom &amp; Blight lands.</p>




<p>News of&nbsp;<em>Aloft</em>'s latest major update comes just a couple of days after publisher Funcom <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dune-awakening-funcom-layoffs" rel="nofollow">embarked on a spate of layoffs</a>, with&nbsp;<em>Metal: Hellsinger&nbsp;</em>developer The Outsiders <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-hellsinger-the-outsiders-shut-down-funcom" rel="nofollow">closing down</a> as a result of these staff cuts.</p>

<p>That's despite the fact that sci-fi survival sim<i>&nbsp;Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</i>proved to be the company's most successful release yet, racking up <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dune-awakening-sales-1m-infographic" rel="nofollow">a million sales within just two weeks of its launch</a> back in June this year.</p>

<p>In any case, you can check out&nbsp;<em>Aloft&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1660080/Aloft/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a>, and you can remind yourself what our very own Isaac thought of the game by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/aloft-preview" rel="nofollow">reading his preview from January</a>.</p>

              <p>We’re fairly used to Nintendo making strange or iconoclastic decisions, whether it’s releasing folding two-screen portable gaming devices or announcing a <a href="https://kotaku.com/virtual-boy-nintendo-switch-classics-2000625301">Virtual Boy peripheral for the Switch 2</a>, but even now the Japanese games company is capable of surprises. It has just uploaded to its various worldwide YouTube channels a stunning four-minute animated short called <em>Close to You</em>, about a baby learning to take their first steps, and there’s no explanation for why. Is it a Princess Peach origin story? Something to do with Rosalina? Is it something to do with <em>Pikmin</em> of all things?</p> <p>It is a truly wonderful cartoon. Evoking Pixar in almost every possible way (complete with&nbsp;<em>Incredibles</em>-like faces), the short shows the mother of a baby just popping out of the room, after which the baby’s toys begin to become animated. Wooden blocks hop about and a rattle rolls itself to the baby’s foot. While enjoying the rattle, the kid’s pacifier falls out of their mouth, and that too comes to life, playfully moving around and evading the baby’s attempts to grab it back. In the end, it gets wedged in a mobile dangling above the baby’s crib, giving the tyke the motivation to reach higher and attempt their first steps.</p>

  <p>There’s obviously no way to know if this baby is a boy or a girl, let alone the child form of a particular character. Given the kid’s white with blonde hair, it could be either Zelda or Link, or Samus, or pretty much any gaming character bar Mario or Toad. Hell, my hair was that blonde as a baby, maybe it&nbsp;<em>is</em> Mario. (It isn’t.)</p>

 <p>Someone has claimed that there’s a Red Pikmin appearing in the video at 1:40. Um, I paused it there, and here it is! But there are musical nods to the&nbsp;<em>Pikmin</em> series in here, and they’re certainly the sorts of mischievous creatures who would move toys around a room.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000632540" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000632540"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000632540">© Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>The only credit at any point is “<b><span>© </span></b>Nintendo” at the bottom right at the end of the video, with no mention of Illumination, the animation house behind&nbsp;<em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em> and its forthcoming <em>Mario Galaxy </em>sequel. It’d make some sense if it were related to that, perhaps depicting a moment from Princess Peach’s childhood? She’s fairly magical, and the pink of the pacifier points in that direction. Then again, the blue of the onesie implies Rosalina. Actually, that’d make sense, given the next movie is set in the <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em> universe, and that’s the game in which she first appeared. Let’s go with that! Starting over…</p> <hr> <h2>Nintendo Reveals Rosalina’s Origin Story In Animated Short</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000632541" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000632541"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000632541">© Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Nintendo today has posted a four-minute animated short to its YouTube channels, revealing the beginnings of fan-favorite&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Galaxy</em> character Rosalina, to coincide with the upcoming <em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em> sequel,&nbsp;<em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em>. Rosalina, the resident of the Comet Observatory and mother figure to the game’s star-shaped Lumas, will obviously play a central role in the forthcoming film, so it only makes sense to see her being highlighted here…</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-has-surprised-everyone-the-kindle-is-practically-a-gift-if-youre-a-prime-member-2000632519</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-has-surprised-everyone-the-kindle-is-practically-a-gift-if-you%E2%80%99re-a-prime-member.1318615/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’ve been waiting for the right moment to finally grab a Kindle, that moment just arrived. Amazon rarely discounts its e-readers, especially the base model that consistently tops the bestseller lists. Summer is peak reading season so the retailer typically holds prices steady through the July Prime Day when demand is already high.</p>
<p>But this Prime Big Deal Days event has brought an unexpected surprise for Prime members: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4586/">the newest Kindle model is down to $84, reduced from $109</a>. That’s an <strong>all-time low on the lightest and most compact Kindle</strong> Amazon has ever made, and it solves one of the biggest frustrations readers face: lugging around heavy books or scrolling through distracting phone screens when you’re trying to lose yourself in a story.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4586/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why You Have to Choose This Kindle</h2>
<p>This latest generation Kindle (2024) eliminates the little irritations that previously made e-readers <strong>slow to react or more difficult to read</strong> under certain circumstances. The <strong>front light is also increased by 25%</strong> at its highest setting over its predecessor so you are free to read comfortably even in direct sunlight without eye strain or having to shift position to prevent glare. The <strong>6-inch display is also purely glare-proof</strong>&nbsp;so being outdoors by the pool or on a park bench becomes just as comfortable a place to read as being indoors. There is <strong>also a dark mode setting</strong> whereby the text and background are reversed and gives white text on a black display for midnight reading sessions.</p>



<p><strong>Page turns are significantly quicker now</strong> which may sound like a trivial thing but becomes a real distinction when you’re engrossed in a thriller and whizzing through pages rapidly. The increased contrast ratio causes text to seem sharper and darker against the background and better replicates the sensation of reading ink on paper than before.</p>
<p><strong>Battery life is six weeks between charges</strong> if we assume a reading of about 30 minutes per day by shutting off wireless and setting the light to a luminous 13. If you read longer hours or leave wireless on so your reading stays current among multiple devices, a few weeks of life remain until it’s necessary to charge it.</p>



<p>The <strong>16GB of capacity stores thousands of books</strong>, a number far greater than most individuals will want to keep current at a single moment. Even if your downloads are a delicate balancing act between text-heavy novels and graphics-intensive comics or magazines, you’ll have quite a bit of capacity left for other titles. The reader itself <strong>is Amazon’s thinnest and lightest Kindle</strong>, weighing a mere 5.56 ounces.</p>
<p>One of the greatest benefits of reading a book on a Kindle rather than a phone or a tablet is total lack of distraction: There are <strong>no text messages flashing, no urge to see what’s new by email, no social media scrolling</strong> and no other programs demanding your focus. You turn on the thing, resume where you left off, and read. That’s it.</p>
<p>This is a members-only deal for Prime members during the Prime Big Deal Days, and it’s also a record-low price for this model, at $84. If it’s been on your mind to pick up an e-reader, or it’s been a couple of years since you’ve picked up a Kindle, it’s your turn yet.</p>

<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7’s associate creative director has explained why the timeline doesn’t allow for Wall Runs.</p>



<p>Activision’s latest Call of Duty installment, Black Ops 7, is all set to arrive on November 14, 2025, with the developers conducting open beta testing until <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-beta-has-been-extended/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">October 9</a>. Ahead of the game’s release, the devs have provided players with an insight into BO7’s movement features, explaining why Wall Jumps can transition into Wall Runs. </p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-doesn-t-have-wall-runs-as-the-timeline-doesn-t-allow-it">Black Ops 7 Doesn’t Have Wall Runs As the Timeline Doesn’t Allow It</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/call-of-duty/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-devs-say-that-you-can-blame-the-black-ops-timeline-for-the-wall-jump-not-being-a-wall-run-black-ops-2-really-gave-us-a-foundation-for-the-technology-available/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>, Black Ops 7 associate creative director Miles Leslie revealed why Wall Runs weren’t included in the game. Leslie first explains that when they began developing BO7, they “wanted to pick up threads from Black Ops 2.” Which is why all the technology available in the game is from that era. Leslie explained that the team is very precious to their canon and they have to respect that. </p>



<p>Leslie added that they couldn’t have Thrust Jump as the tech didn’t exist until 2035. Similar to that, Wall Run would have made sense if the game were set more in the future; however, as the tech did not exist in the Black Ops 2 era, “so it made sense not to do it.” </p>



<p>Black Ops 7 does have Wall Jumps, which allow players to gain some height by chaining three jumps. Leslie also spoke about how players can get much higher with the new feature, and they “took a lot of learnings from everything we did on Black Ops 3 – it was really important that we kept the combat in-frame.” </p>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr"><em>Sonic the Hedgehog 4 is celebrating its 15-year anniversary today, October 7, 2025. Below, we look back at Sega's uneven attempt to revive the classic 2D franchise, and how it ultimately fizzled.</em></p><p dir="ltr">There's no denying the glaring flaws of Sonic the Hedgehog 4--the wonky physics, the blatant remixing (or one might even say "rehashing") of classic levels and bosses from the first two Sonic games, and the soundtrack's questionable and often derided soundfont being chief among them. But despite its problems, even 15 years later, I still find myself occasionally coming back to replay both episodes. Not only that, but dare I say, I enjoy myself.</p><p dir="ltr">The game certainly had its shining spots. I appreciate how, instead of every zone having the same hazards and obstacles scattered throughout, each act of each zone had its own distinct gimmick to help one stand out. For example, Casino Street Act 1 featured your standard pinball flippers, bumpers, and slot machine gimmicks. Act 2 shifted the focus to a new mechanic entirely: flipping around and racing across playing cards that act as platforms. The third act brings in colorful cannons that you can manually aim to shoot Sonic across the level. The game was darn pretty to look at, capturing the colorful aesthetic of the classic games with a modern sheen. And even though longtime Sonic composer Jun Senoue went a little too hard with the Genesis/Mega Drive synths for the music, it was still catchy as heck.</p><p dir="ltr">There were signs that Sega was taking feedback to heart. Many of the flaws that plagued Episode 1 were significantly reduced for Episode 2. Zones like White Park and Oil Desert offered more originality than those in the first episode. Instead of being a mindless sidekick who simply follows Sonic around and runs into everything, Tails was given new utility, able to carry Sonic across chasms, blast through water and snow at high speed, and even destroy every enemy on screen with a powerful team blast. Players who owned both Episodes 1 and 2 could replay Episode 1's levels as Sonic's metallic rival, Metal Sonic, complete with new story elements that run parallel to the original game, harkening back to the lock-on technology of Sonic 3/Sonic &amp; Knuckles in the '90s.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4580715-ss_d9c4849d05ccd623f71e2968a876e6ab544f52da.png" data-ref-id="1300-4580715" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4580715-ss_d9c4849d05ccd623f71e2968a876e6ab544f52da.png" data-ref-id="1300-4580715"></a><figcaption>Sonic the Hedgehog 4: Episode 2</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4580715-ss_d9c4849d05ccd623f71e2968a876e6ab544f52da.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Bringing Metal Sonic into a prominent role was a franchise rarity, marking his chronological return to the series after being destroyed in Sonic CD. Aside from Sonic Heroes, the character had more or less been relegated to minor appearances in almost every Sonic game before or since, simply showing up for a boss fight with little to no fanfare, getting blown up, and never being seen again. In Episode 2, his presence is felt throughout the entire story, appearing every handful of levels to duke it out with Sonic in multiple boss encounters. Whereas up to that point Sonic CD had sort of been an outlier among classic Sonic games, Sonic 4 did a great job of giving it a stronger connection to them. In a similar vein, bringing back Little Planet, the setting in which Sonic CD took place, and turning it into a planet-sized power source for a new Death Egg was another unique callback that I can't help but feel could have been explored further.</p><p dir="ltr">That's why Sonic 4 remains equal parts fascinating and frustrating. It had some cool ideas to bring in underutilized classic Sonic elements in new ways, but took way too long to introduce them. Episode 1 felt like a glorified remix of Sonic 1 and 2 with the occasional twist thrown in. Episode 2 showcased more ambition and originality, but by the time you were invested in what they were setting up, the game was over. And Episode 3…well…</p><p dir="ltr">For years, there was no indication that an Episode 3 was ever in production. Most fans assumed that Episode 2 simply didn't sell well enough to warrant a third episode being greenlit. However, several years after Episode 2's release, former Sonic 4 brand manager Ken Balough stated in an interview <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230208104748/https:/www.sonicstadium.org/2015/01/sonic-4-episode-3-was-planned-then-cancelled/" rel="nofollow ">that the game was planned to be a trilogy,</a> only to be cut short for undisclosed reasons. This statement was given further credence just this year when a beta of Episode 2 was discovered, revealing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnSsIwqBbZ8&amp;pp=ygUdc29uaWMgNCBlcGlzb2RlIDIgYmV0YSBlbmRpbmc%3D">a cut sequel hook</a> showcasing the Death Egg powering up with the help of the Master Emerald--and Knuckles.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to providing tangible evidence of Episode 3's planned existence, the scene implied that Knuckles would have played a prominent role, likely as a playable character. Would he have been able to retroactively explore levels from Episodes 1 and 2 on his own like Metal Sonic, or would he have been a "sidekick" character who Sonic could team up with during gameplay like Tails? Would Episode 3 have linked up with Episodes 1 and 2, effectively creating a "complete" Sonic 4, like how Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles became the complete Sonic 3? All we can really do is speculate.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnSsIwqBbZ8" data-width="640" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YnSsIwqBbZ8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">And nothing screams "missed potential" quite like the reveal that there were talks for Episode 3 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230208104748/https:/www.sonicstadium.org/2015/01/sonic-4-episode-3-was-planned-then-cancelled/" rel="nofollow ">to be developed by Christian Whitehead</a>, the lead developer behind the later universally praised Sonic Mania. Imagine an Episode 3 with pitch-perfect classic physics coupled with the Mania Team's impeccable level designs. Even better, imagine if they incorporated tweaked physics for Episodes 1 and 2 to bring them more in line with the classic games. Granted, we did get Mania several years later, but hey, I like the thought of the Sonic 4 saga being allowed to go out on a high note.</p><p dir="ltr">While I know Sonic the Hedgehog 4 was never going to be a masterpiece by any stretch--much less a worthy successor to one of the greatest gaming trilogies of all time--I can't help but be fascinated by the massive potential it had to be something great, if it had been allowed to conclude as Sega originally intended. For what we ended up with, the discourse around it remains more or less unchanged since it was first released 15 years ago. It's still an enjoyable if not uninspired sidescrolling Sonic adventure that could have been so much more.</p>

During the Valley of Memory reveal stream, it was disclosed that this DLC will add around six hours of gameplay and story as Basim discovers that his father may still be alive. To find him, Basim has to journey to AlUla, an ancient valley that is overflowing with thieves and dangerous men.</p><p>In addition to the primary quest, Basim can accept new assassination missions and side quests. He can also play the oud once players earn music sheets by conquering parkour challenges. Ubisoft has also teased "a unique twist on Assassin’s Creed’s classic black box missions," without elaborating any further.</p><p>The expansion will come alongside an update that further improves parkour and adds replayable missions and challenges.

The developer will publish the full patch notes later, but for now, the company released highlights, including that player movement will feel "more responsive" and that recoil has been rebalanced. Additionally, maps have seen some tweaks for the Rush and Breakthrough modes to help them have "better balance."</p><p>On top of all this, the Operation Firestorm map got some updates to improve performance, while Siege of Cairo's spawn-killing and out-of-bounds exploits will be fixed with the day-one update.</p><p>Battlefield 6's UI and HUD elements should also become "clearer" with the day-one update, while audio has been improved, too, to help sounds become "sharper." What's more, Battlefield Studios made improvements to Battlefield 6's networking to reduce desync and to help make time-to-death feel more fair.</p><p>Also in the blog post, Battlefield Studios said it's heard the calls from fans that they want naval warfare, suggesting that's coming in a future update.

He says the pivot from 2D to 3D wasn't exactly a "walk in the park" and took longer than expected, not least because the team couldn't effectively assess how macro gameplay elements were taking shape until they had fleshed out a good portion of the playspace.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We wanted this to truly be an open world that players could explore in any direction they wanted. It’s a technically challenging genre to work in, you don’t really get a sense of the macro gameplay until you've built quite a lot of stuff. We had a variety of strategies to edit things in rough broad strokes or edit localized areas at a time," says Essen.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/baby-steps-has-me-questioning-my-entire-existence" target="_self" data-discover="true">Baby Steps has me questioning my entire existence</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Nailing the average bike speed was something we tried to get early on, because it impacted the distances between everything in the game, which also factored into the pacing. We did use some tricks like making the bike </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>feel</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> faster using FOV (field of view) and camera angles. The kph gauge has a multiplier on it so that it was still in the realm of how fast a real bike can go."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Essen says Messhof spent a huge amount of time reshaping the landscape to ensure that objectives and collectibles appeared at correct intervals. With so many moving parts, however, making even small tweaks became increasingly expensive. Spend too much time tinkering with an open world project and you might start unraveling the very fabric of your game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Discussing how Messhof sought to gently steer players through their island realm, which can largely be explored at will (although that might present some challenges players aren't equipped for), Essen explains the core narrative—which requires players to outrace bike-riding bosses to collect sacred bike parts—provide some semblance of structure without feeling too on rails.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/read-up-on-new-guidance-for-implementing-accessibility-tags-in-storefronts" target="_self" data-discover="true">Read the ESA's new guidance for storefront accessibility tags</a></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n-WUWFguRqY?si=kix-X18zjuV6YogR" height="nullpx" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video" loading="lazy"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Additional bike parts can also be found scattered across the landscape, which pushes players to keep moving in search of shiny new components that can be used to trick out their cherished two-wheeler for specific events.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We encouraged players to explore quickly, but story beats naturally guide you to easier races in the Farmlands first—where you can also face the first boss. Velo City is the toughest area, with tight turns, aggressive AI, and heavy traffic, so we gated it with 'bike snobs' who won't let you in until you've upgraded all five bike parts," continues Essen.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Beyond that, we left room for player strategy. The BMX track, for example, might be easier with a high-handling, high-power bike for sharp turns and quick acceleration, but you could also choose a drift build that grants boost on slides, or use the Cucaracha frame to jump rolling bumps. We made sure tracks varied in elevation, turns, obstacles, and surfaces so different builds felt viable."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Messhof's ultimate aim was to craft unique and diverse open world that actually rewards exploration. "We wanted a large open world with towns, countryside, and lots to explore. The style had to be achievable by a small art team and feel like a cohesive, believable place—not something thrown together from stock assets," he adds.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/the-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-story-changes-were-made-to-sustain-player-interest-over-time" target="_self" data-discover="true">The Final Fantasy VII Rebirth story changes were made to sustain player interest over time</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The game's world is an alternate universe where life and death revolve around bicycles.

            <p>Nintendo has posted a new animated short film on its Nintendo Today app and YouTube channel, so far completely devoid of context.</p>
<p>Called Close to You, the Pixar-esque film shows a baby following its toys around the room, seemingly moved by invisible creatures, all accompanied by a playful piano soundtrack.</p>
<p>The film has been posted purely with the name and no description, so it's not initially clear what project (if any) this might relate to, be that a game or a film.</p>

<p>While the company doesn't state which production studio created the film, some have speculated this is the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-officially-launches-its-nintendo-pictures-animation-studio">work of Nintendo Pictures</a> - its Tokyo-based animation studio that launched back in 2022, formerly known as Dynamo Pictures.</p>
<p>What's more, the music references the main <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pikmin">Pikmin</a> theme tune at the start, while the focus on items being carried certainly alludes to the little plant creatures. And if you check under the bed at 1'41, a little red creature can be seen scurrying around.</p>

<p>Could this be hinting at a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> version of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pikmin-4">Pikmin 4</a>? That game does include levels themed around a child's bedroom. But why go to the trouble of a new animated short?</p>
<p>At the very least, it's a beautifully animated film and extremely cute.</p>
<p>What do you think Nintendo is hinting at?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Hades 2’s Story Doesn’t Change The Status Quo]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/hades-2-ending</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hades-2%E2%80%99s-story-doesn%E2%80%99t-change-the-status-quo.1318582/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In <em>Hades II</em>’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-iHDj3EwdI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reveal trailer</a>, Melinoë says: “Wait for me, Father, I’ll be there soon.” At first glance, this seems like a straightforward subversion; where Zagreus fought up out of the underworld to escape his father, the titular Hades, Melinoë fights down into it to rescue Hades from his own father, the titan Chronos.&nbsp;</p><p>But flipping this goal isn’t so simple. The Hades of <em>Hades I</em> is an abusive patriarch and part of a terrible system of godly royalty. As Zagreus finds his path out from underneath Hades’ grasp, he also helps nearly every other character with the injustices they’ve suffered at the hands of the divine pantheon.</p><p>But the Hades of <em>Hades II</em> is a figure of, well, mythological worship for Melinoë, who was taken from her family as a baby and only has stories of him to work from – stories told by the other gods who want their own rulership back. Hades is presented as a family man, doting on his new daughter; the abuse of the previous game is never mentioned. And even as the gods’ capricious whims are detailed by&nbsp; various characters, the game does nothing to subvert the idea that you should put those gods back on their ‘rightful’ thrones.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>This piece contains spoilers for the whole of </em></strong><strong>Hades II</strong><strong><em>, including the post-credits quests and multiple late-game side stories</em></strong>.</p><p>Every time <em>Hades II </em>got a new early access update that unearthed more of its overarching story, I waited for Supergiant to introduce a twist into Melinoë’s propagandized drive to re-establish the godly totalitarianism spearheaded by the villain of the first game. But 1.0 has come and gone, and Melinoë’s task never changes. While there are throwaway hints that the age of the gods won’t last forever,&nbsp; Melinoë never learns of Hades’ abuse of Zagreus, and she does nothing for the many people she calls friends who suffer under the system she has fought so hard to uphold.</p><p>There is one clear moment in the game’s ending where Supergiant explores breaking the cycle. Melinoë can’t beat Chronos without Zagreus’ help, in a timewarping plot that is supposed to have Chronos killed before he ever comes to power. But Zagreus doesn’t kill Chronos; instead he offers him mercy. In isolation, this moment lands. But it lands as a cap on <em>Hades I</em>, which was a character study in Zag’s bottomless compassion. As the ending to <em>Hades II</em>, it only serves to spotlight the differences between Zagreus’ journey and Melinoë’s.&nbsp;</p><p>At every turn, Zagreus improves the lives of those around him. We are shown character after character who has had their life ruined by the tyranny of the gods, and who, with Zagreus’ help, manages to improve their lot while still acknowledging that they live within an order that is unfair and cruel. In <em>Hades I</em>, Achilles and Patroclus, separated for who knows how long after their deaths, are able to finally reunite. So are Orpheus and Euridice. Despite the inherently Sisyphean nature of the roguelite, Zagreus even manages to free the actual Sisyphus from his plight. In all these cases, what was done to these characters is recognised as an injustice of divine power, and those injustices are at least partially rectified.</p><p>Compare this to <em>Hades II</em>’s plotline for Narcissus and Echo. Echo was first cursed by Hera to only repeat back what was said to her, and then, after spurning Echo, Narcissus was cursed by Nemesis to fall in love with himself. Narcissus can be found staring at himself in the waters of Oceanus; Echo now exists listlessly in the Fields of Mourning. Melinoë can get them to briefly reunite, and point out to Nemesis that this act of retribution did nothing to help Echo. But Melinoë doesn’t do anything for her either; Narcissus will visit and they will talk, and we’re told this gives them both some kind of closure, but as it happens offscreen, it’s hard to understand what this is.&nbsp;</p><p>After they’re briefly reunited, Melinoë can restore Narcissus’ waters so that he can continue to stare at himself. “As for you,” she says to Echo, “I sense that you don’t ever want to change.” By maxing her bond, you’ll unlock a conversation in Echo’s own voice where she refuses any more help, because she helps others “by reflecting their feelings and thoughts.” At no point are either of their lives meaningfully improved, nor is the fault of Hera or Nemesis explored. This storyline echoes <em>Hades I</em>, but lacks the resonance and change that made those earlier stories work.&nbsp;</p><p>Another character deeply wronged by the gods is Arachne, who was turned into a spider for beating Athena in a weaving contest. She speaks often of her resentment for not only Athena but the entire pantheon who turned a blind eye to the injustice done to her. Later, Melinoë and Arachne learn it was Hecate’s poison that was used in the transformation; Hecate says her allegiance “forcibly is with the gods, not with arrogant mortals.” Melinoë intercedes, but Arachne refuses to grovel in front of Athena, saying she’d rather be a spider than apologise. And she’s right! Athena’s retribution was unfounded and petty; Arachne has nothing to be sorry for.&nbsp;</p><p>But, like Hecate, I’m forced to side with the gods rather than the innocent Arachne. Her refusal to apologize is the end of the story; Melinoë won’t push back any further against Athena or find a different solution to ease Arachne’s suffering. As in <em>Hades I</em>, I can’t change the system, but unlike <em>Hades I</em>, there’s no respite I can provide within it. Instead, I just keep helping Athena to win her war. Arachne suggests that the gods are facing the consequences of their own pride in a mirror of her story, but Melinoë does nothing throughout the game except ensure that they are not.</p><p>In another example, the witch Circe briefly speaks to Odysseus in his quest where he reunites with his family. She thanks Melinoë for putting that “shade to rest.” As for Odysseus, that reunion happens offscreen; there’s no pathos to it, nor any challenge to Poseidon for cursing him in the first place.</p><p>Overall, the endings of side characters’ plotlines mostly exist to hammer home a theme of acceptance and closure. But accepting what’s been done to these characters is unsatisfying. Nowhere is this more obvious than in the character of Prometheus, a character from mythology who is inherently sympathetic given that he was punished for providing fire to humanity, and who also talks candidly in the game about the unfairness of having his liver eaten daily in retribution. He speaks of fighting for mortals, whilst the gods fight only for themselves. Many people, myself included, thought that Prometheus' inarguably correct lines about the nature of power and the injustice of the punishments doled out to those who oppose it would lead to some kind of twist. And yet he’s unchangeably a boss to be defeated. Melinoë offers no counterargument except further violence. Even after Zagreus offers mercy to Chronos, it’s impossible to change Prometheus' fate.&nbsp;</p><p>The game does state in the ending that after having their right to rule reinstated, the gods suddenly begin to treat mortals better. Moreover, in the post-game quest immediately following, the Fates, characters who have been missing and who are supposed to give everyone their lot in life, abdicate their responsibility. This is perhaps hinting that Prometheus, titan of foresight, was aiming for this outcome all along and that this will result in mortals being able to make their own way in the world free from divine meddling. But we’re not actually shown any evidence of that actually being the case. And none of the characters we do see who have been wronged by the gods get any kind of apology, let alone restitution.&nbsp;</p><p>Though <em>Hades II</em> has one swift ending beat about breaking cycles, there’s no scaffolding for that theme in any of the smaller stories that make up the bulk of the narrative. Worse, where <em>Hades I</em> focused on the unfairness of the gods’ rule and argued that while it might not be changeable, it was subvertable, <em>Hades II</em> simply superficially claims that absolute power turns out okay in the end, and if it was too late for you, well, you just need to make peace with that.&nbsp;</p><p>That’s not a leap I’m not willing to take, not with the real world how it is, and not with how it breaks from <em>Hades I</em>. In 2020, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-early-access-journey-has-been-more-important-than-the-destination" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I wrote</a> as <em>Hades I </em>moved from early access to 1.0 that “with so much feeling insurmountable, watching Zagreus try anyway and be rewarded for his efforts lights a similar little fire in the soles of my feet. A better (under)world is possible.” In 2025, watching Melinoë largely prop up kings without meaningfully improving the circumstances of her friends, peers, and those who have been wronged only leaves me feeling hollow.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/gachiakuta-mori-calliope-vtuber-opening-anime-crunchyroll"><h3>VTuber Mori Calliope’s Anime Dream Came Full Circle In Creating Gachiakuta’s New Theme Song</h3></a><p>Mori Colliope's longtime love for Gachiakuta’s manga and her close bond with creator Kei Urana helped shape its explosive new song “Let’s Just Crash”</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/wayward-netflix-martin"><h3>Wayward Is A Queer Exploration Of The Troubled Teen Industry</h3></a><p>Mae Martin's new Netflix show creates a *very* creepy small town</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/one-battle-after-another-review-aftercha"><h3>One Battle After Another Is An Instant Classic That Plays Fast And Loose With Its Politics&nbsp;</h3></a><p>One Battle After Another is an instant popcorn classic that explores the murky, ugly side of revolution and the sexual hangups of fascism.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/hades-2-ending]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>One of the most pleasant surprises of the past couple of weeks has been Skate. If you’ve been around gaming for a while – which I, ahem, have – then you’ll know Skate from the days of the Xbox 360 and PS3, where it went board to board with Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater by offering a completely different take on the sport and the skateboarding scene. Many had assumed that Skate 3 – released 15 whole years ago – was the end for the series, especially with the shuttering of developer EA Black Box, but just like any skateboarder whose face has felt the cool touch of tarmac, you can’t keep a good game series down. The new version of Skate ten, has just arrived in Early Access, and with the launch of Season One today, the team at Full Circle have announced that the game has already seen 15 million players hitting the sidewalks of San Vansterdam.</p>
<p><iframe title="skate. | Early Access Season 1 Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Mi9EKoBCSg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>That’s a hell of a lot of people. And with good reason too, since the move to Free-To-Play has made this the most accessible skateboarding game we’ve ever had. Even if you only have the most passing interest in skateboarding – perhaps you watched Lords of Dogtown with Heath Ledger in back in the day and thought it was pretty cool – there’s literally no reason not to download the new Skate and check it out. That certainly seems to be what people are doing too, as the player numbers have soared in only three weeks.</p>
<p>I’ve spent some serious time in San Vansterdam already, and really enjoyed this initial foray into Early Access in my review, stating, “I’ve been waiting for Skate. Tony Hawk’s frantic take on the sport is cool, but it doesn’t feel as good as this. The freedom, the variety, and the community are already in place, the only thing missing is you.”</p>
<p><em>Season 1 launches today with all-new skateable areas, Challenges, Tasks, seasonal events, new brand partners, cosmetics, quality of life improvements and more.</em></p>

<p>But what could it mean?</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Nintendo has released a surprise new short film called '<strong>Close To You</strong>' and it's... not what we expected from the House of Mario.</p>
<p>Initially shared on the Nintendo Today! app before cropping up on YouTube and socials, the short follows a baby that learns to take its first steps via the magic of a sentient dummy (or pacifier, if you'd rather).</p>
<p>It feels very Toy Story, and the animation style has big Pixar energy to boot, but the strangest part of it all is how it feels very... un-Nintendo. There's no Mario to seen, the baby doesn't stumble past some Joy-Con at any point, there's not even a Pikmin cameo.</p>
<p>Or is there? It feels to us like there's something missing in this short. Don't you get the impression that we <em>should</em> be seeing something carrying the dummy or pushing the blocks? Do we spy something moving under the bed in the background <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsufGY5I8jA&amp;t=99s">around 1:38</a>? Doesn't the music sound a little <em>too</em> Pikmin-coded?</p>

<figure data-uuid="d1d7a901a905b"><a title="Nintendo Close To You Zoom" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d1d7a901a905b/nintendo-close-to-you-zoom.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The whole thing has a whiff of an invisible Pikmin scheme to us, but hey, that's just a theory. Whether this turns out to be something bigger, well, we're just going to have to wait and see.</p>
<p><em>What do you make of this animated short? Do you think it will be part of something larger? Let us know in the comments.</em></p></section>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/battlefield-studios-ea-tease-naval-warfare-on-the-horizon-battlefield-6/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-studios-and-ea-tease-that-naval-warfare-is-on-the-horizon-for-battlefield-6.1318558/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>At the time of this writing, Battlefield 6 is days away from launching on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S worldwide. The <a href="https://x.com/Battlefield/status/1974127507260510622">global launch times are up</a>, and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-reportedly-has-1-7-million-pre-orders-predicted-to-sell-5-million-first-week/">estimated 1.7 million players bought in for October 10</a> will be boots on the ground by the end of the week. So naturally, it's time for Battlefield Studios and EA to talk about what's next for Battlefield 6 on October 11, and every day after that.</p>



<p>In the latest <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/community-update-play-your-way">Community Update blog post on the Battlefield website</a>, Battlefield Studios laid out a few data points regarding what it has noticed over the course of its Battlefield Labs testing, followed by updates and changes players who participated in that testing and in the Beta this summer will notice when the game launches this coming Friday.</p>



<p>Towards the end of the post, in the section titled, "<em>On the Horizon</em>," the Battlefield Studios team writes, "<em>There is much more to look forward to beyond our Seasons as our team continues reviewing Battlefield Labs data, player feedback, and ideating on completely new ideas for the future, starting with an exciting new Battlefield take on Battle Royale.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Separately, requests for naval warfare have not gone unnoticed, nor have the calls for a certain fan-favourite little helicopter, platoons, and more</em>.<em> We appreciate all of your suggestions, and want you to know we're listening.</em>"</p>



<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-1-starts-october-28-roadmap-unveiled/">recently revealed Season 1 roadmap </a>doesn't include the introduction of naval warfare, nor does it include the return of Little Bird, the helicopter that is most likely referenced by the phrase "<em>little helicopter</em>." But that doesn't mean those inclusions won't be ready for Season 2, or Season 3, and so on. At least Battlefield Studios has made the point that it is part of the conversation for Battlefield 6's future.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Vampire Survivors&nbsp;</em>developer and publisher Poncle has announced a brand new update for the arcade roguelike, and it'll finally bring the ability to play the game online alongside your friends.</p>

<p>As revealed in <a href="https://x.com/poncle_vampire/status/1975546530238013703" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on X,&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors&nbsp;</em>Update 1.14 is due to arrive sometime this fall, and it's bringing online co-op to the game on both PC and consoles, although it's not clear right now whether the game's multiplayer mode will feature crossplay.</p>

<p>Of course, Poncle revealed the news of&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors</em>' online co-op mode with a characteristically amusing trailer featuring a throwback Windows 95-style operating system, so if, like me, you're hopelessly nostalgic for the days of old-school PC gaming, this one'll appeal to you.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/poncle-vampire-survivors-online-co-op-update-windows-95.jpg?itok=VZADLhqn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/poncle-vampire-survivors-online-co-op-update-windows-95.jpg?itok=S10Mc8B4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Oh, Poncle, you rogue, you.</figcaption></figure><p>The trailer also shows a clip of four players enjoying&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors&nbsp;</em>together, and indeed, the game's online co-op mode will support up to four players, so grab three friends and get ready to fill the screen with an absolutely cosmic amount of projectiles.</p>

<p>As well as online co-op, there are four more major features to be revealed as part of&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors&nbsp;</em>Update 1.14, and Poncle is pledging to reveal new cards each week, so we'll learn more about what else is coming as part of this update in...well, in a week, as it happens.</p>

<p>News of&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors</em>' latest update comes just a couple of months after Poncle announced its second major <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-survivors-studio-poncle-publishing" rel="nofollow">foray into the publishing world</a> in the form of brick-breaking roguelike&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kill-the-brickman-poncle-out-now" rel="nofollow">Kill the Brickman</a>&nbsp;</em>(no, not that one).</p>




<p>As for the game that made Poncle's name, if you're somehow unfamiliar with it,&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors&nbsp;</em>is an action-heavy arcade roguelike in which you must survive hordes of enemies swarming you across a variety of different maps.</p>

<p>To that end, you'll gain access to projectile and melee weapons that fire themselves, so it's up to you to position yourself correctly and try to build the perfect combination of items in order to survive for as long as you possibly can.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/vampire-survivors/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/vampire-survivors/9pd5bm2z8c4l" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/vampire-survivors-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dyson-v11-cordless-vacuum-at-lowest-price-yet-ahead-of-prime-day-2000631582</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dyson-v11-origin-cordless-vacuum-just-dropped-below-the-older-v8-pricing-for-amazon-prime-day.1318552/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’re under a week out from Prime Big Deals Day. This is Amazon’s two-day sales event where you’ll be able to find steep discounts on products across every category — tech, home goods, automotive, you name it. Despite the even not starting until Tuesday, October 7, you can already start finding some great deals right now. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4478/">The Dyson V11 Origin cordless vacuum has dropped to $400 for Prime users. The stick vacuum normally goes for $630 so you’d be saving a full $230.</a> That’s a 37% discount and it’s not even Prime Big Deals Day yet.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4478/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>Convenience is really prime selling point for a cordless stick vacuum and the Dyson V11 is no exception. This vacuum is easy to move around throughout the home. It’s both lightweight and ergonomic so you can pick it up and clean up high up hard to reach places with ease. Transform the vacuum into a handheld, making it ever easier to maneuver while still not losing any power. That makes it a perfect tool for taking care of the interior of your car before before the next time it’s your turn to drive the friend group.</p>

<h2>Remove Pet Hair From Your Home</h2>
<p>Pet owners wouldn’t give up our furry little friends for the world, but we could sure do without all the hair that falls off of them. It digs into the carpet and can retain that very distinct odor that makes guests who walk in for the first time go, “hey do you have a dog?” Well, the Dyson V11 stick vacuum can help keep your couches and carpets free of fur. The vac comes with a hair screw tool, conical in shape, which can help get hair detangled while you’re going about cleaning your home. The Motorbar cleaner can automatically clear any hair that’s gotten wrapped up around the brush bar.</p>



<p>The vacuum is cordless, so it’s running off of a battery. That battery can last you approximately 100 minutes on a single charge. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4478/">That’s roughly an hour longer than the Dyson V8 can hold up, which is a lot after considering that the V11’s motor spins at 125,000rpm and generates 60% more power than the V8</a>. When the vacuum is not in use, it can be neatly stored against the wall dock, recharging it on its own while its been put away. The LCD screen atop the vacuum shows you exactly how much battery life you have left so you won’t have any unexpected stops while vacuuming because your forgot to charge.</p>

                                                      </p><div>
              
              <p>As the AI plagiarism machines continue to churn out ever-more semi-realistic slop, including <a href="https://kotaku.com/sora-2-update-pokemon-nintendo-openai-sam-altman-ai-2000632089">videos of OpenAI’s CEO Sam Altman eating a barbecued Pikachu</a>, the harm to any number of industries is incalculable. But there is also the personal harm, and no one has captured it better than actor and director Zelda Williams, daughter of the late Robin Williams, in a recent post on her Instagram.</p> <p>As <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/ai/zelda-williams-ethers-ai-tributes-to-her-dead-dad-youre-making-disgusting-over-processed-hotdogs-out-of-the-lives-of-human-beings/">reported by&nbsp;<em>PC Gamer</em></a>, Zelda Williams posted an Instagram story (that has since expired) in which she begged her followers to “just stop sending me AI videos of Dad.”</p> <p>Sora, the AI video app from OpenAI, is flooding the internet with macabre depictions of both dead and living celebrities and public figures saying and doing things they’ve never said nor done. Obviously this can be enormously damaging for people’s reputations, with credulous viewers reposting such footage as fact. But what doesn’t always get thought about is how it affects the loved ones of those depicted, especially of those who have died. Such videos don’t need to be outlandish or offensive to achieve this, either—if anything, the more benign a video is, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@stealthlurking/video/7557903802280594702?q=sora%20robin%20williams&amp;t=1759840729478">the more insidious and upsetting it can be</a>.</p>

 <p>“Stop believing I wanna see it or that I’ll understand, I don’t and I won’t,” Williams wrote in her post. “If you’re just trying to troll me, I’ve seen way worse, I’ll restrict and move on. But please, if you’ve got any decency, just stop doing this to him and to me, to everyone even, full stop. It’s dumb, it’s a waste of time and energy, and believe me, it’s NOT what he’d want.”</p>

 <p>As Rich Stanton points out in his&nbsp;<em>PCG</em> article, Robin Williams was famous for not wanting his face and voice used to hawk any old plastic tat, so it’s especially vile to note the constant dripping from the AI sewage pipe that’s putting words into his mouth. As his daughter puts it, “To watch the legacies of real people be condensed down to ‘this vaguely looks and sounds like them so that’s enough’, just so other people can churn out horrible TikTok slop puppeteering them is maddening.”</p>

 <p>“You’re not making art,” Zelda Williams continues. “You’re making disgusting, over-processed hotdogs out of the lives of human beings, out of the history of art and music, and then shoving them down someone else’s throat hoping they’ll give you a little thumbs up and like it. Gross.”</p>

 <p>And then, in unimprovable words, the actor sums up everything that’s so grim about it all:</p> <blockquote><p>And for the love of EVERYTHING, stop calling it ‘the future,’ AI is just badly recycling and regurgitating the past to be re-consumed. You are taking in the Human Centipede of content, and from the very very end of the line, all while the folks at the front laugh and laugh, consume and consume.</p></blockquote> <p id="dea0a845-47f5-4786-9ec0-3212f05d3981-2">Even OpenAI is <a href="https://kotaku.com/sora-2-update-pokemon-nintendo-openai-sam-altman-ai-2000632089">balking</a> at the way the just-launched Sora 2 is being used, with Altman backtracking on its ability to use any copyrighted materials, saying from now on companies will have to opt in. But this offers nothing to protect individuals, or their loved ones, from being depicted in such intrusive and ghoulish ways.</p> <p>Remember when AI was going to do all the boring jobs for us so we could live happier, freer lives? Yeah, turns out all it’s capable of is cheap tricks and making people sad.</p>
