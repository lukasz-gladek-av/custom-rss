            <p>
Dead Space developer and Striking Distance co-founder Glen Schofield left Striking Distance last September, following lower-than-hoped sales and mixed reviews for the studio's debut project The Callisto Protocol. Now, he's back to share a little about the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game's difficult development, offering details of cut materials, a complicated relationship with parent company Krafton, the impact of Covid, and abandoned plans for a sequel.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The interview in question is with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IIVia5aiUQ">Youtuber Dan Allen</a>. While more appreciative than critical, it's a long, candid chat that's worth watching in full if you're interested in the game. I've put together some highlights. 
</p>
<p>
Striking Distance were founded in 2019 as part of Krafton's efforts to establish revenue streams beyond their legendary battle royale Plunkbat, aka PUBG: Battlegrounds. The Callisto Protocol began life as a game in the PUBG universe but eventually became its own thing, heavily inspired by Dead Space. It was a tough project from the outset. "We started off with a new studio, a new company, a new IP, a new everything," Schofield recalled to Allen. "And then we're six months into it, and they say, by the way, there's new consoles. They actually thought, let's just switch to PS5, and I said well that's a magnitude harder. We're talking millions of dollars more." 
</p>
<p>
Nonetheless, Schofield said the relationship between Striking Distance and Krafton was positive at first. "I really liked working with them for the first couple of years. It was really the last year or so [before I left] - we went public and it put an awful strain on the company, the board of directors and everybody else, and then they put the strain on us."
</p>
<p>
Amongst other things, Schofield feels he was deceived about how much time Striking Distance had to finish the game, which led to impractical project scoping. "I wanted about three and a half more months, and I was led to believe for about three months, four months that that's the way it was going to be," he said. "Actually in October or September of '21, I was told that, you know, you're going to get the time - just, 'no regrets'. That was the term that kept being used, 'no regrets'. Just put whatever you want into the game." 
</p>
<p>
Buoyed by this encouragement, Schofield and other Striking Distance devs spent the Xmas 2021 holiday working on the game - "just designing, coming up with other ideas with some of the guys. And January comes around and some of the [Krafton] folks come over and they just said, 'no, no, no, no - it's December of 2022'.
</p>
<p>
"And I was like, it's not going to get done and it's going to cost you more money. It's not like it costs you less money because you're getting it out three months sooner, no. Because if I just kept it on the way it was going, I wouldn't have to add anybody. But if you want it done, I got to accelerate everything by three and a half months, which means I need to jam people on here - if I need 20 people, I actually need to get 30 or 40, because that learning curve will not adjust."
</p>
<p>
In hindsight, Schofield says he should have "put my foot down on not shipping it", to the point of challenging Krafton to take away control of the company. "If you want the game to ship, come take over the studio and ship it. Sometimes you don't know who you are, and four or five years ago I was like, who am I, telling these guys I'm not going to ship it. I should have, absolutely."
</p>
<p>
Schofield isn't without fault amid all this. In October 2022, he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/striking-distance-studios-ceo-posts-then-deletes-a-tweet-thought-by-some-to-promote-crunch-culture">boasted</a> on Xitter about Striking Distance staff working "6-7 days a week". Schofield subsequently apologised in an interview with <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/callisto-protocol-sequel-glen-schofield-interview">Inverse</a> for making his employees crunch on the game, and promised to keep healthier working hours during subsequent projects. I'd be interested to get some perspective on his management tactics from other members of Striking Distance, former or current.
</p>
<p>
The Callisto Protocol met with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-callisto-protocol-review">iffy verdicts at launch</a>, not least thanks to technical problems on PC. In the wake of its release, Schofield says that Striking Distance and Krafton essentially stopped talking to each other. "As we're making DLC, I kid you not, they started ignoring me. The game came out December 2nd. As we're making DLC, I'm telling the team to start <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-callisto-protocols-pc-patches-restore-it-to-full-yeah-its-alright-glory">patching</a> - I'm going to go out to the community, I'm going to ask them for help. We know what we want to put in the game, and we're just going to patch it. And so we just kept patching. And Krafton weren't talking to us - they were just like, where's the DLC? We did 86 patches, and in three and a half months, that's what we needed. And on PlayStation Network it kicked ass. The reviews were really good."
</p>
<p>
According to Schofield, Krafton lacked the experience as a company to nurture an original videogame property beyond PUBG. "What new IPs need around them is some steady guys, but the truth is they were so new at the time - they didn't have any new evergreen-type games". He feels it's absurd that Krafton haven't (that we know of) greenlit a sequel, given the amount that had to be chopped from The Callisto Protocol during development. "The fact they're not making it is ridiculous, because Callisto, we had to cut two and a half bosses out of it. I mean, I had to cut like three or four enemies out of it." 
</p>
<p>
Some of these cuts were brought about not by Krafton's release schedule but staff sickness during the on-going Covid pandemic. "America lost 1.2 million people, right?" Schofield said. "This wasn't like 'oh, they're getting sick'. One of my best friends, my college roommate died. We all lost people. 
</p>
<p>
"On top of that, when someone got sick, and inevitably you have a studio of 200-250 people, 10 to 20 people a month were getting sick, and they were getting sick for weeks, right? We were devastated. It was sometimes our whole department of VFX would be out, our animation department." Differences between how the US and South Korean governments handled the pandemic exacerbated communication difficulties with Krafton. "When I would call in Korea they're not having that problem, right? You know, we don't follow rules as well maybe [in the USA]? I don't know what it is, but we have a bigger country, you know, it doesn't matter. 
</p>
<p>
"We lost a lot of people. We went through hell, and then on top of that in '21, we had the 'great resignation'. We had 49 people quit on top of that. Because everybody's paying through the roof, and so people are leaving for $10,000 more, and they don't have to leave their house - all they got to do is turn in their equipment, and in most cases, we tell them you can keep the equipment. 2021 was the worst year in development of my life, because you had Covid going on, you had the great resignation going on. I did not even think we'd get the game done. And we're cutting stuff to get it out. We added some stuff back in in the end. Freed up some time - not time, freed up some people. But you're right, there should be a sequel."
</p>
<p>
Schofield's abandoned plans for the sequel include a story concept featuring side character Dani Nakamura as lead. Another scenario would have brought back the original game's Jacob, who was voice-acted by Josh Duhamel. "I wanted to bring back Josh and but I actually wanted to to act like he was dead, and start off with a different character and then halfway through this character dies, and then they're like 'well, we know one guy' and then you surprisingly bring him back," Schofield said.
</p>
<p>
I wasn't a huge fan of The Callisto Protocol myself, but I am automatically enthused for anything that whiffs of Dead Space, and I'm sorry to hear that development of the game was such an ordeal. Again, though, I'd like to get some perspective beyond Schofield's on the making of the game.

			<p>KRAFTON, the developers of PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS has announced the <a href="https://pubg.com/en/main" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest update</a> for the game, which is now live on PC. This update is a game changer for any who utilize the PUBG Clans system. PUBG Clans will now be able to unlock weekly rewards by completing challenges and missions. There are also new weapon attachments for those who enjoy modding their weapons to the fullest.</p>
<p>The new Clan Challenges and Clan Member Missions provides new ways to engage as a team and earn in-game rewards. It allows Clan members to complete challenges together to earn Gauge Points, which will then go on to determine the class of the Clan Supply Airplane.</p>
<p>The higher the class, the better the rewards will be when they are able to open the new Clan Loot Caches. Clan members will have to stay consistent with the amount of missions and challenges they complete though, as the Gauge Points slightly decrease weekly, which could make or break the class of the Clan Supply Airplane.</p>
<p>In addition to these challenges and missions, Clans in<a href="https://wccftech.com/pubg-battlegrounds-is-upgrading-to-unreal-engine-5-and-getting-destructible-maps/"> PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS</a> can now earn an exclusive currency called Clan Tokens by successfully completing Weekly Clan XP Goals. Once you have earned these tokens, you can then use them at the Clan Token Exchange, which can be used to purchase a wide variety of items such as Clan Tag Plates, Sandbox Mode Tickets, Hunter's Chest Tickets and much more. In addition, Clans can now add community links on the Clan Management page, which can help Clans be more organized with their play time.</p>
<p>In addition to the Clan update, there are a bunch of new and updated attachments in PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS. This includes the Muzzle Brake attachment, which is compatible with most ARs, DMRs and some Shotguns. By using this attachment, it significantly reduces camera shake when firing, and can help with horizontal and vertical recoil.</p>
<p>In addition to the Muzzle Break attachment, existing attachments such as the Holographic Sight, Thumb Grip, Angled Foregrip, Lightweight Grip and Heavy Stock all received updates to make the experience smoother and more enjoyable for the players.</p>
<p>The last major element of this update is the beginning of Ranked Season 31. With the start of the new season, players will now be able to receive their rewards from participating in Season 30. These rewards include Emblems, Medals and Nameplates, which will vary according to the player's final tier from the previous Ranked season.</p>
<p>Players who managed to obtain the Gold Tier or above will receive a Ranked Weapon Skin. The rewards given after the season ends are available for use exclusively during a single Ranked season, except for permanent items such as the Ranked Weapon Skins and Medals.</p>

                <p>Sony's latest financial results for the Q1 period of its 2024 financial year--April 1 to June 30--are in, and the <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/" rel="nofollow ">company has revealed</a> that the PS5 has reached 61.7 million lifetime sales so far. In this quarter, 2.4 million PS5 consoles were sold, a figure that's down by 27% when compared to the 3.3 million PS5 consoles sold during the same period in the previous financial year.</p><p>Overall, Sony says Q1 sales in its Games and Network Services section were still up 12% year-on-year, resulting in a 32% increase in operating income. The company added that first-party sales and PlayStation Plus subscriptions grew, with 80% of the 53.6 million PS5 games sold in Q1 being digital purchases. Software sales brought in $3.30 billion in revenue, almost 20% growth year-on-year, but hardware revenue did decline by 21% to $990 million.</p>

<p>Sony also reported 116 million registered monthly active users, an increase when compared to 108 million last year but a decrease from Q4 FY23's 118 million. Looking ahead, Sony has a relatively quiet year when it comes to first-party games. Multiplayer game Concord launches later this month and an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/astro-bot-sequel-announced-for-ps5-coming-september-6/1100-6523821/">Astro Bot sequel arrives on September 6</a>, but beyond that, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/no-major-sony-franchise-game-releases-are-coming-until-april-2025-at-earliest/1100-6521071/" data-ref-id="1100-6521071">no new entries from major franchises</a> like Spider-Man, God of War, The Last of Us, or Horizon are expected until April 2025 at the earliest.</p><p>There are several big third-party games scheduled to arrive later this year on PS5--Star Wars Outlaws, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, and EA Sports FC 25, to name a few--and Sony has adjusted its forecast for the gaming division, predicting a 3% increase in sales and operating income for the 2024 financial year.</p>

You're getting Vault Tec, Hot Rod Flames, Brotherhood of Steel Paladin, Military, and Rusted paint jobs, and each figure comes with an accessory like a box of Sugar Bombs breakfast cereal. Admittedly you won't be doing a lot of construction here, as you're only building rigs for the figures to rest in, but once everything has been assembled and put together, the end result looks impressive. This even comes in a Fallout 4 crate-inspired box, for that extra touch of authenticity.</p><p>If you're looking to build a Fallout shrine with some more collectibles, the McFarlane Movie Maniacs line has some great options. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/McFarlane-Toys-Movie-Maniacs-Exclusive/dp/B0CQ8SSCRJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">You can pick up a three-pack of figures for $110</a>, and this includes Lucy, The Ghoul, and Maximus from the Fallout TV series.

                <p>There hasn't been an official new Fallout game for years now, but the fan-made Fallout 4 mod Fallout London is the closest thing we're going to get for a while. Team FOLON, the developer of the mod, says that a hotfix is coming soon to fix crashing issues that many players have reported, and that a large update will come soon after.</p><p dir="ltr">Team FOLON announced the move on its Discord (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-london-hotfix-still-on-the-way-along-with-huge-update" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>). "We have some big plans for the future, starting with a hotfix. This hotfix will address some crashes and include essential systems like 'Buffout 4,' which will be merged into the mod itself. We've also identified several other fixes that will provide immediate help…We're already working on a HUGE patch that will address all the issues reported in our Discord, as well as a multitude of quest-related and other problems."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PuzpblWpVM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8PuzpblWpVM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Released in late July, Fallout London completely overhauls Fallout 4 and all of its DLC. The mod includes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/is-fallout-london-worth-your-time/1100-6525518/">many of the elements</a> you'd expect, including double-decker buses, red phone booths, and some of the global capital's more famous landmarks. It replaces the series' usual currency of bottle caps with Tube Tickets, and its version of London is comparable to Fallout 4's Boston in scope and scale.</p><p dir="ltr">But while the mod has garnered a warm reception from players, its stability issues <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fallout4london/comments/1eg2zj7/my_lengthy_fallout_london_review/" rel="nofollow ">have been noted</a> by many, so it's good to hear that they're working on fixing them. In other Fallout news, Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-gaming-marks-500-million-monthly-players-notes-fallout-tv-shows-impact-on-game-pass/1100-6525422/" data-ref-id="1100-6525422">pointed</a> to the success of the Fallout TV show as a major factor in Microsoft Gaming notching 500 million monthly players across all platforms.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/abiotic-factor-sales-top-600k-three-months-out-from-launch.946797/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/abiotic-factor-sales-600k<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Deep Field Games and publisher Playstack have announced another major&nbsp;<em>Abiotic Factor&nbsp;</em>sales milestone, so it looks like the indie survival-crafter is still trundling along very nicely.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/427410/view/4340992597617796542" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new post</a> on the&nbsp;<em>Abiotic Factor&nbsp;</em>Steam page, the two studios announce that the game has reached 600,000 sales, which isn't bad considering it's only been out for around three months.</p>
<p>At last count,&nbsp;<em>Abiotic Factor&nbsp;</em>sales stood at 250,000, a figure the game achieved <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/abiotic-factor-sales-250k">within just a week or so</a> on sale, so while sales have slowed down, they've remained pretty strong considering this is an indie project.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/abiotic-factor-sales-600k-artwork.jpg?itok=F5GEemf0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/abiotic-factor-sales-600k-artwork.jpg?itok=Q-jGBnhF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Abiotic Factor&nbsp;</em>has racked up 600,000 sales, which isn't bad.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're an&nbsp;<em>Abiotic Factor&nbsp;</em>fan, you'll also be pleased to know that there's likely more news about the game coming up, although Playstack and Deep Field are remaining tight-lipped about what it might be for now.</p>
<p>In the announcement, the two studios say that the new sales figure "isn’t the only big announcement we’ve got for this week". Could we be about to get a reveal for a console version of&nbsp;<em>Abiotic Factor</em>? We can but hope.</p>
<p>If you haven't come across&nbsp;<em>Abiotic Factor&nbsp;</em>before, it's a survival-crafter set in a science facility that's sort of like a cross between&nbsp;<em>Half-Life</em>'s Black Mesa and the SCP containment HQ.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You and your fellow players (if, indeed, you choose to play with others) play as a group of scientists stranded in the facility, and you must scavenge for resources, build yourself a new base, and deal with the creatures and other hazards roaming the corridors.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/abiotic-factor-sales-600k-corridor.jpg?itok=RQVTMUND 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/abiotic-factor-sales-600k-corridor.jpg?itok=2JmmJDWF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>More surprises are on the way for&nbsp;<em>Abiotic Factor</em>.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Abiotic Factor&nbsp;</em>represents another hit for publisher Playstack; the studio has also enjoyed success recently with poker roguelike&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-one-million">broke a million sales earlier this year</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to know what all the fuss is about, you can grab&nbsp;<em>Abiotic Factor&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/427410/Abiotic_Factor/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>.

<p>
Sifu, from French developer Sloclap, released back in 2022 to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sifu-review">critical acclaim</a> and has since received multiple updates and additions. It's a martial arts roguelite in which its protagonist gradually ages each time they die.

<p>
High on Life, meanwhile, was developed by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/squanch-games">Squanch Games</a> founded by Rick and Morty co-creator Justin Roiland whose involvement was removed following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rick-and-morty-co-creator-departs-high-on-life-studio-he-founded-following-allegations">allegations of domestic abuse</a>.

</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/high-on-life-review-a-mediocre-shooter-with-an-unfunny-attitude-problem">Eurogamer's High on Life review</a> described the game as "a mediocre shooter with an unfunny attitude problem", but it was received positively by fans.

<p>
<a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/membership">Humble Choice</a> is the monthly subscription service from Humble, which provides a number of games available to own forever. Five percent of every membership fee goes to charity - this month's charity is the World Wildlife Fund.

<p>
At the end of last month, Humble's publishing arm <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/humble-games-confirms-restructuring-amid-reports-all-staff-have-been-laid-off">Humble Games confirmed a company "restructuring"</a> following reports of staff layoffs.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-season-of-the-infernal-hordes-now-live/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The latest season for Diablo IV is now live, titled <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-season-of-the-infernal-hordes-begins-on-august-6/">Season of the Infernal Hordes</a>. In this season, players will get to experience a new wave-based feature called Infernal Hordes, where you can slay waves of enemies time and time again to gain rewards.</p>
<p>For the first time in Diablo IV's history, this feature will be available in both the Seasonal Realm and the Eternal Realm. For the Seasonal Realm, there will be a Seasonal Questline that unlocks it, and with the Eternal Realm, there'll be a brief new Questline that unlocks the Infernal Hordes feature.</p>
<p>It's important to note that the new wave-based system is available on World Tier III, after players have completed the necessary questline. You can choose to kill the demons with friends or by yourself, selecting Infernal Offerings along the way that can either help or hinder your run. These Infernal Offerings not only give you a boon, but they also aid the demons by increasing their potency and the number of enemies that you will have to face off against. Players will have a limited amount of revives that can be used while battling through the Infernal Hordes. Lose all of your lives, and you'll be consumed by the demons.</p>
<p>A new exclusive feature to the Seasonal Realm is the Hellbreach Dungeons. They serve as an introduction before players dive head first into Infernal Hordes, which also comes with Seasonal Progression and the Season Journey.</p>
<p>This season, there are a lot of new changes that are arriving in Diablo IV, including 50 new Uniques and Legendaries that will continue to benefit the player long after the season has ended. The weapons that have specific qualities will have the best chance of appearing from Spoils of Hell in the Infernal Hordes, so make sure to keep an eye out for those weapons.</p>
<p>With this new season comes a bunch of tweaks and quality-of-life changes. This includes updates to the Helltide, Legendary drop rates and much more.</p>
<p>For example, Baneful Heart drops in the Helltide are now increased, and are guaranteed to drop from Helltide Commanders. Tortured Gifts now cost 75 Cinders.</p>
<p>Uber Uniques will now be known as Mythic Uniques, and will cast a obvious beacon of light into the sky if you find one to make sure you don't miss out on this loot. In addition, Legendary drop chances are now increased once you are past Level 100, if you are playing in the Helltide, Nightmare Dungeons or the Infernal Hordes.</p>
<p>Blizzard has released a <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo4/24119591/slay-endless-demons-in-season-of-the-infernal-hordes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">huge blog post</a> detailing everything you need to know about the Season of the Infernal Hordes, including all PTR changes.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/level-infinite-showcase-brings-exoborne-dune-awakening-on-august-21-2024/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/level-infinite-showcase-brings-exoborne-dune-awakening-on-august-21-2024.946782/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/level-infinite-showcase-brings-exoborne-dune-awakening-on-august-21-2024/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In a new <a href="https://x.com/LevelInfinite/status/1821169431147639063">post on X</a> today, Level Infinite confirmed the return of its “Into the Infinite” showcase, featuring both Exoborne and Dune Awakening this year.</p>



<p>Into the Infinite will also include other titles when it premieres on August 21, 2024, starting at 1 pm ET or 6 pm BST. Fans can tune in on Level Infinite’s Twitch or YouTube channels.</p>



<p>On YouTube, the event description elaborates on content fans can expect. It will feature “first-look trailers, updates on existing games, long-awaited announcements, and giveaways.”</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Extraction shooter Exoborne is generating a lot of buzz, particularly after developer Sharkmob announced a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sharkmob-announces-exoborne-playtests-with-public-signups/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">series of playtests</a> in May 2024. Fans are hoping to see a release date reveal trailer. </p>



<p>Dune Awakening got its first cinematic reveal trailer during <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-shown-at-summer-game-fest-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Summer Game Fest 2024</a>, and might also receive a concrete release date.</p>



<p>Most recently, Level Infinite announced a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-developer-rebellion-partners-with-level-infinite-for-project-archipelago/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">partnership with Rebellion</a> on an unannounced title. The title is currently in development under the codename “Project Archipelago,” an original IP.</p>



<p>Since the Level Infinite showcase is aiming for surprises, the Gamescom 2024 season would be an excellent opportunity to reveal more. Rebellion did confirm that playtests for Project Archipelago are coming “soon.”</p>



<p>In another <a href="https://x.com/LevelInfinite/status/1821184525440848183">post on X</a>, Level Infinite also mentioned its full lineup of 10 titles for Gamescom 2024. That adds Den of Wolves, V Rising, and more.</p>



<p>Level Infinite is the publisher behind PUBG Mobile and Honor of Kings, the latter of which hit <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/honor-of-kings-worldwide-launch-downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">50 million downloads</a> late last month.</p>



<hr>



<p>For more of the latest Insider Gaming news, you can read about Capcom announcing its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/capcom-reveals-gamescom-2024-lineup-with-monster-hunter-wilds-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full lineup of titles</a> like Monster Hunter Wilds coming to Gamescom 2024, and sign up to receive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/newsletter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our official newsletter</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/the-concerns-of-covering-gacha-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I may be one of the few people who spends their days checking out and covering the hottest and most original indie games, to then play a mobile game like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Arknights</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Limbus Company</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. For many people, mobile games reached their peak with either </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Candy Crush Saga</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Angry Birds</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and there haven’t been any games since.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But the market itself saw huge growth and change from around 2017-on, with impressive looking, and deep gameplay that would put some AAA games to shame. MihoYo has gone from being unknown to very much on par with Valve or peak Blizzard in the mobile space with the successes of their titles. But no matter how big these games are, no matter how successful they are, there is always the caveat of unethical monetization that is the foundation of these games, and that makes it very hard to have a discussion about them.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Growing up&nbsp;Gachaing"><span>Growing up&nbsp;Gachaing</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The mobile/gacha market expanded rapidly in the 2010’s, and yearly ESA surveys now cite that mobile is the most played platform of all games by a large margin. Before, mobile was looked at as something for a mom or grandparent to play when they’re bored or have a few minutes to spare. Today, you have titles with impressive stories, beautiful graphics, and advanced gameplay that continue to expand month after month.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There is a whole generation of gamers who have grown up with the understanding that playing games for “free” is the best way to experience them. But the dark truth is that no matter how “free” these games are to play, the allure of spending money is always there. I have spent money when I’ve played a few mobile games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Arknights</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Limbus</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Company</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but I can tell you that the thought of just loading up a game, dropping $500 or more on a whim for a good character or a six-star equipment piece has never crossed my mind.</span></p><p>content in gacha design has to be balanced between being good for the game, and a means to bring in money. (Source: Limbus Company)</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The mobile industry exists in a strange catch-22 — these games are supported for years to come at a rate that most studios could never realize, but that support comes with having a massive amount of income each month. Everyone on PC has expressed their hatred over </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Diablo Immortal</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but that didn’t stop it from making over 500 million dollars like it was nothing.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="I Pity the&nbsp;Gacha"><span>I Pity the&nbsp;Gacha</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I want to curtail a few defenses people are going to throw my way about gacha design. The first one is the ever popular, “but you don’t need to spend money to enjoy them.” The entire act of gacha design is to instill FOMO (fear of missing out) in the consumer base — if you don’t acquire that new six-star character, then your account is ruined, or that amazing new character will fit your team perfectly and you need to have them. There will always be people who will play these games using nothing but the free characters, but at the end of the day, to experience everything these games have to offer, you are going to seek those six stars.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Every gacha game I’ve played, whether intentionally or not, has inherent pain points and difficulty spikes for new players or accounts that aren’t powered up yet. With </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Limbus Company</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, by being there at the literal start of the game, my account now has access to every single piece of content in the game, and I have only spent about $40 for the different season passes. There are some fights in it that I can’t imagine a new or unlucky account ever having the means to win. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Arknights</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> can also be painful in some of the early chapters, I remember having problems with chapters 5 and 6 as I had no good ranged characters or six-stars to help me. Another defense I want to curtail is the “but you can add friends and request character” feature that many character collector mobile games have. I don’t like this feature as it acts as more of a Band-Aid fix for the inherent difficulty spike problems.</span></p><p>Hard and soft pity systems, are good ideas, but low drop rates are still a major obstacle (source: Snow break Containment Zone)</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s a hard line to walk when you’re designing the pacing and flow of these games — if you want people to go after six-star characters, then you need to design content that makes them interesting to use. But designing content around them will also make it worse for the people who don’t have access to them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The other defense people will bring up is the use of pity systems — where after X amount of pulls, you are guaranteed a six-star or featured character. I think a hard pity system on every banner should be the industry standard, full stop. However, no one has a good idea of what should be a standard hard pity. In some games, the “pity” may still require over a hundred dollars per banner, and players may only earn enough free currency for 1 to 2 10-pulls a month.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When I tried out the game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Nikke</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, I reached a hard limit on account progress placed by the developer. Even though the game has an excellent pity system, I couldn’t make any more progress unless I could get enough copies of the same highest-rated characters so that all my other characters scale up to them. At that point, either I had to get super lucky with my pulls, or just spend lots of money on pulls, so I did neither and quit playing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You, of course, need content to push accounts and be the late game uber challenges for people to enjoy, but if someone is getting locked out in the middle of your story content because of money and luck, they’re never going to reach those challenges. What I’m finding with a game like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Arknights</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is that I’m starting to run out of gas with its late-game challenges. Yes, I have a lot of great characters, but it will take grinding to level them all up, and even then, it’s going to add more time to a game where my time is already limited with everything else I have to do.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">No matter how great a game is, I don’t think I’m the consumer who could ever play a “main game” live service title — or one that demands your time day-after-day in order to progress. If I must dedicate more than 10 minutes daily to a mobile game outside of new content, I’m going to stop playing. I’m also in favor of removing the requirement for daily play resource collecting as forced play is not ethical design.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Changing the&nbsp;Game?"><span>Changing the&nbsp;Game?</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The original idea for live service games was this notion that the game continues to grow beyond the initial retail purchase or release — that the game should be fundamentally a different experience year two, three, five, etc. What we’ve found however is that even in the most successful and biggest live service games, that doesn’t happen. You can argue with me that games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Destiny 2, Fortnite, Arknights, Genshin Impact</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, or any other successful multi-year supported game has grown and changed, but has it?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What I’ve seen from all the live service games I’ve studied is that no matter how much people want to call them “forever games”, no matter how much content and banners and battle passes and FOMO, these games in truth </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>never change</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and the reason why is quite simple, everything is locked to the monetization model. Instead of the gameplay driving the monetization, the monetization drives the gameplay. So what ends up happening is that the gameplay loop in year 1, is the same in years 3,5,7, whatever. You can’t introduce content on par with an expansion or a sequel in a live service game, because everything is tied to the monetization. One exception is the sheer amount of new modes and systems introduced in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Warframe</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and how the developers have found a lot of mileage out of their same gameplay loop.</span></p><p>Dragon Ball Legends is one of the few mobile games to have added in new rarity tiers, and new drop rates to with it, with the same gameplay (source: DB Legends) </p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you introduce a new game mode, a new enemy type, a new weapon, hero, class, etc. that inherently breaks or doesn’t use the content that’s already in the game, consumers will riot, because you are creating content that all the monetization that has led up to your game doesn’t support. Imagine telling someone who has spent $1,000+ on a single game that the next content update is going to introduce something that everything they’ve spent money on doesn’t apply to it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Instead, new content adds breadth, not depth to a game. Yes, the levels may be more advanced, or the enemies stronger or different to fight, or that new six-star has a crazy new power to them, but it doesn’t change or grow the initial gameplay loop that was set year 1, day 1, minute 1 of that game being launched. This is the point when someone is going to write “who cares?” If the gameplay on day 1 was fantastic, then having 5 years of that content would be great, right? Not growing your game or taking years to make simple additions leaves these titles in a strange position. They may have huge growth and get massive recognition, but then they all start to stagnate — new players aren’t joining because they find the idea of starting fresh in a game with years of support overwhelming. And people who aren’t whales will start to get tired and stop playing and paying eventually.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At some point, every single live service game hits its peak and plateaus — no matter what new content they put out, what mega-amazing collab they have coming, people are not joining or coming back. For the big-name games, they still are a license to print money…just less money than they were before.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Where Do These Games End&nbsp;Up?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There is one other point I want to bring up that frustrates me to no end — end of service for mobile games. The beauty of digital games is the very fact that they can be downloaded and played for a long time, but the mobile market is woefully behind in this respect. While you may love or hate them, there are thousands of mobile games released over the 2010’s that are gone — they went end of service, the server is shut off, and those games and all the time, money, energy, and fans, just disappear.</span></p><p>Dragon Ball Legends is one of the few mobile games to have added in new rarity tiers, and new drop rates to with it, with the same gameplay (source: DB Legends) </p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Some of you reading this are thinking “who cares”, but the point of game preservation is to preserve every game — the ones you love and the ones you hate. I can’t stand to think about the work of a studio over months and years of development just going up in smoke never to be seen ever again. Whether you think these games are simple or advanced, they were still developed and released and deserve to be remembered.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There is some fantastic UI/UX work in some of the better/unique mobile games, and it again, breaks the trope that these games are just simple little time wasters.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Next&nbsp;Wave?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When I wrote my book on F2P design a few years ago, I was saying how more mobile and AAA developers would look to the likes of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Genshin Impact</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> as the inspiration for their games going forward. I didn’t think someone would just quite literally make a game just like it with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wuthering Waves</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. We haven’t seen anything new in terms of mobile design and monetization since: things have gotten flashier, but will </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Genshin</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> be considered the peak of mobile design? And to that point — will there be laws here in the US put in place to stop or curtail unethical monetization?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For more on F2P/mobile design, be sure to pick up </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.routledge.com/Game-Design-Deep-Dive-Free-to-Play/Bycer/p/book/9781032207612">Game Design Deep Dive: F2P</a></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>If you would like to support what I do and let me do more daily streaming, be sure to check out my </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="http://patreon.com/gwbycer">Patreon</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ys-x-nordics-preview/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Falcom's Ys series may not be as popular as other JRPG series like Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest, but the action RPG franchise developed by Falcom, alongside the other series by the Japanese studio, the Trails series, started seeing some well-deserved recognition in the West in the past few years. It has been almost 12 months since the release of the latest entry in the series, Ys X: Nordics, in Japan, and in a few months, fans of Adol Christin in the West will finally be able to experience how the tenth main entry in the series is the first one in a long time that attempts to shake the basic gameplay formula introduced in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ys-seven-pc-start-new-era/">Ys SEVEN</a> back in 2009.</p>
<p>Ys X: Nordics brings players back in time when Adol was only 17 years old, fresh out of his adventure in the ancient Kingdom of Ys, which took place in the second entry in the series. Finding themselves in the Obelia Gulf, the red-haired adventurer and his friend Dogi end up in the Obelia Gulf, an area inspired by Normandy in Europe known for its multiple islands and the powerful pirate group, the Balta Seaforce, that control them. At some point, Adol and the daughter of Grimson, the leader of the pirates, are bound together by a power called mana, forcing them to face the threat of the Griegr together and find a way to remove their bonds.</p>
<p>During a press presentation hosted by NIS America last week, I was only able to experience some very short glimpses of the story, so how everything will play out remains to be seen. From what I experienced, the story and character development seem to be in line with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ys-viii-lacrimosa-dana-wonderful-adventure/">Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ys-ix-monstrum-nox-the-night-is-dark-and-full-of-terrors/">Ys IX: Monstrum Nox</a> approach, striking a middle ground between the classic games and the Trails series, which has had its influence on the Ys series, for a while.</p>
<p>What I was able to see way more of was the gameplay, which really sets Ys X: Nordics apart from the most recent entries in the series. Unlike every Ys game since the aforementioned Ys SEVEN, the tenth entry in the series does away with the party system completely, replaced by the Cross Action Gameplay system. In the game, players will be able to control either Adol or Karja and swap between them at any time. The two characters are equipped with different weapons and learn different skills, so either of them can be more effective depending on the player's preference and enemy attributes. Besides controlling the two characters separately, it is also possible to control both of them at the same time in Duo Mode, which makes them slower but more powerful and capable of unleashing devastating Duo Skills. Using Duo Mode is preferred against more powerful enemies, some of them coming with a shield that protects them from taking damage until destroyed. In Duo Mode, it is also possible to block attacks to increase the Revenge value, which increases damage dealt, creating an alternation between offense and defense that seems to work rather well. Despite these changes, however, the core combat gameplay remains similar to that of the previous entries in the series, with engaging, fast-paced action and some combo options granted by the Cross Action gameplay and the different skills that have different properties such as launching, pushing back, and knocking down.</p>

<p>The magical bond that ties Adol and Karja in Ys X: Nordics also gives them access to Mana Actions, special traversal abilities that should make exploration more engaging. Sadly, I didn't see much of them during the presentation, so it remains to be seen how they will improve exploration. The character progression system, the Release Lines, is also tied to the magical bond between the two characters, allowing them to learn new abilities and increase their stats by placing Mana Seeds in the nodes in the Release Line, granting players quite a few customization options.</p>
<p>Another big part of the Ys X: Nordics experience is naval battles. Controlling the Sandras ship, players will be able to explore Obelia Gulf's different regions using information gathered in town or through the sea chart, fight enemy ships, discover secret islands and so on. Naval battles, some of them required to progress the story, look like an evolution of the Beast Raids mechanics seen in Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana and the Grimwald Nox battles in Ys IX: Monstrum Nox, as Adol and his companions will have to defeat multiple waves of enemies while completing other objectives, such as taking down some objects that power a barrier. At the beginning of the adventure, the number of naval combat options is rather limited, but it will expand as the crew grows larger. A cooking system promises to make naval combat deeper, as different meals grant different bonuses, which can make it easier to achieve S rank and obtain all sorts of nice rewards.</p>
<p>Having been a fan of the Ys series since the Western release of Ys VI: Ark of Napishtim, I was already pretty excited for Ys X: Nordics' release, but after seeing more of it in action, I can't wait to travel to the Obelia Gulf with Adol and Karja. While it is hard to say if the naval gameplay will slow down the campaign's pace too much and if the story will deliver, what I have seen of the Cross Action gameplay feels like what the series needed to avoid getting stale with yet another iteration of the party system.</p>
<p>Ys X: Nordics launches on <a href="https://wccftech.com/ys-x-nordics-is-out-october-25-in-western-countries/">October 25th</a> on PC via Steam, Epic Games Store, GOG, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

<p>Nvidia’s latest Driver includes a Game Ready profile for Final Fantasy 16; however, it has yet to be mentioned in the official release notes. Many have theorised that this profile could hint at a potential PC release for Final Fantasy 16.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nvidia released their GeForce Game Ready Driver for Hunt: Showdown 1896 yesterday, and an eagle-eyed user on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/1elhiea/comment/lgrn7t7/?context=3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/hidden-final-fantasy-16-profile-in-latest-nvidia-driver-has-fans-hyping-themselves-up-for-a-surprise-gamescom-pc-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>) spotted a Game Ready profile for FF 16 in the update files. The Redditor mentioned that the Driver included a profile for Final Fantasy 16 and Once Human; they were not mentioned in the official release notes.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Nvidia’s latest Game Ready Driver for Hunt: Showdown 1896 allows GeForce RTX gamers to activate Nvidia DLSS Super Resolution. DLSS Super Resolution technology boosts performance through AI and provides higher-resolution frames from a lower-resolution output.&nbsp;The Game Ready profile has arrived just in time for Hunt: Showdown 1896’s massive <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpIimnVGUbw&amp;t=23s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">August update</a>. Hopefully, an official announcement for Final Fantasy 16 will come soon.</p>



<p>Additionally, Nvidia has added one-click optimal settings for five more games. Players can now configure game options for their system’s hardware for games like Chained Together, Dungeonborne, Once Human, Stormgate and The First Descendant.&nbsp;</p>

Also, FF14’s director has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-14-director-denies-ff9-remake-involvement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">denied involvement</a> in remaking FF9.

This nonlinear mode unleashes the full potential of the procedural generation system, and the game world is generated with a wide variety of random seeds, meaning each playthrough can vary significantly in layout and difficulty.

Though only discoverable in Sandbox Mode, players can bring new objects into Campaign Mode as long as their Dwarf is equipped with them when transferring over.</li><li><strong>New Building Parts and Decorations</strong> – Players can spruce up their bases with over 100 new building objects, including new cosmetic decorations such as light fixtures, rugs, banners, home furnishings, tables, and chairs.</li><li><strong>Building Improvements</strong> – Restoring Moria is now easier than ever with the changes made to the stability system as well as improved object snapping.

                <p>From the very start of my time with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-547394">Space Marine 2</a>, I was taken aback by the sheer scale, atmosphere, and attention to detail. The pride and care emanating from this snippet of the grimdark world that Saber Interactive has built was palpable, and something I believe will resonate with both newcomers to the franchise and longtime fans of Warhammer 40K.</p><p dir="ltr">During my hands-on preview of Space Marine 2, I was given access to a couple of non-campaign PvE missions, as well as a main mission from around the halfway point of the story. The story mission opened with Titus and his squad exiting their ship onto a landing pad with an Imperial Guard staging area just beyond. Through this section, I saw an exciting glimpse of life in the war-torn Imperium: Militarum units bowing and kneeling at the sight of Space Marines, a commander delivering a rousing speech from atop an enormous Baneblade tank, a Commissar delivering punishment to soldiers found guilty of cowardice, troops burning mounds of Tyranid corpses with flamers, and so much more. This small section really drove home how much effort has gone into the game's world-building, and immediately made me think that Space Marine 2 could very well be the most authentic Warhammer 40K game we've ever seen (and since I know so many have been curious, it's an experience you can indeed play through with or without your helmet).</p>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">In <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-goes-even-bigger-and-bloodier/1100-6517050/">my last preview</a>, I said that Space Marine 2 really makes you <em>feel</em> like a Space Marine, and it's a sentiment that has only been further reinforced. But so far, this is also the first game that really makes you feel like you're in Warhammer 40K. A large part of this is thanks to the game's combat. It definitely demands more of you than 2011's Space Marine, but it also retains the same feeling of brutal, grimdark action that made the original great. This makes for more of a "thinking marine's" hack-and-slash game, which works incredibly well.</p><p dir="ltr">However--and it may have been because the mission I played was set at the midpoint of the campaign--I did initially feel overwhelmed by the variety of inputs, enemies, counters, abilities, and resources that made up my first savage melee. But after learning the language of Space Marine 2's combat, the blend of ranged firepower and close-quarters battle quickly became much more fluid and so satisfyingly brutal. Wide swings of a chainsword can cleave through compacted hordes of surrounding Tyranids, while parries, dodges, counters, and "gun strikes" (counters that deliver a devastating pistol shot at close range) all add complexity and are vital if you want to emerge from each bloody maelstrom unscathed.</p><p dir="ltr">Parryable attacks will flash with a blue circle, and nailing one of these can immediately kill a smaller enemy, or interrupt a larger foe's combo and leave them open for attack. Unblockable attacks are denoted by a red circle and must be dodged with a quick backstep or full-on combat roll. Perfectly timed dodges or parries can also open up enemies to a gun strike.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4343351-ss_f3cb28be981ddf20fccd4e8d827d0e340cf12b75.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4343351" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4343351-ss_f3cb28be981ddf20fccd4e8d827d0e340cf12b75.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4343351"></a><figcaption>Space Marine 2 regularly sees you jump into the hectic fray.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4343351-ss_f3cb28be981ddf20fccd4e8d827d0e340cf12b75.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Lighter enemy attacks won't give you the same warning, but after an hour or so of battle, I found myself able to instinctively react to these moves, too. It was at this point when Space Marine 2's flow of combat began to almost remind me of Sekiro, albeit with a chainsword-swinging superhuman from the far future rather than a katana-wielding shinobi.</p><p dir="ltr">Chaining together attacks, parries, and dodges will quickly leave enemies exposed and vulnerable to executions, killing blows that the Space Marine 2 team has obviously delighted in crafting. Each execution seemed more visceral and satisfying than the last, from tearing limbs off of Tyranid Warriors to ripping apart the sealed power armor of the traitorous Thousand Sons.</p><p dir="ltr">Executions are also vital to the flow of combat, as each one will refill a portion of your armor. Previously in the original Space Marine, executions would heal you, but this time health is returned through the use of consumable stims that must be found throughout the level, forcing you to be more mindful of your resources even as you charge into the fray.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4343352-ss_4751069d565b92fadeb6bfd507cef64cf6c70cd1.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4343352" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4343352-ss_4751069d565b92fadeb6bfd507cef64cf6c70cd1.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4343352"></a><figcaption>You'll have to be strategic to overcome larger hordes.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4343352-ss_4751069d565b92fadeb6bfd507cef64cf6c70cd1.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There is also much more strategy to be found in Space Marine 2's combat. A horde of Tyranids can feature a wide variety of enemy types, presenting different challenges and opportunities during each encounter. Do you strike at the smaller mobs to thin the horde and give you more room to maneuver, for example, or do you weather their blows and focus on the larger Warrior enemies with the goal of cutting their synaptic link, taking down surrounding lesser Tyranids? There may also be ranged enemy types to consider, firing strangling thorns that can slow movement or apply poison, or even hovering Zoanthropes buffing nearby creatures with a psychic link, requiring you to break from the immediate close-quarters battle to close the distance or engage these xenos with ranged firepower.</p><p dir="ltr">While I only saw a portion of the combat that Space Marine 2 has to offer, the brutal ballet of battle only grew more varied and more satisfying across the demo. As I made my way deeper into the mission, more tools and weaponry became available, such as the jump pack, which allowed me to fire hails of bolts from up on high and dive back into combat with a devastating strike from above.</p><p dir="ltr">During last year's Space Marine 2 preview, there were only Tyranids to fight. This time around though, Chaos has reared its ugly head and I was able to see the Thousand Sons Chaos Space Marines in action, leading to a lot of intense scenarios. One moment saw me enter a giant plaza, where Thousand Sons, and their summoned demons and cultists, were engaged with the Termigaunts, Hormagaunts, and warriors of the Tyranids--I believe an Astartes would call that a "Target Rich Environment."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4343353-ss_20a753725a34225553c5873fbc079626451ebcf9.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4343353" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4343353-ss_20a753725a34225553c5873fbc079626451ebcf9.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4343353"></a><figcaption>You can play solo or in 3-player co-op.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4343353-ss_20a753725a34225553c5873fbc079626451ebcf9.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Following that carnage, the campaign portion of my preview culminated in a boss fight with a Thousand Sons Sorcerer, which not only provided a completely different gameplay experience but was also one heck of a visual spectacle. As he cast spells and traversed across the arena, I noticed horrific eyes emerging from the walls and ceiling of the room. Shortly after, the ground below him turned to liquid that ripped toward me and my squad--a perfect visual realization of warp magick.</p><p dir="ltr">The battle was completely different from the rest of the demo I played, but these visual details--as well as the attacks and the overall design of my final foe--were another element that really drove home Space Marine 2's attention to detail and its drive to bring so many of the elements of Warhammer 40K to life.</p><p dir="ltr">Finally, as a massive Warhammer fan, I couldn't help but nerd out and get excited about the visuals on display in Space Marine 2. Not only are there tons of little details in the characters, armor, weapons, NPCs, and environments for Warhammer fans to pick apart, but everything looks bloody fantastic, too. From the explosions of your bolt rounds and the streaks of gore as you cleave an enemy in two, to the massive skies filled with flying enemies and dank, swampy jungle environments, Space Marine 2 is shaping up to be a feast for the eyes--albeit a brutal one. It combines all of these elements to create a cohesive and authentic-feeling grimdark world.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4343354-ss_d0bc9105e638b0f8a5364c4a6c70c6ccaf9268bb.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4343354" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4343354-ss_d0bc9105e638b0f8a5364c4a6c70c6ccaf9268bb.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4343354"></a><figcaption>The world design in Space Marine 2 is superb.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4343354-ss_d0bc9105e638b0f8a5364c4a6c70c6ccaf9268bb.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">After the campaign, I also got to experience a couple of Space Marine 2's co-op missions. The Operations mode takes place alongside the main story of Space Marine 2 but sees you play as your own customizable Astartes in a squad of three.</p><p dir="ltr">One of the missions, aptly named "Decapitation," saw my squad springing a trap on a Tyranid Hive Tyrant, knowing that doing so would disable the Tyranid swarm that Lieutenant Titus was fighting in the same campaign mission I just completed. These replayable PvE missions all seem to be tightly connected to the main story, making them feel narratively impactful. The chatter between squads and commanders is mirrored in each mission, so you feel like you're part of the bigger picture even when replaying them as different classes or taking them on with more of a casual approach as you try out new weapons or difficulties.</p><p dir="ltr">From what I have played, the main objectives of these missions remain largely the same throughout each playthrough, and each will generally take you about 30 minutes on the standard difficulty. Variety mostly comes from Space Marine 2's AI director changing up the enemies as it responds to your class and playstyle, or even springing surprise ambushes.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4343355-ss_66a8bc13bf868d0e2a76e4d797e6408c271065d7.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4343355" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4343355-ss_66a8bc13bf868d0e2a76e4d797e6408c271065d7.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4343355"></a><figcaption>It's a shame the in-game currency tied to cosmetics is also used for class perks, forcing you to choose.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4343355-ss_66a8bc13bf868d0e2a76e4d797e6408c271065d7.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Speaking of surprises, I was surprised by how varied the class system is--each class has access to a different arsenal of weapons, perks, and abilities, letting each fill their own niche on the battlefield. The Tactical Marine is your bread-and-butter Astartes and has access to the most ranged weapons, as well as a chainsword and an auspex-scan ability that both reveals enemies and makes them more vulnerable to damage. The Assault class lacks any ranged weaponry beyond a pistol but has access to the most powerful melee weapons, as well as a jump pack that allows them to take to the skies and assault groups of enemies or priority targets from above. The Vanguard, meanwhile, is lightly armored and more suited for close-quarters combat, focusing on single targets. With access to bolt carbines, a Melta Rifle (which mostly functions like a superheated shotgun), and a grapnel launcher ability that allows them to propel themselves toward foes with a diving kick to engage with their giant dueling knives, this class is great for folks looking to get up close and personal with enemies.</p><p dir="ltr">Bulwarks are the tank class and forgo a main ranged weapon in favor of a giant shield that they wield alongside pistols and powerful melee weapons. Their special ability is to deploy a chapter banner, restoring armor to all squad members nearby; this makes them perfect at clearing hordes, staying in the thick of the fight, and soaking up enemy damage. Snipers are, as you may have guessed, equipped with a selection of long-range weapons such as the Bolt Sniper and the Las Fusil. They're great at starting off fights with a couple of long-ranged headshots, and their camo cloak ability allows them to turn invisible for a period of time--useful for breaking contact, flanking, and picking off pesky ranged enemies. Lastly, the Heavy class wields the big guns like the Heavy Bolter, Heavy Plasma Incinerator, or Multi Melta. This class' weapons are so heavy to lug around that they don't get access to a melee weapon, instead having to swing their guns into the jaws of foes or deliver brutal kicks to an enemy's body. They are the best at clearing hordes from range and delivering heavy firepower, with their iron halo ability creating a barrier that can block incoming ranged damage.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4343356-ss_ee88e4cc463b7b25b0ec03930a9e58e5fba2afdf.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4343356" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4343356-ss_ee88e4cc463b7b25b0ec03930a9e58e5fba2afdf.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4343356"></a><figcaption>It's tough but honest work.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4343356-ss_ee88e4cc463b7b25b0ec03930a9e58e5fba2afdf.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">All of these classes are cosmetically customizable, although, from my time with the game, I feel as though it takes a little too long to earn some of the basic customization options. For example, if you want to buy the Caliban Green color to swap your chapter to Dark Angels as I did, you first have to use your well-earned credits to buy the chapter icon, and only then can you obtain the color. However, the credits you use for hot new paint jobs are <em>also</em> required for purchasing class and weapon perks as you work to progress through their respective trees, making this currency even more precious. As this was still a preview build, the price numbers may be tweaked ahead of launch, and there may be other methods to earn said credits in the final release. However, as is, it looks like there may be a lot of required grinding to craft your Astartes to your taste.</p><p dir="ltr">Overall, Space Marine 2 is shaping up to be a more than worthy successor to the 2011 fan favorite. Everything that made the original Space Marine great is still there but as a much more considered and evolved version of itself, all of which comes together to make Space Marine 2 feel like both a familiar old friend and an exciting new experience.</p><p>Space Marine 2's release date of September 9 is now just a few weeks away, and while there are a few elements that we've yet to see, such as the PvP mode Eternal War, there are already a lot of reasons Warhammer fans to be excited about Space Marine 2. As someone who has been a huge 40K fan for over half his life, I have never been more excited about a Warhammer video game.</p>

                <p>A Quiet Place has found remarkable success in theaters since the original launched in 2018, with the trio of horror films earning over $850 million at the box office. A prequel titled Day One released in June, but the franchise isn't done yet in 2024. Three years after Saber Interactive announced a video game adaptation, the end of the road is in sight. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DBWJQ1QV?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead</a> releases on <strong>October 17 </strong><span>for </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DBWJQ1QV?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5</a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DBWQQP5Q?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Series X</a><span>, and </span><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1850010161148280089%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fa-quiet-place-the-road-ahead-preorders-are-live-for-ps5-and-xbox-series-x%2F1100-6525556%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC</a><span>.

                <p>The Callisto Protocol director Glen Schofield claimed that the game was forced to ship early due to the Striking Distance Studios' parent company, Krafton, and its insistance. As a result, development was impacted and content was cut in order to meet deadlines.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IIVia5aiUQ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dan Allen Gaming</a>, Schofield said that Krafton originally let Striking Distance Studios "put whatever they wanted" into The Callisto Protocol and promised more time to work on it. During the 2021 holiday period, Schofield formulated more ideas for the game, but afterward, Krafton suddenly wanted it to ship by December.</p>

<p>Schofield said that he wanted three and a half more months to work on the game, which would have put its release date into 2023. Ironically, the December 2022 deadline seemingly ended up costing Krafton more resources.</p><p>“It’s not like it costs you less money because you’re getting it out three months sooner, because if I’d just kept it on the way it was going, I wouldn’t have to add anybody," Schofield explained. "But if you want it done, that means I’ve got to accelerate everything by three and a half months, which means I need to jam people on here.”</p><p>Due to the accelerated timeline, Schofield said four bosses and two enemy types were left on the cutting-room floor. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dead-space-co-creator-glen-schofield-leaves-callisto-protocol-studio/1100-6517875/" data-ref-id="1100-6517875">Schofield left Striking Distance</a> in 2023, but he provided his vision for what the potential sequel could've been. It would've included a brand-new protagonist at the start of the game, who then would've been killed off halfway through. Then the first game's protagonist, Jacob, would make a surprise comeback for the rest of the game.</p><p>In August 2023, Striking Distance Studios <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-callisto-protocol-dev-striking-distance-studios-lays-off-more-than-30-staff/1100-6516498/" data-ref-id="1100-6516498">laid off more than 30 developers </a>shortly after releasing The Callisto Protocol's final story DLC in June. In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-callisto-protocol-review-i-dont-belong-here/1900-6418007/" data-ref-id="1900-6418007">The Callisto Protocol review</a>, we said, "Though it starts off on a strong note, The Callisto Protocol's focus on action-heavy spectacles fails to adequately explore its horror and overcrowds its weak combat mechanics."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/arena-breakout-infinite-early-access-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Morefun Studios has announced the Early Access release date for extraction shooter&nbsp;<em>Arena Breakout: Infinite</em>, and you'll be able to check it out for free next week.</p>
<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Arena Breakout: Infinite&nbsp;</em>launches into Early Access on August 12th at 7pm Pacific (that's 10pm Eastern). Naturally, this means that if you're in the UK or further east, you'll have to wait until the following day to play the game.</p>
<p>Since the closed beta period for the game, Morefun has focused on adding features like a new Armory map, new weapons, and new gameplay features like a killcam and a spectate mode, among other things.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/arena-breakout-infinite-early-access-release-date-laundromat.jpg?itok=OunzlFET 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/arena-breakout-infinite-early-access-release-date-laundromat.jpg?itok=LdivUUQW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Arena Breakout: Infinite&nbsp;</em>is almost upon us.</figcaption></figure><p>Additionally, if you're still running a relatively old gaming PC, you'll be pleased to know the minimum required hardware has been lowered to an Nvidia GTX 960, so you may well be able to play now where you couldn't before.</p>
<p>During the Early Access phase, Morefun has pledged to optimize the game, of course, as well as adding new features, fine-tuning mechanics, and "balanc[ing] monetization systems". This, the studio hopes, will lead to "the most compelling extraction shooter experience on PC".</p>
<p>If&nbsp;<em>Arena Breakout: Infinite&nbsp;</em>is hoping to take that title, it'll have some stiff competition. There's&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov</em>, of course, which is arguably still the reigning champion despite its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/escape-from-tarkov-pve-eod-free">recent stumbles</a>. The game will also have to field challenges from the likes of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gray-zone-warfare-tarkov-players">Gray Zone Warfare</a>&nbsp;</em>and more fantasy-oriented competitors like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dungeonborne-release-date"><em>Dungeonborne</em></a>, among others.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gray-zone-warfare-extraction-shooter.jpg?itok=XRh5zfz9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gray-zone-warfare-extraction-shooter.jpg?itok=6N-GbrA2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Arena Breakout: Infinite&nbsp;</em>will have some stiff competition from the likes of&nbsp;<em>Gray Zone Warfare</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're wondering what the deal is with <i>Arena Breakout: Infinite</i>, it's a tactical shooter that places its emphasis on realistic engagements and weapon customization.</p>
<p>You'll be able to choose from over 500 gun parts to create your ideal weapon, and since "every bullet counts" in the world of&nbsp;<em>Arena Breakout: Infinite</em>, you'll have to make sure your customization is on point.</p>
<p><em>Arena Breakout: Infinite&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2073620/Arena_Breakout_Infinite/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> on August 12th, and it's a free-to-play game to boot.</p>

			<p>The next-generation Xbox console has already been featured prominently in several rumors. Over the past year, two leakers have <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-xbox-console-might-launch-in-2026-according-to-new-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested</a> that Microsoft's upcoming console would launch in late 2026, getting ahead of Sony's PlayStation 6 in a repeat of the strategy that turned out to be successful for the Xbox 360.</p>
<p>Microsoft is also reportedly busy with the development of an Xbox handheld. Several prototypes are believed to be in the works, although their release is not imminent. That led some Xbox fans to speculate the next console might be a hybrid, like Nintendo Switch (and likely Switch 2, too).</p>
<p>However, in the latest episode of the Xbox Two <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd0mckjjZyk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">podcast</a>, Windows Central's Jez Corden said that won't be the case. There will be a proper home console instead, with the handheld as an add-on. Interestingly, Corden also predicted that Microsoft would finally remove paywalled multiplayer, but only for the next Xbox, as an additional incentive to upgrade from the Series S|X.</p>
<p><em>I'll tell you now: there's going to be a separate handheld and there's going to be an Xbox Series X successor. It's going to be two different things. They're not just going to try and go all in on handheld only; they're going to do a more traditional console for the Series X people and then a handheld. </em><em>[...] I'm predicting a Series X successor, a handheld, and the end of the paywall for premium multiplayer games. That's my prediction.</em></p>
<p>That's certainly great news, as a hybrid console would inevitably have to suffer in performance when compared against a full-fledged home console. Besides, Xbox president Sarah Bond made the bold <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-generation-largest-technical-leap-ever-seen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claim</a> that the next Xbox will offer the greatest leap ever from generation to generation. One way to do that despite the shrinking performance gains offered by new chipsets is adding an <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-xbox-will-use-ai-accelerator-to-handle-ai-tasks-jez-corden-claims-to-have-heard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NPU</a>, or neural processing unit, to handle advanced AI tasks.</p>
<p>We still have a lot to wait until we hear any official information about the next console from Microsoft, but stay tuned to keep informed on all the latest rumors and leaks.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-5-consoles-hit-61-million-units-sold-overall-hardware-sales-fall/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-5-consoles-hit-61-million-units-sold-overall-hardware-sales-fall/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>According to the supplemental information in Sony’s latest <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/archive.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earnings releases</a>, PlayStation 5 sold another 2.4 million units as of Q1 for the fiscal year 2024.</p>



<p>In total, this means that the PlayStation 5 crossed 61 million units sold. However, the Game and Network Services Segment data shows a hardware decline. It states there was a year-on-year “decrease in sales of hardware due to a decrease in unit sales.”</p>



<p>Sony’s PlayStation 5 sold 4.5 million units in Q4 of fiscal year 2023, marking a noticeable drop in console sales.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Still, Sony also reported an “increase in sales of first-party game software titles.” It also saw an increase in sales “from network services, mainly PlayStation Plus.”</p>



<p>In fact, Sony forecasts more increases, including 3% upward revisions for both sales and operating income. Sony estimates this would be related to “impact of foreign exchange rates” and network services improvements, “mainly PlayStation Plus.” </p>



<p>However, Sony didn’t offer a concrete number on its subscriber data. Last week, PlayStation revealed its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-plus-has-revealed-the-free-monthly-games-for-august/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">monthly games lineup</a> for PS Plus in August 2024, including hit titles like Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga.</p>



<p>Sony reportedly plans to make <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-making-cuts-to-playstation-vr-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cuts to VR development</a>, following its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-pauses-psvr2-production-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pause on PS VR2 production</a> in March 2024 due to wavering sales. But PlayStation fans can still look forward to the PS VR2 PC adapter, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-vr2-pc-adapter-is-coming-august-7-2024/">which releas</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-vr2-pc-adapter-is-coming-august-7-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">e</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-vr2-pc-adapter-is-coming-august-7-2024/">s today</a>.</p>

                <p>As part of Disney's latest earnings briefing, the company discussed some of its plans for gaming. The company's <a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/app/uploads/2024/08/q3-fy24-executive-commentary.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">executive summary</a> touches on Disney's deal with Epic Games to create content for Fortnite, with Disney saying the company hopes to deliver "transformational" new games.</p><p>"We are reaching consumers in innovative new ways--such as working with Epic Games to bring together Disney’s beloved brands and franchises with the hugely popular Fortnite in a transformational new games and entertainment universe," the company said.</p><p>Disney went on to claim that its business for licensed video games is the "largest in the world." Its deal with Epic Games is another example of this, it said. As for why Disney is investing so much into video games, the company said it's trying to capitalize on a "transformative industry-wide shift toward converged gaming ecosystems."</p><p>In February, Disney invested a <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/disney-and-epic-games-to-create-expansive-and-open-games-and-entertainment-universe-connected-to-fortnite" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">further $1.5 billion into Epic Games</a> to create a "new persistent universe" for Disney fans to "play, watch, shop, and engage with" characters and content from its Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, and Avatar brands, among others. Disney and Epic also touted the ability for fans to "create their own stories and experiences" and share content with each other as part of this.</p><p>Disney and Epic have yet to officially unveil any specific projects in Fortnite tied to Disney, but many are hoping to see some kind of "virtual Disney World." Fortnite, of course, is no longer just one game--instead, it's more akin to a platform these days. In addition to the main battle royale game, Fortnite hosts games like Rocket Racing, Fortnite Festival, and Lego Fortnite, along with countless other user-created games and experiences on the platform. Whatever Epic and Disney might be cooking up could be just the latest game to exist on the Fortnite platform.</p><p>Disney will reveal what's next for the company across the board at D23 this coming weekend in Anaheim, and while we don't know for sure if Disney will discuss its Fortnite plans, it's certainly possible.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf2bRcSIUsE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Yf2bRcSIUsE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In terms of Disney's commentary around being the "largest" player in gaming for licensed games, that's likely a reference to the numerous deals Disney has made with outside studios to create content. Whereas Disney used to develop games in-house via its own Disney Interactive Studios, the company subsequently shut this down and instead works with outside teams as part of licensing arrangements.</p><p>And Disney has been <em>busy </em>in this regard. There are numerous licensed Disney games in the works from outside teams currently, including Indiana Jones and the Great Circle from Microsoft, Star Wars Outlaws from Ubisoft, Star Wars Hunters from Zynga, Epic Mickey Rebrushed from Purple Lamp, and Disney Pixel RPG from GungHo Online, just to name a few.</p>

			<p>A new Cyberpunk 2077 mod shared online a few days back further improves the game's visuals with ray tracing and path tracing with a simple yet very effective tweak.</p>
<p>The Disable Fake Lights mod, which can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/16060">Nexus Mods</a>, does exactly what its name suggests. It disables all fake lights in the game, such as light emitted from advertising billboards, which are not required with ray tracing and path tracing, and lights attached to things like doors and windows, which break the visuals with path tracing. Without these fake lights, not only does the game look better with ray tracing and path tracing, but it is also more realistic, as seen in a <a href="https://imgsli.com/MjgzODQ3">set</a> of <a href="https://imgsli.com/MjgzODQ5">four</a> <a href="https://imgsli.com/MjgzODUy">comparison</a> <a href="https://imgsli.com/MjgzODY0">screenshots.</a></p>
<p>It's great to see how modders are continuing to improve Cyberpunk 2077, as developer CD Projekt Red, after a slew of excellent updates that massively improved the game in pretty much every way, has moved onto the development of its sequel. In its current state, the game is among the best open-world RPGs ever released, made even better by the excellent Phantom Liberty expansion, which adds, among other things, a brand new ending for the main story.
