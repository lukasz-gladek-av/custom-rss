            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="c8acb7e9785f2"><a title="Banjo-Tooie" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c8acb7e9785f2/banjo-tooie.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>One of the reasons I adore N64-gen Rare so much is because they loved testing the boundaries. What could they get away with in a cheeky, charming 3D platformer? <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/banjo-kazooie">Banjo-Kazooie</a> was already dipping its toe in the water in a few subtle (and less-subtle) ways. “How's your nuts, bark breath?” is funny, but perhaps funnier with that adult context. And the 1998 platformer was more than ready to get a little bit scary – did anyone else freak out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-which-scary-video-game-moments-gave-you-nightmares-as-a-kid">the first time they saw Clanker</a>? No?</p>
<p>But <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/banjo-tooie">Banjo-Tooie</a> pushes things to a whole new level. It rips the band-aid off and tosses it off of a steep cliff into the volcano of Hailfire Peaks, almost with complete disregard for what came before it. Rare is unafraid to tell you that this is a <em>very</em> different game tonally from the first. In fact, growing up, it was one of the scariest games I’d played. I still feel that way 25 years later. And I love it, warts and all, for that reason.</p>
<p>I should’ve known immediately something was different. While Banjo-Kazooie got a chirpy, cheerful intro song with the cast all playing the main theme together, Tooie just gets a slower, lower-pitch version playing as a camera pans over the abandoned Gruntilda’s Lair. Rare could’ve brought Grunty back as the green same, except she’s a walking skeleton.</p>
<figure data-uuid="14561ec8a88a2"><a title="Banjo-Tooie" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/14561ec8a88a2/banjo-tooie.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Oh, and just 20 minutes into the game, Grunty has murdered Bottles the mole by burning him to a crisp <em>and</em> turned King Jingaling into a zombie, who groans and attacks Banjo on sight. I stupidly left Banjo waiting inside the zombified throne room one time and remember hearing the king’s moaning as it pecked Banjo and Kazooie to death. I was but a simple eight-year-old, I didn’t expect previously friendly NPCs to be hostile, even if they were a walking corpse!</p>
<p>So much about Banjo-Tooie is bleak and disturbing, but the intro and the first few sections of the Isle O’ Hags really set the tone; the abandoned Jinjo Village where the HAG-1 tracks has ploughed right through one of the houses, is harrowing the first time you walk through it, made worse by the cheerful music. Walking into Bottles’ house and <em>hiding</em> the fact the patriarch of the family has passed away made me feel sick.</p>
<figure data-uuid="8ee582e6c9015"><a title="Banjo-Tooie" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8ee582e6c9015/banjo-tooie.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Things don’t get any better when you start to explore any of the worlds, either. Mayahem Temple might be one of the gentler worlds on the nightmare fuel front, but something about Ssslumber the Snake always made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. Maybe it’s because I had to do that darn sneaking section at least a dozen times, but those teeth are a little too big for my liking. And the Snapdragons that chomp at you while you’re gripping onto a ledge? No thank you.</p>
<p>Glitter Gulch Mine is where things start to ramp up again. If the toxic gas room where Banjo and Kazooie can choke to death isn’t enough (seriously, what is <em>up</em> with N64 drowning animations?), then how about the pitch-black generator room or the Power Hut where one wrong step means a fall to your death?</p>

<p>The level variety is much darker than it ever was in the original; sunny beaches are now replaced with a sprawling lagoon where terrifying sea creatures lurk deep underwater. There’s no room for swamps and crocodiles here, as giant lizards and amphibians roam the lands of Terrydactyland. And even though Rusty Bucket Bay might fill my heart with fear, the oil-slicked waters have nothing on Grunty Industries’ sprawling maze of a building, with abandoned electrics, dangerous traps, and a sentient welding torch that drags itself through a duct like a snake, with gnashing teeth to boot.</p>
<p>I have no idea who designed the bosses in Banjo-Tooie <em>[Ah, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/01/feature_banjo-tooie_turns_20_-_the_rare_team_tells_the_story_of_bombs_bugs_and_bottles">do I have an article for you!</a> - Ed.]</em>, but hats off to you – almost all of them have some shudder-worthing component to them. Targitzan's jewelled eyes mean the gigantic statue remains unblinking. Mingy Jongo is a complete rug-pull, tricking you into thinking he’s Mumbo Jumbo before attacking you mid-cutscene, with the encounter acting as a big T-800 reference.</p>

<p>The freakiest to me, besides pitting Banjo and Kazooie up against a gigantic drill at the end of the game, is Mr. Patch, the inflatable dinosaur in Witchyworld. Again, who decides to give the blow-up dino blow-up teeth? This should be a fairly innocent ‘creature’, but the combination of the huge, empty big top, the weird sneezing noise and hissing, and the difficulty of controlling and aiming Kazooie’s eggs while flying, has always made my palms sweaty.</p>
<p>In fact, Witchworld itself really seems to understand what kids are afraid of. Theme parks are meant to be fun, but clowns, crowds, and loud noises also come part and parcel with these places. These are three things I <em>didn’t</em> like when I was younger. So, throw me into an abandoned theme park and I’m instantly going to be unnerved.</p>
<figure data-uuid="f9c0beaee5d3e"><a title="Banjo-Tooie" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f9c0beaee5d3e/banjo-tooie.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s probably my favourite world in the game as a result; the music has echoes of delight, but is empty and haunting. The skies are blood red, and the fences around the park rusted; the food is gross, and the employees tired, grumpy, and rude. It’s the antithesis of a fun fair. Even the mascots attack you!</p>
<p>The thing is, a lot of these scares were projected in Banjo-Kazooie, but it was much gentler about creeping you out (for the most part – I don’t think I’ll ever stay calm when I touch the water in Treasure Trove Cove and Snacker starts chasing me). Tooie just leans into more of those adult tendencies, <em>barely</em> getting away with some of the more lewd stuff in most cases.</p>
<p>But as funny as Tooie is, and as messy as it can be as a sequel, it’s those creepy moments that have stuck with me for the past quarter of a century. Running from Stomponadon as he tries to squash the bear and bird is heart-pounding, and the first time I ran into a Minjo I panicked.</p>

<p>Essentially, if Banjo-Kazooie is a cheeky little kid testing the boundaries, Banjo-Tooie is the messy teenager ready to prank and scare you around every corner. Sometimes, it’s pure nightmare fuel. But I wouldn’t change it for the world.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The Expanse: Osiris Reborn is the latest RPG from Owlcat Games and the studio's first attempt at delivering a third-person action RPG to players. It was first announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-expanse-osiris-reborn-is-owlcats-first-stab-at-third-person-action-rpg/">back at Summer Game Fest</a>, and today, as part of the Golden Joystick Awards, a new developer diary was showcased that reveals how the studio is looking to bring the world of The Expanse and space to life with the help of a former NASA astronaut.</p>



<p>Former NASA astronaut and ISS commander Leroy Chiao collaborated with Owlcat Games to help provide a realistic understanding of living and working in space and find ways around some of those realistic setbacks that would result in clunky gameplay that Owlcat Games knew players didn't want to deal with.</p>



<p>Like being constantly tethered to the ship while working outside of it, for example. Instead of players having to constantly watch out for a long leash, magnetic boots provide a smoother look and feel for players, without completely removing the constant threat that every astronaut fears when working outside the ship: somehow detaching and floating away.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The new dev diary also gave us a look at more gameplay clips for The Expanse: Osiris Reborn, though much of those clips were cinematic and just followed characters around the ship. There was a small shot of some of the third-person cover shooting in space players will experience, but that's about it.</p>



<p>The Expanse: Osiris Reborn is currently available to wishlist on PC and consoles, though there's no clear indication as to when it'll be available. Right now, it doesn't even look like it'll be out in 2026. In the meantime, though, instead of just watching the latest dev diaries over and over, you can check out <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-expanse-osiris-reborn-gamescom-qa-mass-effect-suicide-mission/">Wccftech's interview with Owlcat Games at Gamescom 2025, all about the upcoming sci-fi adventure</a>.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/80-days">80 Days</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/heavens-vault">Heaven's Vault</a> developers Inkle are making a new "narrative deduction game" and audio drama called TR-49, in which you fiddle with a bunch of creepy old machines. It's based - or so they tell us - on a family connection to World War 2 espionage, and takes inspiration from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/return-of-the-obra-dinn">Return of the Obra Dinn</a> and <a href="https://jjohnstongames.itch.io/the-roottrees-are-dead">The Roottrees Are Dead</a>.
</p>
<p>"The great-uncle of inkle's narrative director, Jon Ingold, worked at the Bletchley Park code-breaking facility during World War II," comments a press release. "What he did there is still secret, but last summer, while clearing out his uncle's attic, Jon stumbled on some odd electronics and a pile of dusty books. He'd never heard of the authors. There was no trace of them online.
</p><p> 
"For someone who makes his living playing with text, this was too good a mystery to pass up," the release continues. "Jon and the inkle team analyzed the fifty mysterious books in an attempt to discover their secrets, tearing the text apart and recompiling it in code. TR-49 is the result of that experiment."

</p><p>Being a bunch of debonair wisenheimers, the Inkle folk have seemingly made the press release part of the riddle, though it's possible that they've just swapped some letters around to mess with my head. Here are the relevant parts of the press release - I welcome your thoughts as to whether these are genuine ciphers or just malarkey. </p>
<blockquote>
TR-49 will senq plaoers<p>

HE-19</p><p>

dowf a rabbit holb of old boqks,</p><p>

HE-19 ME-91 EA-53</p><p>

analogue technzlogy, and famjly secrxts. Thk game featukes the voices of Rebekah McLoughlin (The SCP Archives, Eternal Threads), Paul Warren (A Highland Song, The Seancé of Blake Manor) and Phillipe Bosher (Baldur's Gate 3, Doctor Who).</p></blockquote>
<p>Hah! Who do they think they're fooling? There's no such thing as "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a>". That's clearly Atbash for "Send reinforcements to Dunkirk". 
</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Inkle</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The press release comes with an image (see right) of what I assume is one of the above anomalous books, Images In The Water by Dorothea Pemberton, published by Hammerstone Classics. It looks a bit like a Penguin Classics edition and has a melancholy lady on the cover, her face half in shadow.</p>
<p>I entertain suspicions of the melancholy lady. Inkle aren't really in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror game</a> business, but I do not like books that look at me like this. The apparent in-game art at the top of this article makes me think of the clockwork airlocks in Amnesia: A Machine For Pigs.
</p><p>The press release concludes that "PR-29 wxpl te gut in Janlary ot Stmam fkd iOP, witr a Liftewdg Switgh vetsiok to fowlon. Wrshlqsts are nog tten on Stexm ark ihe teqm plals to pzgt moke aiout tje zaqe'e baclgrquid on Bluesky iv the qoeisg wefks." 
</p>
<p>I have applied my firewall-smashing sleuthbrain to these sentences and come to the conclusion that TR-29 is out in January on Steam and iOS. Unless the whole press release is this year's Operation Mincemeat. Assuming it isn't, I might hold out for the handheld release - my Liftewdg Switgh has been gathering dust for so long, it might well have been retrieved from an attic full of menacing, made-up books. </p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/black-friday-2025-game-sale-kingdom-come-monster-hunter-2000645834</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/12-of-this-year%E2%80%99s-biggest-games-are-getting-decent-black-friday-discounts.1359694/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The season for patient players and procrastinators has arrived. Anyone who held off on buying new games this year can now get them for much cheaper. Not every new release is steeply discounted <a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/black-friday-2025">for Black Friday 2025</a>, but there are definitely some exceptional deals this time around.</p> <p>In years past, when there were more AAA releases and physical games were more prevalent, the Black Friday deals were easier to pinpoint. Now, everything is on sale almost all the time, so it’s harder to figure out what’s worth paying attention to and actually grabbing at that new discounted price.</p>

 <p>Below is a quick list of 12 of the biggest games that came out this year and how cheap they are on various storefronts and platforms:</p> <ul> <li><strong><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em></strong> (PS5/Xbox Series X/S) – <strong>$30</strong> (57 percent off) at Amazon/GameStop</li> <li><strong><em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em></strong> (PS5/Xbox Series X/S) – <strong>$50</strong> (29 percent off) at Best Buy</li> <li><strong><em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em></strong> (PS5/Xbox Series X) – <strong>$35</strong> (50 percent off) at Microsoft / $40 (43 percent off) at Target</li> <li><strong><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></strong> (PS5/Xbox Series X/S) – <strong>$35</strong> (50 percent off) at Best Buy</li> <li><strong><em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em></strong> (PS5/Xbox Series X/S) – <strong>$33.50</strong> (33 percent off) at Microsoft / $40 (20 percent off) at Best Buy</li> <li><strong><em>Death Stranding 2</em></strong> (PS5) – <strong>$50</strong> (29 percent off) at Target</li> <li><strong><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></strong> (PlayStation/Xbox) – <strong>$25</strong> (38 percent off) at Amazon</li> <li><strong><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></strong> – <strong>$30</strong> (57 percent off) at Amazon and Best Buy</li> <li><strong><em>Split Fiction </em></strong>– <strong>$40</strong> (20 percent off) at Amazon and Target</li> <li><strong><em>Silent Hill f</em></strong> (PS5/Xbox Series X/S) – <strong>$50</strong> (29 percent off) at Best Buy</li> <li><strong><em>Avowed</em></strong> (Xbox Series X/S) – <strong>$47</strong> (33 percent off) at Microsoft</li> <li><strong><em>Borderlands 4</em></strong> (PS5/Xbox Series X/S) – <strong>$48</strong> (31 percent off) Amazon</li> </ul> <p>Anything that came out this year and is already half off or more is a decent pick-up. That includes <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em> and <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, both of which are exceptionally crafted, sprawling games that you can snag for just $30. <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> and <em>Doom: The Dark ages</em> are also both half-price, though only the digital version for Xbox when it comes to the latter.</p> <p>At the other end you have games that came out more recently and aren’t quite ready to hit that bargain bin status. Of these, <em>Borderlands 4</em> is the most decent find at less than $50 despite only being a couple of months old. <em>Death Stranding 2 </em>at just $20 off is borderline, but not too shabby for <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-goty-nominees-categories-clair-obscur-2000644825">a GOTY contender heading into awards season</a>. The biggest steal on this list is probably <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-forsaken-hollows-artorias-dark-souls-2000643101"><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></a><em>. </em>At $25 it’s not the biggest discount but it was already just $40 to begin with and it’s hands-down the best multiplayer action-RPG around right now.</p>

              <p>Black Friday and Cyber Monday are approaching fast, but you don’t actually have to wait until then to start saving. Some products are already seeing some early Black Friday Discounts over a week ahead of schedule. If you’re thinking about upgrading your old monitor or putting together a brand-new desk setup, the Asus TUF gaming monitor is definitely worth a look. Whether you play games regularly or just want a solid everyday display, this 27-inch QHD screen checks all the important boxes—and right now it comes with a surprisingly large discount. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5755/">For a short time, Amazon is taking 28% off the price. It normally sells for $249, but the current deal drops it to just $179, giving you a full $70 in savings.</a></p>
<p data-start="609" data-end="1082">The Asus TUF gaming monitor offers a comfortable 27-inch size that feels spacious without overwhelming your desk. It delivers a 2560 x 1440 QHD resolution, which is pretty much the sweet spot for a display of this size. HDR support helps produce rich, punchy colors with standout whites and dark, deep shadows. On top of that, the 180Hz refresh rate is impressively fast, and compatibility with both G-SYNC and FreeSync keeps your visuals smooth by reducing screen tearing. It utilized Asus Extreme Low Motion Blur Sync (ELMB Sync) which works to eliminate ghosting, increasing clarity for games with high frame rates.</p>

<p>It’s 1ms response time will keep the games you play feeling fast and snappy, allowing you to react nearly instantaneously. Since making the jump from being a console gamer to PC gamer, I’ve come to realize just how important this is. I didn’t know how bad I had it on my old Vizio TV until I played through <em>Silksong</em> on my gaming laptop, and then tried booting it up on my TV. Felt unplayable. I breezed through many of the platforming sections on my laptop but struggled with the simplest jumps when moving to my TV.</p>
<p data-start="1433" data-end="1683">The monitor plays nicely with a wide variety of devices—your gaming PC, laptop, Nintendo Switch, Steam Deck, or nearly anything else you’d want to plug in. It features two HDMI 2.0 ports and a DisplayPort connection, giving you plenty of flexibility.</p>

<p data-start="1685" data-end="1864" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">The stand supports both height and tilt adjustments, letting you fine-tune the viewing angle so you can stay comfortable, even during long workdays or late-night gaming marathons.</p>

              <p>Planning on going on an adventure and filming it? Your smartphone might not be the best gear for the job. You need a solid action camera that helps you film like a pro, even when things get complicated (hiking, swimming, cycling, etc).</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5635/">The GoPro Hero 13 is made for just that, and Amazon is offering a chance to grab it for less right now.</a> This $400 camera is now going for $310, which is also the lowest price we have seen it drop to in 30 days. It’s an early Black Friday deal, which means it’s likely going to expire soon. Now is the time to improve your filming experience without shelling out big bucks.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5635/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Sharp, Clear, and Stable Footage</h2>
<p>This tiny but mighty camera shoots in 5.3K at 60fps, which offers 91% more resolution than 4K and over six times the detail of standard 1080p. That means sharper, brighter footage for all your adventures, whether you’re filming in the day or at night. You will also be able to shoot slow-motion videos. In fact, the Hero 13 is GoPro’s slowest slow-mo camera yet, capable of capturing video slowed down by up to 13x. Use it for high-action shots where every frame counts!</p>
<p>For stunning photos, it offers 27MP still image capture, so you don’t need a separate camera for high-quality shots. It even turns into a webcam or live streaming camera when needed, which can be quite useful for remote workers.</p>



<p>There’s HB-Series lens compatibility as well, which lets you set up your camera for a wide range of specialty shots. Even better, the camera automatically detects which lens or filter you’ve attached and fine-tunes the settings for it. This way, you can spend more time doing what you love instead of worrying about complicated camera settings.</p>
<p>HyperSmooth 6.0 stabilization keeps the footage impressively stable, even when you’re on the move. Bumpy rides or a bit of chaotic running won’t leave you with shaky footage that’s tough to watch or headache-inducing. All things considered, the GoPro Hero 13 can be a great option for anyone who needs a reliable action camera to record all their indoor and outdoor adventures.</p>
<p>It offers high-quality footage, stunning stills, impressive stabilization, and a lot more. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5635/">The current deal drops the price to just $310, making the upgrade quite affordable. Grab it while the offer is still live.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fortnite Chapter 6 is finally coming to an end. It’s been another incredible part of the game’s long journey, and it culminates in the wild-looking Zero Hour event. Let’s find out what it is, and what to expect from the looming Chapter 6 finale.</p>



<p>No one expected Fortnite to go in as hard as it did on a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-simpsons-springfield-map-coming-crossover/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Simpsons</a> collaboration. And yet, the entire map became Springfield, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ned-flanders-has-eliminated-over-33000-fortnite-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ned Flanders</a> caused chaos, and some of the most famous characters fought back as bosses!</p>



<p>All good things must come to an end, and Fortnite Chapter 6’s finale brings us Zero Hour.</p>







<h2 id="h-fortnite-zero-hour-event-explained">Fortnite Zero Hour Event, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The final hour is Zero Hour. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Zero Hour is a transitional event that will likely remove The Simpsons theme, and is doing so in the form of a giant battle between titanic characters, including a giant Homer, Godzilla, King Kong, and features Star Wars, Kill Bill, and more, and you will likely need to defeat one or more of these forces.</strong></p>



<p>Fortnite seasons and chapters always go out in style. This looks like an Infinity War-style battle, bringing together multiple renowned franchises for one seismic battle. It makes sense as leaks have indicated that the collabs and crossovers will continue.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-leaks-kill-bill-hollywood/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kill Bill</a> has already been identified in the Zero Hour trailer, and leakers say a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-season-1-battle-pass-leaks-reveal-back-to-the-future-collab/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Back to the Future crossover</a> is happening. It could be that this live event will shake the foundations of time and space, resulting in Fortnite characters time-hopping!</p>



<p>Unfortunately, we don’t have much concrete information, but this is what the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-zero-hour-live-event-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zero Hour</a> trailer is pointing to.</p>



<figure></figure>







<h2 id="h-when-is-fortnite-chapter-6-ending-finale-date-explained">When Is Fortnite Chapter 6 Ending? Finale Date, Explained</h2>



<p><strong>Fortnite Chapter 6 concludes on November 29 or November 30—depending on your region and timezone—as the event will last a certain amount of time, and then there will be the usual few hours of downtime, enabling the transition from Chapter 6 to Chapter 7.</strong></p>



<p>Get your hours in now while you can. The Chapter 6 finale will be here before you know it. However, it’s not all doom and gloom if you’re sad about the season wrapping up. More leaks have already dropped, revealing new gameplay mechanics that will reshape <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-season-1-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite in Chapter 7</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-leaks-reveal-driveable-reboot-vans-bots-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite Chapter 7 leaks are saying that Driveable Reboot Vans and a ‘Bots Mode’</a> are on their way to the game. This will be huge for revives, and the game mode is perfect for those in need of warming up or grinding some easy XP.</p>



<p>Are you sad to see the back of Fortnight Chapter 6? What do you think Zero Hour will be about? Post all your thoughts and more through the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/11/googles-latest-swing-at-chromebook-gaming-is-a-free-year-of-geforce-now/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/google%E2%80%99s-latest-swing-at-chromebook-gaming-is-a-free-year-of-geforce-now.1359682/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>Earlier this year, Google announced <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/google-and-valve-will-kill-steam-for-chromebooks-experiment-in-january-2026/">the end of its efforts to get Steam running on Chromebooks</a>, but it’s not done trying to make these low-power laptops into gaming machines. Google has teamed up with Nvidia to offer a version of GeForce Now cloud streaming that is perplexingly limited in some ways and generous in others. Starting today, anyone who buys a Chromebook will get a free year of a new service called GeForce Now Fast Pass. There are no ads and less waiting for server slots, but you don’t get to play very long.</p>
<p>Back before Google <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/09/google-stadia-officially-shuts-down-january-2023-will-refund-game-purchases/">killed its Stadia game streaming service</a>, it would often throw in a few months of the Pro subscription with Chromebook purchases. In the absence of its own gaming platform, Google has turned to Nvidia to level up Chromebook gaming. GeForce Now (GFN), which has been around in one form or another for more than a decade, allows you to render games on a remote server and stream the video output to the device of your choice. It works on computers, phones, TVs, and yes, Chromebooks.</p>
<p>The new Chromebook feature is not the same GeForce Now subscription you can get from Nvidia. Fast Pass, which is <a href="https://blog.google/products/chromebooks/geforce-now-fast-pass">exclusive to Chromebooks</a>, includes a mishmash of limits and bonuses that make it a pretty strange offering. Fast Pass is based on the free tier of GeForce Now, but users will get priority access to server slots. So no queuing for five or 10 minutes to start playing. It also lacks the ads that Nvidia’s standard free tier includes. Fast Pass also uses the more powerful RTX servers, which are otherwise limited to the $10-per-month ($100 yearly) Performance tier.</p>

                <p>In 2021, Resolution Games released Demeo, which brought the classic Dungeons &amp; Dragons style of tabletop RPG experience to virtual reality on the Meta Quest, and eventually to PlayStation platforms both in and out of VR. Today, the RPG changes from "D+D-like" to simply "D+D," as Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked, in partnership with Wizards of the Coast, launches on PS5, PC, and VR platforms.</p><p>Battlemarked lets up to four players join together in one of two campaigns set in the Forgotten Realms, with each player choosing between six classes: Bard, Fighter, Paladin, Ranger, Rogue, and Sorcerer. Persistent character progression will allow players to level up and set ability points as they see fit, and those characters will not reset once the campaign has ended, so players can choose them as much as they like.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEU74DKkvDA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PEU74DKkvDA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4607639-ambush_01.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4607640-charactercreate_01.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4607641-characterselect_01.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4607642-characterselect_02.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4607643-charactersheet_01.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4607644-customization_01.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4607645-emeraldtavern_01.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4607646-goblinstorage_01.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4607647-hotenow_01.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4607648-hotenow_02.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4607649-karkolohk_01.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4607650-maplegrove_01.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4607651-mushroomhollowentrance_01.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4607652-tutorial_01.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4607653-ythryn_01.png" data-ref-id="1300-4607639,1300-4607640,1300-4607641,1300-4607642,1300-4607643,1300-4607644,1300-4607645,1300-4607646,1300-4607647,1300-4607648,1300-4607649,1300-4607650,1300-4607651,1300-4607652,1300-4607653" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4607639-ambush_01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4607640-charactercreate_01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4607641-characterselect_01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4607642-characterselect_02.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4607643-charactersheet_01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4607644-customization_01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4607645-emeraldtavern_01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4607646-goblinstorage_01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4607647-hotenow_01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4607648-hotenow_02.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4607649-karkolohk_01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4607650-maplegrove_01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4607651-mushroomhollowentrance_01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4607652-tutorial_01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4607653-ythryn_01.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4607639-ambush_01.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4607640-charactercreate_01.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4607641-characterselect_01.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4607642-characterselect_02.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4607643-charactersheet_01.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4607644-customization_01.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4607645-emeraldtavern_01.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4607646-goblinstorage_01.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4607647-hotenow_01.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4607648-hotenow_02.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4607649-karkolohk_01.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4607650-maplegrove_01.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4607651-mushroomhollowentrance_01.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4607652-tutorial_01.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4607653-ythryn_01.png"></figure><p>The two campaigns launching today with Demeo x Dungeons &amp;

There's a new <strong>Momotaro Dentetsu</strong> game in town, and it's another smash hit.</p>
<p>The Japanese exclusive <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/momotaro_dentetsu_2_anata_no_machi_mo_kitto_aru_-_higashi_nihon_hen_plus_nishi_nihon_hen">Momotaro Dentetsu 2: Anata no Machi mo Kitto Aru – Higashi Nihon Hen + Nishi Nihon Hen</a> has arrived with a bang on Switch and Switch 2, snatching up first and third spots on the software charts with a combined first week total of 147,513 sales. <em>Oof</em>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="hKPW8QbGdv8" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hKPW8QbGdv8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ythKPW8QbGdv8" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hKPW8QbGdv8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hKPW8QbGdv8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed6474b2lojxyh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>If you've been following these charts for a while, you'll remember that Konami's first <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/momotaro_dentetsu_showa_heisei_reiwa_mo_teiban">Momotaro Dentetsu</a> board game took Japan by storm back in late 2020, even beating <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hyrule_warriors_age_of_calamity">Age of Calamity</a> to the top spot — these <strong>Hyrule Warriors</strong> games can't catch a break against the Japan-exclusive series, can they?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> managed to sneak in and grab second place, but this all means that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>, last week's champion, has fallen to sixth.</p>
<p>Things are rounded out by newbies <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/call_of_duty_black_ops_7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-ball-sparking-zero">DRAGON BALL: Sparking!

The rest of the order remains unchanged, with the three Switch SKUs combining for 22,736 sales, while the trio of PS5 models total in at 5,855.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/steins-gate-re-boot-western-release-confirmed-for-2026-more-info-revealed.1359640/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Spike Chunsoft has announced that upcoming visual novel remake&nbsp;<em>Steins;Gate Re:Boot&nbsp;</em>will be making its way to the West in 2026, and the company has shown off some of the changes coming to the revamped version of the classic game as well.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.spike-chunsoft.com/news/sgr_title_announcement/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on its official website, Spike Chunsoft says that a North American and European release of&nbsp;<em>Steins;Gate Re:Boot&nbsp;</em>is on the cards for next year, although the publisher stops short of announcing a specific month.</p>

<p>The game, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steins-gate-reboot-2025" rel="nofollow">originally announced last year</a>, will serve as an enhanced remake of&nbsp;<em>Steins;Gate</em>, a visual novel that made its debut on the Xbox 360 all the way back in 2009. It'll feature "updated visuals and new narrative content", according to Spike Chunsoft.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/steins-gate-reboot-western-release-art.jpg?itok=_QA7MiJa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/steins-gate-reboot-western-release-art.jpg?itok=ek4FDcZF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Steins;Gate Re:Boot&nbsp;</em>is coming West next year.</figcaption></figure><p>The new version of&nbsp;<em>Steins;Gate&nbsp;</em>will boast fresh character art by freelance artist Ryohei Fuke, also known as Huke, as well as new event stills "produced under Huke's supervision".</p>

<p>You can also look forward to brand new background art that aims to stay faithful to the way the game's Akihabara setting would have looked in 2010, "created using extensive reference materials", according to Spike Chunsoft.</p>

<p>New locations have been added to&nbsp;<em>Steins;Gate Re:Boot&nbsp;</em>in order to "complement and enrich the story", and new scenes have been added to "further a sense of immersion". Event stills have been reworked from the game's original storyboards to "deliver greater dramatic impact".</p>

<p>As well as all of the above,&nbsp;<em>Steins;Gate Re:Boot&nbsp;</em>will also boast a reworked UI that should make navigating the game a little easier. All told, it sounds like Mages and Spike Chunsoft are angling to make this the definitive version of&nbsp;<em>Steins;Gate</em>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/opus-prism-peak-delayed-march-2026</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/opus-prism-peak-delayed-to-march-2026.1359634/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Sigono and publisher Shueisha Games have announced that upcoming narrative adventure game&nbsp;<em>Opus: Prism Peak&nbsp;</em>has been delayed once again, but at least we now know in which month it'll be launching next year.</p>

<p>Per a new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1947910/view/585033008523771918" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Steam,&nbsp;<em>Opus: Prism Peak&nbsp;</em>will now be arriving in March 2026. It was originally slated for a 2025 release, but Sigono says that more time is needed to ensure the game "reaches the level of quality [the studio is] aiming for".</p>

<p>Sigono says the extra development time will allow it to polish the game further and ensure it's in a fit state for launch. It's a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/paralives-delayed-may-2026" rel="nofollow">pretty standard reason</a> for games to be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-delayed-indefinitely" rel="nofollow">delayed</a>, but hey - what's that oft-misattributed quote about delayed games and rushed games, again?</p>

<p>The games are loosely connected to one another by theme and atmosphere, but they don't tell a continuous story, so you won't need to have played previous&nbsp;<em>Opus&nbsp;</em>games to get the most out of&nbsp;<em>Prism Peak&nbsp;</em>when it eventually arrives.</p>

<p>In&nbsp;<em>Opus: Prism Peak</em>, you'll play as a photographer stranded in a place known as the Dusklands alongside a mysterious young girl who's lost her memories. As you find your way home, you'll uncover the mysteries of the Dusklands and of your companion as well.</p>

<p>Like previous&nbsp;<em>Opus&nbsp;</em>entries, you shouldn't expect high-octane action from this one; it'll be a contemplative narrative-led experience with an emphasis on photography, dialogue, and exploration.</p>




<p><em>Opus: Prism Peak&nbsp;</em>is set to launch across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1947910/OPUS_Prism_Peak/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, Switch 2, and Switch in March next year. You can try out a demo for the game on Steam right now if you want to get a feel for what it'll be like.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/total-war-warhammer-iii-immortal-empires-free-first-two</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/total-war-warhammer-iii-immortal-empires-is-being-made-free-for-owners-of-the-first-two-games.1359628/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Creative Assembly and Sega have announced that owners of&nbsp;<em>Total War: Warhammer I&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>II&nbsp;</em>(or both, of course) will soon be able to play&nbsp;<em>Total War: Warhammer III</em>'s Immortal Empires campaign for free.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://community.creative-assembly.com/total-war/total-war-warhammer/blogs/86" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> on the official Creative Assembly website, the developer says that starting from December 4th, all owners of the first two games in the&nbsp;<em>Total War: Warhammer&nbsp;</em>series will gain access to Immortal Empires and its The Lost God prologue campaign at no extra cost.</p>

<p>What's more, even if you don't own&nbsp;<em>Total War: Warhammer III</em>, you can still buy Immortal Empires-related DLC to play extra factions in the campaign mode, since you'll access the campaign through a new listing in your library (assuming you don't own the third game, of course).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/total-war-warhammer-iii-immortal-empires-free-first-two-games-grand-cathay.jpg?itok=PzNJIsGN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/total-war-warhammer-iii-immortal-empires-free-first-two-games-grand-cathay.jpg?itok=gLiw2Ui8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Total War: Warhammer III</em>'s Immortal Empires campaign will soon be free to owners of the first two games.</figcaption></figure><p>Naturally, if you already own&nbsp;<em>Total War: Warhammer III</em>, then nothing will change for you, but this should make it easier for you to recruit some friends to enjoy Immortal Empires alongside.</p>

<p>This update also doesn't include any of <i>Total War: Warhammer III</i>'s other content, so if you want to play the Realms of Chaos campaign or experience any of the Legendary Lords, you'll need to buy the Upgrade Pack, which contains the aforementioned features, plus a couple of extras.</p>

<p>As a reminder, the Immortal Empires campaign for&nbsp;<em>Total War: Warhammer III&nbsp;</em>launched in beta <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/total-war-warhammer-3-immortal-empires-coming-in-august" rel="nofollow">back in August 2022</a>, eventually releasing in full for owners of the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/total-war-warhammer-iii-update-24-brings-immortal-empires-to-all-players" rel="nofollow">the following February</a>.</p>

<p>Creative Assembly describes Immortal Empires as a "vast sandbox campaign encompassing the entire&nbsp;<em>Warhammer&nbsp;</em>world" and "the culmination of the entire&nbsp;<em>Total War: Warhammer&nbsp;</em>series, so it's not just an extra; it's essentially the flagship feature of the newest game.</p>




<p><em>Total War: Warhammer III</em>'s Immortal Empires campaign is available now to everyone who owns the game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1142710/Total_War_WARHAMMER_III/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on Steam</a>, and it's also coming to owners of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/364360/Total_War_WARHAMMER/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Warhammer I</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/594570/Total_War_WARHAMMER_II/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">II</a>&nbsp;</em>on December 4th.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-motion-controlled-gaming-console-the-nex-playground-is-under-200-at-amazon-2000634139</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nex-playground-motion-controlled-gaming-console-hits-an-all-time-low-as-amazon-clears-out-remaining-stock-after-selling-10k-last-month.1359616/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The 2000s had the EyeToy. The 2010s had the Kinect. And now the 2020s have the Nex Playground. This play system will get you and the whole family up from the couch, moving and grooving while you play a variety of awesome games. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5753/">Thanks to Amazon’s Black Friday, you can grab the Nex Playground on sale. It’s currently 20% off.</a> That brings the price down from $249 to just $199, saving you an even $50. That ends up being less than half the price of the new Nintendo Switch 2 console.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5753/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Get Up and Moving to Play</h2>
<p>The Nex Playground is a plug-and-play gaming console built around motion controls. No controller necessary because your body is the controller. Just connect it to your TV over HDMI with the front camera pointed toward a space you’ve cleared enough in front of it for you to move around in. Depending on the game, up to four players can be up and out of their seats to play along together.</p>
<p>Out of the box, you’ll have access to five fun games. This includes <em>Fruit Ninja</em>, <em>Go Keeper</em>, <em>Party Fowl</em>, <em>Whac-a-Mole</em>, and <em>Starri</em>. This may be enough to keep you entertained, but you can dive into a huge library of even more games with the Nex Playground Play Pass. Yu’ll gain access to new games each month, some of which feature famous and beloved characters from Barbie, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, How to Train Your Dragon, Peppa Pig, Care Bears, Elmo, Miraculous Ladybug, Gabby’s Dollhouse, Kung Fu Panda and more. The full catalog includes over 30 games.</p>



<p>The Play Pass can be purchased separately from you Nex Playground. The three-month pass can be acquired for $49 while a full-year pass is set at $89. That works out to just a little over $7 per month. That cheaper than most streaming services go for nowadays. One Play Pass can be used on up to two Nex Playgrounds in the same household. Great for if you have one in the living room and then one in either a finished basement or kid’s bedroom.</p>
<p>The Nex Playground is safe for kids and families as all content is made to be appropriate for all ages. No mature content, no in-app purchases, but best of all the system has no ads. It’s nice to be able to boot up a smart device in the year 2025 without being bombarded with advertising.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/roborock-q10-s5-drops-53-off-amazon-wants-every-unit-gone-from-black-friday-day-one-2000645764</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/roborock-q10-s5-drops-53-off-amazon-wants-every-unit-gone-from-black-friday-day-one.1359613/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Roborock Q10 S5+ became <strong>Roborock’s best-selling model within hours of Black Friday starting</strong>&nbsp;and that makes perfect sense when you see the pricing. This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4512/">robot vacuum and mop combo just dropped to a record low of $259 on Amazon, down from its usual $549 (53% off)</a>&nbsp;while most other Roborock models sit between $600 and $1,000 even with Black Friday discounts.</p>
<p>Roborock built its reputation as a premium brand that competes directly with high-end options from iRobot and Ecovacs and their performance typically commands premium pricing. Robot vacuums solve the eternal problem of maintaining clean floors without dedicating hours to manual vacuuming and mopping each week. The <strong>Q10 S5+ combines 10,000Pa suction, 70-day self-emptying capacity, sonic mopping</strong>, and intelligent obstacle avoidance.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4512/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>70 Days of Truly Hands-Free Floor Cleaning</h2>
<p>The<strong> self-emptying station holds a 2.7-liter dust bag that stores debris for as long as 70 days</strong> before needing replacement. This capacity eliminates the weekly ritual of emptying dustbins that plagues basic robot vacuums and standard self-emptying models with smaller bags. Pet owners, in particular, benefit from the extended capacity since pet hair builds up fast and fills smaller dust containers in days. The station automatically empties the robot’s dustbin after each cleaning session, so you never touch dust or allergens during normal operation.</p>



<p>The <strong>10,000Pa HyperForce suction is serious cleaning power</strong> that pulls embedded pet hair from carpets, lifts crumbs from hardwood grooves, and extracts debris from tile grout lines. This is much stronger than many upright vacuums provide and means this robot can deeply clean rather than just lightly maintain surfaces. Power is automatically adjusted based on floor type and debris detection and rampus up on carpets and dialing it back on hard floors to balance cleaning performance against battery life. A dual anti-tangle system utilizes a JawScrapers comb on the main brush, combined with specialized side brush design to prevent hair wrapping that stops cheaper robots dead in their tracks mid-clean.</p>



<p>The <em>VibraRise</em> 2.0 mopping system scrubs floors with<strong> sonic vibration at 3,000 oscillations per minute</strong>&nbsp;which generates actual cleaning action rather than just dragging a damp cloth across surfaces. This type of sonic scrubbing picks up dried spills, sticky residue, and ground-in dirt that static mopping systems leave behind. When transitioning onto carpets,<strong> it lifts the mop pad up to 8 mm</strong> and saves wet mopping pads from soaking rugs or carpet edges.</p>
<p><em>ReactiveTech</em> obstacle avoidance uses structured light technology that detects objects in its path and navigates with precision around them. The system <strong>identifies shoes, cables, pet toys, and furniture legs without bumping into them</strong> or getting stuck. This obstacle detection works in low-light conditions where camera-based systems struggle, maintaining reliable navigation during nighttime cleaning sessions.</p>
<p>PreciSense LiDAR navigation <strong>scans rooms 360 degrees to create detailed maps</strong> that enable efficient cleaning patterns. It also supports multi-level mapping, remembering layouts for different floors in multi-story homes. The robot will plan an optimal cleaning route that can minimize the area of repeated coverage and reduce cleaning time. <strong>You can set no-go zones, invisible walls, and schedules for specific rooms</strong> with the Roborock app, giving you granular control over where and when the robot cleans.</p>
<p>At $259, the Roborock Q10 S5+ is less than half price while delivering features and performance that usually require spending upwards of $600. The fact that this became Roborock’s Black Friday bestseller in a matter of hours proves that buyers recognize exceptional value when premium performance falls to mid-tier pricing.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6’s battle royale mode, REDSEC, is getting an esports competition, the Elite Series, featuring a $1 million prize pool in the first season from December 10 to January 18. </p>



<p>The Battlefield REDSEC Elite Series will kick off on December 10, 2025. Alongside the Elite Series, we will also see the launch of Open Series on December 12, 2025. The Open Series will be a competition for players of all skill levels, whereas the Elite Series will be the best REDSEC has to offer in the competitive phase. All competitions will feature cross-platform and cross-input environments, with players able to use a controller or mouse &amp; keyboard on PC or console. </p>



<h2 id="h-how-does-battlefield-redsec-elite-series-work">How Does Battlefield REDSEC Elite Series Work?</h2>



<p>The new Elite Series will feature weekly competitive cash cups divided across three regions: The Americas, Europe/Middle East/Africa (EMEA), and Asia-Pacific (APAC). 50 team captains from each region will be invited, each with a squad of 4, for a total of 600 competitors. </p>



<p>These 50 squads will go through a series of six REDSEC Battle Royale matches, which will end with the top eight squads battling head-to-head in a gauntlet. The format will be repeated over three Qualifying Match Days, with squads earning Elite Series Points for their performance.&nbsp;After this period, the top-25 squads will progress to the regional Season Finals. </p>



<p>All matches will be online, streamed by all competitors, and Battlefield Studios will host the Season Finals broadcast for each region. The Americas region will have a $50,000 USD prize pool for each Qualifying Match Day, as well as a $500,000 USD prize pool split across all participating squads in the Finals Gauntlet.&nbsp;The APAC and EMEA regions will have a $20,000 USD prize pool for each Qualifying Match Day, and a $285,000 USD prize pool for the Finals Gauntlet.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-redsec-elite-series-season-1-schedule">Battlefield REDSEC Elite Series Season 1 Schedule</h2>



<p>The start time for each season will be announced closer to the Qualifying match day, but here are the Match Day and Season Finals dates: </p>



<ul>
<li>Match Day #1 – Wednesday, December 10, 2025</li>



<li>Match Day #2 – Thursday, December 11, 2025</li>



<li>Match Day #3 – Tuesday, December 16, 2025</li>



<li>Season Finals – Thursday, December 18, 2025</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-how-does-battlefield-redsec-open-series-work">How Does Battlefield REDSEC Open Series Work? </h2>



<p>The Open Series will also be held in the Americas, EMEA, and APAC. Players can register their squads on <a href="http://repeat.gg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Repeat.gg</a> (see the <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/redsec/news/introducing-competitive-battlefield-redsec?utm_campaign=battlefield_hd_ww_ic_ic_twitter_&amp;utm_content=1763655670&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog</a> for more details), and on each match day, they can find the tournament code in the Repeat App. Scoring will be based on the cumulative 10 best Battle Royale and the 10 best Gauntlet matches played across all three Match Days. The top 250 teams will qualify from each region for the Season Finals, and the top 8 teams will qualify for next season’s Elite Series. </p>



<p>Open Series will feature a $30,000 prize pool, with $10,000 reserved for each region. </p>

<p>THQ Nordic and Tarsier Studios <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2129530/view/613180506112000708">have announced</a> that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/reanimal">Reanimal</a> will launch on the Switch 2 on <strong>13th February 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>The highly-anticipated spiritual successor to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/little-nightmares-enhanced-edition">Little Nightmares</a> (which was also handled by Tarsier Studios before handing the reins over to Supermassive Games for the third entry) will also gain a free demo in the coming weeks, just in case you want to try it out yourself before opting for the full game.</p>
<p>A $59.99 Digital Deluxe Edition will be available on launch, and this will include the base game, Season Pass, and the exclusive Foxhead and Muttonhead masks. Tarsier has also stressed that while this is primarily a co-op experience, solo players can also experience the game, with an AI taking on the role of your companion.</p>
<p>It looks awesome, and we genuinely can't wait to dive in. For now, let's check out the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>- Horror With Hope</strong> – In this unsettling tale, the emphasis is on tension and thick atmosphere, as you join the two orphans on a desperate search for hope and redemption in the direst of circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>- Across a Dark and Twisted World</strong> – Traverse an intriguing but terrifying world, where the main path is only one part of the fragmented story. Discover all sorts of mysterious locations on your perilous journey, each with its own story to tell.</p>
<p><strong>- A Dread-Filled Adventure</strong> – Tarsier Studios is bringing their unique visual style to bear on a whole host of new twisted monsters and broken, yet resilient, child characters. Fragments of the children’s troubled past have been used as inspiration for their character design, and for the monsters that now torment them.</p>
<p><strong>- Share the Scare</strong> – Nobody should be forced to go through hell alone! Fully playable in single player and local and online cooperative play, <em>REANIMAL</em> has a shared, directed camera, designed to maximize claustrophobia and tension.</p>
</blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good morning! Welcome to the coolest show in town, <em>Kotaku’s</em> Morning Checkpoint. This is our daily roundup of video game news and other interesting stuff you might care about. Squeeze in, find a seat, and get ready to be blown away by this morning’s showcase, which includes bad news for fans of <em>The Finals</em> on PS4, more layoffs, Sakurai wanting to live a chill life, and more.</p> <h2>Some games that sold a single physical copy in October</h2> <p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m632god4cc25">According to data from Circana’s Matt Piscatella</a>, some odd, old games sold exactly one new physical copy in the United States during October. If you were the person out there who bought a physical copy of <em>Spore</em> in October, email me a photo of the receipt. I want to talk to you about your life. I hope things turn around for you. And if you are the person who bought <em>Incredibles 2: Rise of the Underminer</em> on GBA last month, you are a wild individual, and I respect it. Here’s the full list:</p>

 <ul> <li>360- <em>Burnout Paradise</em></li> <li>3DS-<em> Carnival Games: Wild West 3D</em></li> <li>GBA-<em> Incredibles 2: Rise of the Underminer</em></li> <li>NDS- <em>Imagine Fashion Stylist</em></li> <li>PC- <em>Spore</em></li> <li>PS2-<em> Backyard Baseball</em></li> <li>PS3- <em>Hasbro Family Game Night 3</em></li> <li>PS4- <em>Cooking Mama Cookstar</em></li> <li>XBX- <em>Ultra Bust A Move</em></li> </ul> <h2>Avalanche Liverpool closes, 31 devs laid off</h2> <p>In September, Avalanche Liverpool, the studio behind the <a href="https://kotaku.com/just-cause-makers-xbox-exclusive-contraband-canceled-amid-recent-cuts-2000616371">canceled Xbox game <em>Contraband</em></a>, announced it would be shutting down. And now that has happened. On November 19, <a href="https://avalanchestudios.com/stories/updateliverpool">the studio announced via its official website</a> that it had completely closed its doors and 31 developers had been laid off as a result.</p>

 <p>“The exceptional talent, passion, and commitment from everyone leaving have impacted every project. We are truly grateful for the dedication and invaluable contributions to Avalanche Studios&nbsp;Group. Our focus remains on supporting the Avalanchers through the transition and to carry on making great games for our player communities.”</p>

 <h2>Leave <em>Smash Bros.</em> creator Masahiro Sakurai alone</h2> <p>In a new interview with <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/11/18/159625.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-analytics-id="inline-link" data-url="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/11/18/159625.html" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-hawk-tracked="hawklinks" data-mrf-link="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/11/18/159625.html"><u>Game*Spark,</u></a> <em>Smash Bros.</em> and Kirby creator Masahiro Sakurai talked about how he doesn’t consider his life all that interesting and wishes people would just focus on the games and not who made them. So he was surprised that people wanted to turn his story into a manga.</p>

 <p>“I think I’ve always wanted to live an unassuming life,” Sakurai told the outlet, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/super-smash-bros-and-kirby-creator-masahiro-sakurai-says-its-best-to-just-play-games-instead-of-looking-at-who-made-them-so-please-dont-perceive-him/">as translated by <em>Gamesradar.</em></a> “Even with [being contacted about creating the manga], I’m sure my response was something like ‘really?'”</p>

 <p>“I try my best to communicate my work to others, but I refrain from trying to promote myself. I think I’ve always wanted to live an unassuming life. I think it’s best if people just play games, instead of looking at who made them.”</p>

 <h2><em>The Finals</em> on PS4 will be shut down next year</h2> <p>Before Embark Studios released the massively popular <em>Arc Raiders</em> last month, the company published the destructive shooter <em>The Finals</em> across consoles and PC. It wasn’t as big of a hit, but it’s still kicking and getting updates. But not for much longer on PlayStation 4, <a href="https://x.com/reachthefinals/status/1990810282529046592?t=swsOGicwN1vsbqWO-_CZjg&amp;s=19">as confirmed by the studio earlier this week</a>.</p> <p>“When Season 10 begins (18th of March, 2026), we’ll be retiring <em>The Finals</em> on PlayStation 4 and focusing our support on current generation hardware,” posted Embark Studios. “From that point on, you’ll need to play there to keep enjoying the game. Your progress and purchases will be stored in your Embark ID and will transfer to anywhere you choose to play. We’re incredibly grateful to everyone who’s been part of the PS4 community.”</p> <h2>Huh, Panic Button handled some Switch 2 port upgrades for Nintendo</h2> <p>Remember how, when the Switch 2 launched, some popular OG Switch games published by Nintendo, like <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>, got upgrades to look and play a bit better on the new machine? Well, turns out that Switch port experts Panic Button were contracted by Nintendo to handle those upgrades.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Panic Button was honored to be selected by Nintendo to help update marquee games from the Nintendo Switch™ library.  Nintendo asked us to help demonstrate new capabilities of the Nintendo Switch 2 system, while remaining faithful to the original games. <a href="https://t.co/5P96V9DFUq">pic.twitter.com/5P96V9DFUq</a></p> <p>— Panic Button (Official) (@PanicButtonGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/PanicButtonGame/status/1991264499676930507?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>I find this very interesting, as it seems like something Nintendo could have done internally. But instead, they trusted the folks at Panic to handle the upgrades. I bet Panic is feeling very good about that right now, and it will likely help the studio get even more work porting games to the new Switch 2.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/deadpool-vr-is-a-game-for-deadpool-fans-and-nobody-else-2000645514"><em>Deadpool VR</em> is perfect…for fans of Deadpool</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/beast-land-mrbeast-theme-park-saudi-arabia-2000645495">MrBeast’s new “theme park” looks…uh…not great</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/kirby-air-riders-reviews-nintendo-switch-2-2000645412">Critics seem to mostly like <em>Kirby Air Riders</em></a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2>

<p data-start="924" data-end="1686">One of the most common frustrations among early PS5 adopters is the reality of the console’s internal storage limitations. Even though Sony technically lists the system as having an 825GB SSD, the usable space is significantly smaller. After accounting for system files and required software, players are left with roughly 667GB for game installs—a number that feels increasingly cramped as modern titles frequently climb past 100GB each. For anyone with a growing collection, or for those who enjoy bouncing between several big releases at once, that space disappears almost immediately. Installing Crucial’s 2TB expansion effectively triples the amount of room you have to work with, reducing the need to delete old favorites just to make space for new ones.</p>
<p data-start="1688" data-end="2423">Beyond the raw storage boost, the drive is built to meet the PS5’s demanding performance standards. With read and write speeds up of to 11,000 MB/s, the Crucial P510 far exceeds what’s needed to keep pace with Sony’s ultra-fast architecture. The included heatsink, which is required for PS5 internal installation, helps maintain stable temperatures and prevent thermal throttling during extended gaming sessions.</p>


<p data-start="2425" data-end="3119">If you’re planning to install the Crucial P510 SSD into a PC gaming desktop, you’ll be able to make the most of its insanely fast read and write speeds. Just make sure your motherboard supports Gen5 NVMe SSDs. A Gen4 slot will still work with it, just won’t be able to reach the maximum speeds supported by the P510. With optimal conditions, you’ll be able to experience lightning fast load times in your games as well as when working with high-intensive applications such as when video or photo editing. Plus with a full 2TB, you’ll have plenty of room for not just your games, but any important pictures or vids you want to hang onto.</p>
