            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo%E2%80%99s-new-switch-1-update-is-getting-things-ready-for-switch-2.1177152/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/658511/nintendo-switch-20-0-0-update-virtual-game-card-gameshare-switch-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>With just over a month to go before the Nintendo <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634603/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-details">Switch 2 release date on June 5t</a>h, Nintendo has released a Switch 1 update that will help prepare things for the new console’s arrival. The <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/22525/p/989/c/188#current">V20.0.0 update for the original Switch</a> adds a bunch of new features that go along with the Switch 2, like Home menu buttons for the<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/637307/nintendo-switch-virtual-game-card-lending-system"> Virtual Game Card</a> and GameShare features that were announced earlier this month, and a new system transfer feature that can store your data in the cloud until you’re ready to put it on a Switch 2 — just make sure you read the instructions closely before trying it.</p><p>You won’t be able to use the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641334/nintendo">GameShare feature</a> yet, as sharing can only start from a Switch 2 system over local wireless connections — trying to do it between two Switch 1 systems won’t work.</p><p>You can check out the new Virtual Game Cards that collect digital software and DLC for you to “load” and “eject” between two different systems, and lend games to others in your Nintendo Account family group. If you lend a game to someone else, then you can pull it back while they’re online even if they’re currently playing, but if they go offline without returning it or coming back online, you’ll need to wait until the end of the two-week lending period for it to be returned to your library automatically.</p><p>Nintendo’s <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/67891">Virtual Game Card Guide</a> explains all of the ins and outs of the new lending system, like how each Switch can only be connected to one other Switch at a time, how to manage your game cards from the web, and how to hide (or unhide) certain cards.</p><p>To use digital games across more than just two systems or without those restrictions, Nintendo is now relying on the Online License Settings, which are also being added to your Switch 1 in this update. If it’s turned on, it will allow the user to play any of their digitally purchased games and DLC as long as they’re connected to the internet, without relying on virtual game cards.</p><p>But if you’ve already decided to upgrade, then your first stop might be the new option for “System Transfer to Nintendo Switch 2” under the System menu in System Settings. While it can be used for a local system-to-system transfer once your new console arrives, there’s also an option to upload system transfer data to the cloud now, where it will be ready to download to a Switch 2 without requiring access to your old system.</p><p>While that might be good for someone passing their Switch 1 off to someone else, the downside is that it will factory reset your Switch 1, so it’s better to wait if possible, and it will only be stored for a year if not downloaded. Another wrinkle is that it’s possible to set up a Switch 2 cloud transfer, then cancel it and bring your data back to a Switch 1. However, <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68432">as Nintendo’s system transfer FAQ explains</a>, while it doesn’t have to be the same Switch 1 you started with, if it started on a Switch OLED, you will only be able to cancel and reload your data on another Switch OLED.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        </p>No. We have to fight on, the rest of us cannot give up.<br>And now I have an unlikely ally… I’m becoming more powerful.<br>Can I save her? Can I bring back her soul?<p>Embark on an epic odyssey to save your younger sister—and the whole of humanity—from mysterious dimensional invaders from beyond the starlit skies in <em>Lost Soul Aside</em>.</p><p>Run the gauntlet of formidable enemies and colossal bosses in this breathtakingly stylish <a title="Genres > Action [2,703 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,246 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> <a title="Genres > RPG [17,215 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPG</a>; chaining weapon and spectacular attack combos in high-octane, dynamic combat.</p><p><strong>Heroes and Villains</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Kaser</strong> – A war orphan born in Slum Harbour, Kaser raised his younger sister Louisa alone and has become a pivotal member of the GLIMMER resistance group. Strong and selfless, Kaser shies away from the label of a hero, feeling the weight of those who depend on his abilities and leadership. Unyielding in his defiance against oppression, he fights for those who cannot stand up for themselves, fuelled by a steadfast resolve to save his home from the cruel reign of brutal tyrants. Now the fate of his beloved sister hangs in the balance as he seeks to exact a terrible revenge on Aramon and the invading Voidrax.</li><li><strong>Arena</strong> – Once a powerful alien-dragon warrior, Arena exudes a commanding aura of authority that demands respect. It was in witnessing the true depths of human love and kindness that he realized humanity was not the evil species he had always believed it to be. Now haunted by the memories of his past actions in conquering innocent worlds alongside his Voidrax brethren, Arena’s future is clouded and his motivations remain unclear. <a title="Games > Beneath [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/beneath">Beneath</a> his strong and domineering presence lies a wise and compassionate soul, capable of offering help and guidance to those who need it the most, with a dose of dry humour even in the most dangerous situations.</li><li><strong>Louisa</strong> – Kaser’s sweet-natured younger sister always prioritizes the wellbeing of others and is willing to do whatever it takes to protect her friends and family from harm. Growing up in Slum Harbour left an imprint on the teenager and deeply shaped her character, instilling a great deal of loyalty and empathy for its people who have long suffered under the harsh and oppressive rule of the Empire. Despite her overly protective older brother’s concerns, Louisa joined the GLIMMER resistance group, determined to make Slum Harbour a happier and safer place to live. Her genuine compassion, respect and kindness have earned her the heartfelt gratitude of the townsfolk.</li><li><strong>Aramon</strong> – The ruthless commander of the Voidrax has been imprisoned across alternative dimensions for a millennium—but is executing a meticulous escape plan that threatens to unleash catastrophic consequences. Consumed by an insatiable obsession to dominate all of existence, he intends to seize the planet’s Life Nexus—a move that could grant him nearly limitless power. His vengeance against those who imprisoned him will be swift, brutal and merciless, leaving devastation in his wake. Manipulative, narcissistic and arrogant, he holds others in utter contempt, believing that the time for his ultimate rule has finally arrived.</li><li><strong>Victor</strong> – As the noble leader of the Holy Order, bound by a solemn oath to protect the weak and the innocent, Victor embodies the virtues of a true hero. His unwavering loyalty to the Empire and his firm belief in the Emperor’s vision for a brighter, more prosperous future drive him forward. A paragon of honor, integrity and courage, Victor is unafraid of telling hard truths for the greater good of the country, the people and the Empire he loves deeply.</li><li><strong>Zana</strong> – A natural born leader with extraordinary superhuman abilities, Zana joined GLIMMER upon understanding the oppressive nature and formidable power of the Empire. Now a vital member of the organization, she constantly strives for excellence and manages to display strength, calm and pure emotional control, even when challenged with terrible adversity. Preferring to work alone, Zana often keeps others at arm’s length, making her seem cold and distant, and carefully considers her next move before acting.</li></ul><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Fight for Everything</strong> – Simple to grasp, challenging to perfect.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tempest-rising-review-multiplayer.1177029/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/tempest-rising-review-multiplayer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">There's some rising left to be done in the amount of maps, factions, and modes available.</h2></div><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Note: This review specifically covers the multiplayer mode of Tempest Rising. For thoughts on the story mode, check out the </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tempest-rising-review-single-player-campaign">Tempest Rising single-player campaign review</a><em>.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The problem with Tempest Rising's multiplayer is that while it's perfectly competent at recreating a slice of the old Command &amp; Conquer multiplayer with a pair of new and interesting factions, it's just that: a slice, rather than the whole pie. With only two factions, nine maps, and the most basic of options for customizing its two or four-player matches, just about everything here screams "minimum viable product." Combine that with the fact that Tempest Rising doesn’t aspire to be anything more than a revival of C&amp;C’s gameplay, and there's not a tremendous amount to get excited about. It may well expand over time – such as whenever the Veti faction arrives – but like a vehicle factory that's only half built, it won't be super useful until you're certain you'll have enough harvested Tempest in the bank to complete it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I could try to comment on unit balance, but like with any fresh-out-of-the-gate multiplayer game, anything I say will almost certainly soon be obsolete. My anecdotal experiences with the community's apparent preference for GDF over Dynasty, probably thanks to their self-replenishing drone swarms, is likely to either be nerfed in a patch within a week or proven completely wrong. Soon, I'm sure someone way smarter than I am will figure out a devastating counter that reduces the seemingly unbeatable (and admittedly pretty cool) strategy of loading Skycrane transport helios with drone operating infantry to automatically barrage anything in range to a garbage-tier strategy for fools.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So I'll leave that to the folks who are busily hashing out the best build orders and counter strategies for the unique characteristics of each faction, which are mostly remixes of C&amp;C ideas with a few twists to get a hang of. I’m a big fan of the Dynasty’s Scrap Trucks, which let you quickly unfold a vehicle-repairing turret anywhere on the map and start plopping down structures that you can pre-construct at your con yard. Naturally, there's no end to the opportunities for showing off your micromanagement skills by deftly controlling the transforming Trebuchet tanks, picking targets for your long-range artillery and airborne units to clear the way for flamethrowers and armor, activating special abilities to disable groups of enemies and leaving them vulnerable, laying mines, scouting, calling in support abilities, etc. – all while building and protecting your own resource economy and climbing the tech tree.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Because of Tempest Rising's retro style and adherence to time-tested tech trees I've found it instantly familiar and easy to slip back into old habits; I've been enjoying going back to the classic engineer-rush where I steal the enemy's construction yard out from under their noses while a handful of infantry distracts them from the opposite flank. (That'll only work for a short while after launch, so I'm getting that trollish thrill while I can.) If it worked in C&amp;C, it'll probably work here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a few features that feel like they're built almost exclusively for the hyper-competitive set, such as the Doctrine tech tree that invites you to dump thousands of precious Tempest credits into upgrades that, for the most part, don't get all that good until you're several tiers deep. Boosting my infantry health by 15%, for instance, doesn't seem all that worth it until I have a <em>lot</em> of infantry in play (as opposed to building more infantry). At my skill level – and probably that of most people who aren't hardcore players – the vast majority of my games thus far haven't lasted long enough to build up the kind of excess cash I'd need to invest in that sort of thing, with most of them wrapping up before the 15-minute mark. But I'm sure that plenty of people will find uses for these to get the upper hand with specific builds, so it's good to know there's more depth to be mined if you put in the time to train up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, if you <em>are</em> a competitive player looking for your next RTS fix, know that Tempest Rising doesn't have a ton for you to play with at the moment. For one thing, if you play ranked, there are only 1v1 matches available. Even if there were 2v2 ranked matches (it's actively being worked on, the developers promise), there would only be three maps available that support four players in teams or free-for-all. 1v1 isn't much better in that regard, with just six options. Combine that with there only being two factions until whenever the Veti expansion comes along – which could be a while given the lack of a published timeline – and it feels pretty slim compared to a lot of the games that inspired it.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Dan's Favorite RTS Games</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There's nothing wrong with the maps that are here – each is a symmetrical layout with areas of high and low elevation, plenty of bottlenecks and alternate routes, all dotted with capturable neutral structures that can give you a "free" (for the cost of an engineer) foothold to build defenses and forward production off of, as well as a few that generate resources. It's simply that there's nothing unexpected – good or bad – at all, and that gives it a very bog-standard feeling. It’s hard to make the argument that Tempest Rising has gone for quality over quantity when there are no big standouts.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Tempest Rising’s multiplayer mode is a better looking but anemic version of the same exact style of RTS multiplayer we've been playing for 30 years. There's certainly value in that, since Command &amp; Conquer’s fast-paced strategic action still holds up as well as ever, and matches are quick and tense when you’re up against an evenly skilled opponent. It may be a minimum viable product with only two factions and a handful of maps, but it is viable, and it remains a good time to duke it out as GDF and Dynasty with others or bots.</p></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3><div><h3 data-cy="object-review-title">Tempest Rising Review - Multiplayer</h3><div data-cy="review-content"><p>okay</p><p>Tempest Rising's multiplayer mode replicates the thrills of old-school Command &amp; Conquer-style RTS gameplay, but with just a couple of factions and a handful of maps there's not much meat on its bones.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
A year after laying off five percent of its workforce - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-announces-further-lay-offs-this-time-likely-to-affect-around-670-employees">impacting 670 employees</a> - EA has reportedly cut more than 300 additional jobs, as  part of what it called "select changes" at the company. The move has also seen the publisher cancel a number of in-development projects, said to include a new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a> game.
</p>
<p>
EA's latest round of layoffs was <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-29/electronic-arts-lays-off-hundreds-cancels-titanfall-game">initially reported by Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>, who - citing a source "familiar with the cuts" - claimed "between 300 and 400 positions" had been eliminated. Around 100 of those cuts were said to have been made at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> and Star Wars Jedi studio <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/respawn-entertainment">Respawn Entertainment</a>.
</p>
<p>
An EA spokesperson confirmed layoffs had been made in a statement shared with Bloomberg, writing, "As part of our continued focus on our long-term strategic priorities, we've made select changes within our organisation that more effectively aligns teams and allocates resources in service of driving future growth."
</p>
<p>
A <a href="https://x.com/Respawn/status/1917267367144423543">follow-up statement from Respawn</a> acknowledged it had made some "targeted team adjustments", specifically impacting its Apex Legends and Star Wars Jedi teams. "These decisions aren't easy and we are deeply grateful to every teammate affected," it added. The studio also confirmed it had "made the decision to step away from two early-stage incubation projects".
</p>
<p>
Bloomberg reports one of these projects, codenamed R7, was an extraction shooter set in the Titanfall universe. It seems likely this is the same Titanfall project - lead by Titanfall 1 &amp; 2 director Steve Fukuda - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/titanfall-director-reportedly-making-new-titanfall-game-thats-not-titanfall-3">confirmed to be in early development</a> at the start of 2024. Notably, this is the second Titanfall project cancelled by EA in recent years; an Apex/Titanfall crossover, dubbed Titanfall Legends, was reportedly canned in 2023.
</p>
<p>
"Looking ahead," Respawn's statement continued, "our commitment to player-first experiences remains unchanged... For Apex Legends, that means not just delivering competitive, innovative seasons - but expanding what Apex can be." The studio also highlighted its continuing work on the next Star Wars Jedi game, saying it was "aiming to raise the bar again for storytelling and gameplay."
</p>
<p>
Today's layoffs mean EA has now laid off more than 1800 employees <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-laying-off-6-of-its-workforce-as-part-of-restructuring">since March 2023</a>. Despite that figure, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-top-execs-earned-60m-in-last-fiscal-year-despite-company-layoffs">company's top executives earned $60m in the fiscal year 2024</a>, $25.6m of that going to CEO Andrew Wilson.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/electronic-arts-respawn-titanfall-layoffs-andrew-wilson-pay<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-cuts-around-300-roles-including-roughly-100-at-respawn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a very normal day</a>. Nothing is amiss. But just for fun, let’s have a gander at the most recent available information on how much EA execs, like CEO Andrew Wilson, are making.&nbsp;</p><p>Now admittedly, these numbers come from <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000712515/f0be0a59-dd50-4247-b36e-0513336b6c1f.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA’s 2024 proxy statement</a>, the 2025 version of which is just around the corner, so they might be a little out of date. Still, I think they’re useful a) as a point of comparison to workers in less vaunted positions and b) because they’re from a time period during which EA <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/28/ea-layoffs-company-to-cut-5percent-of-workforce-or-about-670-employees.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cut five percent of its global workforce</a> – the sort of ripcord a major video game publisher would obviously <em>never </em>pull again, but to liven up an otherwise dull day, why don’t we consider how such a thing does or does not impact executive compensation.</p><p>During fiscal 2024, Wilson took home over $25.6 million via a mixture of a $1.3 million base salary, $20.4 million in stock awards, $3.44 million from a non-equity incentive plan, and around $500,000 in personal security benefits. In the same proxy statement, EA said that the annual total compensation of its median employee was $148,704. If you crunch the numbers <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-execs-earned-60-million-in-2024-despite-layoffs-and-office-closures" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as Game Developer did</a>, you’ll find that Wilson made 172 times more than the median EA worker.&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re wondering how Wilson fared in years where EA didn’t lay off five percent of its workforce, well, those were some real belt-tightening times for the company’s head honcho, who pulled in only $20.6 million in fiscal 2023 and $19.8 million in fiscal 2022, down from $39 million the year prior, <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-executives-blocked-from-received-exorbitant-awards-1844694638" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an “exorbitant” level of executive pay</a> that shareholders ultimately <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-ceo-pay-apex-legends-fifa-battlefield-layoffs-compen-1849078379" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">voted to rein in</a>.</p><p>Here’s what other EA executives made during fiscal 2024:</p><figure></figure><p>Now, as a thought experiment, let’s say that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-29/electronic-arts-lays-off-hundreds-cancels-titanfall-game?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0NTk1MzQ2OCwiZXhwIjoxNzQ2NTU4MjY4LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTVkhVQjFUMEcxS1cwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.Ok9U1G-8KnrQWSRme5JF1VqfCPIxgENs3iq9d32PeRc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">300-400 workers had just gotten laid</a> off as a result of poor sales of games like <em>EA Sports FC 25</em>,<em> </em>as well as longstanding mismanagement of beloved series like <a href="https://aftermath.site/dragon-age-veilguard-mass-effect-5-bioware-layoffs-ea" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Dragon Age</em></a> and, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ea-cancels-single-player-titanfall-apex-legends-game-221552559.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">repeatedly</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ea-reportedly-cancels-another-titanfall-game-lays-off-several-hundred-employees-205008255.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Titanfall</em></a>. Wouldn’t you think one or even a few of these people could stand to take a pay cut in order to prevent such an outcome? Wilson alone, as we’ve learned, is equivalent to 172 employees if we’re measuring in pure dollars, and I’m sure he’s got plenty in the bank.</p><p>Fortunately, this is all hypothetical, and there’s no need to feel any wholly justified, blood vessel-bursting rage about any of it. We are, after all, in the midst of yet another normal spring day.

            <p>
You know, I don't think I'll ever understand why, after finding a huge amount of surprise success, developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/1047-games">1047 Games</a> decided to stop working on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splitgate">Splitgate</a> all so that they could make a sequel. Perhaps that's just part of my general confusion towards live service games as a whole, but I do think it's a bit odd all the same. Still, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splitgate-2">Splitgate 2</a> is still on track for a 2025 release it seems, with a date now set for the game's first open beta.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
As confirmed in a very brief teaser trailer released earlier today, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> will be getting an open beta next month, May 22nd. In terms of content, there will apparently be 25 plus weapons, including the "brand new Borealis, an energy carbine power weapon", 10 plus modes like Takedown, a mode returning from the first game where "teams battle to eliminate all members of the opposing team before they can respawn", and 15 plus maps, including a couple of 24-player Onslaught maps.

<p>
Actually, hang on, scratch that, as both the trailer and a press release notes that there'll be "infinite" maps. The trailer didn't elaborate on that, and the press release said that 1047 "promise to reveal exactly what that means soon." Judging from the trailer itself, and the fact this was a feature in the first game, it'll be a map editor. 
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, that would still mean a finite amount of maps, as just because there would theoretically be a regular supply of them, you could still put an exact number as to how many there are. Perhaps there's some kind of randomly generated map feature instead, I don't know, I realise I'm being very particular about this, I just don't appreciate hyperbole. No details on how to sign-up just yet either, so you'll just have to keep your eyes peeled.

Unlike the dirt you blast off a muddy truck in <em>PowerWash Sim</em>, the mold has a life of its own and will slowly grow back when you’re not spraying it down. Waste too much time cleansing an old bell pepper and that abandoned jar of stuffed olives you bought for those classic martinis you only made once will soon become ensconced in the dusty fungus.</p><p>Currently slated to release near the end of 2025,<em> Moldwasher </em>promises a range of unlockables, various treasures to clean, and lots of different mold types to combat, including mimic, crystalline, and glowing variants. I hope it goes full <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> and adds some slime boss fights, though that might go against the meditative energy at the game’s core, which will include non-AI lo-fi chiptunes. <br></p><p>This isn’t just an idle post on a subreddit showing off a cool mockup. Instead, <em>Moldwasher</em> follows two previous sanitation-inspired games. The first was strategy sim <em>Listeria Wars</em> and the second was the tactical roguelike <em>Staying Fresh</em>, which was<em>&nbsp;</em>about preventing old food in the fridge from turning into zombies. Both have only a couple dozen Steam reviews so far but are positively rated. <br></p><p><em>PowerWash Simulator </em>is getting its own follow-up as well. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/powerwash-simulator-2-dlc-clean-dirt-futurlab-1851773438?_gl=1*k4yvk4*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NTk1NTIyNC41NC4wLjE3NDU5NTUyMjQuNjAuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/powerwash-simulator-2-dlc-clean-dirt-futurlab-1851773438?_gl=1*k4yvk4*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NTk1NTIyNC41NC4wLjE3NDU5NTUyMjQuNjAuMC4w"><em>PowerWash Sim 2</em></a></span> is arriving sometime in the fall with split-screen co-op and other new features.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-kickstarter-tariff-manager-helps-creators-navigate-volatile-trade-environment<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A Kickstarter tariff manager is being introduced. The crowdfunding platform that has given creators of all stripes a chance to bring their projects to new audiences is helping those same creators navigate the volatile trade environment caused by the US government.</p>

<h2>The Kickstarter Tariff Manager Announcement</h2>

<p>The Kickstarter tariff manager was announced in an official <a href="https://updates.kickstarter.com/first-look-the-kickstarter-tariff-manager/" rel="nofollow">blog post</a>. The post states that the manager is part of the platform assisting creators with navigating rapidly changing trade policies. Up to this point, this assistance has included tips on shipping logistics and conveying information to campaign backers. This manager is the first major form of aid that isn't just useful information.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sea-freighter-on-sea.jpg?itok=fxMp-1ZS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sea-freighter-on-sea.jpg?itok=p69J7ZsS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>According to the post, the Kickstarter tariff manager will aid all US-based creators more flexibility, control, and transparency during the fulfillment process of a crowdfunding campaign. This is important because an import fee during this time can lead to disruptions of budget, delayed timelines, and even difficult tradeoffs on what can be delivered.</p>

<p>To this end, the tariff manager can allow creators to introduce a surcharge to backers to cover import costs. This will lead to a separate line item on the backer's payment page. This ensures full transparency to why backers are charged extra after their respective pledge level and shipping fees.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if backers cannot pay these extra costs, the manager will allow them to contact the creator directly and discuss solutions. This can include requesting a refund, adjusting their pledge level, or other compromise agreed upon by both parties. If the campaign in question was just for a TTRPG book however, there's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/ttrpg-books-might-be-exempt-from-us-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a chance</a> it won't be affected by these tariffs.</p>

<p>The Kickstarter tariff manager is another tale in the ongoing story of the board game industry reacting to the trade tariffs imposed by the Trump Administration. The severe costs have already caused the closure of developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/greater-than-games-shuts-down-in-response-to-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Greater Than Games</a>, publisher <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cmon-reduces-staff-and-pauses-board-game-development-amid-us-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">CMON</a>, and online retailer <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/boardlandia-shuts-down-due-to-us-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Boardlandia</a>. The sudden and aggressive implementation of the tariffs have even caused Stonemaier Games to file <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/stonemaier-games-suing-us-president-over-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a lawsuit</a>.</p>

<p>THe Kickstarter tariff manager will be introduced as part of a new Pledge Manager several weeks from now.</p>

            <p>
Remember when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/haunted-chocolatier">Haunted Chocolatier</a> was announced… sorry, hang on, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/haunted-chocolatier-is-the-stardew-valleys-developers-next-rpg">almost four years ago</a>? Cripes, time really does fly when you're waiting on the incredibly anticipated follow-up to one of the most popular games of all time doesn't it! It's no secret that developer Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone is happy to take his time with his next game, and good on him for doing so. However, he also can't help himself but continue to work on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a>, releasing another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stardew-valleys-huge-update-16-brings-new-items-pets-and-progression-and-more-players-in-co-op">pretty big update</a> for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fighting-games">farming game</a> only last year. The good news is that, based on some comments in a recent interview, Haunted Chocolatier is the main focus going forward.

Speaking to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/life-sim/after-getting-stardew-valley-to-a-good-place-with-update-1-6-eric-barone-is-now-fully-focused-on-his-next-game-im-committed-to-not-working-on-stardew-valley-until-im-done-with-haunted-chocolatier/">PC Gamer</a>, Barone explained,"The 1.6 update is pretty settled at this point. There were ongoing console ports and bug fixes, but it's pretty settled now. I'm committed to not working on Stardew Valley until I'm done with Haunted Chocolatier… I think it's in a good place. I feel very solid about it. I think if anyone picks up Stardew Valley for the first time in 2025, I'm very proud of it, and I think they'll have fun with it if they like this kind of game."

Another issue he's facing is his own work, specifically the work he did when he started development all those years ago. "It's been a few years that I've been working on it now and it's like, I look at some of the stuff I did at the beginning and I'm like, 'Oh man, here we go again. I'm gonna have to redo all of this," Barone said. Though, he did note it's not a case of anything being bad, just that given the passage of time he's a "different person" and his "aesthetic sensibilities have evolved."
</p>
<p>
That's one of the fatal flaws of game dev these days I think. How on earth can you properly reflect the artist you are now when it's a project you've been working on for years? A question I'm curious to see answered whenever Haunted Chocolatier does come out. Which, I imagine, is still probably a good while away.

Activision has released a new trailer to showcase a closer look at all three, including all the details packed into the 4/20-inspired variant of Nuketown.</p><p dir="ltr">As shown in the trailer below, there is an in-depth look at all three maps for Season 3 Reloaded. This includes Haven, a brand-new core map set in a large KGB safehouse, and Signal, which is a brand-new Strike map that takes place inside the close-quarters of a submarine bay.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_JtCQeKbB0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8_JtCQeKbB0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The third map for Season 3 Reloaded is Blazetown, a stoner-themed rebrand of the iconic Nuketown map. The trailer shows off so many little details for Blazetown. The houses have colorful new paint jobs, the truck at the center of Nuketown is wrapped in octopus art, and most of the mannequins are dressed in clothing covered with pot leaves. Even the cars are decked out with pinstripes and pot leaves.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, these maps are just part of the content coming to Black Ops 6 and Warzone. Season 3 Reloaded adds Seth Rogen as an operator and 4/20-inspired events and game modes.
