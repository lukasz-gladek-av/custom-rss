			<p>The much-anticipated remake of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a> is here, and much like the Gamecube original, the game is bursting with puzzles, secrets, and some quirky mechanics that new players may find slightly perplexing. Don’t worry though, we’re here to cut The Thousand-Year Door’s more confusing aspects down to size.</p>
<p>In order to kick off Chapter 3 of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door, you’ll need to get yourself a blimp ticket to the floating island of Glitzville, but doing so is a little more complicated than getting to where you need to go for Chapter 1 or 2. This may well be one of your first real “What am I supposed to do?” stumbling blocks in the game, but don’t worry, we have you covered…</p>
<p><em>Note: The following guide contains minor Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door SPOILERS.</em></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd23.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>According to Professor Frankly, you’ll need to talk to Don Pianta on the west side of town to get your hands on a blimp ticket.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd24.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>So, to start, let’s make sure you have access to the west side. There’s a yellow toad blocking your way to the west side, who accuses you of crushing their contact lens. Go to the nearby shop to buy them a new one (talk to the shopkeeper to do so). The shopkeeper will send away for lens and ask you to wait and… you have to do just that. After about five minutes, they’ll send you a mail saying the lens has come in. Yeah, it’s weird, but that’s how it is. Give the contact lens to the toad and you can now access the west side.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd25.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Now, slightly unintuitively, it order to further your quest in the west side of town, you’ll have to return to the east side of town. If you haven’t already, defeat or pay off the guard, then squeeze through this crack next to the Trouble Center.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd26.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>When you emerge from the crack, head through the door to your right. Talk to the gang member Ishnail (the guy with the snail shell). Pay him 64 coins and he’ll tell you to go to the shop on the far west side of town and buy a Dried Shroom and Dizzy Dial in order, then say your favorite color is yellow. By the way, you can actually skip paying Ishnail now that I’ve told you the secret “password.”</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd27.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>So, head to the west end, past the Pianta Parlor, to the shop owned by the ghost with cat ears, Peeka. As previously instructed, buy the Dried Shroom, Dizzy Dial, then tell the ghost your favorite color is yellow.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd28.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>You can then pass through the shop and up the stairs to Don Pianta’s office. He’ll ask you to find his daughter who has eloped with her boyfriend.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd29.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>You can find them down by the docks. Return to Don Pianta after speaking to them (the dialogue choices don’t matter) and he’ll give you the blimp ticket.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd30.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Finally, head north up the central path in Rogueport’s west end and give your ticket to the cheep-cheep.</p>
<p>And there you go – all aboard to Glitzville! Get ready for a fun wrestling-themed chapter!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-guide-how-to-level-up-party-members/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The much-anticipated remake of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a> is here, and much like the Gamecube original, the game is bursting with puzzles, secrets, and some quirky mechanics that new players may find slightly perplexing. Don’t worry though, we’re here to cut The Thousand-Year Door’s more confusing aspects down to size.</p>
<p>Unlike most recent entries in the series, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door is a full-on RPG, with Mario gaining levels in a straightforward manner by earning Star Point XP by winning battles, but what about your various non-Mario party members? How do you improve their abilities? It isn’t immediately obvious and the game doesn’t do a great job of explaining it, but don’t worry, we’ve got you covered…</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd19.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The key to upgrading your support party members is collecting Shine Sprites, collectibles that look like the Shines from Super Mario Sunshine. These are 42 of these in total, spread around the world – usually slightly off the main path, with players often having to use one of their papery powers in order to collect them.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd20.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Once you’ve acquired some of these Shine Sprites, head back to the east side of Rogueport off the main plaza. You’re going to want to go into Merlon the fortune teller’s place – you can tell it by the Shine Sprite symbol outside the door. Trade in three Shine Sprites in order to upgrade your party member. This will increase their HP and give them a new ability.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd21.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Each party member can be upgraded twice, but you can only upgrade them the second time after you’ve completed Chapter 5. At that point, you’ll notice Merlon standing outside his shop. He’ll ask you to find the “Up Arrow” item in Hooktail Castle. Head to the easternmost room in Hooktail Castle with the spikes, and use Captain Bobbery to blow up a cracked wall and collect the Up Arrow from a chest. Bring this back to Merlon and you can now upgrade all your support characters a second time.</p>
<p>And there you go – you should now be able to get the most out of your party!</p>

			<p>The much-anticipated remake of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a> is here, and much like the Gamecube original, the game is bursting with puzzles, secrets, and some quirky mechanics that new players may find slightly perplexing. Don’t worry though, we’re here to cut The Thousand-Year Door’s more confusing aspects down to size.</p>
<p>The new Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door features a revamped, more richly-orchestrated soundtrack, but perhaps you prefer the Gamecube original’s more funky lo-fi sound? Well, worry not, you can switch between the two, but don’t go looking for a toggle in the options menu. No, that would be too easy, and Nintendo doesn’t like to make things easy. You’re going to need to get a specific badge to change the music, so here’s how to do that…</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd15.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Once you arrive in Rogueport at the beginning of the game, head to the main plaza and then the inn. Head up to the second floor of the inn, then go through the door on the lefthand side of the room. This will take you over a small bridge to the semi-hidden “Lovely Howz of Badges.”</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd16.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Unlike in the original TTYD, you can now buy a “Nostalgic Tunes” badge for 1 coin. It’s the one that looks like a little Gamecube, naturally.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd17.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>This badge doesn’t require any Badge Points to equip, so you can freely equip or un-equip it to change between the old and new soundtrack without having to worry about your BP limit.</p>
<p>And there you go – the choice of tunes is now yours! I like most of the new tracks, but some of the classics still stand up better, so I actually change back and forth fairly often.</p>

  <p id="CxPbQQ"><strong>Chapter 2</strong> of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23924972"><em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em></a> focuses on the <strong>Punies </strong>and the <strong>Great Boggly Tree</strong>. While the forest outside the tree is straightforward, the tree itself is labyrinthine, filled with twists and turns.</p>
<p id="1DEnxB">You’ll have to rescue the Punies, who end up following you around, eager to help solve the mysteries of the tree.</p>
<p id="nFgyFT">The Great Boggly Tree can be a nightmare to navigate in <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em>, so we have a walkthrough for you, including how to find all six <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23924922">Star Pieces</a> and four <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23925646">Shine Sprites</a>.</p>
<hr id="wIgrIp">

<p id="w9BpPF">Once you’re inside the tree, take out the X-Nauts and listen to Punio’s conversation with his friends. The other Punies have been kidnapped, and you can’t really progress much through the tree without them, so your first task is going to be to free them.</p>
<p id="Jl706V">Ignore the red door on the right and head into the warp pipe, which will take you up to the second floor. There’s an interesting structure with a star-shaped cutout in the back, but we’ll be back for that later. Keep its location in mind and head up the warp pipe to the third floor.</p>
<p id="kbC3TS">Smoosh the bushes in this room to find a <strong>Power Punch</strong> item. Head up another floor and then <em>another</em> floor to see the jailed Punies in a red and blue cage. Head to the left and you’ll run into Ms. Mouz in a treasure room, where you can grab some loot. Take out the X-Naut inside who drops a <strong>red key</strong>, collect the <strong>Ultra Mushroom</strong>, and then head back to the cages to free the elder Puni. Follow him to the <strong>first room of the tree</strong>.</p>

<p id="0X18L2">The elder Puni will give you the <strong>Puni Orb</strong> and 11 Punies will start following you around, attracted to the orb. Note that Punies will not follow you if you jump off a ledge, but they can fall down ledges when scared or blown away by Flurrie. They will follow you up and down the pipes, though. If you lose any of your Punies, you can also go back to the first room and talk to the elder to get them back.</p>
<p id="OVijfY">Head back up to the second floor and put the Puni Orb in the star-shaped cutout structure you passed earlier. A pipe will appear, leading you down the tree, so grab the Puni Orb out of the indent, and then head inside. Take out the X-Naut and interact with the console next to the red door to have permanent easy access to the first room of the tree.</p>
<p id="UpAjri">Take the warp pipe down and smash the bushes to get a<strong> Thunder Rage</strong> item. There’s also a <strong>Shine Sprite</strong> on the right side of the room.</p>
<p id="xO3UZw">Head back up and place the Puni Orb into this indent to get all the Punies to line up. Then use <strong>Flurrie’s wind ability</strong> to blow them off the platform to the right and into the water below. Keep blowing with Flurrie and the Punies will get swept to the right side of the room. Jump across the platform to the right side and enter the pipe with your Punies.</p>

<p id="SP0jkk">Follow the path and your Punies will get scared by a <strong>Pider</strong>, which you’ll need to be wary of as you traverse the tree. Your Punies may run off the cliff, but don’t worry about them. Beat the Pider and then use Flurrie’s wind ability to move a boulder off of the plane platform. Glide down to the right and land on another plane platform and then glide down to the left to get a second <strong>Shine Sprite</strong>.</p>
<p id="UkSqsp">If any of your Punies were left upstairs when you flew down, there’s a pipe behind where you grabbed Shine Sprite that you can use to pick them up. Head back down and head into the warp pipe in the back right corner.</p>
<p id="oydhXf">In this zigzag room, Piders will drop down, scaring your Punies off the platform, but don’t worry about it. Use Koops’ shell to hit an invisible block under the question mark block to get a <strong>Damage Dodge P badge</strong>.</p>

<p id="TbpXy6">Drop off the platform to get to a room with a save block in it. Hit the bushes nearby to get a <strong>Star Piece</strong> and use Flurrie’s wind ability on the left wall to get to a <strong>secret shop</strong>. Buy stuff (if you want), and then head back out.</p>
<p id="dIwSDR">With your Punies back, head back up to the zigzag platform, and then go to the room to the right. Let your Punies engage in battle with the Jabbies and head into the newly opened room to get the<strong> blue key</strong> from a chest. You know what to do: Head back up all the warp pipes until you hit the jail cell room and free the remaining Punies. You should have 101 of them now!</p>
<p id="1yNXHY">Make your way back to the zigzag room and follow the path with your 101 Punies to enter the left doorway. Again, your Punies will take on a massive hoard of Jabbies, but you’ll need to help them a bit. <strong>Use Flurrie’s wind ability</strong> to assure their victory against the Jabbies, and then enter the newly opened doorway.</p>
<p id="tTa1M5">Head down the pipe, ignoring the Puni structure. In the room with the big stump in the middle, walk behind the pipe to get a <strong>Star Piece</strong>. Go into the next room and use the Puni Orb on the 101 Puni structure — only for it to be a trap.</p>
<p id="kbucOE">Luckily, you can wiggle out of the cage through the bars using ZR. Head into the warp pipe on the right and memorize the symbols you see down there: <strong>sun</strong>, <strong>moon</strong>, <strong>Puni</strong>, and <strong>star</strong>. Hit the black exclamation point block. Before you leave, grab a <strong>Star Piece</strong> from behind the pipe.</p>

<p id="7pnkMY">Head back out and Spin Jump on the wooden platform to drop down to an area with lots of pillars. Fire Koops’ off to the left to nab a <strong>Charge badge</strong>. Jump to the back platforms to get a <strong>Shine Sprite</strong>. Head back up once you have your loot and go to the zigzag room again.</p>

<p id="saUcbI">Go into the pipe next to where the Shine Sprite was and use the 101 Puni device to open another hole in the ground. Drop in to get into a room with a save block. Head to the right room. Put the Puni Orb in the indent for the boss to emerge. You’ll have to escape the tree in a set amount of time, but don’t worry – it’s more than enough time to get out of the tree.</p>
<p id="tjuoMD">Head up the pipe on the right. Take out the X-Naut, but before you leave this room, smush down the bushes for a <strong>Star Piece</strong>. Use the console to open the red door, and head up the pipes until you get to the room where you had to push the Punies into the bubbles. Cross the platform and enter the red door for a <strong>boss fight</strong> against <strong>Magnus Von Grapple</strong>.</p>
<p id="tGLw07">Magnus has<strong> 30 HP</strong> and isn’t really any different from the other enemies you’ve encountered. Its hands will detach, and you can one-shot its hands as long as you execute your attacks correctly.</p>
<p id="puC1c5">Once you’re done with the boss, you’ll get the<strong> Crystal Star</strong> and you’ll be done with the Great Boggly Tree!</p>
<p id="zlH7Hb">There are two Star Pieces you can backtrack in the tree if you want, now that you have the Spin Jump:</p>
<ul>
<li id="5AbTyZ">Go back to the room where you pushed the Punies into the bubbles. Go up the pipe on the left and Spin Jump next to the pipe that’s going up to get a Star Piece.</li>

  <p id="RQJJDI"><em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em> has been remade for the Nintendo Switch, and while there are a few changes, it’s mostly the same game, with a beautiful new coat of paint.</p>
<p id="EsBhe3">If you’re new to the world of Mario RPGs or maybe you remember playing the original game 20 years ago (yeesh!), then we have a handful of tips that are helpful for starting the remake.</p>
<p id="PqVaiQ">Below, we list a few tips to make sure you have an easy time starting out in <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em>.</p>
<hr id="FtE7Ss">
<h2 id="dpp9ip"><strong>Don’t forget to pick up enemy drops</strong></h2>
<p id="Hlpobo">After you beat an enemy, you don’t automatically collect the items from the enemy. Rather, the items will just explode onto the floor where the enemy was. Make sure to actually pick up the coins and items before you skitter off to your next fight.</p>

<h2 id="9utyww"><strong>Investigate everything</strong></h2>
<p id="1YlHBh">Since the game is made of, well, paper, that means most of the décor and environment is flat. There might be a Star Piece or badge behind those paper-thin barrels or that bush in the foreground. You should also smush every bush with your hammer to find items, coins, and other useful things.</p>
<h2 id="1s41Nq"><strong>Don’t dwell too much on seemingly secret paths</strong></h2>
<p id="6NtNzK">See a dog-eared paper covering something but you can’t grab it? Or maybe you see a huge crack in the wall but you hammer isn’t strong enough to smash it down? Don’t dwell on these and come back later. As you progress through the game, you’ll unlock more party members and more abilities that will take care of these things easy-peasy, so don’t bother trying to grab that loose paper now.</p>
<h2 id="b1Nyy6"><strong>Take advantage of letting your partner go first</strong></h2>
<p id="iH8Rdg">While you can control which enemy Mario and his friends jump on, some attacks (like Mario’s hammer or Koops’ shell) can only attack the first monster on the left. That being said, you’ll want to strategize who gets to attack first when you’re against a variety of enemies. Maybe Koops can kill the first enemy with his shell, but he won’t be able to reach the second enemy, who flies and thus dodges his shell — it’s in cases like this where you’ll want to do a little switcheroo.</p>

<h2 id="xu9xdP"><strong>Watch your item count</strong></h2>
<p id="je3sQo">You can only hold a few items at a time and if you try to pick up an extra item, you’ll need to drop or use one of your items to get it. You can deposit extra items in storage via shopkeepers, so make sure to drop off any extra mushrooms or inn tickets that are cluttering your inventory.</p>
<h2 id="S598hE"><strong>Pay attention to that dialogue — or don’t and hear out Goombella</strong></h2>
<p id="Bw0thg">If you caught yourself dozing off and spamming the A button during one of Professor Frankly’s spiels, don’t worry. Goombella will provide hints on who to talk to or where to go next, if you press ZL.</p>
<p id="eEpoM9">While Professor Frankly will typically give you an assist on how to get to the next areas, sometimes impatience gets the best of us. It happens.</p>
<h2 id="ZTcaKj"><strong>Try everything everywhere</strong></h2>
<p id="NVJmco">If you’re stuck in a dungeon in what seems to be a dead end, try <em>everything.</em> Use Flurrie’s wind on everything, try pushing objects around, and hammer everything in the room. Some things, like the aforementioned peeling paper walls and huge Xs on the floor, are more obvious hints as to what to do, but not everything is as simple as it may seem.</p>

  <p id="eWDcSq">As you cross through Petalburg to head to Hooktail Castle in the Nintendo Switch remake of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23924972"><em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em></a>, you’ll eventually run into the <strong>Quiz Thwomp</strong>, who has a plethora of questions for you. There’s also a second Thwomp in Chapter 7 in the X-Naut Fortress.</p>
<p id="r0zXb3">While none of the questions are particularly difficult, some of these answers can be pretty easy to miss if you haven’t been paying too much attention to the story or the stuff around you. The quiz is actually a tiny bit different from the original GameCube quiz, so don’t just answer all willy-nilly.</p>
<p id="y48EXG">Below, we’ve detailed <strong>all Thwomp quiz answers in </strong><em><strong>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</strong></em>.</p>
<hr id="7IgoyM">

<p id="KBtJU0">The questions and correct answers for the Quiz Thwomp are as follows, in order:</p>
<ol>
<li id="XD9jbP">“What’s hidden in Shhwonk Fortress?”<br><strong>Sun and Moon Stones</strong>.</li>
<li id="HoVcDh">“What do one Mushroom and one Fire Flower cost at the shop in Petalburg? Total!”<br><strong>12 Coins</strong>.</li>
<li id="mF8FpE">“What is the name of the mayor of Petalburg?”<br><strong>Kroop</strong>.</li>
<li id="Z2XBmu">“Tell me, now! Where is the Crystal Star?”<br><strong>Hooktail Castle</strong>.</li>
<li id="QnHc7Y">“How can one get from Rogueport to Petal Meadows?”<br><strong>Go through a Pipe</strong>.</li>

Players take on the role of the tree’s caretaker, controlling familiars (golems) and turning the tree into a fortified mobile fortress as they progress on their journey.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Game System</strong></p><p>First, gather resources on the ground. Collect not only materials for construction but also food to satisfy your golems’ hunger, as well as “lost technology” left behind by the past inhabitants of this world.</p><p>You can build various structures on the back of the sapling. Depending on your strategy, you can construct walls to protect its core, weapons to defeat monsters, and rooms for golems to work in.</p><p>However, if you cannot effectively manage your time, resources, the stamina of your golems, and the weight and strength of buildings, the journey to the nursery bed will be a challenging one.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_884225"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>Once you’re prepared, embark on your journey. The World Tree sapling will take the form of a large beast and begin moving.</p><p>During the journey, monsters attracted to the World Tree’s vitality will attack relentlessly. These monsters will destroy buildings and target the World Tree’s core. Use your golems and weapons to fend off the monsters’ attacks.</p><p><strong>Demo Available During Steam Next Fest: June 2024 Edition</strong></p><p>To coincide with the Next Fest event on Steam, which runs from Monday, June 10, 2024, to Monday, June 17, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. PT, a demo version of <em>Ark of Charon</em> will be available starting Thursday, May 30, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. PT.</p><p>The demo offers a comprehensive look at the beginning of the journey with almost no restrictions on in-game content.</p><p><strong>Early Access Version Launches July 9</strong></p><p>The Early Access version of <em>Ark of Charon</em> will be available on Steam starting Tuesday, July 9, 2024.</p><p>Get early access to the game at a discounted price before the full release.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-is-removing-another-pve-mode-saying-it-hasnt-resonated-with-players<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Hero Mastery Gauntlet won't be available starting in Season 11. </h2></div><section><p>Blizzard Entertainment is removing Overwatch 2’s Hero Mastery Gauntlet PvE mode as it felt it “hasn’t resonated” with players.</p><p>The developer <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/overwatch/t/update-regarding-hero-mastery-gauntlet/901366" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>announced the news on its forums</u></a>, explaining the reasoning behind its decision in a statement. Starting with Season 11, the Hero Mastery Gauntlet, a round-based tower defense mode that sees players team up against robots, will no longer be accessible.</p><p>Hero Mastery Solo Courses will remain available as a single-player offering, with more courses promised to arrive in future seasons. You can see the full statement below:</p><p>Hero Mastery Gauntlet launched in March 2024, meaning it will have only been available for around three months before it’s dropped. Although the mode has been criticized by many, some are disappointed not only because it’s leaving so soon, but because it represents another scrapped PvE mode in the history of Overwatch 2.</p><p>In May 2023, Blizzard announced it would <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-pve-hero-mode-canceled-a-difficult-choice"><u>no longer be adding the long-promised PvE Hero mode</u></a> to Overwatch 2. It had been touted as one of the biggest changes for the franchise, which was largely known for its PvP content, since Overwatch 2 was originally announced. Director <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-director-pve-hero-mode"><u>Aaron Keller eventually apologized for the change of course</u></a>, calling the mode an “exciting but gargantuan vision.”</p><p>Overwatch 2 launched in 2022 as a sequel to Blizzard’s original hero shooter. While we enjoyed it upon its release, giving it an 8/10 in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-review"><u>our review</u></a>, the hero shooter follow-up has changed in a few major ways in the last few years.</p><p>Following the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-league-officially-ending-as-blizzard-focuses-on-new-direction"><u>decision to shutter the Overwatch League</u></a> late last year, Blizzard announced that it would <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-actively-working-to-let-all-overwatch-2-players-experience-a-hero-the-day-a-season-drops"><u>make new heroes available to all players to enjoy</u></a> instead of locking them behind a premium battle pass purchase. The company <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-season-10-will-unlock-all-heroes-and-change-how-mythic-skins-are-earned"><u>made good on that promise with Season 10</u></a>, delivering all past playable characters and its newest Damage hero, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-venture-gameplay-trailer-trial"><u>Venture</u></a>, available to all.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The current season runs for another 28 days, meaning you have just less than one month to squeeze out that last bit of fun from Hero Mastery Gauntlet before the co-op mode is gone for good.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/all-resonance-nexus-locations-in-wuthering-waves/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=all-resonance-nexus-locations-in-wuthering-waves<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="245" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Wuthering Waves</em> has a pretty big map, and in the traditional style for this type of game, a lot of it will be dark when you first start playing. The good news is that it will be covered with structures known as a Resonance Nexus to help you out.</p> <p data-characters="426" data-current-count="426" data-injectable="true">The Resonance Nexus is an easy way for you to get additional map information and get a vision of everything you might be missing. It might not sound like much, but it can be very useful in the early game and cut down on a lot of confusion just to understand how this mechanic works. Keep in mind that you can be in an area covered by a Resonance Nexus, and if you don’t have the device activated, the map will stay dark.</p>
 <h2 id="h-all-resonance-nexus-locations-in-wuthering-waves" data-injectable="false">All Resonance Nexus Locations in Wuthering Waves</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Wuthering Waves Interactive Map</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="486" data-current-count="786" data-injectable="true">There will be a total of 11 Resonance Nexus to find when you first start playing Wuthering Waves. These are, essentially, giant server farms that you can visit to download map data about the surrounding area. Each time you find one and interact with it, it will give you the data you seek, and a large portion of the map will become visible. They are also extremely useful as fast travel points and allow you to heal any damage you have taken or revive fallen characters in your party. </p>
 <p data-characters="87" data-current-count="87" data-injectable="false">You can find the Resonance Nexus in the following locations, as shown on the map above:</p> <ul data-found-items="11" data-current-count="527" data-injectable="true"> <li>At Whining Aix’s Mire</li> <li>To the northeast of Whinig Aix’s Mire, on the coast</li> <li>To the southwest of the Dim Forest, on the coast</li> <li>Tiger’s Maw, in the northwest of the area</li> <li>To the southwest of Wuming Bay</li> <li>To the west of Tiger Maw, halfway to the Port City of Guixu</li> <li>Jinzhou, almost directly in the center of the city</li> <li>Far to the east of Jinzhou, on the islands</li> <li>North of the Gorges of Spirits</li> <li>North of the Central Plains</li> <li>South of Desorock Highland</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="332" data-current-count="332" data-injectable="false">These are not the only fast travel points in the game, as you can also access a huge number of Resonance Beacons while you travel the map. There are 68 of the Beacons in total, so they are far more prevalent, but they do not give you the ability to cure wounds or revive fallen characters in the same way that visiting a Nexus does.</p> <p data-characters="562" data-current-count="894" data-injectable="false">Now, when you go and activate all the Resonance Nexus points is up to you, but I traditionally find it very useful just to do this as early as possible. Being able to fast travel to almost anywhere based on the quests, side questions, or just general random stuff that comes my way in a game like this is always useful. If I suddenly need to be halfway across the map to farm some ascension/development materials for a character, I would like to be able to just do it. So, 30 minutes or so spent running around the map early in the game can be a real time saver.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-2024-teaser-leaked-image-black-ops-6/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-2024-teaser-and-leaked-image-very-clearly-point-to-black-ops-6.878868/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-2024-teaser-leaked-image-black-ops-6/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>We’ve been getting numerous hints recently that the reveal of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/call-of-duty-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this year’s Call of Duty</a>, rumored to be a Treyarch-developed continuation of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-2024-gulf-war-rumor-early-access-period-unusually-long/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Ops series set during the Gulf War</a>, is likely not far away, and few more bits of information dropped today back that up.</p>
<p>First up, the reliable Call of Duty experts at <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Charlie Intel</a> revealed the <a href="https://thetruthlies.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">existence of a website</a> featuring what appears to be a teaser for the next Call of Duty (how Charlie Intel found said website is a bit unclear – I have a feeling Activision themselves may have given them a “tip.”) You can check out one of the live-action teasers found on the site below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">BREAKING: The first Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 teaser is here 👀</p>
<p>New website found: <a href="https://t.co/8B9C5QIKur">https://t.co/8B9C5QIKur</a> <a href="https://t.co/JcW4mhTHDh">pic.twitter.com/JcW4mhTHDh</a></p>
<p>— CharlieIntel (@charlieINTEL) <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1793301871429382299?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 22, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>As you can see, the video shows some group making a statement by putting blindfolds reading “The Truth Lies” on the Presidential noggins of Mount Rushmore. Another teaser on the site shows the same group putting up posters featuring an image of the blindfolded Mt. Rushmore. Of note, one of the blindfolds features a wolf-like logo that looks very much like the one Microsoft used to tease a “Direct” that will be broadcast directly after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-showcase-2024-call-of-duty-direct-dated-june/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">big Xbox Games Showcase in June</a>. It’s widely expected this Direct will be focused on the next Call of Duty.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, reliable insider account <a href="https://x.com/billbil_kun" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Billbil-kun</a> has leaked a image of what appears to be Call of Duty 2024’s key art. The image has been intentionally blurred by the leaker, but we can still glean something from it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">🔒 REDACTED 🔒</p>
<p>Call of Duty $S7&amp;5°+/45%86 <a href="https://t.co/02AACE67Io">pic.twitter.com/02AACE67Io</a></p>
<p>— billbil-kun (@billbil_kun) <a href="https://twitter.com/billbil_kun/status/1793344752768704797?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 22, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>While we can’t make it out perfectly, the blurred character above seems to be posing in a very similar way to the key art for the original Call of Duty: Black Ops and numerous games in the series since. The orange and gray color scheme also screams Black Ops.</p>
<p>So yeah, pretty much everything is yelling that this year’s game will be Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, or perhaps to follow the naming convention of the last game in the series, Call of Duty: Black Ops Gulf War.</p>
<p>The Xbox Games Showcase and Call of Duty reveal will take place on June 9, so mark your calendars. What do you think? Getting excited for what Treyarch is cooking up?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/23984150/furiosa-mad-max-timeline-movie-continuity<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="NDfSx0">Continuity in the Mad Max movie series is pretty confusing. It might be hard to believe, but the 40-year-old franchise spawned from a micro-budget Australian movie about raiders in a post-apocalyptic wasteland doesn’t actually have the most coherent timeline. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24157385/furiosa-review-no-spoilers-george-miller-anya-taylor-joy"><em>Furiosa</em></a>, the full-speed-ahead latest film in the series, doesn’t clear anything up, although it does have a specific timeline connection to its predecessor, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/5/14/8607723/mad-max-fury-road-review"><em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em></a>. But we’ll do our best to help you understand it.</p>
<p id="4jaX4s">The first important thing to remember about <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/93Nq0">Mad Max’s timeline</a> is that it kind-of-sort-of got rebooted. <em>Fury Road</em>, the fourth installment in the series, was originally planned for production in the ’90s or early 2000s, with Mel Gibson returning to his central role as roving loner Max . However, after numerous delays, and numerous instances of Mel Gibson <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mel-gibson-controversies-timeline-antisemitism-dui-2023-10">being a horrible person in public</a>, the movie got an updated script and a new Max — the much younger Tom Hardy. </p>

<p id="QCq9cr">With the change in actors and in Max’s apparent age, the series had to be changed slightly, too. So <em>Fury Road</em> is essentially set in an alternate timeline from the original movies, where key events happen at slightly different times. In <em>Fury Road</em>’s timeline, the nuclear annihilation of huge portions of humanity happened between the events of <em>Mad Max</em> and <em>The Road Warrior</em>, rather than after <em>The Road Warrior,</em> like they do in the original trilogy. </p>
<p id="JQAwrQ">This feels especially confusing given that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23981365/furiosa-mad-max-trailer-fury-road-anya-taylor-joy-hemsworth-george-miller"><em>Furiosa</em>’s first trailer</a> says the movie takes place 45 years after “the Collapse.” Technically, this means the movie probably takes place a little less than 45 years after the events of <em>The Road Warrior</em>. This doesn’t make a ton of sense when compared to the events of <em>Fury Road</em>, especially if it’s the same Max character.</p>

<p id="j2gvy1">But if you’re trying to square that math either with the events of the original Mad Max trilogy or with <em>Fury Road</em>, let me offer some helpful advice: <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23180299/obi-wan-kenobi-show-age-fictional-character-played-by-actors#:~:text=Why%20does%20Obi%2DWan%20Kenobi,character%20played%20by%20different%20people.&amp;text=You%20see%2C%20Obi%2DWan%20Kenobi,and%20he%20died%20in%202000.">Don’t.</a> It probably doesn’t make sense. In fact, the <a href="https://www.dc.com/graphic-novels/mad-max-fury-road-2015/mad-max-fury-road">comic books that came out since <em>Fury Road</em></a> tried to fit its timeline back into the original trilogy, and never got close to succeeding. </p>
<p id="2UGcIQ">And you know what? That’s OK.</p>
<p id="sEzkuu"><em>Mad Max</em> director, writer, and creator George Miller, in his infinite wisdom, rightly decided with the release of <em>Fury Road</em> that maybe Max is an idea larger than petty grievances like canon and continuity. Max is a myth and a legend, and as Miller himself said, anything that happens to him is just “an episode” in a tumultuous life, with no specific connection needed. As he put it in a press conference for <em>Fury Road</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p id="cpT7Tl">All the films have no strict chronology. It’s probably after Thunderdome, but it’s an episode in the life of Max and this world. It’s basically an episode, and it’s us revisiting that world. I never wrote the story, <em>any </em>of the stories, with a chronological connection.</p></blockquote>
<p id="BZWqWN"><em>Furiosa</em> is no different, and that first trailer said as much in its first few seconds. This is her <em>Odyssey</em>. She’s destined to become a myth, and myths are too important to worry about exactly how the details line up. We know this is a prequel because it deals with her childhood and young adulthood; we know it spans 15 years of her life because she tells us in the movie itself that 15 years have passed since we first saw her on screen. But in terms of exactly how much time passes between the end of <em>Furiosa</em> and the beginning of <em>Fury Road… </em>Miller isn’t concerned with that, and we don’t need to be either.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/akuma-just-launched-in-street-fighter-6-and-fans-have-already-discovered-two-secret-supers<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">We're just not sure how viable they are with 30 seconds of sitting on the ground.</h2></div><section><p>Akuma has been in Street Fighter 6 <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/street-fighter-6-dlc-character-akuma-finally-has-a-release-date-and-yes-his-raging-demon-looks-awesome">for under a day</a>, but fans have already discovered two secret super moves he can use. The catch? You can only use them after his secret taunt - the one that involves Akuma sitting on the ground, chomping on a rice ball for 30 seconds.</p><p>Most characters only have three super moves, but Akuma has a whopping <em>seven</em>, although that includes the two hidden ones that aren't included on the move list. Despite that secrecy, various <a href="https://x.com/FGAnniversaries/status/1793344865176002632" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fans on social media</a> were quick to discover both the hidden taunt and the supers that come with them, which IGN has verified independently. </p><p>As mentioned, it all starts with the secret taunt. To pull that off, perform Akuma's back taunt by holding back and pressing all six buttons, then mash down on all those buttons. That'll lead to a taunt that sees Akuma eating a rice ball, and once he's finished his snack, you can perform the two hidden supers, which you can see below (along with some helpful instructions from my colleague Mitchell Saltzman):</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The first is done by doing two quarter circles back and pressing kick. This one is actually a call back to Kage’s V-Trigger 1 in Street Fighter 5, Rikudo Osatsu. The other one is performed by pressing down, down, and all three punch buttons, and it's essentially his super move from Street Fighter 5.</p><p>That’s not all, though! While in this state, he can also unleash his classic double air fireballs by doing quarter circle back and two punches while jumping forward in the air, and it doesn't even cost meter.</p><p>Although, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StreetFighter/comments/1cy62bu/akuma_has_2_hidden_supers_he_can_use_after_one/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as fans were quick to point out</a>, the moves aren't <em>super </em>viable when it comes to competitive play, as the taunt literally leaves the warrior sitting with his back turned to his opponent for 30 seconds. Still, it's a fun Easter Egg - and, as popular fighting game streamer <a href="https://x.com/maximilian_/status/1793354716753309842" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maximilian Dood notes,</a> it gives Akuma players a way to open Evo matches in the funniest way possible.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If two Akuma players at <a href="https://twitter.com/Evo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Evo</a> start the set with this taunt, the roof will blow off the convention center. <a href="https://t.co/w8BDsKG2Ds" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/w8BDsKG2Ds</a></p>— Maximilian Dood (@maximilian_) <a href="https://twitter.com/maximilian_/status/1793354716753309842?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 22, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>As mentioned, Akuma entered the Street Fighter 6 fray in an update just earlier today, which has led to a spike in interest for the fighting game. According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1364780/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SteamDB</a>, there were 70k players on Steam just earlier today, quite the jump from the 5k-25k that were playing in the days prior to the update. Akuma's a bit of a classic boss for the Street Fighter series, having been introduced all the back in Street Fighter II, so it's little surprise the see fans psyched for his addition.</p><p>IGN gave Street Fighter 6 <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/street-fighter-6-review">a 9/10 a year ago</a>, with Saltzman writing at the time, "Street Fighter 6 is the most feature-rich a Street Fighter has ever been at launch, but even beyond that, it's roster of 18 characters is excellent, the new mechanics revitalize the one-on-one fighting formula, and it absolutely nails all of the little things that make for a stellar fighting game."</p><p><em>Alex Stedman is a Senior News Editor with IGN, overseeing entertainment reporting.

                <p>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom was one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-reviewed-games-2023/2900-4922/" data-ref-id="2900-4922">best games of 2023</a>.

And if you typically buy books from Amazon, you will <em>definitely </em>want to choose the hardcover collector's edition version.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1913330001?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">collector's edition is available for $27 (was $45)</a>, but <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Legend-Zelda-Complete-Official-Standard/dp/1913330036?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the standard edition paperback is currently listed for $43</a>. This is rather peculiar considering Amazon had the standard edition for around $20 at various points last year. What's even stranger is that the standard edition launched with a $30 MSRP. And yet, the price at Amazon for the standard edition has been climbing for several months--and this $43 listing is indeed shipped and sold by Amazon. But you can still <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fhowl.me%2Fcmi4SadIJLq&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fzelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-collectors-guidebook-is-much-cheaper-than-the-paperback-on-amazon%2F1100-6523640%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">grab the standard edition guide for a great price, as Target has it for $18.79</a>.

At the same time, it's certainly possible that the collector's edition version will hover around $27 for months. That said, its all-time low price is only about a buck less, so the chances of "overpaying" at this price are pretty low.</p><div title="6523640 - TotK Collector's Guide Deal" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="2397" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6523640 - TotK Collector's Guide Deal" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1913330001?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/1913330001?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1913330001?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Complete Official Guide (Collector's Edition)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1913330001?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/1913330001?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1913330001?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$27 (was $45)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>This guide features 496 pages and covers everything you'd need to know about Tears of the Kingdom.

What sets this apart from the standard edition is its gorgeous hardcover design, making it a much more premium option than the paperback.</p>                      </div><p>If you don't want the collector's edition, consider purchasing the paperback Tears of the Kingdom Complete Guide from <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FThe-Legend-of-Zelda-tm-Tears-of-the-Kingdom-The-Complete-Official-Guide-Standard-Edition-Paperback-9781913330019%2F2827029499%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fzelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-collectors-guidebook-is-much-cheaper-than-the-paperback-on-amazon%2F1100-6523640%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Walmart</a>. While Amazon has it listed for $43, a third-party reseller on Walmart is selling it for just $19.

All three sport enhanced graphics and gameplay improvements that make them easier to play for modern audiences, while still capturing the fast-paced arena-style shooting and blocky dinos that made them great back in the day.</p><p dir="ltr">The bundle also offers a bunch of other games that originated on the Nintendo 64. There's the mind-bending Forsaken, which is a shooter that gives you full 360-degree movement, and Doom 64, which is one of the wildest entries in the Hellish FPS series--and thanks to Doom 2016 and Doom Eternal, Doom 64 is now an important part of the modern Doom canon.</p><p dir="ltr">Like other Humble bundles, the <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kqzyfj.com%2Fclick-100770772-14555742%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fgames%2Ffully-loaded-nightdive-fps-remasters&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Frevisit-turok-and-other-old-school-shooters-with-humbles-retro-fps-bundle%2F1100-6523654%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fully Loaded bundle</a> offers a "pay what you want" structure. For $5, you get three games--Turok, Sin: Gold, and Blood: Fresh Supply--along with a coupon for 10% off PO'd: Definitive Edition in the Humble Store. Kick the price up to $10 and you'll add Forsaken: Remastered, Doom 64, and Turok 2 to the list. For $15, the bundle adds Powerslave Exhumed and Rise of the Triad: Ludicrous Edition, while $20 gets you everything from the previous tiers, plus Turok 3.</p><p dir="ltr">There's also a charity tied to the bundle, so you can choose to pay more to give a little to Active Minds. The charity focuses on providing mental health awareness and education to young people ages 14 to 24.</p><p dir="ltr">Humble has a few other bundles you might want to check out, as well.

            <p>
Sublime grid-filling puzzle series Picross is returning to Switch this month for another retro-themed collaboration, developer Jupiter this time teaming up with Bandai Namco to release Picross S: Namco Legendary Edition on 30th May.
</p>
<p>
Much like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-an-official-mega-drive-and-master-system-themed-picross-game-heading-to-switch-next-week">2021's Picross S: Mega Drive &amp; Master System Edition</a>, Namco Legendary Edition takes Picross' beloved puzzle action - in which players use number clues to correctly fill in squares on a grid and complete a picture - and infuses it with retro-game theming, albeit this time delving into Namco's illustrious archive of classic arcade titles.
</p>
<p>
30 Namco titles will be represented across a total of 585 puzzles, with the likes of Pac-Man, Dig Dug, Galaga, Xevious, Rolling Thunder, and Splatterhouse all putting in an appearance.

This game is a smaller and much better spin-off featuring comic book-inspired visuals and an unreliable narrator who will sometimes change his story on the fly, which leads to some fun and surprising moments. </p><p>For example, at one point you are attacked by Apache warriors.

It’s great and feels like something that more games should have copied. </p><p>  <em>Gunslinger </em>also isn’t too long. You’ll likely be able to knock it out in a single Sunday afternoon, making it the perfect palette cleanser between recent big games. Plus, while it’s not 60 hours long, it packs a lot of great stuff into its short runtime, including duels, boss fights, a full skill tree, massive gun fights, and a fantastic ending. </p><p>You can currently pick up <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/204450/Call_of_Juarez_Gunslinger/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/204450/Call_of_Juarez_Gunslinger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Call of Juarez: Gunslinger </em>on Steam for just $1.50</a></span>! That’s practically nothing, and this creative FPS is worth it. Even better, <em>Gunslinger </em>runs like a dream on Steam Deck. (Some players have reported issues with the cutscenes, but I didn’t notice that when I played.) The sale’s set to run through the end of May, so get it while the gettin’s good.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

If you love Spiderman action figures, Marvel legends, or the Avengers- you need this 1-4 player game for ages 14 and up.</p></div></div>
<p>Marvel United is a rules-light and affordable adventure game that works superbly for nearly any age. Each player takes on the role of a unique superhero and work together to thwart a villain and their henchmen. Heroes are fueled by their deck of action cards, with players utilizing these cards to activate various locations around a city, beat down minions, and confront the main rival. While there are a series of Marvel United titles and many product options, the best starting point is the recently released Spider-Geddon set. This offers a large amount of content with an intriguing set of heroes and adversaries.</p><h3 id="anchor2">Marvel: Crisis Protocol</h3><div id="198422"><p><h3>Atomic Mass Games Marvel: Crisis Protocol Earth's Mightiest CORE Set</h3></p><div><p>"Unleash the power of 13 all-new miniatures, featuring legendary characters like Captain America and Ultron, to assemble your dream team from the Marvel Universe."</p></div></div>
<p>Ever wonder what it would be like to play Warhammer 40,000 but with Marvel heroes instead of Space Marines? Marvel: Crisis Protocol is the answer. This is a heavily detailed miniatures game that requires players to assemble figures. You can dive deep into this hobby, painting each character with painstaking precision, as well as constructing buildings and elements of terrain to fight over. The ruleset is splendid as it focuses primarily on small teams of mixed heroes. Each character is distinct with their own suite of abilities and powers. It’s a dynamic and exhilarating game with a wonderful flow. For a more thorough look, you can read our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-crisis-protocol-earths-mightiest-core-set-board-game-review"><u>review of Marvel: Crisis Protocol.</u></a></p><h3 id="anchor3">Marvel Champions </h3><div id="198423"><p><h3>Fantasy Flight Games Marvel Champions: The Card Game</h3></p><div><p>"Join forces as Marvel's iconic heroes and thwart the schemes of powerful villains."</p></div></div>
<p>This fully cooperative card game has players wielding unique decks for superheroes such as Captain Marvel, Spider-Man, and Black Panther. Each hero has a number of specific ability cards representing their various powers in combination with a central character card that can flip between their hero persona and their alter ego. Players manage their hands and decks in order to dish out damage against a central antagonist such as Rhino or Ultron. The villain, which is controlled entirely by a personal deck of cards, pursues their own agenda to threaten the innocent and achieve world domination. For those that are particularly smitten with this title, you can expand your collection with dozens of additional hero packs and larger expansion boxes.    </p><h3 id="anchor4">Marvel: Remix</h3><div id="198424"><p><h3>WizKids Marvel: Remix</h3></p><div><p>"Create an epic battle with a hand of cards in Marvel: Remix."</p></div></div>
<p>As the smallest game on this list, Marvel Remix is a tidy card game that can be tossed in a bag and taken nearly anywhere. This competitive design has players trying to assemble a hand of heroes, villains, locations, and items. Each card has various symbols that interact with other cards, as well as its own scoring condition. With deft play you can build a hand with several intersecting combinations that yield enormous point gains. Since you only make your way through a portion of the deck and there are a wide range of creative synergies, this little game beckons continual play and exploration. </p><h3 id="anchor5">Marvel Dice Throne</h3><div id="198425"><p><h3>Dice Throne Inc. Marvel Dice Throne</h3></p><div><p>"Suit up for battle in Marvel Dice Throne - a game of intriguing dice, tactical card play, powerful Marvel heroes, and unique abilities."</p></div></div>
<p>Dice Throne is the successful competitive dice battler that has been kicking since 2018. Just recently the series made the jump to Marvel, featuring heroes such as Black Widow, Captain America, and Thor. Each character has their own set of dice and abilities, and players take turns rolling their dice and assigning the results to their various unique powers. The goal is to deal enough damage to defeat your opponent in this quick and clever head-to-head bout. While play is streamlined and relatively uniform, the asymmetric playstyles for each hero encourage experimentation and add just enough texture to maintain long-term interest. There are some truly empowering moments when you manage to roll your special finishing maneuver and unleash maximum power.</p><h3 id="anchor6">Marvel Zombies - A Zombicide Game</h3><div id="198426"><p><h3>CMON Marvel Zombies - A Zombicide Game</h3></p><div><p>"Enter the gripping world of "Marvel Zombies" in this thrilling Zombicide game adaptation, where even the mightiest heroes have succumbed to the relentless zombie plague."</p></div></div>
<p>Zombicide is the popular miniature heavy cooperative survival game where players fight the dead while seeking to accomplish various scenario-specific objectives. Marvel Zombies shifts the series to the popular Marvel storyline where an infection has spread and the heroes have begun to turn into powerful undead legions that crave flesh. Beyond the naturally slick adaptation of the Marvel property to this series, this game flips the traditional Zombicide script by having players take on the role of superhero zombies hunting humans. It features an entirely new hunger mechanism while pushing gameplay into several distinct directions that changeup the formula. This may very well be the best Zombicide yet, as its crammed full of wonderful ideas and shining Marvel miniatures.</p><h3 id="anchor7">Marvel D.A.G.G.E.R.</h3><div id="198427"><p><h3>Fantasy Flight Games Marvel D.A.G.G.E.R.</h3></p><div><p>Join forces with up to 5 players in Marvel D.A.G.G.E.R., a thrilling cooperative board game where iconic Marvel heroes team up to battle nefarious forces threatening the world.</p></div></div>
<p>D.A.G.G.E.R. stands for “Defense Alliance for Global and Galactic Response”, and this is the organization that players are affiliated with this in globe-spanning adventure game. The scope here is larger than any other title on this list, as players travel around the world to put out fires and confront enemies. Villains terrorize cities and launch evil machinations for greater purpose, and heroes such as Daredevil, the Hulk, and Elektra must do everything within their power to shut it down. This is a lengthy game, but it’s one with scope that provides for a more epic adventure with many ups and downs. It delivers a fully realized vision of characters responding to threats and traveling to various regions in order to thwart evil. There is a real sense of being overwhelmed and having to triage threats in order to stay ahead of the curve and prevail.  </p><h3 id="anchor8">Unmatched: Marvel </h3><div id="198428"><p><h3>Restoration Games Unmatched: Marvel</h3></p><div><p>"Redemption Row brings three of Marvel’s most tortured heroes into the arena."</p></div></div>
<p>The Unmatched series is a collection of games that pit fighters against each other in head to head bouts. Think Street Fighter on a tabletop, except it trades out Ryu and Ken for heroes of all different time periods and properties. There are sets that feature mythic and literary figures such as King Arthur or Alice from Alice in Wonderland, and there are also sets that highlight pop culture characters such as Grant from Jurassic Park or even Ghost Rider. Yes, there is an entire suite of Marvel characters spread across several products, allowing players to wield icons such as Moon Knight, Spider-Man, and Black Widow. The game itself is smooth and simple as each character is fueled by a deck of asymmetric cards that represent their unique attacks and powers. In just 20 minutes, two participants can square off and beat the heck out of each other utilizing a simple and rewarding ruleset. Over multiple plays you can come to understand the nuance of these characters, just as if you were learning a moveset while playing an electronic fighting game. This is a fantastic, inexpensive product line that is entertaining and lean.</p><h3>Splendor: Marvel</h3><p>The original Splendor is one of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-engine-building-board-games">best engine building board games</a>, so it makes perfect sense to give it an even more popular makeover with the Marvel brand. In this version, players are collecting infinity stone tokens that they can spend to add Marvel characters to their growing band, trying to stop Thanos from taking over the universe. Each character you add serves as one or more stones against future purchases, so it’s very much a game of trying to build the most effective hero-engine to acquire the last cards and stones that you need to push past the victory criteria before your opponents. Easy to lean but with plenty of challenge to enjoy and with enough differences to the original to please fans of that, it’s hard to go wrong with this reskinned classic. </p><h3>Infinity Gauntlet: A Love Letter Game</h3><div id="200954"><p><h3>Infinity Gauntlet: A Love Letter Game</h3></p></div><p>Another classic game reskinned with an infinity stone theme, this one takes the bluffing game of courtly courtship Love Letter and turns it on its head, with players assigning heroes to fight Thanos. In a major gameplay change, however, this is a one versus many game, with one player taking the role of The Mad Titan and the others assembling superheroes to try and thwart their evil plan. Thanos has their own deck and can hold two cards, while other players can hold one hero each at a time, and it’s still very much a game of bluff as many card effect revolve around swapping or guessing what the opposition is holding and potentially dealing damage if you get it right. Thanos looses if his life pool is reduced to zero and wins if he can kill the heroes or collect a full set of infinity stones. It’s a smart twist on a winning formula with simple rules, sure to win new converts and please existing fans alike.</p><h3>Marvel Villainous: Infinite Power</h3><div id="200955"><p><h3> Marvel Villainous: Infinite Power</h3></p></div><p>Villainous is an innovative line of games in which players take on the roles of famous villains from Disney franchises, trying to advance their personal plots while dishing out infuriating fate cards on their opponents. Marvel, of course, has some of the most iconic villains of all and this box lets you walk in the wicked shoes of Thanos, Killmonger, Taskmaster, Hela, or Ultron. Each has a unique set of decks and victory goals, meaning the game has considerable replay value as well as strategic depth. There are beginner and advanced versions to make to suitable for different player ages. And best of all, you get the chance to play the bad guy, plotting your path to power and cursing your peers, in a genre of games that’s almost always focussed on the heroes.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

It quickly became the biggest hit of the year so far, turning into both a sales juggernaut and a cultural phenomenon.

Months later, co-founder Johan Pilestedt maintains the Sweden-based team of over 100 has no plans of becoming another cog in the first-party PlayStation machine. </p><div data-video-id="196395" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Co-Op Bug Blasting And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="80" data-playlist="196395,196406,192516" data-current="196395"><div><p>The Week In Games: Co-Op Bug Blasting And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21945.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p> “We pride ourselves on being an independent studio,” he told <em>Gamesindustry.biz</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesindustry.biz/arrowhead-games-we-want-to-be-the-next-from-software-or-blizzard&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/arrowhead-games-we-want-to-be-the-next-from-software-or-blizzard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in a new interview today</a></span>. “We have to see what the future holds, but there’s nothing in the plans where we want to be acquired by somebody. I want to see how high we can fly.” Pilestedt also announced today that the studio has hired former Paradox Interactive executive Shams Jorjani to be its new CEO while he moves into a chief creative officer role to focus more on keeping <em>Helldivers 2</em> a top-10 live service hit. </p><p>The two say Arrowhead now has ambitions of being a flagship studio that can rival the best in the world, especially when it comes to the hyper-competitive landscape of online co-op games. “When we were growing up, we really wanted to work at Blizzard, it was one of the bucket list places to work at,” Jorjani said. “I think Arrowhead has the potential to be that.”</p><p>But <em>Helldivers 2</em>'s overnight success has also made it a lightning rod for controversy and assholes.

Almost all games have a bit of toxicity in the community, but with these big numbers you just get so many, so we need to work with the community to get them to self-moderate, give people the tools to speak with each other in a positive fashion, so we can keep talking to the players openly. The more voices being added to the choir does add complexity.</p></blockquote><p>While the Arrowhead executives said the team’s plans are only growing more grandiose, it doesn’t plan to scale up to the size of a full-blown AAA studio anytime soon. It’s also going to slow down the pace of <em>Helldivers 2</em>'s updates so it can maintain quality amid the chaos. “We want to take some more time for this one and potentially between future patches since we feel cadence has probably been a bit too high to be able to maintain the quality standard we want and you deserve,” community manager Twinbeard recently wrote on the game’s Discord. </p><p>It sounds like at least for now, however, players will still be getting new <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-polar-patriots-warbond-ps5-steam-roadmap-1851451513&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-polar-patriots-warbond-ps5-steam-roadmap-1851451513">Warbond battle passes</a></span> on a near monthly basis.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/starfield/">Starfield</a>'s massive May update--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfields-massive-may-update-is-finally-here-check-out-the-patch-notes/1100-6523488/">the biggest to hit the game</a> since its September 2023 launch--arrived last week, introducing tons of new quality-of-life features (like improved scanner function and surface maps) and long-awaited bug-fixes for some of the game's most important quests. The May update ostensibly has it all, from options to tweak combat difficulty to increased inventory space and even improved ship-decorating mechanics.</p><p dir="ltr">As a fan of Bethesda's previous games (and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-expanse-a-telltale-series-review-choices-that-matter/1900-6418098/" data-ref-id="1900-6418098">huge space nerd</a>), I was excited to get my hands on the update and take it for a spin. Disappointed by the state of the game at launch, I'd awaited this update with bated breath, hoping Starfield would finally get the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/cyberpunk-2077/">Cyberpunk 2077</a> treatment and rise like a phoenix from its buggy, underwhelming ashes. Unfortunately, upon firing up the game, I discovered something incredibly disheartening: Rather than drastically improving Starfield's gameplay, the May update instead makes the game's flaws even more evident and introduces new bugs. Later, I stumbled into an even more painful truth: Although the update itself is available free of charge, some of the update's best quality-of-life improvements come with a surprising price--one that players might not be willing to pay.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4306709-sfmad.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4306709" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4306709-sfmad.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4306709"></a><figcaption>Players who take advantage of Starfield's new settings may be unhappy to learn that some quality-of-life improvements come at a surprising price.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4306709-sfmad.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Playing on Xbox, I fired up an old save and immediately proceeded to test out the new surface maps and scanner functions. Functionally, the new three-dimensional surface maps do a fantastic job of helping players get their bearings and allow them to survey a planet's topography without having to physically run around to see if there's anything worth finding on it. The new maps don't exactly scream, "Hey, there's a really cool point of interest over there!" but the 3D details that now appear on a planet's surface map mean players can spot buildings, unusual rock formations, and other details that may indicate the presence of an interesting locale they might wish to explore.</p><p dir="ltr">There are 3D maps for major buildings, as well, which make getting from point A to point B significantly easier when exploring large enclosed areas with multiple floors. Prior to the update, players could only rely on a trail of arrows that would appear on the ground while using the scanner, pointing them in the direction of their current objective. Those guide arrows are still there, and still have a tendency to disappear at random, but players now have more options than simply putting the scanner away and taking it back out again to get them to reappear. The new update's 3D building maps make it much easier to figure out which floor certain destinations are located on, but appear to be available only for large or unique buildings, like the fully enclosed city of Cydonia on Mars. If a player finds themselves struggling to navigate oft-reused structures, like the Robotics Science Facility on Volii Chi, they'll still have to rely on the guide arrows.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4306704-sfsurfacemap.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4306704" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4306704-sfsurfacemap.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4306704"></a><figcaption>Starfield's new surface maps make navigating easier, but also demonstrate how empty the galaxy feels, even on major planets like Mars.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4306704-sfsurfacemap.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The new 3D surface maps work well but also demonstrate exactly how empty many of the game's 1,000+ planets truly are. POIs are still extremely sparse on most planets (even those with large settlements, like Mars), and players are still going to find themselves running for several minutes straight--with nothing but rocks to look at on the way--to get from their landing zone to the undiscovered POIs on their maps. Even with a fully tricked-out Boost Pack and a dose of Amp (which temporarily increases movement speed by 35%), getting around in Starfield remains an exercise in frustration. Traveling from one POI to another on-foot still takes far too long, but on the bright side, Bethesda has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/land-vehicles-are-finally-coming-to-starfield-but-we-dont-know-when-theyll-arrive/1100-6523105/">announced that ground vehicles are finally in development</a>. In the meantime, Starfield's scanner has been updated with a useful new feature: When activated, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfields-biggest-update-since-launch-arrives-on-may-15/1100-6523100/">POIs now pop up on the scanner</a>, allowing players to select them and fast-travel instantly, without having to waste time navigating through multiple menus to do so.</p><p>Unfortunately, there's a downside. Naturally, players cannot fast-travel to undiscovered POIs until the player has unlocked them by first reaching the location on foot. But returning players will likely be displeased to discover that even POIs they've <em>already</em> discovered must be re-unlocked if they want to fast-travel there with the new scanner function. I've already explored every inch of New Atlantis, for example, and while I can still fast-travel to The Lodge and various other locations via the menus on the starmap, those locations are not unlocked for me on the scanner. This also means returning players will be repeatedly bombarded with "New Location Discovered" notifications when arriving at POIs they haven't visited since before the May update, and will obviously not be earning any XP for re-discovering these locations.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4306705-sfscanner.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4306705" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4306705-sfscanner.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4306705"></a><figcaption>Returning players must re-unlock visited POIs to use the scanner's new fast-travel function.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4306705-sfscanner.jpeg"></figure><p>Speaking of XP, one incredibly important detail Bethesda left out of its marketing for the May update is the fact that making use of certain new features can affect how much XP a player earns. One of the best features in the update is the ability for players to tweak things like the difficulty of ground combat vs. space combat from the game's settings menu. Players can even increase the amount of credits that vendors have on them (making repeated trips to sell off stolen goods a thing of the past) and tweak how much weight their character can carry. But there's a price: Increasing your character's carry weight will decrease the amount of XP you gain. Increasing the distance from which you can access items in your ship's cargo hold will have the same effect. Changing your character's carrying capacity from Normal to Increased will decrease the amount of XP you earn by 6%. Upping your carrying capacity to Greatly Increased will cost you 8% of your earned XP. Allowing yourself to access your ship's cargo hold from anywhere will knock off another 6%. Increasing vendor credits from Normal to Greatly Increased decreases your earned XP by a further 4%.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4306706-sfsettings.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4306706" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4306706-sfsettings.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4306706"></a><figcaption>The new settings are great, but the price players pay for using them is rather steep.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4306706-sfsettings.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">With my character's carrying capacity set to Increased, vendor credits set to Greatly Increased, and my ship's cargo accessible from anywhere, I was earning a total of 16% less XP per activity than I otherwise would. But even stranger than that, tweaking combat damage (in space or on the ground) has zero effect on the XP you earn. It seems odd that Bethesda is set on punishing players who want to avoid repeatedly fast-traveling back and forth to access their ship's cargo hold, making multiple trips to multiple Trade Authority locations to sell their goods, or listening to their companions repeatedly complain out loud that they're carrying too much because the game's woefully inadequate default carry capacity means they're constantly finding themselves overencumbered. Why give players the option to play the game their way and then punish them for it?</p><p dir="ltr">Players looking for a challenge will be rewarded, however, as decreasing vendor credits, ship cargo accessibility, and carry weight will increase the amount of XP players earn. But this makes the fact that there's absolutely zero XP penalty for increasing the damage one does in combat (or decreasing the damage enemies can do) even stranger. I tested this by running the "Eyewitness" quest with max player damage and minimal enemy damage--reducing the difficulty so severely came with no XP penalty but did make the battle laughably easy, reducing one of the game's most formidable monsters into a creature roughly as dangerous as a <a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Radroach" rel="nofollow ">Radroach</a>. One wonders what Bethesda's goal is with regard to XP penalties and bonuses.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4306725-sfnekkidminer.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4306725" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4306725-sfnekkidminer.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4306725"></a><figcaption>Many of Starfield's persistent bugs are harmless and hilarious, but others can prove quite frustrating.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4306725-sfnekkidminer.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">On the topic of Radroaches, replaying the Terrormorph questline also revealed that there's still quite a lot of work to be done in terms of squashing the game's many bugs. I encountered naked miners on Cydonia, saw my companions walk around without a spacesuit on planets with no atmosphere while brandishing invisible guns, and had an entire conversation with the back of an NPC's head (it seems the issue with the game's camera glitching out during dialogue sequences is still alive and well). After disposing of the comically feeble Terrormorphs that attacked New Atlantis, I turned around to discover that a vital NPC companion appeared to have been downed or killed in the fight. The option to speak with her was still appearing, but selecting it didn't wake her up, so I made my way back to the UC Vanguard soldiers who I'd left to hold the line behind me.</p><p dir="ltr">Upon striking up a conversation with the soldier who was meant to debrief me, the game entered a dialogue scene, but presented no dialogue options for me to choose from. Unable to exit the dialogue or access the game's menu, I was forced to restart, and upon doing so, discovered the automatic save created when I exited the game had been corrupted, renaming my character to "Dude Mack" and changing her level from 31 to "##." I went back to a previous save, made in the moments after I put down my last Terrormorph, and loaded in to find that the entirety of New Atlantis had become a game-breaking shade of yellow that made it almost impossible to see anything. After restarting the game once again, the save finally loaded correctly, and the mysteriously downed NPC was alive and well.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4306708-sfyellowaf.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4306708" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4306708-sfyellowaf.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4306708"></a><figcaption>Bugs are still alive and well in some of Starfield's most prominent quests.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4306708-sfyellowaf.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Starfield's May update is certainly a step in the right direction, and features like the ability to decorate one's ship in the same manner as an outpost or player home are fantastic. Updates to Photo Mode now allow players to choose from a variety of facial expressions for their character, and they can also change the pose and expression of whichever NPC the player has accompanying them, making photo ops more appealing. The 3D surface and building maps are extremely helpful, as is the new ability to fast-travel from the scanner. But ultimately, Starfield still suffers from the same issues that plagued it at launch, from frustrating bugs to empty planets with little of interest to discover. By far, the biggest issue with the new update is that some of its most useful features--like the ability to access ship cargo more easily, carry more items, and make fewer trips to Trade Authority vendors--come with a built-in punishment for players who dare to make use of them.</p><p dir="ltr">Though Bethesda hasn't shared when players can expect to gain access to ground vehicles for planetside exploration, their addition will hopefully improve the core experience of the game, and one hopes that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-shattered-space-expansion-coming-this-fall-ship-building-update-later-this-week/1100-6523051/">the Shattered Space expansion coming this fall</a> will also add a bit more depth to a game that currently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/starfield-review-to-infinity-but-not-beyond/1900-6418110/">feels a mile wide and an inch deep</a>. I'm still hopeful for the future of Starfield and am looking forward to the new expansion. But after experiencing the game's biggest update yet, I fear that Bethesda's decision to penalize players for making use of sorely needed quality-of-life improvements and persistent bugs in some of the Starfield's biggest quests will continue to negatively impact the game, and I find myself wondering if other features planned for the game might also come with a hidden price. Vehicles are all well and good, but not if I'll have to synthesize my own gasoline to use them, or suffer an XP penalty for daring to cram a few too many <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/someone-made-the-sandwich-from-the-starfield-trailer-and-you-can-too/1100-6493196/">space sandwiches</a> in the trunk when I embark on an interstellar picnic.</p>

<p data-characters="127" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Semi-automatic weapons often get overlooked by their fully automatic counterparts, yet the M16A4 deserves plenty of attention. </p> <p data-characters="567" data-current-count="567" data-injectable="true">The M16A4 requires an abundance of skill and patience to perfect. Instead of firing and forgetting like other assault rifles, the M16A4’s three-round-burst firing type eliminates any margin for error and forces players to be accurate with their shots. When perfected, it will become second nature to take down enemies in two bursts, but in the beginning, there will be plenty of instances where you get punished for missing a shot by fully automatic weapons. That persistence will eventually payoff, as the M16A4 is arguably one of the best weapons in <em>XDefiant</em>.</p>
 <h2 id="h-best-m16a4-loadout-in-xdefiant" data-injectable="false">Best M16A4 loadout in <em>XDefiant </em></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="500" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Barrel: </strong>Rapid Fire </li> <li><strong>Front Rail: </strong>Superlight Grip </li> <li><strong>Optic: </strong>Reflex Sight </li> <li><strong>Rear Grip: </strong>Grip Tape </li> <li><strong>Stock: </strong>Padded Stock </li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="358" data-current-count="358" data-injectable="false">Every second matters while using a burst weapon. The quicker you can aim down sight with the M16A4, the more effective it will be. With that in mind, our loadout focuses on improving ADS speed, rate of fire, sprint speed, and recoil recovery. This set of attachments slightly hinders vertical and horizontal recoil, but not enough to be worth worrying about.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Best&nbsp;<em>XDefiant</em>&nbsp;faction for the <em>M16A4</em></h2> <p data-characters="406" data-current-count="764" data-injectable="false">Choosing a faction comes down to personal preference. Still, the Cleaners provide the best set of abilities to make the M16A4 flourish. To start, the Incendiary Rounds kill enemies faster in short to medium-range engagements, which is perfect for the burst rifle, and the Firebomb ability is perfect for trying to clear off an objective on offense, or weaken an enemy to make them killable with one burst.</p>

Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League might not have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-fails-to-meet-warner-bros-expectations">done the numbers Warner Bros was expecting</a>, but developer Rocksteady continues onward with its post-launch plans, with its imminent Season 1 - Episode 2 update introducing new enemies, new gears, and more.
</p>
<p>
Season 1 - Episode 2 is a mid-season update for Kill the Justice League, and follows the<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-first-season-kicks-off-with-the-joker-this-month"> arrival of The Joker as a playable character</a> at the end of March. As such, it's light on major headline features, but it does bring a few gameplay additions while players wait for the next big update.
</p>
<p>
For starters, The Joker's Elseworld map - introduced alongside the character - is "opening up further". This expanded version adds "tricky" Green Lantern infused enemies - immune to all direct damage until their Constructs have been destroyed - and the new Promotinaut enemy, capable of promoting its allies to their next, more powerful level of mutation.

<p>
Additionally, Season 1 - Episode 2 introduces the new Out of Orbit mission. Here, players must topple corrupted Justice League Watchtowers, which have only partially phased into the world and are invulnerable to attack, by locking their control points so Task Force X can get stuck in. There's an added complication in that enemies can exist in one of two dimensions during the mission and players will need to keep switching dimensions to take them out.

Founded in 2001, the award is gifted to people, products, concepts, or groups that have demonstrated spectacular quality within the industry. Now we have Diana Jones Award 2024 Emerging Designer winners, highlighting new talent in the industry.</p>



<p>According to a post on their <a href="https://www.dianajonesaward.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official website</a>, the Diana Jones Award for Emerging Designer went to four deserving winners. These winners were decided via an anonymous committee of 50 industry professionals, including designers, creatives, consultants, and publishers.</p>

Brander was the creative voice behind 2023's <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/368463/rebuilding-seattle" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Rebuilding Seattle</em></a>, an economic city-building game with a simple ruleset. He is working on a 2025 follow-up, <em>Rebuilding Chicago</em>, and an ambitious co-op roguelike campaign game.</p>

<p>Winner number two is Puerto-Rican British TTRPG designer and project manager Taylor Navarro. Navarro is a Big Bad Con Scholar whose work includes <em>Tales of Sina Una</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/dungeons-dragons"><em>D&amp;D 5e</em></a>, <em>The Seeker's Guide to Enchanting Emporiums</em>, and her own indie project <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/taylornavarro/not-yet-a-romantic-ttrpg-duet" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Not Yet: A Romantic Duet TTRPG</em></a>.</p>

Simpson's career began in videogame development but dove into board game development in 2019. Since then, he has been the co-designer on the award-winning board game <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/368058/the-wolves" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>The Wolves</em></a> and designed <em>A Message From The Stars</em>, <em>Chomp</em>, and <em>Merchants of Magick</em>.</p>

<p>The fourth and final winner is Basil Wright. Wright's design philosophy is to make games that promote community, have a low barrier to entry, and draw magic from the mundane. Their body of work are notably weird entries like <em>Pelogos</em>, <em>You're Naked, Run!</em>, and <em>You Can (Not) Pet The Cat</em>.</p>

<p>All four winners will receive a prize package worth over $6500. The package includes a one-year voting membership in GAMA and an expenses-paid trip to Gen Con 2024.</p>

Those winners include Erlc Lang (<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bloodborne-board-game-review"><em>Bloodborne: The Board Game</em></a>), the board game <em>Ticket To Rid</em>e, and the very concept of actual plays like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dimension-20-gauntlet-at-garden-rolls-dice-at-madison-square-garden"><em>Dimension20</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-beacon-membership-service-announced"><em>Critical Role</em></a>.</p>
