            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/sirius-dice-releases-progress-pride-dd-dice-in-collaboration-with-daniel-quasar-and<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>To celebrate Pride Month Sirius Dice has collaborated with Daniel Quasar, creator of the Progress Pride Flag, and Wizards of the Coast to release a <a href="https://siriusdice.com/products/dnd-progress-pride-dice-set-limited-edition">full set of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> dice that feature the Process Pride Flag</a>. The main catch is that this is an exclusive set of dice, once the 1,500 copies that were created are sold they won't be returning to the store.</p>

<p>In talking about this collaboration Daniel Quasar had the following to say about the importance of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> to their life and the importance of LGBTQ+ representation in the space:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Playing tabletop RPGs has changed my life significantly so getting to experience them from a different perspective has been amazing. My hope with this dice set is that LGBTQ+ players will feel seen, represented and proud as they roll, knowing that someone on the inside is just like them and just as excited to play.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This limited set of dice come with everything from your d4 up to your d20 and cost only $40. For every set of dice sold a donation in the amount of $30 will be made to <a href="https://www.thetrevorproject.org/">The Trevor Project</a>. Assuming my math is correct a $30 donation for each of the 1,500 copies would mean a staggering $45k donation.</p>

<p>For those who may not be aware The Trevor Project is a suicide prevention and crisis intervention organization for LGBTQ+ young people. The organization offers 24/7 services allowing for youths to get access to trained counsellors when they're needed.</p>

			<p>Cyberpunk 2077 continues to be among the best-looking open-world role-playing games released in the past few years, thanks to some impressive mods that push its visuals further in terms of realism, like the DreamPunk graphics overhaul mod.</p>
<p>A new video shared a few days ago by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NextGenDreams" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NextGen Dreams</a> showcases the game running with the <a href="https://www.patreon.com/NextGenDreams" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1.1 version of the mod</a>, which features a complete rework of all weather conditions and lighting, a custom LUT for SDR and HDR, improved ray tracing and path tracing and more. Thanks to the high quality of this graphics overhaul, some of the sequences featured in the video could pass for real-life sequences.</p>

<p>Reaching new levels of realism in Cyberpunk 2077 seems to be the main goal for several modders. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalDreamsyt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Dreams</a> attempted to do so, as seen in a new 8K resolution video, using the Real City Modlist and the latest version of the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/10490" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ultra Plus Better Path Tracing mod</a>, which introduces multiple quality improvements to modes and quality for an improved path tracing experience.</p>

<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and Xbox One. The Phantom Liberty expansion is now available only on PC and current-generation consoles, introducing a new location and one of the best stories told in Night City, as highlighted by Alessio in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/">review</a>.</p>

<p id="6POnTd"><strong>Run time: </strong>2h 9m<br><strong>Director: </strong>Spike Lee<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Denzel Washington, Clive Owen, Jodie Foster<br><strong>Where to watch:</strong> Netflix</p>
<p id="xTIsSL"><em>Inside Man</em> is an undersung classic in one of cinema’s greatest subgenres: the bank heist movie. Starring Denzel Washington at the height of his leading-man powers as a disgraced detective sent to negotiate with a Clive Owen-led group of robbers turned hostage takers, <em>Inside Man</em> is a perfect mix of 2000s bravado. The movie is full of twists and both of its stars getting one over on each other, but like all the best thrillers, it’s not until the final moments that everything comes into place. </p>
<p id="zcfFMU">And while the cast is outstanding, the real star of the show here is Spike Lee, who seems to use this movie to prove that he could be the greatest pop filmmaker of his generation if he wanted to. Few movies can match the raw tension and nervous energy that <em>Inside Man</em> brings to every scene, let alone its high points, like Washington and Owen’s confrontation inside the bank, which feel like a barrage of cinematic magic tricks. All of this leads to one of the most satisfying endings to any heist movie ever, making <em>Inside Man</em> an easy choice for one of the 2000s’ best thrillers. —<em>Austen Goslin</em></p>

<p id="Xn0GOZ"><strong>Run time: </strong>1h 57m<br><strong>Director: </strong>Paul Feig<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Anna Kendrick, Blake Lively, Henry Golding<br><strong>Where to watch:</strong> Netflix</p>
<p id="zfCPL6">Few movies have ever captured the exact feeling of breezing through a summer beach read as effectively as <em>A Simple Favor</em>. Paul Feig’s terrifically fun thriller follows Stephanie Smothers (Anna Kendrick), a mommy vlogger in need of some friends, as she meets the unbelievably cool Emily Nelson (Blake Lively) and her very hot husband, Sean (Henry Golding). </p>
<p id="pJ0vBI">To say more about the movie now would be to spoil one of its dozen or so twists, which would partially ruin the fun. But without giving anything away, <em>A Simple Favor</em> is absolutely delightful in the way it reveals mystery after mystery, somehow finding a new way to get more fun and silly with each revelation. Lively is particularly incredible in the film as a high-society version of Amy Dunne with a way better wardrobe. —<em>AG</em></p>

<p id="rzSdBn"><strong>Run time: </strong>1h 37m<br><strong>Directors: </strong>Joel and Ethan Coen<br><strong>Cast: </strong>John Getz, Frances McDormand, Dan Hedaya<br><strong>Where to watch:</strong> Max, Criterion Channel</p>
<p id="voLCPh">The Coen brothers’ 1984 directorial debut, <em>Blood Simple</em>,<em> </em>is a perfect primer for the darkly comic, eccentrically plotted, idiosyncratic body of work they went on to create. A hard-boiled neo-noir crime thriller set in Texas, the film centers on a deadly love triangle between a bar owner, his wife, and one of his employees. When the attempted affair and elopement inevitably spills over into bloodshed, the would-be lovers are implicated in a tangled plot of money and murder. Frances McDormand shines in her performance as Abby, the dissatisfied wife at the heart of the drama, as does M. Emmet Walsh as Loren Visser, the conniving hitman who throws the whole conflict into turmoil in his own selfish bid for a quick payday.<em> —Toussaint Egan</em></p>

<p id="LCXvIk"><strong>Run time: </strong>1h 48m<br><strong>Director: </strong>Brian De Palma<br><strong>Cast: </strong>John Travolta, Nancy Allen, John Lithgow<br><strong>Where to watch:</strong> Available to rent on Amazon, Apple TV</p>
<p id="obTQmI">John Travolta stars in Brian De Palma’s 1981 mystery thriller <em>Blow Out</em> as Jack Terry, a sound effects technician living in Philadelphia who inadvertently stumbles across a political assassination while recording background noise for a sleazy teen slasher flick. Befriending Sally (Nancy Allen), a distressed call girl and the sole principal witness of the assassination, Jack attempts to unravel and expose the insidious conspiracy behind the killing before the perpetrators can murder her and cover up their involvement. </p>
<p id="mAWhSs">Based on Michelangelo Antonioni’s 1966 film <em>Blowup</em>, De Palma’s film is an inspired contemporary reinvention of an old classic defined by its inventive use of split diopter lenses to achieve focus between foreground and background elements, impressive cinematography that emphasizes the elements of sound design and music inherent to the plot, and a trio of fantastic performances by Travolta, Allen, and John Lithgow as a sadistic hitman hellbent on completing his mission. If that weren’t enough, the ending to <em>Blow Out</em> is arguably one of the most remarkable and devastating of its era, with a twist so well-executed you’ll be left scratching your head in astonishment as to how you never saw (or heard) it coming. <em>—TE</em></p>

<p id="wtiy1Q"><strong>Run time: </strong>2h 6m<br><strong>Director: </strong>Todd Haynes<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Mark Ruffalo, Anne Hathaway, Tim Robbins<br><strong>Where to watch:</strong> Netflix</p>
<p id="pBzhpe"><em>Dark Waters</em> is the kind of harrowing corporate legal thriller we don’t get much of nowadays, and certainly not about real-life stories and cover-ups. The movie follows defense attorney Robert Bilott (Mark Ruffalo) as he investigates the deaths of several cows on a small dairy farm. What he uncovers after that is a massive conspiracy perpetrated by the DuPont company in regard to a toxic forever-chemical called PFOA. After his discovery, Bilott sets off on a massive legal undertaking to hold DuPont responsible for knowingly poisoning thousands of Americans.</p>
<p id="wbElfp">The story itself is nearly beyond belief and scarier than any corporate legal thriller has any right to be. But despite this being mostly a movie about Ruffalo shuffling through boxes and slowly driving by farms, director Todd Haynes (<em>Carol</em>) manages to make every second feel taut and full of conspiracy and danger. —<em>AG</em></p>

<p id="nk15e6">A tightly wound political thriller set during the start of the Somali Civil War, Ryoo Seung-wan’s <em>Escape from Mogadishu </em>doubles as an exciting action movie and a moving plea for the world to move past superficial divisions that prevent us from helping each other.</p>
<p id="pPjUyG">Set in 1991, the movie takes place in a time where both the North and South Korean governments were lobbying hard to be added as United Nations members. The Somali government holds a key vote, so both Korean governments send representatives to make their case. When civil war breaks out, the politicians and their families must find their own way out of the country — but will the group be able to work together, or will decades of generational distrust get in the way of their safety?</p>
<p id="xv1ZSk"><em>Escape from Mogadishu </em>strikes the balance between thoughtful historical film and exciting thriller deftly, and one scene in particular stands out in the latter category: A caravan, fired upon by soldiers, attempts to back its way out of a tight situation, as the camera zooms through each car one by one in an absolutely breathless sequence that will leave you on the edge of your seat. —<em>PV</em></p>

<p id="BPwiFx"><strong>Run time: </strong>2h 50m<br><strong>Director:</strong> Michael Mann<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Val Kilmer<br><strong>Where to watch:</strong> Netflix</p>
<p id="yA49Xh">In an <a href="https://scrapsfromtheloft.com/movies/michael-mann-the-making-of-heat/">interview with Empire published 12 years after the film’s release</a>, Michael Mann described his 1995 masterpiece <em>Heat</em> not as a heist thriller, but as a “symphonic drama,” an opera of heightened emotions centered on two men whose single-minded obsessions put them at odds not only with one another and their respective sides of the law, but the people who otherwise love and care about them. <em>Heat </em>is not only that, it is also indisputably one of the greatest movies of the ’90s, featuring two career-best performances from the legendary Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. </p>
<p id="c0411J"><em>Heat</em> is... well, an absolute heater of a movie. It’s a masterful thriller clocking in at nearly 3 hours, and yet every minute feels consequential and moving. The story of Neil McCauley (De Niro), a career thief and his cat-and-mouse battle against LAPD Lt. Vincent Hanna (Pacino) is an explosive epic bursting with gunfire that rattles like percussion instruments and pensive silences that pronounce emotional intensity too complex to express through words alone. If you have never seen <em>Heat</em> before, now is the opportunity to correct that error, and even if you have seen it already, I guarantee you’re well overdue for a rewatch. <em>—TE</em></p>

<p id="Ccglwj">A career-making hit for Park Chan-wook (<em>Oldboy</em>, <em>The Handmaiden)</em>, <em>JSA </em>is a mystery about a murder on the border between the two Koreas. Swiss Army Major Sophie E. Jean (Lee Young-ae) is sent to the Demilitarized Zone to investigate an incident on the border that left two North Korean soldiers dead and one South Korean soldier (Lee Byung-hun) wounded. After the wounded South Korean soldier confesses to the killings, the investigator gets conflicting reports from the two sides about what happened. At times funny, joyful, crushing, and pensive, <em>JSA </em>cuts right through to the human stakes of the maintenance of borders and government conflicts. —<em>Pete Volk</em></p>

<p id="tSmuPp">John Cassavetes’ 1976 neo-noir thriller is one of the finest works by one of the masters of American independent cinema. The movie follows a nightclub owner (Ben Gazzara, in a stunningly good performance) who gets in way over his head and is asked to kill somebody to pay off his gambling debts. A rich character study with an all-timer lead performance, stunning use of tinted frames to bring out color, and Cassavetes’ cunning eye for group dynamics, <em>The Killing of a Chinese Bookie </em>is a high mark of 1970s American filmmaking. —<em>PV</em></p>

<p id="oShUWc">Jean-Pierre Melville’s hugely influential neo-noir is a meticulously paced, slow-burn crime thriller. Quiet hitman Jef (played by all-time great movie star Alain Delon in one of his most memorable roles) gets pulled into a tough situation when he’s spotted after killing a target. Soon, Jef is not just on the run from the police, but from other figures in the organized-crime underworld.</p>
<p id="RdGpa8"><em>Le Samouraï </em>is one of the purest distillations of “cool” ever seen in movies, and has been cited by filmmakers like John Woo, Jim Jarmusch, and Johnnie To as influences on their work. —<em>PV</em></p>

<p id="Wnx4TF">This 92-minute thrill ride is one of many stellar French crime thrillers on Netflix. In it, Lino (former stunt man Alban Lenoir) is an expert mechanic who has been forced to work for a group of dirty cops. When he’s framed for murder, Lino has to find the one thing that can prove his innocence: a lost bullet in a missing car. With high-octane action sequences and great car stunts, director Guillaume Pierret executes a simple premise to perfection. The sequel, also on Netflix, is just as good (if not better). <em>—PV</em></p>

<p id="GYLp0m">Fritz Lang’s 1931 thriller <em>M</em> is widely considered arguably his magnum opus — second perhaps only to his seminal 1927 sci-fi epic <em>Metropolis </em>— but also one of the greatest films of all time. Set in Berlin, the film follows the investigation of a psychotic child murderer whose reign of terror has plunged the city into a fit of hysteria and suspicion. As the criminal underground of Berlin find the noose tightening around them in the police’s unsuccessful campaign to capture him, they take it upon themselves to root out this evil and bring him to justice. <em>—TE</em></p>

<p id="5Dho9n"><strong>Run time: </strong>2h 5m<br><strong>Director: </strong>John Schlesinger<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Dustin Hoffman, Laurence Olivier, Roy Scheider<br><strong>Where to watch:</strong> Prime Video, Paramount Plus, MGM Plus</p>
<p id="7Hli8O">John Schlesinger’s 1976 thriller <em>Marathon Man</em> is perhaps best remembered for one scene in particular, wherein Dustin Hoffman’s character, Thomas “Babe” Levy — a New York graduate student writing his thesis on American fascism — is brutally tortured by an elderly Nazi war criminal with dentistry tools, all while being asked, “Is it safe?” The whole movie is worth witnessing in full, with a byzantine conspiracy involving devious assassins, undercover government agents, a hidden cache of stolen diamonds, and a hapless layperson thrown into the mix by a whim of unfortunate circumstance. Aside from possessing one of Hoffman’s most iconic roles, <em>Marathon Man</em> is a taut, nail-biting film that withstands the test of time as thoroughly entertaining thriller. <em>—TE</em></p>

<p id="mX8EoP"><strong>Run time: </strong>1h 32m<br><strong>Director: </strong>Charles Laughton<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Robert Mitchum, Shelley Winters, Lillian Gish, Billy Chaplin<br><strong>Where to watch:</strong> Prime Video, Tubi, Pluto TV</p>
<p id="oMcELu">The sole film directed by actor Charles Laughton,<em> The Night of the Hunter</em> is hailed by many as one of the most masterful stories ever committed to the screen. At the heart of the movie’s enduring legacy is Robert Mitchum’s iconic performance as Harry Powell, a misogynistic serial killer with a flair for silver-tongued theatricality. Centering initially on Powell’s plot to romance a gullible widow and uncover the whereabouts of a stolen cache of $10,000, the film later unfolds into an odyssey across a rich expanse of stark, silhouetted environments, as the widow’s children desperately attempt to elude the mad preacher’s murderous intent. If you’re looking for a classic thriller with beautiful imagery, a moving score, and memorable performances, <em>The Night of the Hunter</em> boasts all those in ample amount. <em>—TE</em></p>

<p id="YC8sbm"><strong>Run time: </strong>3h 0m<br><strong>Director: </strong>Sukumar<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Allu Arjun, Fahadh Faasil, Rashmika Mandanna<br><strong>Where to watch:</strong> Prime Video</p>
<p id="KHEup4">This Telugu crime thriller tells the origin story of Pushpa, a gangster who rises up the ranks of a smuggling syndicate that exports red sandalwood, a rare lumber that only grows in South India, overseas. A movie inextricably linked to the globalization of labor, <em>Pushpa</em> opens with an animated sequence depicting how the lumber got to Japan as part of a wedding present, told in reverse. It’s a fascinating way to start the movie, and it immerses you directly into the story and the struggle of the laborers who harvest this rare commodity.</p>
<p id="Nx4bvR">Pushpa (Allu Arjun) is one of these laborers, but he is one of a kind. Uniquely laid back and with enough confidence in himself to ignore any and all authority figures, Arjun brings a vibe to the character that can best be summarized as “the coolest cat around.” While he may not be super smooth around the woman he pines for (Rashmika Mandanna), Pushpa is savvy enough with his brains and with his fists to quickly move up the ladder of the syndicate. But when the unsavory figures at the top of the criminal organization start to feel threatened by his rise, Pushpa has to use all his wits and strength to prevail. A beautiful movie with bright colors, hard-hitting action sequences, and fun musical numbers, <em>Pushpa </em>is one of the coolest gangster thrillers in recent memory. —<em>PV</em></p>

<p id="UyzrGH">A standout low-budget Antonio Banderas vehicle, <em>Security </em>is a 2017 action thriller where Banderas plays a retired Marine Corps delta captain who gets hired as the new security guard at a mall. When a young girl being chased by armed mercenaries (led by Ben Kingsley) takes shelter in the mall, Banderas must use all the training at his disposal to protect her. With great action sequences, a strong lead performance by Banderas, and an economical 92-minute running time, <em>Security </em>is one of the stronger action thrillers available on Netflix. —<em>PV</em></p>

<p id="8g0SqO"><strong>Run time: </strong>1h 57m<br><strong>Director: </strong>Thomas M. Wright<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Joel Edgerton, Sean Harris, Jada Alberts<br><strong>Where to watch:</strong> Netflix</p>
<p id="hNiwCZ">Based on a true story, Thomas M. Wright’s Australian psychological crime thriller stars Sean Harris as Henry Teague, an aloof day laborer with a sordid past who, by way of an acquaintance he meets on a long distance bus ride, meets and begins to work for Mark (Joel Edgerton), a criminal with ties to a much larger crime syndicate in West Australia. Parallel to this is the largest organized police manhunt in the country, one which may or may not have its sights set on Henry and his employers. Things get a little more complicated than that, but then — why spoil the surprise, eh?</p>
<p id="cDtQT9">Wright’s film is packed with dark, subliminal imagery; whole sequences that play out with seemingly mundane detail before quickly morphing into fugue-like nightmares. Edgerton and Harris both deliver exceptional performances, as does Jada Alberts in her role as a dogged Senior Constable determined to bring Teague to justice by any means available. Between the gorgeous cinematography and bracing minimalist score, <em>The Stranger</em> is a no-brainer pick for one of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23402426/best-thrillers-watch-netflix-streaming-movies">best thrillers available to stream on Netfli</a>x. <em>—TE</em></p>

<p id="vCon3K"><strong>Run time: </strong>2h 9m<br><strong>Director: </strong>Park Chan-wook<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Song Kang-ho, Shin Ha-kyun, Bae Doona<br><strong>Where to watch:</strong> Tubi, Plex</p>
<p id="l2294c"><em>Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance </em>is the first in Park Chan-wook’s Vengeance trilogy, a group of three standout films (including 2003’s <em>Oldboy</em>) that are linked in theme but not in characters or plot. In <em>Mr. Vengeance</em>, a deaf factory worker (Shin Ha-kyun) makes a deal with black market organ sellers to exchange his kidney for one that could be used for his sick sister. When the organ sellers run away with his kidney, he acts on the advice of his girlfriend (Bae Doona) and kidnaps the daughter of his former boss (Song Kang-ho).</p>
<p id="RBq0yI">Like <em>Oldboy </em>and the trilogy’s third movie (<em>Lady Vengeance</em>), <em>Mr. Vengeance </em>tackles issues of class and capitalism through the prism of the action thriller genre. With a standout cast and Park’s terrific visual sensibilities, <em>Mr. Vengeance </em>is a bloody good time at the movies. —<em>PV</em></p>

<p id="kY1Z9L"><strong>Run time: </strong>1h 50m<br><strong>Director: </strong>Akira Kurosawa<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Toshiro Mifune, Tatsuya Nakadai, Yoko Tsukasa<br><strong>Where to watch:</strong> Max, Criterion Channel</p>
<p id="qLun66">Of the many excellent collaborations between Akira Kurosawa and legendary movie star Toshiro Mifune, <em>Yojimbo</em> may be my favorite. Mifune plays a ronin who wanders in a small town and unknowingly finds himself squarely in the middle of a gang war. As the ronin’s skill with the sword becomes quickly apparent, the two factions try to bring him into their side of the conflict.</p>
<p id="s16Nvp">Unofficially remade years later Sergio Leone’s <em>A Fistful of Dollars</em>, <em>Yojimbo </em>is a remarkably influential movie, and an unforgettable display of one of the most charismatic leading men to ever grace movie screens. If you’ve gone this far without seeing it — run, don’t walk, to your TV. —<em>PV</em></p>

Geoff has had BioWare reveals at his events almost exclusively over the past however many years: <em>Dreadwolf </em>itself was revealed in 2018 at The Game Awards; BioWare announced it was making a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-4-5-bioware-teaser-release-date-2029-1851009417&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-4-5-bioware-teaser-release-date-2029-1851009417">new <em>Mass Effect</em></a></span> at the same event in 2020. <em>Dreadwolf </em>is practically a shoo-in for this year’s Game Awards. But that’s a safe prediction. So instead, I’m going with a hope: I need my mage pariah boyfriend Dorian Pavus to show up in the trailer. It’s Pride Month. Show him to me. — Kenneth Shepard<br></p></div><div><p>I have no insider knowledge to base this on, but I can’t imagine FromSoftware decided to ship the first<em> Armored Core</em> in a decade without cooking up some expanded content. We’ve gotten plenty of balance patches and smaller updates adding new features and equipment, but there’s plenty of room to add some full-blown missions or an entirely new campaign. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/armored-core-6-review-elden-ring-souls-rpg-fromsoftware-1850765780&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/armored-core-6-review-elden-ring-souls-rpg-fromsoftware-1850765780"><em>Armored Core IV</em></a></span> was just so good and I’m ready for more.</p><p>It would also be in keeping with the series’ history to release a spin-off or direct sequel within the first two years of the previous game’s launch. Am I grasping at straws here? Yes. But hey, the <em>Elden Ring</em> <em>Erdtree</em> DLC took forever. Maybe that’s partly because some folks were still working on <em>Armored Core</em>. I know the game didn’t seem to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/armored-core-6-sequel-hidetaka-miyazaki-mech-fromsoft-1851497631&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/armored-core-6-sequel-hidetaka-miyazaki-mech-fromsoft-1851497631">sell as much as the studio hoped</a></span>, but the only way to win over more fans is with more mech battles. It’s time to return to Rubicon. — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><p>Last year, <em>Alan Wake 2</em> was everything to me. Sure, I play a lotta games in this line of work, but <em>AW2</em> kept me in a trance that lasted long after its conclusion, including a line about loops and spirals that I keep repeating and inserting wherever I can. Naturally, I need more. Yes, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/senua-saga-hellblade-2-sacrifice-review-xbox-pc-1851489149&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/senua-saga-hellblade-2-sacrifice-review-xbox-pc-1851489149">other narrative and cryptic games</a></span> have managed to keep me satisfied in the meantime, but I need more of Mr. Wake and Ms. Anderson, along with Remedy’s wonderful storytelling and game design.</p><p>We know Remedy has been working on something, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/alanwake/status/1796557371046580629&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/alanwake/status/1796557371046580629" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">based on their tweets</a></span>, including a rebrand of their Twi—X account to “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/remedygames/status/1795832621533917371&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/remedygames/status/1795832621533917371" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Poison Pill Entertainment</a></span>,” which, you know, would be the opposite of a Remedy. We’ve seen creative director <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/genepark/status/1749973876308684851?t=QSWHa3YnGyQOgPdCZdRDVg&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/genepark/status/1749973876308684851?t=QSWHa3YnGyQOgPdCZdRDVg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sam Lake in mo-cap gear</a></span>, so we know Remedy certainly has secrets to reveal. Hopefully, we’ll learn what they are soon… — Claire Jackson</p></div><div><p>If Paramount wasn’t going to put out the trailer for the third live-action <em>Sonic the Hedgehog </em>movie in front of one of its own films, last month’s <em>If</em>, what better place to premiere Keanu Reeves as Shadow? Fans (including me) <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-3-movie-trailer-shadow-paramount-1851483101&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-3-movie-trailer-shadow-paramount-1851483101">are going mad waiting</a></span> for even a frame of footage from the upcoming film, and all signs point to a Summer Game Fest premiere. According to Geoff’s highlight trailer, Sega will be showing <em>Sonic X Shadow Generations </em>at the event, and even if the <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 </em>trailer would do fine as a shadow (no pun intended) drop on YouTube, what could it hurt to have a big stage to itself for a few minutes? — Kenneth Shepard<br></p></div><div><p>I might be a huge <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/stellar-blade-nier-yoko-taro-jealous-hyung-tae-kim-1851413085&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/stellar-blade-nier-yoko-taro-jealous-hyung-tae-kim-1851413085">Yoko Taro</a></span> stan who is constantly hoping the madman will announce a new game, but I really do think it could be in the cards for this Summer Game Fest. First off, Taro hasn’t released a major new game since <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nier-automata-the-kotaku-review-1793002839&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nier-automata-the-kotaku-review-1793002839"><em>NieR: Automata</em></a></span> in 2017. While I am a fan of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/yoko-taro-sinoalice-end-update-server-nier-mobile-1849711919&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/yoko-taro-sinoalice-end-update-server-nier-mobile-1849711919">now-defunct gacha games</a></span> he has worked on, as well as the oft-forgotten <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/voice-of-cards-trilogy&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/voice-of-cards-trilogy"><em>Voice of Cards</em></a></span> series, none of his post-<em>Automata</em> projects have been on the same level production-wise. Also, we know he has new projects in the works—in May <em>NieR </em>series producer Yosuke Sait revealed that he and Taro are <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nier-3-automata-yoko-taro-yosuke-saito-1851478254&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nier-3-automata-yoko-taro-yosuke-saito-1851478254">working on a new game</a></span> together, though they wouldn’t confirm if it was a <em>NieR </em>title. Just announce the dang thing already and give me something to live for! — Willa Rowe<br></p></div><div><p>But my one hope is that whatever Taro’s next project is, it isn’t <em>NieR</em>. At this point, we’ve experienced five incredible stories from Taro in the extended Drakengard and Nier universe (that’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/drakengard-3-isnt-just-about-making-a-sequel-not-en-469640600&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/drakengard-3-isnt-just-about-making-a-sequel-not-en-469640600"><em>Drakengard 1</em> and <em>3</em></a></span>, as well as the original <em>NieR</em>, <em>Automata</em>, and <em>Reincarnation</em>). All these stories have been variations on the same themes, and worked incredibly well as pieces of a larger thematic quilt. But I truly feel like the story reached its conclusion with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nier-reincarnation-final-chapter-goodbye-out-now-1851374397&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nier-reincarnation-final-chapter-goodbye-out-now-1851374397"><em>Reincarnation</em></a></span>, which you all should have played. The thing that would excite me most is seeing Taro create something completely fresh that isn’t weighed down by fan expectations of what a <em>NieR </em>or <em>Drakengard </em>game has to be. - Willa Rowe<br></p></div><div><p>I don’t know if Hideo Kojima will appear on stage at Summer Game Fest. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/death-stranding-2-trailer-playstation-gameplay-2025-1850470174&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/death-stranding-2-trailer-playstation-gameplay-2025-1850470174"><em>Death Stranding 2 </em>is looming</a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hideo-kojima-od-jordan-peele-xbox-exclusive-1851083040&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hideo-kojima-od-jordan-peele-xbox-exclusive-1851083040"><em>OD </em>exists</a></span>, and he’s also working on a new espionage game called <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/physint-hideo-kojima-new-game-state-play-1851214597&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/physint-hideo-kojima-new-game-state-play-1851214597"><em>Physint</em></a></span>. But even if the man is not there to show any of those games, I am confident his name will be said on stage at least once. I have no idea what the context will be, but I do not believe Geoff can stand on a stage and not mention his bff Jill. — Kenneth Shepard<br></p></div><div><p>Summer Game Fest 2023 was a two-hour show <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-geoff-keighley-women-diversity-1850553957&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-geoff-keighley-women-diversity-1850553957">with no women</a></span>. There was supposed to be one, Melanie Liburd, who played Saga Anderson in<em> Alan Wake II</em>, but she couldn’t make it due to scheduling conflicts. Surely this year will be better? Hopefully, the big game companies send more women to represent them and their games at the event, and Keighley doesn’t take no for an answer. — Ethan Gach<br></p></div><div><p>Ideally, this prediction doesn’t come true and Ethan’s hope wins out over my cynicism. But the video game industry is always listening and learning and then forgetting the lessons it was taught even a month or two prior. I believe we’ll see more women presenting games on stage at Summer Game Fest 2024, but I will be gobsmacked if the numbers aren’t still lopsided as fuck. — Kenneth Shepard<br></p></div><div><p>Geoff has no doubt upped security after he’s had not one, but two instances of someone getting on stage who should not have been there. This included the infamous <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2022-bill-clinton-orthodox-rabbi-elden-ring-1849873240&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2022-bill-clinton-orthodox-rabbi-elden-ring-1849873240">“Bill Clinton Kid” from The Game Awards 2022</a></span> and another guy who said some shit about <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/geoff-keighley-gamescom-starfield-gta-6-bill-clinton-1850762952&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/geoff-keighley-gamescom-starfield-gta-6-bill-clinton-1850762952">at Gamescom 2023</a></span>. But I still believe someone is going to try a third time, and I am waiting for Geoff’s guards to knock someone out. I fully believe that the need for the show to go exactly how it’s rehearsed will lead to someone getting cold-cocked on a livestream. The question is, which of Geoff’s shows will be the one where it finally happens? — Kenneth Shepard<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p><a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/ubisoft">Ubisoft</a> is gearing up to drop another <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/xdefiant">XDefiant</a> update later today following the online shooter’s launch later last month.</p>
<p><iframe title="XDefiant Preseason Battle Pass Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QnpEl5D_t4Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>XDefiant update Y1S0.2 (which will appear on PS5 as 1.000.009) makes a number of changes to Ubisoft’s new free-to-play title, including improvements to how Crossplay and party invites work.</p>
<p>For those who missed the memo, XDefiant is a high octane, arena-based shooter that is shaping up to be one of <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/call-of-duty">Call of Duty</a>‘s biggest rivals in 2024. What does it bring to the table, you ask? The developers at Ubisoft San Francisco have woven together smooth COD-like gunplay with a splash of <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/overwatch">Overwatch</a> (light hero-like powers, and a focus on team-based objectives). On top of that, the game features Factions inspired by characters from Ubi franchises such as Splinter Cell and Far Cry.</p>
<p>Y1S0.2 is sure to be one of many patches as XDefiant continues to undergo refinement. In future updates, we can expect new content including bonus Factions, maps, events, and (hopefully) even more game modes.</p>

<p>Here are latest changes coming to XDefiant.</p>
<h2>XDefiant Update Y1S0.2 Patch Notes</h2>
<h3 id="U29jaWFs">Social</h3>
<ul>
<li>While in a party, we now display the most restrictive Crossplay setting among the party members, as it applies to the whole party. Also fixed an issue where party members with differing Crossplay settings couldn’t matchmake.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with displaying incorrect player names on some Social screens.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash caused by spamming open/close View Party Invites, but who would even do that, calm down.</li>
<li>On consoles, Ubisoft Connect party invites could display as if they were coming from Xbox or PlayStation Network friends. Fixed that, along with some other weird invite-related things.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="TWlzY2VsbGFuZW91cw==">Miscellaneous</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed some missing terrain textures when players joined matches in progress on some maps.</li>
<li>Input-Based Matchmaking setting status now updates correctly after changing it on Xbox.</li>
<li>Fixed a thing on PS5 where people could sneak into places they shouldn’t via PS5 Activities.</li>
<li>Security improvements, various.</li>
</ul>
<p>Having recently got some hands-on time with the game, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/01/is-xdefiant-a-cod-killer/">here’s what we had to say</a>:</p>
<p>“Exactly how much stopping power XDefiant gains will depend largely on its future roadmap. Thankfully, Ubisoft is no stranger when it comes to running a successful live service, with Rainbow Six Siege making a dramatic turnaround in its first year to become one of the biggest FPS games of all time. XDefiant fans are seemingly in good hands, then, and Ubisoft will need to keep its momentum if it wants to ward off 2024’s upcoming class of shooters from this year’s Black Ops 6 to <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a>&nbsp;and Sony’s&nbsp;<a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/concord">Concord</a>.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pax-dei-early-access-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Mainframe Industries has announced an Early Access release date for its social sandbox MMO&nbsp;<em>Pax Dei</em>, which will have you exploring a massive open world based on the myths and legends of medieval times.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Pax Dei&nbsp;</em>will launch into Early Access on June 18th, which means it's exactly two weeks to the day (at time of writing) until you'll get to play this one.</p>

<p>According to Mainframe,&nbsp;<em>Pax Dei&nbsp;</em>is "currently amongst the most-wishlisted games on Steam", with more than 100,000 players apparently taking part in the game's latest alpha test.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pax-dei-early-access-release-date-building.jpg?itok=nadK-YQf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pax-dei-early-access-release-date-building.jpg?itok=Y9WGVnnp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pax Dei&nbsp;</em>has already amassed some pretty significant interest.</figcaption></figure><p>Although<i>&nbsp;</i><em>Pax Dei&nbsp;</em>is still in the relatively early stages of development, Mainframe says it has "reached a stage where it requires a permanently live game and an active player base" in order to progress.</p>

<p>Game director Reynir Hardarson, whose name you might recognize from his work as creative director with&nbsp;<em>Eve Online&nbsp;</em>developer CCP Games, says&nbsp;<em>Pax Dei&nbsp;</em>"can't be built without players" and that Early Access puts&nbsp;<em>Pax Dei&nbsp;</em>players "on the floor with [Mainframe]".</p>

<p>Two of&nbsp;<em>Pax Dei</em>'s core gameplay loops are, according to Mainframe, already in place. The "peaceful" loop, which involves gathering and crafting, and the "adventure" loop, which encompasses the game's PvE and PvP dimensions, are already present.</p>

<p>The third pillar, the "social" loop, will introduce markets and economy to&nbsp;<em>Pax Dei</em>, and will be incorporated as the game's first major update after its Early Access release, although we're not sure exactly when that will happen.</p>




<p>Mainframe Industries boasts luminaries from the likes of not only CCP Games, but also Blizzard, Ubisoft, and Remedy on its team.</p>

<p>If anyone's going to be able to build a lasting, sustainable social sandbox MMO, it's probably these guys, although I don't think you should expect a&nbsp;<em>Pax Dei&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/eve-online-microsoft-excel-crossover-actually-happening">Microsoft Excel crossover</a> anytime soon.</p>

<p><em>Pax Dei&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1995520/Pax_Dei/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> on June 18th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/interviews/skydances-behemoth-interview-discussing-importance-of-creating-immersive<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Skydance Games is preparing their next big VR title following the success of <em>The Walking Dead: Saints &amp; Sinners</em>, and it’s looking to be a big one. While we had some time to get to know the upcoming <em>Skydance’s Behemoth</em> through an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/skydances-behemoth-preview">early preview session</a>, we still had some questions.</p>

<p>Sitting down with Skydance Vice President of Creative for <em>Skydance’s Behemoth</em>, Shawn Kittlesen, we were able to get a further grasp on the development of the game with a focus on player experience, and how it’s important to create an immersive and engaging experience through physics-based combat mechanics, player choice, and customization.</p>

<p>As the game has been fairly dormant in the public eye since its announcement, we wanted to know a little more about the history of this project and why the team decided to go ahead with VR versus a traditional kind of action adventure.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skydances-behemoth-screenshot-01.jpg?itok=TB4N8ui_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skydances-behemoth-screenshot-01.jpg?itok=forOTGTi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>“Our original team was looking for pioneering technology, with VR being that in games right now,” said Kittlesen. “The team released <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/walking-dead-saints-sinners-hands-on-preview"><em>The Walking Dead: Saints &amp; Sinners</em></a>, and that has gone on to be one of the best-selling VR games of all time.</p>

<p>“The physics-based melee combat in that game lets you kill walkers, which was something fans responded to in such a way that made us think we had to build on this. So taking this idea, we thought, what if any one human enemy was dangerous? What if they could go toe to toe with you using melee combat?</p>

<p>“That’s how we ended up getting into the advanced mechanics [for <em>Skydance’s Behemoth</em>], and then just bringing in as many weapons as we could like swords, axes, blade knives, and a bow and arrow as a ranged weapon. The grappling hook became a way to manipulate the environment and explore.”</p>

<p>While <em>The Walking Dead</em> was a survival game in a very intimate space, the team at Skydance Games then considered what was the opposite of that – wide open spaces. Specifically in that VR can sell the scale in a way that traditional “flat” games can’t.</p>

<p>“We wanted to go the biggest scale with our world, and the Behemoth encounters are these really exceptional punctuation points along the way of the campaign,” said Kittlesen. “The package comes together with everything you’ve learned in terms of traversal, environmental puzzles, and combat.”</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skydances-behemoth-screenshot-02.jpg?itok=uU7VDrxK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skydances-behemoth-screenshot-02.jpg?itok=YhwhXcRc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This was all evident in the demo Skydance Games had on display moments before. While it was run through in about 30 minutes, the slice of gameplay could have taken up to an hour for the sheer number of ways it could be approached, and because <em>Skydance’s Behemoth</em> is the type of game where you can pick your play style a little bit.</p>

<p>“You can hang back and play from range, you can get up close, and I imagine there’s going to be some in the player base who go with a shield only so they can block attacks,” explained Kittlesen.</p>

<p>“Or you can grab enemies and engage your strength and shoot them a great distance. So yeah, player choice is important to us. Wren [the player character], is not canonically gendered in any direction, so Wren can be anyone.</p>

<p>“In the final game, you’ll have a choice of voices for your character, a choice between two different sets of arms, and a choice of range of skin tones too so that whoever’s playing, they can be fully immersed in their character.”</p>

<p>The way anyone plays, it’ll ultimately be up to them. <em>Skydance’s Behemoth </em>is effectively a sandbox, and the game environments are a playground.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skydances-behemoth-screenshot-03.jpg?itok=Bguthdgi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skydances-behemoth-screenshot-03.jpg?itok=1pFmDiG_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Attached to these gameplay elements is an immersive story, and while it won’t be as choice driven like the gameplay loop itself is, it is engineered to be like a thrilling rollercoaster ride.</p>

<p>“Everyone will get the same story,” Kittlesen confirmed.</p>

<p>“It’s just sort of how their approach to getting there, and how they upgrade their weaponry. There are different hero weapons you can acquire along the way, and rather than upgrading your character, you’ll upgrade those weapons.</p>

<p>“You’ll have the choice where you put those resources into customizing the different properties and effects that it has when you do different tasks. You’ll also be able to customize the appearance of it.”</p>

<p>There’s a lot to sift through when it comes to <em>Skydance’s Behemoth</em>’s narrative, and there will be a lot of twists and turns along the way, as well as other characters who you’ll meet during the adventure. But just how long will said adventure last?</p>

<p>“It’s about a 12-hour campaign,” said Kittlesen.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skydances-behemoth-screenshot-04.jpg?itok=o6SjLI40 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skydances-behemoth-screenshot-04.jpg?itok=Kw0Rzoa_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>“We have frequent save points and it’s divided into chunks, so that if a player only has 20-30 minutes they can go in, have a play session, and make some meaningful progress as they make their way through. Anyone’s welcome to play longer, but realistically most VR players prefer a 30-to-40-minute session."</p>

<p>This design was implemented after the team received feedback from the work on <em>The Walking Dead</em>. That means it’s all manual saves, and while there are auto save points, the big boss battles do have that leeway in the form of checkpoints if you need to go back and puzzle out what to do.</p>

<p>These bosses, or Behemoths as the game’s title calls out, were the result of the team at Skydance Games pushing themselves to do something that could only be done in VR. Of course, you can fight boss battles in traditional flat games, but you can’t get a sense of how big that monster is relative to you.</p>

<p>“You can’t look up and have that feeling of awe and the impossibility of it,” Kittlesen explained.</p>

<p>“The demo boss started out at about half its current size, and we decided to keep scaling it up. All the Behemoths are very different, look different, and the largest one is about the size of a skyscraper.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skydances-behemoth-screenshot-05.jpg?itok=kO68gKdG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skydances-behemoth-screenshot-05.jpg?itok=5DlOP45E 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>“All of the fights have distinct phases they go through, but we really want them to feel dynamic so no two are the same.”</p>

<p>Because <em>Skydance's Behemoth</em> is a full-featured game, there will be a number of accessibility options in place because VR has that physical element and everyone has different limitations, including the possibility of feeling motion sickness.</p>

<p>“You saw some of the features – there’s the comfort vignette, which you can dial in to help tunneling so that your periphery can help drive motion sickness,” said Kittlesen.</p>

<p>“The snap turn versus smooth turn setting is another powerful feature. There’s also a color blindness feature, and ultimately you’ll be able to play sitting or standing. This is something that was actually really hard to tune for because you can imagine things like the belt and picking things up.”</p>

<p>In an effort to get as many people as possible to play a game like <em>Skydance’s Behemoth</em>, these type of options are key. The team wants to make games for everyone, which is why it’s coming out on every VR system, and the goal is to attract people to VR in general.</p>

<p>With VR still in a sort of niche space, <em>Skydance’s Behemoth</em> looks to be a huge step up in terms of what developers can actually do with the VR platform. <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/skydances-behemoth-preview"><em>Skydance’s Behemoth</em></a> will be available for PlayStation VR 2, PCVR, as well as Meta Quest 2 and 3 this fall.</p>

<p>Previews for the upcoming Elden Ring DLC, Shadow of the Erdtree, have finally surfaced online and reveal a variety of details about the challenges, art design, and more.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/04/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-hands-on-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new PlayStation blog</a> describes the upcoming Land of Shadow setting as “ancient and blighted.” Its environment features “a vast settlement, an expansive castle, and a dark woodland.”</p>



<p>The blog also mentions the DLC will feature “10+ full bosses and additional side bosses.” These include the Divine Beast Dancing Lion and Twin Moon Knight, a castle guardian. </p>



<p>There will also be “around one hundred new weapons” players can find, as well as new weapon types such as Martial Arts.</p>



<p>Lastly, the PlayStation preview mentioned the Shadow Realm Blessing system, adding stackable buffs to even out gameplay. </p>



<p>Still, a report <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/elden-ring-shadows-of-the-erdtrees-opening-hours-are-absolutely-brutal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by VGC</a> describes the opening hours as “brutal.” The fresh system appears to balance out increased difficulty for the DLC. VGC also said there are “three builds to start from.” </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>PC Gamer adds in <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-scadutree-fragments-revered-spirit-ash-blessings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new report</a> that players can scour for Scadutree Fragments to increase their Scadutree Blessing level to scale stats.</p>



<p>FromSoftware recently revealed a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-story-trailer/">new story trailer</a> for Shadow of the Erdtree, though today’s previews confirmed much more. The DLC will add new weapons, equipment, and more, including the brand-new Land of Shadow.</p>



<p>Elden Ring remains widely praised among critics and fans alike, and Shadow of the Erdtree is highly anticipated DLC. However, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-reportedly-wont-get-new-dlc-after-shadow-of-the-erdtree/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a recent report</a> spotted a key comment by FromSoftware’s Hidetaka Miyazaki, mentioned during an interview. Miyazaki suggested that Shadow of the Erdtree will be Elden Ring’s “first and last DLC.” </p>



<p>Elden Ring’s Shadow of the Erdtree will release on June 21, 2024, for all available platforms. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ikea-roblox-store/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>IKEA has just revealed plans to hire ten employees to work in a fully virtual store housed exclusively within the confines of Roblox. The furniture giant confirmed today that ‘The Co-Worker Game’ will come to the Roblox ecosystem on June 24, with ten successful applicants being hired to ‘serve up endless amounts of meatballs’ or organise the virtual furniture displays in and around the store.</p>



<p>The twist here is that these employees will earn a decent wage – around £13.15 per hour. That’s the ‘London Living Wage’ per the latest update, but it hasn’t been confirmed how many hours per week or month the successful applicants will be asked to ‘work’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-let-s-get-digital">Let’s Get Digital</h2>



<p>In a press release published recently, IKEA confirmed that applications for the ten roles are now live and that applicants have until June 16 to get their forms in. It’s a bizarre interview process with some inane questions, but that’s partly what we’d expect from a role like this, which is borderline experimental at best.</p>



<p>It’s reportedly part of an initiative called ‘Careers Done Different’, and it’s part of a drive to entice younger people into a career at IKEA. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/newsroom/corporate-news/ikea-is-opening-a-new-store-on-roblox-pub8a9272d0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">In the press release</a>, IKEA’s Darren Taylor said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><br>We’re excited to be the first brand to launch paid work on Roblox to showcase how we do careers differently, bringing our unique careers philosophy to life. At IKEA, there is no set route to career progression. Our co-workers are able to change roles, switch departments, and grow in any direction they choose, both in the game or in the real world. There are many ways to learn and grow at IKEA, and that’s what IKEA on Roblox is all about.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s a serious process, though. From the initial application, there will be a shortlist drawn up and applicants will need to undertake a virtual interview. The roles are also only open to those aged 18 and over in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. </p>

Accompanied by a mustachioed robot companion named Oz, the titular Weko sets out to save his home from darkness by locating seven primordial masks, each of which represents one of the seven deadly sins.</p><p>Since the game’s announcement, <em>Weko the Mask Gatherer</em> has enchanted players with its colorful stylings, evoking memories of <em>Spyro the Dragon</em> or <em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</em>. However, this cozy and wholesome mask obscures the slightly darker face of the game. Players must fight off formidable foes in challenging boss fights, each demanding its own set of skills, item combinations and strategic gameplay to overcome. The game, however, carefully balances this intense combat with relaxing puzzles, side quests and locations to explore.</p><p>As Weko undertakes his heroic adventure, he must harness the power of other, more benevolent masks scattered across the land, each offering a different perk or ability to aid the gecko in his quest. Whether players prefer to play defensively or hack ‘n’ slash their way through, they will wield a combination of masks that suits their own play style. Alongside this myriad of masks, players can unlock new weapons, discover hidden secrets, and even acquire mounts to help them traverse the breathtaking world of the game.    </p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><em>Weko the Mask Gatherer</em> is the first game from Swiss indie developers SIRO Games – a talented duo consisting of Robin Haefeli and Simon Da Silva. Between them, they carefully balance Weko’s nostalgic art style and action-packed game mechanics.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Wéko The Mask Gatherer – Release Date Trailer - Steam" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fudJ6d4FB2A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>There are a variety of fixes for XDefiant's social features, too, and the patch notes are humorously written. For example, the patch fixes an issue that could cause the game to crash when people spammed the button to open and close party invites. Ubisoft said, "But who would even do that, calm down."</p><p>You can see the full XDefiant patch notes below, as shared by Ubisoft on the <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/xdefiant/news/7uPCH1ds2CjmwkdpRnbqVU" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XDefiant website.</a></p><p>After overcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisofts-cod-like-shooter-xdefiant-is-unplayable-for-many-on-launch-day/1100-6523613/" data-ref-id="1100-6523613">launch-day server issues</a>, XDefiant has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-player-numbers-8-million/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reportedly reached more than 8 million players</a>.

Fixed that, along with some other weird invite-related things.</li></ul><h2>Miscellaneous</h2><ul><li>Fixed some missing terrain textures when players joined matches in progress on some maps.</li><li>Input-Based Matchmaking setting status now updates correctly after changing it on Xbox.</li><li>Fixed a thing on PS5 where people could sneak into places they shouldn't via PS5 Activities.</li><li>Security improvements, various.</li></ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/twitch-mizkif-mma-brawl<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Over the weekend, popular Twitch streamer Matthew “Mizkif” Rinaudo <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2161054114?filter=archives&amp;sort=time" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hosted an MMA event</a> at a gym in Austin that he co-owns alongside other fitness-minded streamers. It ended pretty much the only way it could: with a fighter who had just lost whipping his dick out and inciting a multi-man melee in the cage. Rinaudo, commentators, and viewers ate up the ensuing spectacle.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“A fight just broke out at my MMA event, and the fighter is outside getting arrested right now,” Rinaduo <a href="https://x.com/REALMizkif/status/1797035846727585856" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said on Twitter</a>. “I love this sport.”</p><p>He then clarified how it all started for those watching along on Twitch and other platforms, a moment that the cameras – luckily for Rinaudo, who has a vested interest in remaining unbanned – did not fully catch.&nbsp;</p><p>"This fight happened, and the guy who lost whipped his dick out in front of the audience, and was arrested,” Rinaudo wrote.</p><p>In broad strokes, it’s not difficult to see how we arrived here. But sometimes, with enough amassed domain knowledge, you can peer into the depths of a single moment and perceive precisely how the dominoes fell. When I’m not writing about video games or touching grass, I spend my time hoovering up exactly two flavors of trash: MMA news and Twitch drama. So unfortunately, I was made for this moment. Let’s break it down.</p><p>Rinaudo is a streamer who got his start as a cameraman for Paul “Ice Poseidon” Denino, who was <a href="https://kotaku.com/for-twitch-streamer-who-got-swatted-on-a-plane-notorie-1794972701" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">perma-banned from Twitch in 2017</a> after a series of escalating real-life stunts saw him get swatted while boarding a plane. More recently, Denino found himself in hot water on Kick for streaming an encounter between a friend and a sex worker while he and another streamer, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/29/kick-streamers-leave-ceo-ice-poseidon-prank-sex-work/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unbeknownst to the sex worker</a>, hid in a nearby room.&nbsp;</p><p>Rinaudo is also no stranger to scandal, with his biggest – an alleged 2022 cover up of a sexual assault incident between two other streamers – getting him <a href="https://x.com/OTKnetwork/status/1572387360247271427" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">temporarily booted from OTK</a>, the content creation company he owns alongside other big names like Asmongold and Esfand, which already saw another member, Rich Campbell, <a href="https://x.com/RichWCampbell/status/1603869600969547785" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">resign in the wake of his own set of sexual assault allegations</a> in 2022. Also in 2022, a third-party investigation from legal firm Jackson Walker – now, <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/bankruptcy-law/jackson-walker-in-legal-hot-seat-following-judge-romance-scandal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as Bloomberg Law puts it</a>, in "Legal Hot Seat Following Judge Romance Scandal" – <a href="https://x.com/OTKnetwork/status/1609361988467183616" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">found Rinaudo innocent of the coverup</a>, but OTK added in a statement that Rinaudo would remain suspended from OTK's board of directors due to his "callous disregard towards the severity of sexual misconduct and racial prejudice in our space," pending a probationary period. More recently, content creator Mitch Jones <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/esports/news-i-got-assaulted-mizkif-mitch-jones-accuses-otk-co-founder-claims-knocked-strangled" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accused Rinaudo</a> of physically assaulting him in late 2023. So far, no disciplinary action has come of that.</p><p>While a typical stream from Rinaudo is not laden with controversy – he mostly just plays video games, talks shit, and interacts with other OTK members – part of the broader appeal of this corner of the streaming ecosystem is the mess. It’s long-form reality TV, and people only begin to balk when things get a little <em>too </em>real, when they’re reminded that the actions of their faves – incentivized by platforms and thrill-seeking viewers to behave irresponsibly on (and off) camera – have actual human consequences.&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of personnel, OTK’s lineage traces back to Twitch’s earlier, edgelordier days, prior to growing mainstream acceptance as a result of the Amazon acquisition and, later, the <em>Fortnite </em>boom, which came with ad deals and brand safety concerns. OTK in particular straddles an awkward line, attempting to professionalize and host events around streamers, some of whom have checkered pasts and, if they were just getting started now, would likely <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/27/kick-lures-disenchanted-twitch-streamers-for-now-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">default to Kick</a>, not the comparatively-sanitized Twitch. There is, as a result, an appeal to somebody like Rinaudo, who’s almost edgy enough for Kick or <a href="https://www.indy100.com/science-tech/what-is-rumble-kai-cenat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rumble</a>, but savvy enough to know when to rein it in. A subset of Twitch viewers is all about This Kind Of Guy. In their eyes, he’s more real than other Twitch streamers, who are engaged in transparent branding exercises, when in reality he’s just engaged in a different kind of branding exercise, the kind that allows him to be edgy <em>by Twitch standards</em> while not getting banned from Twitch.&nbsp;</p><p>That, in turn, pairs perfectly with MMA, which is a sport made up almost entirely of This Kind Of Guy, some of whom – like <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/sugaseanomalley" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">135-lb champion Sean O’Malley</a> – spend a lot of their free time streaming on Twitch. The modern UFC is full of fighters who love to act edgy, individualistic, and tough while also emphasizing, over and over, that they are compliant Company Men who will fight whenever and wherever the boss, UFC president Dana White, desires. This is by design. To fulfill its <a href="https://www.espn.com/mma/story/_/id/23581729/espn-ufc-reach-five-year-television-rights-deal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lucrative $1.5 billion ESPN broadcast deal</a>, the UFC has to put on events at a breakneck pace, which means that the schedule is king. If fighters drop out of scheduled fights (for example, due to injury) or try to haggle for a timeframe that better suits their needs, they get punished with worse matchmaking, decreased promotion, or more time on the sidelines. Your best bet, then, is to suck up to the boss and the system while otherwise building your own brand as a man’s man in a lawless land (read: one <a href="https://redflag.org.au/article/ufc-30-years-blood-sweat-and-exploitation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ruthlessly controlled by capitalism</a>).</p><p>The tradeoff is that the UFC turns a blind eye to all sorts of inappropriate behavior on the part of its fighters, including <a href="https://au.sports.yahoo.com/sexism-storm-khabib-nurmagomedovs-disgusting-comments-211706790.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sexism</a>, <a href="https://www.espn.com/mma/story/_/id/29959739/dana-white-colby-covington-comments-muzzle-anybody" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">racism</a>, <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/ufc-297-sean-stricklands-homophobic-tirade-latest-in-ufcs-ugly-uninhibited-dive-into-culture-wars/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">homophobia</a>, and – you guessed it – <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/trentreinsmith/2019/11/06/greg-hardy-fights-on-same-ufc-card-as-domestic-violence-survivor-jessica-rose-clark/?sh=355e6b7a382c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">assault</a>. In this sense, the UFC is actually kind of on an opposite trajectory compared to Twitch. In the early 2010s, the organization was desperate for legitimacy in the eyes of the sports world, attempting to shed the remains of its – as late senator <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2018/08/john-mccain-ufc-how-he-grew-to-tolerate-mma-the-sport-he-considered-human-cockfighting.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">John McCain put it in 1996</a> – “human cockfighting” image once and for all. As a result, the UFC, which had <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2711551-mmas-top-10-wildest-out-of-the-cage-brawls" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no shortage of unsanctioned brawls in its early days</a>, briefly enforced something resembling a code of conduct, albeit inconsistently. In 2010, it perma-banned British fighter Paul Daley for angrily striking opponent Josh Koscheck after the end of a match in which Daley was wrestled to the ground for three rounds. In 2013, it suspended then-burgeoning star Nate Diaz <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ufc/2013/05/17/ufc-suspends-nate-diaz/2206831/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for tweeting a gay slur</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>But after securing certain trappings of mainstream acceptance – a uniform deal with Reebok, the aforementioned ESPN deal – UFC brass realized they just… didn’t need to police fighter behavior anymore. In fact, there was more money in <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/04/27/ufc-president-dana-white-explains-companys-political-apathy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">branding themselves as an alternative</a> and, relatedly, as <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-ufc-fight-masculinity-verdict-rcna155252" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the one true MAGA sport</a>, <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/pandemic-helped-ufc-find-another-level-of-success-this-business-is-on-fire-233433085.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">especially once the pandemic rolled around</a> and other sports took a more cautious approach to live events. This arose out of promotional convenience just as much as it did politics. It’s very easy to sell a fight, for example, when one of your guys is screaming at the other about how, if this was a different time, his people would <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=324560952419233" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kill and enslave their people</a>, or in another instance, seeking out an opponent before a scheduled fight to <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/2018/4/5/17203890/watch-conor-mcgregor-throw-a-dolly-through-ufc-223-fighter-bus-window" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hurl a dolly through the window of a bus</a> they were seated on, shattering glass and slicing up innocent bystanders.&nbsp;</p><p>The latter incident preceded <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/2019/5/22/18635315/conor-mcgregor-relives-ufc-229-brawl-underlines-interest-in-khabib-nurmagomedov-rematch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a 2019 brawl</a> not unlike the one at Rinaudo’s event, neither <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/mma/article-12019649/The-10-craziest-outside-cage-moments-UFC-history.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the first nor last of its kind</a> in the UFC. Unlike Daley, who was ejected from the UFC forever after throwing a single post-fight punch, the fighter who kicked off the 2019 brawl – now-retired mega star Khabib Nurmagomedov – faced little in the way of consequences from the UFC, nor did his opponent, Conor McGregor, for whom dolly-throwing now somehow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor#Controversies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ranks among the least of his crimes</a>. Both the bus incident and the brawl were used in future UFC promotional videos. These days, when UFC stars step out of line – whether that means nearly getting into fights <a href="https://www.sportscasting.com/ufc-fight-called-off-after-violent-weigh-in-altercation-injures-fighter-sends-hospital/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on weigh-in scales</a>, having <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzpFZ6fSr-Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weird racially-motivated in-cage confrontations</a>, or <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/sports/ufc-champ-jon-jones-accused-threatening-kill-drug-testing-agent-rcna146747" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">threatening drug testers</a> – White, who faced no meaningful consequences for <a href="https://defector.com/dana-white-hits-his-wife-at-a-club" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">publicly slapping his own wife in early 2023</a>, just <a href="https://www.espn.com/mma/story/_/id/29959739/dana-white-colby-covington-comments-muzzle-anybody" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shrugs it off</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>All of which brings us back to the in-cage melee at Rinaudo’s event over the weekend. Compared to some of the big leagues’ more notorious brawls, it was a pretty tame affair. A couple of the many staff members and teammates of fighters in the cage threatened to throw punches, but mostly they just worked to separate fighters from one another. The whole thing was over after just a minute or so. Rinaudo <a href="https://x.com/REALMizkif/status/1797112078643392536" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">later said</a> that the fighter who kicked it off was “suspended from fighting for 6 months.”</p><p>It’s not clear what he meant by that. Is the fighter suspended only from Rinaudo’s organization, or did a state athletic commission – the body which usually sanctions these sorts of events and metes out fines and suspensions as needed – hand down the order, which would prevent the fighter from competing in other organizations as well? In any case, you need only look at viewership numbers, which <a href="https://x.com/REALMizkif/status/1797046196621410631" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">peaked at over 100,000 concurrents</a> across all platforms, and listen to commentators to learn how people actually felt about this moment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“Let’s go! Let’s go!” shouted one commentator excitedly when the scuffle began, as an in-person audience began to hoot and holler. Twitch chat, meanwhile, filled with messages like “DRAMA” and “OOOOOOO.”</p><p>"Take it easy. Take it easy,” cautioned another commentator. “We ain't gotta go there. We ain't gotta take it there."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"For the sake of viewership, they have to take it there," retorted a third.<br>This is neither shocking nor particularly revealing. At best, it’s instructive. In 2024 – a year in which YouTuber-turned-celebrity-boxer Jake Paul will fight a nearly 60-year-old Mike Tyson, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/31/sport/mike-tyson-jake-paul-fight-delay/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">probably, at some point</a> – this <em>is </em>the show. Fights are not just fights; they are settings, scaffoldings that hold up months of online drama both before and after. Paul and his brother Logan, not coincidentally, were <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-logan-paul-vs-ksi-fight-is-the-natural-conclusion-o-1828642369" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">among</a><a href="https://kotaku.com/logan-paul-vs-floyd-mayweather-was-just-the-beginning-1847046623" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the first</a> to maximize that side of the business, but the UFC had already spent decades blazing a trashy trail before either Paul brother ever stepped foot in a ring. Where once in-cage brawls – or exposed dicks, or discriminatory language, or assault scandals – might have seemed shocking, now they’re just part of the daily tapestry of both combat sports and content creation. They happen, they generate some wacky headlines, and then everybody moves on to the next drama.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-therapist-critical-role-hades-2<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Little Bat Games, developer of "analyze-'em-up" therapy sim&nbsp;<em>Vampire Therapist</em>, has announced that two major high-profile voice actors have joined its game's cast.</p>

<p>The first is someone you'll know well if you're a&nbsp;<em>Critical Role&nbsp;</em>fan or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-vincent-valentine-voiced-matt-mercer">if you've played <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em></a>. It's Matt Mercer, who'll be voicing the vampire Reinhard with what sounds like a characteristically campy accent.</p>

<p><em>Vampire Therapist</em>'s second major new voice acting addition is Sarah Grayson, who plays Selene in the recently-released&nbsp;<em>Hades 2</em>. She's also the voice of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/open-roads-review"><i>Open Roads</i></a>' Aunt August, <i>Gone Home</i>'s Sam, and&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>'s Commander Jehan.</p>

<p>They're joined by a cast that also includes&nbsp;<em>Hades</em>' Cyrus Nemati, who gave his voice to Ares in that game, as well as Francesca Meaux, also of&nbsp;<em>Hades&nbsp;</em>fame.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Newcomer Kylie Clark, who Little Bat says was "trained at the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama", rounds off the cast as we know it so far.</p>

<p>More voice actors could be waiting in the wings to swoop down and charm you in&nbsp;<em>Vampire Therapist</em>, so we'll just have to wait and see who else is in store.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Vampire Therapist</em>, it's a visual novel-style game that puts you in the therapist's chair. You'll get to talk to a range of vampiric personalities, each with their own foibles and problems that need to be worked through.</p>

<p>Little Bat describes the game as a "unique tale of mental health, vampires, and German-inspired nightclubs". The studio says a demo for&nbsp;<em>Vampire Therapist&nbsp;</em>is available now, but it wasn't live at time of writing, so make sure to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2481020/Vampire_Therapist/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">check back later</a> if you want to take a look.</p>

            <p>Yes, I've played a portion of Elden Ring's expansion Shadow Of The Erdtree and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-hollows-out-everything-you-loved-about-elden-ring-and-its-brilliant">I think it's brilliant</a>. But there's one thing I didn't flesh out in the preview and that's the DLC's standalone levelling system, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/to-play-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-you-must-defeat-some-of-elden-rings-toughest-bosses">brought to our attention</a> a month or so ago. Well, here I am to flesh it out! Be warned, though, the role of the system is a jarring thing to condense into words.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>For context, I spent around three hours with Shadow Of The Erdtree's opening area, the Gravesite Plains. So my thoughts on the levelling system aren't set in stone, nor are they definitive just yet. That'll have to wait until I get my hands on the entire thing.</p>
<p>Essentially, though, the standalone levelling system revolves around three things: Crosses, Scadutree Fragments, and Revered Ash Blessings.</p>
<p>Crosses are scattered around The Land Of Shadow and look like brilliant, golden shafts of light. Various NPCs you'll talk to early on mention that they're the "footsteps of Miquella" and that you'll want to follow them. One maggot-faced individual eventually hands you a map - inspectable in your inventory - and asks you to track down as many as you can find within the Gravesite Plains. Presumably if you do, you get a reward? Either way, it cements one of their purposes as a pseudo-Site-of-Grace, guiding you to new areas in the DLC. Crosses are distinct from Graces, mind you: you can't interact with them in the same way.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/elden-ring-erdtree-belurat.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Bandai Namco</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Crosses are also where you'll often find Scadutree Fragments, which are the new levelling system's key resource. Acting in a similar way to flask shards or Golden Seeds from the base game, you have a choice whether to cash in Scadutree Fragments when you rest at Graces. Do so and you'll receive a flat buff to your stats, but ONLY in the DLC areas. The moment you leave the Land Of Shadow, you'll lose the buff.</p>
<p>As for Revered Ash Blessings, they act in much the same way as Scadutree Fragments, but grant your summonable pals flat buffs. Again - only in the DLC areas. I can't quite remember how I found these Ash Blessings, but I sort of recall getting one after beating a tough miniboss or as rare, super glinty loot in hard-to-reach areas.</p>
<p>I've been umming and ahhing over what exactly FromSoft's going for with these Scadutree Fragments. Based on my small slice of the DLC, I see the buffs they offer as a necessary way to grow stronger for most players, or to offset characters who've entered the DLC a little underlevelled (players who may not have done all the optional stuff in the base game, say).</p>
<p>But making your redemption of the Ashes and Fragments optional also opens the door for masochists who want a tougher challenge without the buffs. Again, it's hard to know just how much harder it'll be without them, but I'll suppose we'll find that out soon enough when the expansion launches on June 21st.</p>

			<p>Fittingly, Bandai Namco invited Wccftech and a number of other global journalists out to experience an exclusive hands-on with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-story-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upcoming DLC expansion</a> for 2022’s Game of the Year, Elden Ring. The venue of choice was a cemetery in sunny Southern California and after a brief bus ride through Hollywood and passing by rows of elaborate tombstones and a live peacock enclosure, we were greeted by a choir quartet and a life-sized statue of Miquella’s Egg taken straight from Mohgwyn Palace. It’s here that Bandai Namco graciously lets us sit down for the first two hours of the upcoming Shadow of the Erdtree DLC and explore at our leisure, all running on an army of Razer laptops.</p>
<p>After a brief onboarding to discuss the setting and ways to access Elden Ring’s Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, we were given free rein to hit the ground running as one of several level 150 champions, all adequately geared up for the adventure with +25 weapons. Not one for a spellcaster in From Software’s masocore adventures, I stuck with a more traditional DEX-focused swordsman who could wield most of the weapon types available with relative ease. While I started leaning toward the simpler swords (including the new Odachi type), it wasn’t until wielding the throwing daggers in both hands that the combat began to shine. There were indications of a perfume bottle-class weapon available for players to use in the DLC that wasn’t present in the base game. Still, sadly, I didn’t have the foresight to dig that deeply and experiment with the zanier weapon types in the interest of time.</p>
<p>To access the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, From Software and Bandai Namco opted to provide a proper explanation on how to play the content that players paid for, a stark change from the Artorias of the Abyss, where players were expected to blindly explore Lordran and track down a broken necklace and about a dozen other steps. This time, players must first take down two key shardbearers to reach Miquella: Starscourge Radahn and Mohg, Lord of Blood (not to be confused with Mohg, the Omen). There are theories abound as to why it’s these two specific bosses that need to be bested in mortal combat to venture into the Shadowlands, primarily focused on the giant egg that Miquella was attempting to breach from and some lore-appropriate theories as to having to release the stars from Radahn’s imprisonment to venture forth.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ELDENRING_SotE_19_4K-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Throwing daggers are largely what they sound like on the cover: a limitless supply of throwing knives that only consume one’s stamina and are otherwise infinite. Wielding one pair is fine, but the weapon properly showcases its ability when dual-wielded and the nameless Tarnished becomes the modern equivalent of a Touhou boss. Dozens after dozens of daggers can be launched with two main drawbacks: enemies can block and mitigate their damage quite easily and the range on what can hit an enemy is shorter than the actual throwing animation, if by a short margin. The latter can be alleviated by locking onto an enemy and approaching until damage numbers are visible. At the same time, the other might need some skills to back it up, such as a charged throw that can deal heavy poise damage and stagger those hiding behind shields.</p>
<p>Some of the other melee weapons in Elden Ring’s Shadow of the Erdtree that I found to provide significantly varied combat from the base game were in the forms of a dueling shield and the inclusion of proper hand-to-hand melee skills. The dueling shield offers protection in line with medium shield classes while also used like a pile bunker to thrust and damage enemies just out of range of your fists. The new melee archetype lets players string together punches and kicks, and position themselves both to the side and even dashing behind enemies with some of the unique skills for the weapons. However, I wish I could say more positive things about the new weapon types (save for the throwing daggers). Still, getting a proper readout on optimally performing damage was difficult when the two main bosses of the DLC had health bars that easily exceeded 10-thousand hit points apiece.</p>
<p>To offset entering the DLC shadowlands well above the intended power curve, Shadow of the Erdtree features a pair of open-world collectibles that passively imbue the Tarnished with more power. One makes the player more generally more effective at dishing out damage/taking less, while the other increases the effectiveness of summoned spirits. Both of these are upgraded by collecting key items and returning them to a bonfire of protection before upgrading them in the same fashion one would upgrade their flasks of crimson tears. I could foresee this as From Software’s way of balancing the DLC by preventing characters well above the normal power curve from approaching the DLC content with a modest degree of difficulty. How players already deep into their third or seventh New Game Plus run would be able to get into Shadow of the Erdtree without being steamrolled by their first boss was something that Bandai Namco didn’t yet have the full answer for when I spoke with a couple of the representatives leading the marketing push. Sadly, no From Software developers were on-site to address these questions during the preview event.</p>

<p>Two hours was only enough time to get a brief taste of the smörgåsbord of new content Miyazaki and his team had been cooking up. However, it was just enough to get a proper feel for the trials and tribulations against a variety of bosses, explore a new legacy dungeon, and walk away with more questions than answers about Miquella’s true role in the upcoming Shadow of the Erdtree DLC. Besting a giant floating Chinese lion dance that constantly shifted its elemental affinity around rewarded me with a pretty sweet lion helm to wear around the Shadowlands, so that was a nice bonus.</p>
<p>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree will launch on June 21st, 2024, and will be available as a boxed physical edition for $79.99 on PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series S|X, as well as deluxe and collectors editions at $99.99 and $249.99 respectively. Players that already own the base game can purchase just the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC expansion for $39.99</p>

			<p>Octopath Traveler II will be arriving on Xbox Series X|S as well as day-one on Xbox Game Pass later this month, it's been claimed.</p>
<p>This information comes from Spanish leaker eXtas1s, who often writes for outlet Exputer, and was recently spot on with <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his information about Lords of the Fallen coming to Microsoft's subscription service</a>. Interestingly enough, the leaker was also among the first to claim that Microsoft is planning to <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-tier-changes-cod/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make changes to Game Pass tiers due to the Call of Duty franchis</a>e. For those in the unknown - Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-day-one-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently confirmed that the upcoming Black Ops 6 will be coming to Game Pass day-one</a>.</p>
<p>On the Exputer forums, eXtas1s <a href="https://forums.exputer.com/threads/octopath-traveler-2-headed-to-xbox-in-june.77/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now writes</a> that he has learned that 2023's Octopath Traveler sequel will be coming to Xbox Series this month. "It's going to be a day-one Xbox Game Pass game, along with the franchise's first game (Octopath Traveler), which could also be added to the subscription service as well", the leaker added.</p>
<p>During Tokyo Game Show 2023, it was confirmed that Octopath Traveler II <a href="https://wccftech.com/octopath-traveler-ii-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would be launching on Xbox Series X|S in early 2024</a>. We've included the game's Xbox announcement trailer below:</p>
<p><iframe title="OCTOPATH TRAVELER II - Xbox &amp; Windows Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5E-BqssreVQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Released in 2023 for PC, PlayStation 5/4, and Nintendo Switch, offers charming characters alongside beautiful visuals, and an interesting story. Here's what we wrote about the sequel in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/octopath-traveler-ii-same-systems-superior-stories" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch review</a> last year:</p>
<p><em>Octopath Traveler II plays it safe when it comes to its core gameplay, offering a handful of small positive tweaks that don’t entirely make up for returning problems like clumsy party management and battles that take too long to wrap up. Thankfully, the game also takes a big, confident step forward in terms of writing, offering a cast of well-wrought, interesting characters, and a vividly-detailed world you won’t soon forget. Octopath Traveler II may have the same old engine under the hood, but the road trip it takes you on is well worth experiencing.</em></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/skydances-behemoth-preview</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/skydances-behemoth-preview-into-the-great-wide-open.889098/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/skydances-behemoth-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As time goes on, the complexity of VR games is ever-changing. Skydance Games is hoping to take further advantage of that particular platform by putting together immersive adventure games such as the upcoming release of <em>Skydance’s Behemoth</em>. Skydance Games is set to bring this project to multiple platforms later this fall, with the goal of building upon melee combat and hand-based physics that was prominent in the VR title <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/walking-dead-saints-sinners-review-oculus-quest"><em>The Walking Dead: Saints &amp; Sinners</em></a>.</p>

<p>I recently had some hands and eyes-on time with <em>Skydance’s Behemoth</em> at a preview event held a couple of weeks ago. The demo, presented in PlayStation VR 2, offered a glimpse of what using the grand scale of virtual reality can achieve when married with a story-driven immersive experience.</p>

<p>While I got to control the very start of the preview, which allowed me to select various comfort settings – something that feels like a necessity when it comes to free-roaming VR – the bulk of what I saw was demonstrated to me by Shawn Kittlesen, Vice President of Creative for <em>Skydance’s Behemoth</em>.</p>

<p>The demo begins with the main character, Wren, who has been afflicted by a terrible curse that will be important to the course of the story. Wren, who can effectively be anyone you want because that’s really the point of immersive VR, enters the Forsaken Lands – a kingdom that’s been decimated by an ancient curse, in order to take on the daunting Behemoths.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skydance_s-behemoth-screenshot-weapons.jpg?itok=3HhHG_Ki 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skydance_s-behemoth-screenshot-weapons.jpg?itok=lVsEbZTb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>These monsters are scattered across the land, so they’ll be fighting any manner of enemies along the way in order to restore life to a civilization's past.</p>

<p>From the jump, it’s clear that <em>Skydance’s Behemoth</em> has put forth loads of detail into crafting its fantasy world. Just looking around, it’s easy to see the details in the environment, and the little things you can pick up such as a sword – which will come in handy for taking on various enemies of course – and other items such as healing greens, or items for crafting.</p>

<p>Using these items has an element of real-life application to them. For example, you will be moving your hand to sheath and unsheathe your sword like you would in real life. Or lifting a healing item up to your mouth to imbibe it.</p>

<p>Furthermore, this methodology extends to basic attacks. Blocking involves holding the sword perpendicular to the angle of oncoming attacks, and you can parry by swimming against an oncoming attack like you would if you were holding a real sword, just by using the VR controllers.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skydance_s-behemoth-screenshot-grappling-hook.jpg?itok=2MsQWO8n 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skydance_s-behemoth-screenshot-grappling-hook.jpg?itok=qxhi2SzA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In <em>Skydance’s Behemoth</em>, one element that sort of sets it apart from other action games is the addition of a super strength ability. It’s an important one because it allows you to use some fun attacks, like slicing an enemy for a fatality.</p>

<p>The damage against enemies is dynamic too, so you can cut them any way you want. That level of freedom is extended to the world itself as well – there are no invisible walls, and Wren can make use of a grappling hook to get around high places. If you want to jump from high areas, you can do that too.</p>

<p>Crafting comes into play in a more organic way. When you want to craft, there’s a specific station you find, and you put the plants you picked up into a pouch. Said pouch can then be placed on your belt so that you can heal yourself along the way.</p>

<p>There’s a lot to explore in <em>Skydance’s Behemoth</em>, with puzzle rooms that net secret items, as well as other nooks and crannies to discover. There might be secrets in places you never expected to find them in.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skydance_s-behemoth-screenshot-combat.jpg?itok=SMby1zb1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skydance_s-behemoth-screenshot-combat.jpg?itok=tqgTD4uN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>With the power of the current generation platforms such as PlayStation 5, atmosphere effects and physics rendering are fleshed out quite well. The PSVR 2 version specifically, is able to approximate PC ultra settings because of the power of the console itself.</p>

<p>At its core, <em>Skydance’s Behemoth</em> is a physics-based game. The physics are real so you can get all sorts of fun effects going like swinging across planks or using the grappling rope.</p>

<p>Throughout the course of the demo, it became clear that it’s important to learn how to adapt to the situations you find yourself in – particularly when engaging in normal enemy encounters.</p>

<p>Toward the end of the demo, we finally saw one of the game’s titular Behemoths, and what a sight it was. Without giving away the plot, there’s a lot of strategy involved in taking one of these things out, and perhaps most importantly, endurance.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skydance_s-behemoth-screenshot-seal-behemoth.jpg?itok=TE96jIMs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skydance_s-behemoth-screenshot-seal-behemoth.jpg?itok=oPu0ZirR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>A familiar comparison might be something like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/shadow-of-colossus-review-timeless-art"><em>Shadow of the Colossus</em></a>, but with you directly getting that first-person experience through VR. That and these Behemoths aren’t on any set pattern – the one in the demo proved to be plenty of challenge just because it wasn’t entirely predictable. Throw some smaller enemies into the mix during the encounter, and it’s quite a task.</p>

<p>All in all, the demo lasted about 30 minutes, and that was by someone who already knew what they were doing. I could have easily played through the same map and spent an hour or more just exploring around if I had had the time.</p>

<p>That said, this little slice of gameplay did give me a grand perspective on what <em>Skydance’s Behemoth</em> is setting out to do. It’s not just some quick, gimmicky attraction to hold your attention for a few minutes at a time. This feels like the real deal – a fully fleshed out, free-roam action adventure that puts key focus on the narrative, and one that isn’t just converting an existing traditional game into VR.</p>

<p>As someone who in the past wasn’t particularly sold on the merits of VR, I can see the appeal here. Singleplayer narrative games hold a special place in my heart as my typical go-to and <em>Skydance’s Behemoth</em> looks to be a magnificent time when it finally releases later this Fall on PlayStation VR 2, PCVR, and Meta Quest 2 and 3.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24170532/elden-ring-dlc-shadow-of-the-erdtree-preview-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="HuDDhY">My first steps into <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22947204/elden-ring-review-from-software"><em>Elden Ring</em></a>’s new <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24126482/how-to-prepare-dlc-gear-quests-endgame"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> expansion</a> feel like coming home again. After traveling there, by touching a withered arm, I step out into a grassy plain, and see a crumbling giant tree in the distance. The land is pocked with intangible gravestones and spirit-world versions of enemies I’ve faced before: dogs and wandering nobles. But it isn’t long until I face something terrifying in this new region, the Land of Shadow, in the form of a giant walking iron brazier filled with embers and burning prisoners.</p>
<p id="JrCtEc">As I try to slash at that hundred-foot monstrosity, I learn pretty quickly that even the highly leveled, generously equipped knight I’ve been given to play as part of a three-hour preview of the DLC is no match for the thing. It kicks huge, unavoidable piles of flaming debris at me as I try to run away. A handful of other unfamiliar monsters — Gravebirds, smaller cousins of the Death Rite Birds from <em>Elden Ring</em>, and lithe ash-skinned humanoids armed with twin circular blades — pile on and thrash my poor knight.</p>
<p id="cOR4kT">Even at a high level, I’m underprepared for what awaits in the Land of Shadow. But there’s a new kind of power-up scattered around the Gravesite Plain and in dungeons nearby: Scadutree Fragments. These new consumable items are splinters from this world’s version of the Erdtree. They bestow Scadutree Blessing on my knight, boosting virtually all of his stats. <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> players will need to hunt these fragments down to contend with the powerful enemies here. In my three hours of playtime, I found a half-dozen of them with relative ease. I also found plenty of the DLC’s other new power-up, Revered Spirit Ash, an item that makes my Spirit Ashes and my steed, Torrent, stronger. </p>
<p id="UJyuOG">Scadutree Fragments and Revered Spirit Ashes can be used at sites of grace in the Land of Shadow to become stronger, similar to how players use <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/22950763/golden-seed-locations-upgrade-sacred-flask-crimson-tears-cerulean">Golden Seeds</a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/22994386/sacred-tear-locations-map-limgrave-liurnia-caelid-altus">Sacred Tears</a> to empower their flasks in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough"><em>Elden Ring</em></a>. The blessings provided by those new power-ups are immediately apparent, but they only supercharge my character while he’s in the Land of Shadow. (While in that land, you’ll see your stats are boosted with the color yellow. Back in the Lands Between, they revert to white.)</p>

<p id="ZUMMfY">Getting to the Land of Shadow requires two major accomplishments in <em>Elden Ring</em>. You must <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/22993446/radahn-location-general-starscourge">defeat Starscourge Radahn</a> at Redmane Castle and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/24087922/mohg-how-to-beat-boss-strategy">Mohg, Lord of Blood</a> at Mohgwyn Palace. Once you do, you’ll be able to transport to this strange new land with the aid of a knight, one of Miquella’s many followers that you’ll meet in <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>’s adventure.</p>
<p id="781GpP">Meeting the followers of Miquella, all of whom refer to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24131400/elden-ring-dlc-miquella-shadow-of-the-erdtree">the mysterious brother of the swordswoman Malenia</a> as “kindly” or “tender,” I was struck by another difference here in the Land of Shadow: a sense of hope. Unlike the despair that permeates the Lands Between in the main story of <em>Elden Ring</em>, the people you meet in the Land of Shadow all seem content.</p>
<p id="7jLzaF">I met a handful of Miquella’s followers at stations known as Three-Path Crosses, said to represent Miqeulla’s footprints on his journey through this land. At these gold, glowing crosses, I met new NPCs and merchants, some of whom gave me items to use or quests to undertake. One, named Freyja, said she was a former ally of General Radahn. Another claimed to be a servant of Mohg. One Miquella devotee, Moore, was a simple-minded merchant. Unlike many of the confused and downtrodden NPCs typical of FromSoftware’s games, the followers of Miquella all seem unusually happy. They all appear to support you on your mission here, despite your status as a Tarnished. (Why they object to that isn’t quite clear, based on my playtime.)</p>

<p id="8smLxh">Beyond the Gravesite Plain is a handful of legacy dungeons, catacombs, and strongholds. The largest that I saw was Belurat, a massive castle settlement with labyrinthine pathways patrolled by new types of enemies. I fought scorpions of pretty big and terrifyingly big sizes, annoying spellcasters, and humanoid giants. </p>
<p id="Dy5gwe">At the end of my trip through Belurat, I encountered the Divine Beast Dancing Lion, a mess of human limbs, fabric, and a lion’s head, previously seen in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23991138/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-trailer-release-date-dlc"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>’s first trailer</a>. The Dancing Lion attacked with a chaotic rhythm, deploying freezing and lightning-based attacks as I tried to keep up with its frenzied dance. My powerful pre-built knight and a pair of summons — two of Miquella’s followers — made the battle relatively easy (it certainly won’t be that easy with my <em>Elden Ring</em> character). After killing it, the Dancing Lion dropped its own head, which I then proceeded to wear as a comically oversized helmet. That new piece of armor amplified my knight’s strength and dexterity, but lowered the effectiveness of my flasks. </p>
<p id="vVGKZx">Before my trip to the castle of Belurat, I stumbled upon a gaol underneath it, where I discovered the most horrible thing I’ve seen in <em>Elden Ring</em> yet. The Belurat gaol, a catacombs-style dungeon, is full of Living Jars who reside there. But here’s the bad part: The scraps of meat that players typically get from smashing those jars is, in this place, still very much alive. For the first time, we get to see what lives inside the jars: a glistening, tumorous monstrosity that will attack you with their own guts and launch themselves to pin you down. Disgusting though they may be, these jar-meat-people still manage to adhere to <em>Elden Ring</em> director Hidetaka Miyazaki’s famous quote about not relying on “the gross factor” to unnerve players. They’re both repulsive and sad to look upon.</p>

<p id="kWa7UU">The other region available during my hands-on time with the expansion is known as Castle Ensis. It’s a mid-scale legacy dungeon guarded by a new type of giant troll; this one can use magic, a herald of what’s to come (i.e., a lot of sorcerers). While exploring Castle Ensis, I encountered a knight with a giant hammer who, in the process of beating me to death with that hammer, signaled that I wasn’t ready to face him. Reps from Bandai Namco suggested to those in attendance that if we were to face such a challenge, we should seek out additional Scadutree Fragments to become competitive.</p>
<p id="55MD6X">I declined that advice and took the other option in <em>Elden Ring</em>: run past everything. By sprinting through Ensis, I successfully made my way to its boss, Rellana, Twin Moon Knight. She’s a former Carian princess and the younger sister of <em>Elden Ring</em> boss <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/22969148/rennala-tips-tricks-strategy-raya-lucaria-academy-boss-weapons-armor-talisman">Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon</a>. Like Rennala, Rellana can throw magical moons at you while <em>also</em> dual-wielding a pair of long blades that deal magic and fire damage. Like the Dancing Lion, I managed to defeat her, but only with the aid of multiple summoned allies who helped me break her poise and stagger her multiple times.</p>
<p id="0tJONS">My victory can also be credited to a brand-new weapon in the game: my speedy but powerful, poise-breaking light greatsword named — of all things — Milady. Light greatsword is a new class of weapon in <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>. Other new additions include the Backhand Blade, a curved sword held at a backward angle that delivers thrust attacks and slashes to enemies’ flanks; Dryleaf Arts, one of the new martial arts weapons that’s not really a weapon, but a style of hand-to-hand combat; and the Red Bear’s Claw, an actual severed bear paw modified with steel claws.</p>

<p id="3Ah71e">New weapon types I didn’t really get to spend much time with are the previously revealed thrusting shields, which are shields that have pointy ends; throwing blades, a variation on the existing throwing knives that can be equipped as a primary weapon; perfume bottles, also now a primary weapon option; and the great katana, which is, well, a larger version of a standard katana. Bandai Namco and FromSoftware promise 100 new weapons in <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>, with the handful of new additions I tested already feeling like fun new variations on existing fighting styles.</p>
<p id="VXwwJU">During my three hours with the game, I feel like I’ve barely scratched the surface of what <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> will add to <em>Elden Ring</em>. I’ve already spotted some fascinating new characters and lore, intimidating new challenges, and intriguing vibes. Whether the hopeful tenor of Miquella’s followers is authentic or some sort of misdirect before things go terribly south, we’ll all have to discover when <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> is released on June 21. </p>

<p>As I wait for my first movie to premiere, I wonder if I made the right decisions. Was “Argh for Romance” really going to be the hit I needed to make my studio a success? A general audience romance film centered around pirates doesn’t sound that great, but maybe it’ll resonate thanks to the sets I built and the actors I’ve cast. So I wait for the results to come in, and, much to my surprise, it sits in the middle of the pack and my low-budget debut nets $300,000 in profit for “Just Go With It Films”. I was happy but knew there was more work to be done to become the best production studio around.</p>



<p>Those are the general vibes you get from Blockbuster Inc., the new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1793090/Blockbuster_Inc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">movie sim game</a> from developer Super Sly Fox and publisher Ancient Forge.</p>



<figure><p>

Review - The Movies Meets The Sims | Buy, Wait, or Skip" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J2PWVePpYs0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>You start off with an empty plot in Filmwood with dreams of becoming the next big production company. While the game takes inspiration from other management sims like Game Dev Tycoon, there’s a lot more depth here than what many would expect going in.</p>



<p>You have to manage everything in this game. And when I say everything, I mean everything. From the schedule of your staff to where they live to the quality of food you feed them, it’s more than just the acting and set design that makes a successful studio.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And while it sounds like it could be a bit overwhelming, it’s all done in a way that never feels like it’s getting to be too much. Everything is organized and easily accessible, and while decisions on things like housing and food need to be made, it’s not so in the weeds that you’ll get lost. It’s often just a simple menu selection.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Where the heavy depth comes is with the movie and show-creating process. You know, the whole point of Blockbuster Inc..</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-behind-the-camera-in-blockbuster-inc">Behind The Camera In Blockbuster Inc.</h2>



<p>Creating a movie or show is a pretty straightforward process with the level of depth you’d expect based on everything else in the game. To start, you name your product, and choose the type, budget size, genre, theme, and age focus. From there, you have to select your producer, director, writers, and actors while deciding how much or little of various elements should be in the movie. Want a comedy about vampires? You can do that. What about a medieval action flick? That’s no problem.&nbsp;</p>



<div><p>Once you have that basic information finalized, it’s time to choose your sets and direct your scenes. Speaking of sets, you can use the premade ones, build your own for your lot, or utilize the Steam workshop to download sets from other players.</p><p>With your sets chosen, directing your scene comes down to choosing the animations you want to use, the actors involved – you can have up to three in a movie –, any special effects, costumes, and camera positions. As you move through the years and eras, you can unlock better equipment to improve your production quality both during filming and in post production. It’s a nice progression that will see you make better products each time.&nbsp;</p></div>



<p>Here’s the real kicker of the process, though. Full video editing. After filming your scenes, you have to cut, clip, and move the scenes how you want them to make your movie. You can even add sound effects to increase the overall quality. When you’re all done, you can then save your films to your PC to watch back whenever you want.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once a film is out there, you’ll get reviews and feedback, not only for the film as a whole, but each individual scene. You’ll also learn how various actors work together and if the genre you picked was a strong suit for your writers and producers. All to help you make better decisions moving forward.</p>



<p>And like real life, each year there’s an annual award show that will help your studio and actors increase notoriety and revenue as you take home gold.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-expect-the-unexpected">Expect The Unexpected</h2>



<p>Of course, there’s the dark side, so to speak, of running a studio. You have to not only keep your employees and actors happy, but keep an eye out for rival studios keen on poaching your talent as they become more known.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You might have your employees lie about being sick because they were taking an interview with another studio. Another might just throw a tantrum and threaten to quit mid-production. How you handle each situation goes a long way into the respect you earn from your staff and the competing studios.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are even situations that happen that you might not even expect. One such instance was when I started producing my first movie, my lead actor decided to go out and celebrate. That’s all well and good, but he then got into an accident due to driving drunk and needed plastic surgery to fix his face. That would’ve cost my small studio $15,000, which I wasn’t going to just drop on something like this that could’ve been avoided. So, I told him, and his family, I wasn’t paying for it, leaving him “deformed”. He then gained the trait of “ugly” and ultimately became such a problem that I had to fire him. It was a completely unexpected scenario that blew me away.</p>



<p>Now, there are some small issues I have with limitations, specifically with set design and the animations you can choose when creating movies. I feel that for some movies there are plenty of animations, and even set elements to an extent, to pick from while others have slim pickings. It makes you feel like you have to always go towards specific themes and genres to get the best experience when creating your show or movie. It’s something that I think gets added to in future updates, but, right now, it’s a small nitpick of mine.</p>



<p>I also wish editing the animations and camera work was more open. Certain scenes I felt I had less control of than I’d like. Lastly, buying and unlocking newer equipment can feel a bit too easy as you play. It might be by design, but it felt like there was no real challenge in getting better cameras, mics, lighting, and more.</p>



<p>Overall, Blockbuster Inc. is exactly what you’d want from a spiritual successor to a classic game like The Movies. It’s clear the team at Super Sly Fox has a passion for what they’ve built. The freedom you have to do what you want with your movies and shows will keep everyone coming back weeks and months after their first play. And all the extra depth around the movies are just bonuses to an already fun game.</p>

                <p>Voice actress Briana White landed the breakout role of Aerith Gainsborough in 2019's Final Fantasy VII Remake. White also reprised her role for Final Fantasy VII Rebirth earlier this year. However, when it came time for Aerith's show-stopping operatic song, "No Promises To Keep," Loren Allred stepped in to provide Aerith's singing voice. Now, White has revealed why she didn't tackle the song herself, before sharing the relief she felt when Allred performed the scene instead.</p><p>"During recording, I remember that we recorded all of the lines before the theatrical performance, and then there was some reference in the script to singing a song, because she's writing the lyrics in the game," White told <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/06/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-interview-briana-white-aerith-1235943022/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Deadline</a>. "And I'm thinking to myself, 'Are they about to make me sing? Am I ready for that?' I don't think I could handle that. I'd give it my best. I did musical theater growing up, but I am not a trained singer, so I was very nervous. And then it never came back up."</p><p>"It's such a beautiful song, and it's so emotional," continued White. "Of course, I'm tearing up and going; I could never have given that performance. [Allred] does an incredible job. I wouldn't have it any other way, truly."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8ZyP-AsVeA" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/N8ZyP-AsVeA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>While White doesn't sing in the game, she did mention that singing is part of her routine before she attends the recording sessions.</p><p>"I warm up in the car on the way to the booth by singing Disney songs, specifically Disney princess songs," said White. "I think that they have a sort of clarity to their vocal quality, but also a lot of highs and lows, and so that's how I warm up for recording."</p><p>Out of all of the Disney princesses, White believes that Aerith has a lot in common with Rapunzel, which should be interesting if they ever meet during any future Kingdom Hearts sequels.</p><p>"I think [Aerith] actually has a lot in common with Rapunzel," explained White. "And she also has the connection of Aerith [having been] voiced by Mandy Moore in the past, and Mandy Moore voices Rapunzel. But Rapunzel spends most of her life in captivity, and her big arc is being brave enough to go outside and explore the world and see the beauty that it has to offer. She always looks on the bright side. I mean, the connections, they're totally there. I think they would be best friends."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ex-riot-devs-believer-seeks-a-better-way-to-develop-video-games-with-open-source-tool-friendshipper<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <p>CTO Landon McDowell tells us why the new studio is sharing some of the technology behind its debut game</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>The Believer Company has today released its internal development tool Friendshipper as an open-source project.</p>
<p>The studio was founded by veterans from Riot Games and is currently working on a next-generation open-world multiplayer game. Friendshipper is a development tool that the team has been using to improve how efficiently they build this game, such as faster implementation of bug fixes during playtests.</p>
<p>Chief technology officer Landon McDowell tells <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em> the aim of Friendshipper is to "very quickly make changes to the code, quickly do builds, and then get changes in those builds out to ourselves as well as testers."</p>
<p>As for why the studio is sharing this technology with other developers, McDowell puts it down to one simple belief: "There's just a better way to develop video games."</p>
<p>"We've not had the most fantastic experiences throughout our careers, and one of the reasons why we came here is that we knew that we wanted to invest, we wanted to figure out a better way of doing this, for a multitude of reasons," he explains.</p>
<p>"We want to be able to play test more frequently. We want to be able to, as best we can, avoid crunch and some of the more problematic aspects of game development. And we believe that the game development process at its core is part of that."</p>
<p>Since forming last year, The Believer Company has grown to 65 people. Of those, McDowell says only three – "three-ish," to be completely accurate – are dedicated to the development of Friendshipper (although the CTO notes that other members of the team do collaborate on this project at times).</p>
<p>As such, he emphasises that Friendshipper in its current state is just one potential solution to some of the problems game developers face.</p>
<p>"We don't have so much hubris that we think we have all the answers," he says. "We have ideas about things that we want to do differently and things that we want to improve, but there is an entire industry of game developers that have similar experiences and have other ideas about ways to do that.</p>
<p>"The best thing that we can do is to take a shot at what we think are fantastic development tools that are going to solve all sorts of problems in game development. But we want to quickly share that out and start building a community around these tools and ideas so that we can learn and grow from other people's experiences in the industry."</p>
<p>He adds that Friendshipper is also designed to help make development easier because "the act of making games should be a joyous one."</p>
<p>"We believe that players benefit from developers having a great experience developing games," he says. "So we want to share these tools and practices, and build a community around them, because we feel like players as a whole will benefit from the industry adopting development methodologies and practices."</p>
<p>Our conversation with McDowell also touched on other ways in which developers can make games faster, better and cheaper – something the GamesIndustry.biz will explore in more depth during <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/find-out-how-to-make-your-games-cheaper-faster-and-better-with-gi-sprint">our GI Sprint editorial special later this month</a>. Expect more from our chat with McDowell during GI Sprint.</p>
<p>We previously spoke to The Believer Company's CEO Michael Chow and chief product officer Steven Snow shortly after the new studio secured $55 million in seed funding. You can <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/riot-vets-aiming-to-shake-up-multiplayer-with-new-studio-the-believer-company">find out more about the studio's origins and its ambitions in our full interview</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-introduces-a-new-levelling-system-just-for-its-expansion-area/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-introduces-a-new-levelling-system-just-for-its-expansion-area<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="342" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Previews for <em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree </em>are dropping today, and with it, many tidbits about the upcoming expansion. We got to go hands-on with it at an event hosted by Bandai Namco, and one surprising detail we learned about was an additional way to level up your character and their Spirit Ashes, alongside the usual runes and levels.</p> <p data-characters="271" data-current-count="271" data-injectable="false">As part of the gameplay in <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>, the player can come across two different resources: <strong>Scadutree Fragments </strong>and <strong>Revered Spirit Ash Blessings</strong>. Each one corresponds to a different power scale that you can boost up at Sites of Grace within the Realm of Shadow.</p> <p data-characters="454" data-current-count="725" data-injectable="true">Scadutree Fragments give you a boost, increasing the damage you can deal and decreasing damage taken. Even a few made a bit of a noticeable difference in our time with the <em>Elden Ring </em>DLC. Meanwhile, Revered Spirit Ash Blessings proffer benefits to your Spirit Ashes, the summoned allies who can fight by your side in major encounters. Both are found scattered around the open world, as special item pick-ups similar to significant items in the base game.</p>
 <p data-characters="364" data-current-count="364" data-injectable="false">It’s important to note that these new power-scaling measures are <strong>exclusive to the expansion area and content</strong>. So piling up a bunch of Scadutree Fragments won’t make your fight against, say, Malenia any easier. Instead, this seemed like a method for assisting players through some of the tough encounters planned for the <em>Shadow of the Erdtree </em>expansion.</p> <p data-characters="448" data-current-count="812" data-injectable="true">We didn’t get a chance to ask any FromSoft members about the mechanic and why it’s been implemented, but in my own playtime, it did feel like a pretty helpful tool for navigating bosses that would’ve been otherwise much more difficult. Considering there’s a fair level range at which a player could enter the DLC, this might be a way to offer fresh scaling and power increases, even if you’re rocking an endgame build.</p>
 <p data-characters="191" data-current-count="191" data-injectable="false">As for whether it makes the traditionally tough bosses of FromSoftware DLC expansions any easier, we’ll have to wait to see. <em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree </em>launches on June 21, 2024.</p>

The 32-inch Odyssey OLED G8 <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/monitors/gaming/32-odyssey-oled-g8-g80sd-4k-uhd-240hz-0-03ms-smart-gaming-monitor-with-sleek-metal-design-ls32dg802snxza/">(model G80SD) is now available for $1,299.99</a> — making it a smidge cheaper than the first <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/6/23586882/samsung-odyssey-oled-g8-display-price-preorder-specs">$1,499.99 OLED gaming monitor Samsung released last year</a>.</p></div><p>Samsung says the G80SD model is its first AI-powered gaming monitor, featuring the same NQ8 AI Gen3 processor as its recently released <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/tvs/neoqled-tv/">2024 Neo QLED 8K TV</a>. That chip is behind the monitor’s AI-upscaling capabilities, according to Samsung, which enables content and games to be upscaled to almost 4K when run through the monitor’s built-in smart TV apps and Gaming Hub, respectively.</p><div><div><figcaption><em>The slim metal design is, to my eye, unchanged since it was first announced in January.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Samsung</cite></p></div><div><figcaption><em>Here’s the view from the back, showing the monitor’s ports and RGB lighting.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Samsung</cite></p></div></div><p>The company has also updated the G80SD’s cooling system to mitigate OLED burn-in, adding a proprietary “pulsating heat pipe” to the monitor, which Samsung says is five times more effective at diffusing heat than the graphite sheet method it was previously using.

            <p>It's been one month since the sound of engines began. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/these-racing-game-players-are-11-days-into-an-exhausting-race-to-climb-a-deadly-tower">hardest track ever created in Trackmania</a> was published by a team of mappers on May 4th, bringing an intimidating 16-floor tower called Deep Dip 2 into the racing game. It became a magnet for competitive drivers after a prize pool of over $30,000 was offered to the first three players to conquer its hellish heights. The prize has yet to be claimed. Even today, determined racers continue to bang their heads against the brutally designed course, featuring icy surfaces, curving rails, and perilous loop-the-loops that hang kilometres about the ground. Some players have parked their hopes and given up. But others persevere. The top three players have reached the final floor and currently stand shoulder to shoulder, eyes focused on the prize.

<!--more-->
</p><p>At the time of writing, the remaining competitors are warring it out at a particular spot on floor 16, tantalisingly close to the finish line. To proceed, they have to perform a nigh-impossible trick that involves <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2163059065?t=03h44m26s">crawling along a vertical surface on two wheels</a>. It is disgusting. The three players currently in the running are "Larstm", "Hazardu", and "BrenTM" - whose <a href="https://deepdip2.com/leaderboard">personal bests</a> now all stand within a couple of metres of each other.</p>
<p>One racer who has bowed out of the contest is  Øyvind "Wirtual" Iversen, a prominent Trackmania speedster who got as far as floor 14, a hefty achievement in itself. </p>
<p>"It sorta gets to the point where the way we're playing the map now, we just have to drive for half an hour," says Iversen in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxCzLV1pyUs&amp;t=1s">a video</a> where he explains the reasons he is throwing in the towel. "Half an hour of perfect driving without falling just to explore the hardest floor. And it feels very unrewarding in that sense.</p>
<p>"The map I think is too difficult. The difficult floors should be earlier in the map because this way of exploring is so taxing... This is the type of map that you need the determination and iron will of, like, a god. Seriously."</p>

<p>He also admits that, as a YouTuber, he can't do the same thing over and over again and expect viewers to keep tuning in. That, and normal life must go on. "If I keep playing Deep Dip now," he says, "it'll be destructive to the rest of my life."</p>
<p>But Iversen also encourages people to support the remaining drivers.

</p><p>"I am so incredibly impressed with their progress," said Iversen, "and you only get such a huge respect for this the more you play the map... It's completely bewildering to me."</p>
<p>Iversen once <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVzsVE60uqU&amp;t=3s">beat Trackmania blindfolded</a>. When someone like that nopes out of a challenge, you know it's a tortuously difficult task. Yet the end is in sight and, barring some Sisyphean nightmare trap metres before the finish line, one of the remaining contestants is sure to take the prize money any day. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24171051/like-a-dragon-yakuza-show-amazon-prime-video-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="CHhuIK">After the huge success of its <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24122477/fallout-tv-series-review-prime-video-show"><em>Fallout </em>series</a>, Amazon has moved quickly to follow it up with another video game adaptation. <em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza</em>, a live-action Japanese production based on Sega’s long-running series of gangster soaps, drops on Prime Video worldwide on Oct. 25, 2024.</p>
<p id="WcxrEy">Well, half of it does, anyway. It’s a six-episode series, to be released in two chunks: the first three episodes on Oct. 25 and the next three on Nov. 1.</p>
<p id="q4ZMwj">The show follows series protagonist Kazuma Kiryu and his friends across two time periods, in 1995 and 2005 — suggesting an adaptation of the first game, which came out in 2005 and followed Kazuma after he was released from a 10-year prison sentence. Kazuma is played by Ryoma Takeuchi, star of the <em>Kamen Rider Drive </em>series. The series is directed by Masaharu Take, with a story by Sean Crouch and Nakamura Yugo, and a Japanese screenplay by Yoshida Yasuhiro and Yamada Kana.</p>
<p id="WWlgej">Amazon describes the show as “an original crime-suspense-action series” that “follows the life, childhood friends, and repercussions of the decisions of Kazuma Kiryu, a fearsome and peerless Yakuza warrior with a strong sense of justice, duty, and humanity.”</p>
<p id="EsdZPD">“Audience will enjoy the show’s human drama and conflict that unfolds around Kazuma Kiryu,” Takeuchi said in a statement. “Moreover, please take a look Kiryu’s intense fighting scenes with the Dragon tattoo on his back.” </p>
<p id="rmbOkf">Reading between the lines, it seems like Amazon has swooped in to acquire an already-filmed independent Japanese production, which explains why the show’s release is only a few months away. Amazon’s streaming muscle and deep pockets mean the show gets a simultaneous worldwide release, supported by subtitling and/or dubbing in 30 languages.</p>
<p id="k7Wafr">Given not just the success of <em>Fallout</em> and HBO’s <em>The Last of Us </em>but the acclaim and ratings bestowed on FX’s mostly Japanese-language <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24138469/shogun-finale-review-war-toranaga-explained-episode"><em>Shōgun</em></a>, this seems like a clever, opportunistic move from Amazon. To the point: “The unfettered appeal for Japanese content from within Japan and other parts of the world has been growing exponentially,” said James Farrell, head of international originals at Amazon MGM studios.</p>
<p id="OWPSPq">It’s not the first adaptation the Yakuza series has had, though — the first game was adapted into <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/23196727/best-video-game-movies-adaptations-tv-watch-streaming">a typically anarchic movie by Takashi Miike</a> in 2007.</p>

Titled “The Spectacular Failure of the <em>Star Wars </em>Hotel,” it goes into excruciating detail about why the immersive (and expensive) experience went off like a Wookie fart in the Jedi Temple. Throughout the video, there are obvious parallels to recent, spectacularly bad video game launches centered around popular IP, like <em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em> and <em>Marvel’s Avengers</em>. It’s almost as if no amount of lucrative lore can save something when it’s rushed or half-assed, am I right?<br></p><p><em>Star Wars</em>: Galactic Starcruiser opened on March 1, 2022 and permanently closed a year and a half later in September, 2023. The “immersive” experience required guests to stay there for two nights—no more, no less. (Nicholson’s stay cost just over $3,000 per person, though the lowest possible option was $1,209 per person.) During your stay, you spend almost the entire time “on” the Starcruiser, which promised wild views of space you could glimpse through its fake windows, and an excursion to Disney’s <em>Star Wars</em> world, aka Galaxy’s Edge. </p><div data-video-id="196653" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: A Star Wars Classic Returns &amp; More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="105" data-playlist="196653,195840,196049" data-current="196653"><div><p>The Week In Games: A Star Wars Classic Returns &amp; More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22209.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>“Immersion” was the big promise here—you’d get pulled into your own unique storyline that was meant to seamlessly weave into other guests’ storylines as well as those of the cast members working at the hotel, like a real-world RPG. If you wanted to turn it into a proper LARPing (live action role playing) experience, you could even wear full <em>Star Wars</em> attire while staying there. </p><p>The experience proved lackluster for the price point, and thus the Galactic Starcruiser closed last year. Jenny Nicholson exhumed its corpse in her May 18 video, opening the floodgates for derision from fans, a litany of memes, and even a weird, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://screenrant.com/star-wars-galactic-starcruiser-hotel-what-everyone-gets-wrong/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://screenrant.com/star-wars-galactic-starcruiser-hotel-what-everyone-gets-wrong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PR-heavy <em>ScreenRant</em> article from a former Starcruiser employee</a></span>.<br></p><p>There are so many details packed into this YouTube video (which is roughly the length of <em>A New Hope</em> and <em>Empire Strikes Back</em> combined), that I couldn’t even approach properly covering it, but there are some really stark parallels to poorly received video games that stand out, from the bugged quest lines to the bevy of microtransactions that serve as a reminder of the perils of putting all your eggs in one IP basket. </p><figure id="" data-id="91ebc643fee28507b410fba8dc4dc50b" data-recommend-id="image://91ebc643fee28507b410fba8dc4dc50b" data-format="jpg" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Galactic Starcruiser concept art shows a busy lobby full of aliens, robots, Stormtroopers, and more.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h146381"><a id=""></a><strong>The <em>Star Wars</em> hotel: expectations vs reality</strong></h2><p>First, there’s the stark contrast between concept art and reality. Concept art is just that—a concept, so while there’s some expectation that the final product will at least resemble the concept art, it’s not something that can make or break a video game or a real-world experience. Except, that is, when the wonder and promise of the concept art dwarfs the reality of the final product, or when things from that concept art are excised from the final product entirely. Both of those things happened at the <em>Star Wars</em> hotel.<br></p><p>All of the concept art for the Galactic Starcruiser showed that the common areas would be bustling hives filled with space citizens and droids, while giant windows offered a breathtaking look out into space. As Nicholson shows in her video, the lobby of the hotel has a few tiny windows that are <em>way </em>up high on the walls, far enough away to avoid close inspection, and nowhere near eye-level. Meanwhile, the space station-themed restaurant in Epcot has a ton of gigantic fake windows looking out into virtual space.<br></p><p>Things were clearly rushed or cut here. There was one droid roaming around amongst hotel guests, not several skittering around the space. There were a few actors in alien makeup, not a ton. Many times the actors and droids appeared in balcony in the lobby that was inaccessible to guests. </p><p> Nicholson even points out the rooms were needlessly small—as this isn’t a real cruise ship of the sea or the stars, there’s no similar size restrictions Disney had to stay within—likely to cut costs so that the company could maximize its profits.</p><figure id="" data-id="6a181ec2b8f2ced5a20128dc20889b33" data-recommend-id="image://6a181ec2b8f2ced5a20128dc20889b33" data-format="jpg" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="More concept art of the Star Wars hotel.

You could pay $169 for the Memory Maker package, which ensured that the roaming photographers would snap pictures of you living this immersive experience and that you had access to unlimited downloads of those photos. You could also pay $399 for a half-hour private photo shoot, but this package was added at a later date, and appears to have negatively affected those who bought the original, $169 Memory Maker tier, as Nicholson claims she saw no roaming photographers during her stay—apparently they were too busy covering the private photo shoots.<br></p><p>And, as Nicholson points out, though your stay at the hotel would get you seven hours of time in the Disney parks, there were tons of paid add-ons that were <em>not </em>included: lightsaber building ($220), droid building ($100), or a table at Oga’s Cantina (food and drink not included). The Galactic Starcruiser staff also suggested people arrive the night before their stay so that they wouldn’t miss out on any of the activities—another hidden cost.<br></p><p>All of this is reminiscent of the recent, worrying trend: full-priced video games being released that are littered with microtransactions. This is different from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/live-service-games-95-studios-destiny-suicide-squad-1851221959&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/live-service-games-95-studios-destiny-suicide-squad-1851221959">free-to-play titles</a></span> like <em>Fortnite</em> or <em>Overwatch</em>, which are also littered with microtransactions but at least allow you to get your foot in the door for free. The exorbitant pricing of the <em>Star Wars</em> hotel and its equally pricy add-ons is a direct parallel to AAA games charging the new $70 norm just to offer you even more crap to spend your hard-earned money on.<br></p><p>Like <em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em>. Though it was developed by <em>Batman Arkham </em>studio Rocksteady, it adopted the microtransaction trend: You’d have to spend $70 to buy the game (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/suicide-squad-kill-justice-server-offline-major-bug-1851205221&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/suicide-squad-kill-justice-server-offline-major-bug-1851205221">which launched in a fairly broken state</a></span>), and if you wanted to unlock its new characters you have to grind its battle pass—or pay up.<br></p><p>Or what about <em>Diablo 4</em>, another full-priced game that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-shop-cosmetic-armor-mounts-microtransactions-1850498188&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-shop-cosmetic-armor-mounts-microtransactions-1850498188">offered $25 armor sets</a></span>, a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-iv-season-malignant-battle-pass-platinum-1850671621&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-iv-season-malignant-battle-pass-platinum-1850671621">battle pass that many considered at one point to be “stingy</a></span>,” and a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-dlc-30-portal-colors-bundle-blizzard-1851252883&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-dlc-30-portal-colors-bundle-blizzard-1851252883">fast-travel portal that cost you $30</a></span>?<br></p><p>Or the <em>NBA 2K</em> games, which are also not free-to-play and which, at one point, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nba-2k23-durag-microtransaction-vc-finders-keepers-1849640528&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nba-2k23-durag-microtransaction-vc-finders-keepers-1849640528">charged $5 for virtual durag</a></span>s (when IRL ones cost you about $3).

Nicholson makes a parallel with the notoriously cheap, paid-option-heavy Spirit Airlines, which is still usually a pretty economical way to fly, but can feel more grating because it explicitly charges you for amenities that other airlines bake into the cost of your ticket. Nicholson asks you to imagine Disney’s “immersive” hotel experience is like if Spirit Airlines “actually cost more…and all those amenities still cost extra.”</p><figure id="" data-id="ecb48e871e842a4180bbbea90095e36c" data-recommend-id="image://ecb48e871e842a4180bbbea90095e36c" data-format="jpg" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Concept art shows parents and their kids standing in a Star Wars hotel room." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Concept art shows parents and their kids standing in a Star Wars hotel room." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney / Lucasfilm</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ecb48e871e842a4180bbbea90095e36c" data-recommend-id="image://ecb48e871e842a4180bbbea90095e36c" data-format="jpg" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Concept art shows parents and their kids standing in a Star Wars hotel room." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h146383"><a id=""></a><strong>The <em>Star Wars</em> hotel’s bugged quests</strong></h2><p>For the marketing push leading up to the opening of the Galactic Starcruiser, Disney released a few Imagineer roundtables that delved deeper into what guests could expect. As Nicholson points out, one of those roundtables suggested you’d be able to “help someone stow away” or break someone out of the brig, or run into a “galactic superstar” during your stay. One video even suggested that there was a “love story” on board.<br></p><p>Nicholson’s video lays out how the RPG elements of the Starcruiser worked: the cast (which included a Togrutan, a Twi-Lek, and a Rodian) were the NPCs of this world, and an app that you had to use on your phone let you “communicate” with these characters and others. Those characters would “text” you via the app, and you could reply by choosing a few pre-written options.<br></p><p>There were rumors swirling that the Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) bracelets all the guests had to wear were somehow transmitting info to the actors, including things like whether you’d responded to a specific character positively in the app, which would, in turn, increase (or decrease) your trust score with them. Yes, this is all exactly like how an RPG works.</p><p>Except it didn’t work.<br></p><p>“The gameplay did not work for us at all,” Nicholson says in her video. “At some point there was some sort of critical logistical failure which broke every aspect of it.

It’s the heat death of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the bevy of schlocky, subpar games tied to hugely expensive franchises like <em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em> or <em>Gotham Knights—</em>the late-game excisions made to rush out a product, the crunch to release something quickly to capitalize on fans’ shifting interests. Corners get cut, original ideas get sanded down until they are barely reminiscent echoes of a much more palpable promise—and you have to pay a premium to experience this smoothness.</p><p>The failure of the <em>Star Wars</em> hotel reminds me of the lead-up to the launch of <em>Starfield</em>: the hype, the deep-dive videos, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/starfield-rpg-planets-xbox-pc-gaming-todd-howard-1850565329&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-rpg-planets-xbox-pc-gaming-todd-howard-1850565329">the 1,000 planets</a></span> promise, the assurance from Microsoft that this would be <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/starfield-xbox-microsoft-bethesda-rpg-game-pass-1850531802&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-xbox-microsoft-bethesda-rpg-game-pass-1850531802">“one of the most important RPGs ever made,</a></span>” just for us to get an unsurprising, thoroughly Bethesda experience.

No it wasn’t, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/starfield-game-bethesda-xbox-pc-metacritic-reddit-hype-1850819494&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-game-bethesda-xbox-pc-metacritic-reddit-hype-1850819494">even if it was just <em>Skyrim </em>in space</a></span>—because you weren’t charged $3K to experience it. The <em>Star Wars </em>hotel was an abject failure, because it did not deliver what was promised after you forked over a massive sum of cash.<br></p><p>The rabid <em>Star Wars</em> fan base will pay just about anything for an experience or item that is unique, different, or exclusive, and the Galactic Starcruiser promised just that.

Going since 2005's original <em>Yakuza</em>, and most recently releasing its ninth mainline entry, <em>Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth</em> in January, 2024, the franchise also sports multiple spin-off games, Japanese-only releases, and the inevitable remakes of older games to confuse anyone who isn’t paying close attention. Oh, and yeah, it switched English-language names over the last five years, ditching the <em>Yakuza</em> moniker for <em>Like a Dragon</em> as its official title.</p><p>Amazon Prime’s show is to compromise on that,  titled <em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza</em>, flipping around the ordering of 2019's game name to ensure maximum confusion. However, it’s not the first live-action TV show based on the game, that honor going to 2010's <em>Kurohyō: Ryū ga Gotoku Shinshō </em>based on the PSP spin-off game, airing only in Japan. It then had a sequel based on the following PSP release, <em>Kurohyō 2: Ryū ga Gotoku Ashura hen</em>. You can find it all on YouTube if you look, and it has some powerful soap opera vibes. It’s safe to say Prime’s version will sport a somewhat larger budget.</p><p>Filmed in Japan, and in Japanese, Amazon plans to subtitle <em>and</em> dub the show for international audiences. It will star Ryoma Takeuchi (<em>Kamen Rider: Drive</em>) as lead character Kazuma Kiryu, with direction by Masaharu Take (<em>We Make Antiques</em>) and Kengo Takimoto (<em>Kamen Teacher</em>), in a six-episode show taking place in both 1995 and 2005.</p><p>The storyline, as described by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/like-a-dragon-yakuza-live-action-series-sega-game-prime-video-1236024275/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/like-a-dragon-yakuza-live-action-series-sega-game-prime-video-1236024275/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Variety</em></a></span>, will be “the life, childhood friends and the repercussions of the decisions of a fearsome and peerless Yakuza warrior with a strong sense of justice, duty, and humanity.”</p><p>It appears to have the official seal of approval by the video games’ writer and producer Masayoshi Yokoyama, who has an executive producer credit on the program. While making it clear that he had no desire to rewrite events based on games he’d previously made, he seems very happy with the job done by others. “If I were ever sent to the past through some kind of cosmic joke, this is the experience I’d want to create. If I had to go through the wringer anyhow, I’d want to make the most engaging versions of Kamurochō and Kazuma Kiryu I could —and this show has it all.”</p><p><em>Like A Dragon: Yakuza</em> will be dropped in two three-episode batches, one on October 25, the next on November 1, although there’s no information yet on how long each episode will be.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/epic-games-acknowledges-%E2%80%98pay-to-win%E2%80%99-car-skins-in-fortnite.889044/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-epic/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Epic confesses to having pay-to-win car skins in Chapter 5 Season 3 of Fortnite. These skins will continue to be pay-to-win till the next update. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortnite’s Chapter 5 Season 3 has been all about cars, which is understandable as it is the ‘Mad Max’ themed season. This is why as soon as you enter the battle royale title, you get to experience a battlefield for vehicular warfare this season. A lot of the end game depends on having the faster, stronger and deadlier car, which is why even a slight advantage can be crucial. Hence, players will not be happy to learn that there are pay-to-win skins in Fortnite right now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The pay-to-win nature of these skins is as clear as day and it was best explained by a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@nickeh30/video/7375289587100290309" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TikTok video</a> from popular content creator NickEh30. In the video, NickEh30 demonstrates how the car skins that can be acquired for free in Fortnite have a wider windscreen. This allows enemy players to either get into the passenger seat and shoot the driver through the window, or aim at them easily from the ground. However, the story is very different once you get to the paid skins. Some of these models, for cosmetic reasons, have much smaller windscreens, which makes it harder for players to shoot at the drivers.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>This is a clear disadvantage for other players who haven’t spent real money on these car skins. According to a report by Kotaku, Epic Games has acknowledged the situation, stating that they are “aware” of the issue and have a “fix planned for an upcoming build.” This means players will still have to be on the lookout for these pay-to-win cars until the next update.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, The Employee from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lethal-company-coming-fortnite-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lethal Company</a> is now available in the Fortnite Item Shop. </p>



<p>What are your thoughts on the situation? Let us know in the comments.&nbsp;</p>
