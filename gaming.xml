<p>GSC Game World has announced that Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl has finally gone gold after many years of development. The open-world survival shooter, which is one of this year’s most highly anticipated games, has been in development on and off for more than a decade, but on November 20, it’ll finally be released to the world.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-long-time-coming">Long Time Coming</h2>



<p>I played Stalker 2 at Gamescom and can attest to how incredible of an experience GSC has compiled for long-awaiting fans. It was an entirely different world when the last major Stalker game was released, and what we’ll be getting our hands on when November 20 comes around is leagues beyond what already exists in the series.</p>



<p>From sumptuous visuals to a remarkable combat engine, and intense survival mechanics to an open world bursting with side activities, Stalker 2 has stacks of meat on the post-apocalyptic bones.</p>

</p></figure>







<p>Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl will drop on the Game Pass subscription service the day it launches, which is a huge win for gamers everywhere. If you’d rather go above and beyond, the game has a <strong>ridiculous </strong>collector’s edition that’s probably one of the most expansive versions of a game I’ve ever seen.</p>



<p>Recently, the team also revealed the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-pc-specs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game’s PC requirements</a>, unveiling a specification that’s not all that demanding, considering it’s a top-shelf open-world game being released in late 2024.</p>



<p>Are you going to be playing Stalker 2? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a> what you’re most looking forward to about the game.</p>

<p>Tony Todd, the voice of Venom in Spider-Man 2, has sadly passed away at the age of 69. The late actor’s representatives first revealed the news to Deadline, stating that he died of natural causes. It was confirmed that he passed away in his home in Los Angeles on November 6, one month before his 70th birthday.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-legendary-presence">Legendary Presence</h2>



<p>Tony Todd enjoyed a lengthy, star-studded career that included 40 years of television, film, and video games. Best known for his role in the Candyman movies, this enigmatic and versatile performer contributed to hundreds of productions over the years.</p>



<p>His spree through video games started in 1998 with a Star Trek title, and a few years later, he was voicing aliens in Half-Life 2. He’d come to play characters in Call of Duty: Black Ops II, Dota 2, and Back 4 Blood, but his most recent and impactful role was as Venom in Spider-Man 2.</p>



<p>While playing Venom, Todd revealed that he spent more time in the voiceover booth than in any previous role in his entire career. He also played fast and loose with some of the game’s juicier tidbits before launch, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/spider-man-2-september-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teasing the release date</a> and content drops on social media, much to the amusement of fans worldwide.</p>



<p>Tony Todd was a talented and spirited individual known by many as a gentle giant, and he’ll be greatly missed. Our thoughts are with those who survive him.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24291592/arcane-season-2-review-netflix<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>The first season of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22763818/netflix-league-of-legends-arcane-review">Netflix and Riot’s <em>Arcane</em></a> animated series fashioned disparate pieces of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/19/18099147/league-of-legends-marvel-comics-game-lore-riot"><em>League of Legends </em>lore</a> into a beautiful, devastating tale about a society on the brink of collapse. The show infused each of its characters with a depth and complexity that felt unlike anything Riot had done <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/8/22567914/league-of-legends-riot-games-sentinels-of-light-novel">elsewhere in the longrunning franchise</a>. And its commitment to telling its own story made it remarkably easy for new fans to dive in.</p><p>There’s a density to <em>Arcane</em>’s second season that feels reflective of the show’s creative team working to bring this juggernaut of a story to a satisfying end in just nine short episodes. Especially since it has been three years since season 1, you might need a refresher on how things became so dire for the citizens of Piltover and Zaun. But while the new season drops you right back into the chaos in a somewhat disorienting way, it does an excellent job of weaving together the many different threads of <em>Arcane</em>’s powerful legend.</p><p><em>Arcane</em>’s first season ended with a literal bang — an explosive attack from Jinx (Ella Purnell) on the elite council members of Piltover just as they were about to sign a peace treaty that would have brought an end to their war on the impoverished people of Zaun. Though Jinx’s attack was rooted in years of personal psychological torment and her growing up as part of Zaun’s abused, disenfranchised underclass, it was a moment that made her sister Vi (Hailee Steinfeld) see truly her as a terroristic monster. It wasn’t clear who might emerge from the smoking rubble in the end, but there was no question about how much harder Piltover would retaliate with its dangerous Hextech weapons.</p><p><em>Arcane</em>’s second season picks up in the immediate aftermath of the attack to emphasize the sheer amount of destruction Jinx caused in her crusade to make Piltover pay for its history of injustices. With so many of Piltover’s political leaders dead, the city’s priorities and its balance of power have to shift in ways that feel necessary to Vi and other survivors like enforcer Caitlyn Kiramman (Katie Leung). But while the new season takes some time to make you appreciate the magnitude of Piltover’s loss, it pushes this act of <em>Arcane</em>’s story into motion by exploring how oppressive societies create the monsters they ultimately come to hate and fear.</p><p>Everyone suffers as <em>Arcane </em>moves its characters into a new phase of conflict, but the show uses Vi and Jinx in particular to highlight how profoundly war can unmoor people from their senses of self. It’s easier for the sisters to let one another go than it is for either of them to see themselves in the other’s face. And when presented with chances to channel their feelings into action, it seldom occurs to them how fighting just to hurt the other side is guaranteed to cause self-inflicted wounds.</p><p><em>Arcane </em>repeatedly echoes that idea as it briskly shifts focus to the rest of its cast and brings the devastating danger of Hextech into sharp focus. Inventor Jayce Talis (Kevin Alejandro) and politician Mel Medarda (Toks Olagundoye) can understand the gravity of the escalation her warhawk mother Ambessa (Ellen Thomas) is hungry for. But that foresight can only do so much to keep the calls for a full-on invasion of Zaun at bay.</p><p><em>Arcane</em>’s second season uses the rising tension and Jayce’s fears about what he has helped create to delve deeper into the magical mysteries of Hextech with a subplot that zooms far out into new realms of the <em>League of Legends </em>universe. It’s another way the show reinforces its ideas about actions coming with consequences that aren’t immediately obvious up close. And in some of <em>Arcane</em>’s characters, it crystalizes how heavy a price the planet can pay as humanity wages war.</p><p>Hextech also features largely in most of this season’s more visually stunning set pieces, which are once again truly the show’s greatest strength. Though the show as a whole is still utterly gorgeous, the action feels even more brutal this time around. On occasion, the “cool” needle drops feel a bit tone deaf because of how frank <em>Arcane</em> is trying to be in its depiction of a society tearing itself apart. But that has always kinda been <em>Arcane</em>’s vibe, and the season really leaning into it will likely appeal to hardcore fans.</p><p>Because the stakes are even higher and all of <em>Arcane</em>’s players are now fully locked into the war, this season’s first three episodes often feel more narratively dense and like they’re moving at a much faster pace. That might be more exhausting if the season was dropping all at once, but Netflix has smartly chosen to split it up into three separate acts set to debut through the end of the month. We won’t know until the end of November just how <em>Arcane</em>’s creators intend to bring this story to a close and whether it might set the stage for whatever’s coming next for the franchise. But this first act is a strong opener for <em>Arcane</em>’s final chapter.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We are Venom... forever."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/jJ4zIyBERE" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/jJ4zIyBERE</a></p>— Insomniac Games (@insomniacgames) <a href="https://twitter.com/insomniacgames/status/1855085273035530368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 9, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Other fans also paid tribute to Todd, calling him a "horror legend" as well as a terrific character actor. Bloody Disgusting Editor in Chief John Squires wrote, "The loss of Tony Todd is a monumental loss for the horror world. One of the all-time greats. We say it a lot. Horror icon. Horror legend. He embodied all of that. Made every movie he was in better. A staple of the convention scene. A true member of this horror family. Deeply sad."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat. Have a tip?

If it's charity speed runs you want, then it's charity speed runs you'll get; Awesome Games Done Quick organisers have announced the annual seven-day event will return in January 2025, and its full speedrun schedule is available to peruse now.
</p>
<p>
More specifically, Awesome Games Done Quick 2025 runs from 5th-12th January next year, featuring over 130 speedruns across its duration. And as per its <a href="https://gamesdonequick.com/schedule/52">newly released schedule</a>, the line-up is a typically eclectic one, covering everything from triple-A blockbuster titles and indie games to retro classics and other assorted oddities.
</p>
<p>
Proceedings get underway at 4:30pm GMT on Sunday, 5th January, with an introductory pre-amble ahead of an All Parts speedrun of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pikmin">Pikmin</a> on Switch by RayOken. Things then come to a close seven days later with a Map Randomizer Race speedrun of Super Metroid - starring Andy, Eddie, imyt, and Oatsngoats - at 4:10am on Sunday, 12th January.

<p>
Inbetween, there's everything from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine</a> to The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, as well as the traditional Awful Games Done Quick block - which this year kicks off with Superman 64 at 3:24am on Thursday, 9th January, before forging onward with the likes of Golf With Your Grandmother, Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing, and the superbly named Doronko Wanko. Also of note is the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/crazy-taxi">Crazy Taxi</a> speedrun on Saturday, 11th January, which will be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1sjLtAk3EU">accompanied by a live rock band</a> playing renditions of its in-game tunes.
</p><p>
If you're looking to attend Awesome Games Done Quick 2025 in-person, it's being held at the Wyndham Grand in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, for the second time in a row, and <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#inbox/FMfcgzQXKDWWRRbtgZMmlScwxxFHLgbX">registration is now open</a>. Of course, if that's too much of an impractical trek, the whole thing is also being streamed online <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gamesdonequick">via the Games Done Quick channel on Twitch</a> as it happens.
</p>
<p>
Awesome Games Done Quick 2025 is once again raising money for the Prevent Cancer Foundation, after this year's event amassed £1.9m for the charity back in January. Its sister event, Summer Games Done Quick 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-games-done-quick-2024-raises-19m-taking-its-lifetime-charitable-total-to-40m">raised £1.9m for Doctors Without Borders</a> in July, taking the organisation's lifetime charitable total to over £40m.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/deep-regrets-developer-voices-potential-impact-of-imposing-us-trade-tariffs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The developer of Deep Regrets has voiced the financial risks of proposed US trade tariffs. The tabletop developer is the first to articulate this major commerce issue facing the entire board game industry, one that can be financially devastating.</p>

<h2>The <em>Deep Regrets</em> Risk Update</h2>

<p>In a recent update on its <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tettix/deep-regrets-an-unfortunate-fishing-game/description">Kickstarter page</a>, the developer of <em>Deep Regrets</em>, Judson Cowan, informed backers on game developments. It started with rudimentary updates regarding updates to the pledge manager, issues with declined card payments, and that the manufacturing was officially underway.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/deep-regrets-kickstarter-promo-artwork.jpg?itok=tm_x2zAD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/deep-regrets-kickstarter-promo-artwork.jpg?itok=3mRXx4iX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Then Cowan went into a risk update. Cowan mentions the immediate impact of the recent US election, the victory of former president and convicted criminal Donald Trump. Specifically, the administration would impose trade tariffs on imported products. These tariffs were a highly advertised part of Trump's campaign, though it is a strategy <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/08/politics/tariffs-donald-trump-strategy/index.html">not fully formed</a>.</p>

<p>The impact of these tariffs would devastate the entire board game industry. <em>Deep Regrets</em> is no different. If the tariffs are imposed by the time the game reaches store shelves in February, the price of importing the game to the US could increase by 60%, roughly costing $100,000 more.</p>

<p>The reason for this is that the aim of these trade tariffs is on imported products from China. Roughly 90% of all board game manufacturing happens overseas in China. A potential side effect may mean board game companies will increase their prices to recoup these costs.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/deep-regrets-board-screenshot.jpg?itok=67Tbu2Yi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/deep-regrets-board-screenshot.jpg?itok=jf_woPOv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This won't affect how customers receive <em>Deep Regrets</em>, Cowan has restated he will do everything possible to ensure US backers get their copy of the game. However, Cowan remakes that the tariffs may potentially affect his ability to sell board games in the US, or even continue to make and sell board games period.</p>

<p>This will not be the last time such stories will occur in the tabletop industry. Amongst the many geopolitical, sociologically, and economic ramifications of a second Trump presidential terms, one of them maybe higher costs for board game experiences across the board. <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> cards, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer</em></a> miniatures, and potentially TTRPG books.</p>

The lawsuit claims that shortly after the company had his monetized YouTube channel and other accounts shut down, the streamer told Nintendo he would help people find “newer and updated copies” of the abandoned Switch emulators to help them pirate games.</p><p> “LOVE YA’LL! CAPITALISM IS CANCER! MY CHANNEL IS BEING DELETED FOR SHARING GAMEPLAY VIDEOS! THIS IS YOUR REWARD!” Keighin wrote in one of his posts. If you haven’t heard of him before now, it’s probably because his social media accounts were small, and his reach was very, very limited. It certainly <em>seems</em> like his ongoing defiance of the Switch maker led the company to try and make an example out of him.

<p>You need money. We all need money, but we’ll have to settle for virtual cash in a game like Planet Coaster 2. At least in that world, you have total control and can plop down an entire roller coaster in your backyard. I tried that once, and the city sent a zoning expert to shut everything down. Anyway, you can earn more money in Planet Coaster 2, and I’d like to help your amusement park flourish with a few tips!</p>



<h2 id="h-best-ways-to-make-more-money-in-planet-coaster-2">Best Ways to Make More Money in Planet Coaster 2</h2>



<p>Without a constant and ever-growing source of income, you can’t reinvest in your park to open additional rides, like rollercoasters and carousels, or expand your offerings to the new waterpark mechanics. But earning more money in Planet Coaster 2 is easier said than done, right? Nope, here are a few tips:</p>



<h3 id="h-lower-the-entry-fee-to-free">Lower the Entry Fee to Free</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>First and foremost, open up your Park Management screen. It’s the top-most icon on the top left-hand side of the screen. Here, you can alter your Park Options, including the price of admission for the various ticket and pass types in the game.</p>



<p>Here, I recommend lowering your entry tickets to $0.00. That’s right; allow everyone free entry to your for-profit amusement park. Doing so will entice more visitors to check out your park, where you stand to make money. With the ticket prices free, people can spend more on drinks, food, merchandise, and the rides themselves. Jack up those prices, baby!</p>



<h3 id="h-add-scenery-to-rides">Add Scenery to Rides</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Don’t forget about the scenery as you expand your park, plopping down a new ride or two along your most recent expansion. It’s easy to ignore scenery, as everything little bit costs money. It’ll feel as if you’re hemorrhaging money initially. But trust me when I tell you it’s an investment with long-term gains.</p>



<p>The scenery in Planet Coaster 2 directly increases ride and park appeal, which increases the Prestige of your attractions. As appeal and Prestige increase, so does guest happiness. They’ll spend more time at your park, riding the rides and buying merchandise, making you money.</p>



<h3 id="h-relax">Relax!</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>I like to watch whatever show I’m binging while playing a game like Planet Coaster 2. Inevitably, you still encounter slow periods of gameplay where it’s often best to sit back and relax. For instance, once you’re profitable, with a handful of rides and attractions bringing in customers, speed up the game and chill.</p>



<p>Now’s a good time to catch up on Reddit, read a chapter in your book, or catch a few moments of your favorite show while your park works in the background, constantly ticking up those dollar signs with every passing second.</p>

And, again, the big issue here is that this is <em>Pokémon</em> doing it to an audience with a huge proportion of children, and indeed delivering it in the most byzantine way imaginable.</p><p>To discover just how bonkers this all is, on the game’s main page, there’s a button on the bottom-right with three lines. Tap that, and there’s an option below “Shop” called “Items.” Click on this innocuous little word, and the lunacy is revealed.</p><p>Let’s lay it all out:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Poké gold (non-paid)</li><li>Poké gold (paid)</li><li>Shinedust</li><li>Shop ticket</li><li>Special shop ticket</li><li>Premium ticket</li><li>Pack Hourglass</li><li>Wonder Hourglass</li><li>Event Hourglass</li><li>Advance Ticket</li><li>Event Shop Ticket (Meowth)</li><li>Emblem Ticket (Genetic Apex)</li><li>Rewind Watch</li></ul><p>Now, we’re being generous here, including the two types of gold as one to get to that total of 12. And if your list doesn’t have that many, that’s because you currently don’t own any of them. It’s a list that just keeps expanding, and given the specificity of the Event Shop Ticket and Emblem Ticket, we must assume that there are other types of these to come.</p><p>You might expect me here to go through explaining what each type does, but you know what? Not even The Pokémon Company seems willing to share that. That Advance Ticket’s entry reads, “This ticket cannot be used yet. Wait and see what it’s for!”</p><p>Um, no? Just tell me? It’s already annoying enough as it is.</p><figure id="" data-id="048e105d6c3449b0bf3cf18b9820490c" data-recommend-id="image://048e105d6c3449b0bf3cf18b9820490c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Items page in Pocket, on a blurry background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Items page in Pocket, on a blurry background." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="048e105d6c3449b0bf3cf18b9820490c" data-recommend-id="image://048e105d6c3449b0bf3cf18b9820490c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Items page in Pocket, on a blurry background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Most of these currencies are used to buy items from specific pages of the game’s shop, which itself is laid out as if it got caught in one of those Doctor Strange spells where all the buildings and train tracks start spinning and weaving inside one another. To spend the Event Shop Ticket (Meowth), you need to go to the “Limited Time / Events” section of the shop, and then to the Event page within that, as distinct from the Premium page, Poké gold page, and the mysterious and always-empty “Other.” There’s another Other in the “Main” section of the shop, which is also empty! Is it empty of the same things? No one knows!</p><p>Special Shop Tickets are gained when you sacrifice multiple versions of full-art or better cards, which the game never explains at any point, and require you to have somehow gathered three or more of the same incredibly rare art. We’re talking about cards with a 0.3 percent (or worse, getting as low as 0.013 percent) chance of coming out of a pack here. You get <em>one</em> of those per card (I know, because infuriatingly I’ve somehow pulled three of the gorgeous Snorlax full-art card), and the cheapest item in this shop costs <em>seven</em> Special Shop Tickets. That’s for the presentation backgrounds, rather than the fancy black-and-silver sleeves, playmat or coin you might want—they cost 12 tickets each!</p><p>Oh wait! Hang on! It <em>is</em> thirteen currencies, because I completely forgot to include Pack Points! Yeah, there’s yet another system that it doesn’t even bother to remember when listing what you own. These are the points you can use to exchange for cards you might want in your deck, gained by opening packs, and only appearing—not when you’re building packs or on any of the card screens—but when you’re on the page to select a new sealed pack to open...</p><p>WHO LET ANY OF THIS HAPPEN?!</p><p>I have to stop writing now, in case I discover a fourteenth currency I’d not seen before now and have an aneurysm.</p><p>And why is it like this? To deliberately confuse you. To make sure you’re never certain which currency is one you should be holding onto and which is one that has no other purpose than to be spent there and then. And to constantly dangle numbers in front of you that could get higher if only you bought just a teensy bit of gold. Some directly, like hourglasses, where shortages can be made up by subbing in gold you own; others indirectly by only arriving if you buy the (abysmal) Premium Pass, or won by continuing playing that Event where you just ran out of hourglasses...</p><p>Next time, the <em>eight</em> different pages of Missions!</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That film, which I love, tells the story of a blue, pudgy alien criminal who crashes in Hawaii and befriends a little girl as he pretends to be her puppy to avoid being captured by authorities. As with all of Disney’s popular animated movies these days, <em>Lilo &amp; Stitch</em> is getting remade as a live-action film. And our first real look at the character has me nervous. </p><p>On November 8, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/DisneyStudios/status/1854968360397640011&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/DisneyStudios/status/1854968360397640011" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the official Disney Twitter account posted</a></span> an image of Stitch as he will appear in the May 2025 live-action adaptation of the animated movie.

My first complaint is simple: He’s not blue enough! </p><p>My second complaint is that Stitch doesn’t look pudgy and round enough. One of the best parts of<em> Lilo &amp; Stitch</em> is how characters in the movie have this round and oblong appearance<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://characterdesignreferences.com/art-of-animation-5/art-of-lilo-stitch&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://characterdesignreferences.com/art-of-animation-5/art-of-lilo-stitch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">. It was very different from the usual house style</a></span> seen in most Disney animated flicks back in the day, and as a kid, I adored that visual. Stitch was cute and very funny, too, which also helped me fall in love with the film.</p><p>This new Stitch is giving me live-action Sonic vibes, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-movie-first-trailer-ugly-design-delay-redesign-1851446390&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-movie-first-trailer-ugly-design-delay-redesign-1851446390">but before he was fixed and made less ugly and horrible looking.</a></span> That’s not a good thing! </p><p>Now, let me just say that I’m not angry about Stitch’s new look. I’m not going to send threatening messages to people who worked on the film or start some online campaign to harass people or create videos complaining that Disney is “ruining” Stitch. </p><p>At the end of the day, this is a movie designed for kids. It ain’t for me. And if I really, really don’t like the new Stich, I can just watch the OG film and not worry about the remake. See, this is how adults handle this kind of stuff. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/a-minecraft-movie-trailer-jack-black-kids-1851640395&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/a-minecraft-movie-trailer-jack-black-kids-1851640395">You don’t need to get angry or toxic</a></span>. Just point out that something is either not for you or objectively bad and move on. </p><p><em>Lilo &amp; Stitch</em> arrives in theaters on May 23, 2025. I hope he looks more blue in the actual movie. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Today, Sony <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-reaches-65-5-million-units-sold-favorable-quarter-leads-sony-to-up-its-gaming-forecast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> its Q2 2024 financial report, revealing that the PlayStation 5 had reached 65.5 million units and the quarter had performed well enough to warrant an upgrade to the full-year forecast for the gaming segment.</p>
<p>Following the report, the usual investors call saw PlayStation Co-CEO Hiroki Totoki talking about a couple of hot topics. Speaking of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/concord-offline-september-6th/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">failure of Concord</a>, which led to wasting over $200 million spent on the project and to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-shuts-down-firewalk-studios-maker-of-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closure</a> of the developer Firewalk Studios last week, he said (excerpt <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/sony-leads-say-the-company-gained-a-lot-of-experience-from-concords-failure-and-will-have-to-do-more-user-testing-or-internal-evaluation-in-the-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via GamesRadar</a>):</p>
<p><em>Currently, we are still in the process of learning. Basically, with regards to new IP, of course, you don't know the result until you actually try it. So for us, for our reflection, we probably need to have a lot of gates, including user testing or internal evaluation, and the timing of such gates. And then we need to bring them forward, and we should have done those gates much earlier than we did. Also, we have a siloed organization, so going beyond the boundaries of those organizations in terms of development, and also sales, I think that could have been much smoother.</em></p>
<p>Totoki also <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/sony-boss-admits-forcing-pc-gamers-into-playstation-accounts-can-invite-pushback-but-insists-they-have-to-keep-games-safe-which-doesnt-really-track-in-single-player/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talked </a>about the pushback of PC gamers on Sony's hard requirement to create a PlayStation Network account in games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-gets-review-bombed-on-steam-amid-the-psn-linking-requirement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">God of War Ragnarök</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-pc-upgrade-adds-mandatory-psn-account-requirement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</a>. The executive admitted that users haven't liked the policy, but he stressed the need to ensure safety in live service games through the PSN account requirement:</p>
<p><em>We have learned a lot. The way to face the issues regarding PC, for instance. The PlayStation accounts that we have offered – well actually, by offering them, for instance, sometimes that tends to invite pushback. But for the live service games, in order to maintain order of the gaming so that anybody can enjoy the games safely, we need to create an environment conducive to that and, of course, enjoying the game freely. </em><em>Having some restrictions, may not call it rule, but to ask the users and gamers to follow the manner, those manners are very important and we have to continue to seek the best way to achieve this.</em></p>
<p>The thing is, neither of those two games are live service titles. They're single player games, and PC gamers rightfully do not understand why they'd have to create a PSN account to play titles that do not even have any online functionality.</p>

It's got hexagonal maps, flesh trees, gangly Evangelion-grade giants, "otherworldly hymns of decay", nuclear bombs, and a player-led "blend of magic and cyberpunk" that extends from the city architecture to the research component. All of which is my cup of giblets. Here's the launch trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>OK, as and when I play, I'm probably going to turn off that unit dialogue. Why does everybody sound so chipper about being forced to trade blows with tentacle beasts? But the putrid scenery is inviting, and I like the sound of a "combat-focused" 4X with battles taking place on the same map as exploration and construction. I also like the premise of, essentially, deciding what particular flavour of sci-fantasy you want your civ to become. Will you field a robot army dolled up with alien gadgets, channel dark forces from beyond the veil, or some combination of the two? Here's some blurb:</p>
<blockquote><p>Humanity emerges, hesitantly, into ruination. Almost nothing is left of the world as we knew it--settlements, forests, seas, mountains--all have been blasted into unfamiliarity. Horribly mutated animals hunt in packs through deformed woodland. Decrepit military robots stumble unknowingly through the ruins, sensors and logic centres blown. Alien soldiers, once impossibly powerful, cower in the wrecks of their ships, praying to heedless gods for rescue.</p>
<p>Control the survivors of humanity in a near-future apocalypse of alien origin. Pick a path between the indifferent abominations of the Voice and the uncaring automata of ZEPHON, with city management, turn-based tactical combat, unholy research, diplomatic maneuvering, and branching narrative quests. Gather your allies and pick your actions wisely.</p></blockquote>
<p>And here are some numbers. Over 50 unique units in battle! Over 150 technologies! Six kinds of climate to worry about as you paint the map! 11 tiered resources to account for when running your economy! OK, that's enough numbers. Don't fret, there are more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1481170/ZEPHON/">the Steam page</a>.</p><p>The aforesaid Gladius came out in 2018, at the height of the pre-Edwin period. It appears to have been well-received. How terribly embarrassing, then, for my vaunted predecessors at Rock Paper Shotgun, who never managed to review it. Fraser (RPS in peace) did <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-gladius-relics-of-war-killed-off-all-the-diplomats">write about the absence of diplomatic options</a>. Zephon appears to be cut from the same cloth, even if it's comparatively deficient in Tyranids.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-comic-hunters-board-game-review.1031367/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-comic-hunters-board-game-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Collecting comic books has been a thing for as long as the comic industry has been around. There's an almost irresistable allure to having that one issue featuring the debut of your favorite hero or the one where a lovable character dies. I have dipped my toe into the comic-collecting hobby from time to time, and that was why I had to have Comic Hunters, if for nothing other than all the official comic covers the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-marvel-board-games">Marvel-themed board game</a> features. </p><div catalogid="b2d5765a-319b-4a3d-95dc-44885f751402" id="210193"><div id="210193" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Marvel Comic Hunters</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Designed by Robert Coelho with Art by Diego Sa, Comic Hunters was initially released exclusively in Brazil back in 2020 but, thanks to Spin Master and Arcane Wonders, has now been released in the United States. In Comic Hunters, anywhere from one to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-4-players">four players</a> compete with one another, traveling from flea markets to auction houses, in the attempt to snag those classic Marvel comic issues to make the most valuable collection of them all. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The core idea of Comic Hunters is that players draft cards to make the most valuable collection of comics. Each game allows you to set the market value either randomly or by hand-picking which heroes or types of comics are the most sought-after. To keep things interesting, drafting is done in five different ways, including players taking a card from a drawn hand of cards and passing the remainders to the next player, bidding on a blind pool of cards, and more. Once you have your new set of comics, you build your collections, paying for the cards you keep with the other cards you drafted but are opting to discard. The more of a certain hero or type of comic (first appearance, outfit change, epic battle, etc.) the more points you will get at the end of the game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a process that, once you've gone through it once or twice, you and the other players will fly through. It results in a game that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-quick-playing-board-games-in-2024">doesn’t take long to play</a> at all, but that initial time figuring out how all the different methods of drafting works can be a bit tedious as the rulebook doesn’t explain it very clearly. Multiple times during my first game, I had to stop and reread the rules to figure it out. Luckily, though, the whole game flow is quick and smooth once you wrap your brain around it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With being playable <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games">solo</a> or with up to four players, Comic Hunters feels like a different game depending on your player count. My favorite setup is playing it as a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-2-player-board-games">two-player board game</a> against one other person. With two players, cards and player collections are manageable enough (each player’s sets are openly displayed in front of them) to make it a game where you can not only strategize what cards are best for you to expand your sets but also what could hinder your opponent too. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">At three and four players, the number of cards out and around the table can get overwhelming and instead often changed into more of a solitaire experience where I was only focused on my own sets and not stopping others, which admittedly may be more attractive to many players. For me, though, I appreciate the addition of that little bit of conflict. Fair warning: Comic Hunters can trigger decision paralysis, so be wary if that's an issue for you or the people you want to play against.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are several avenues to score points come the end the game – the sets of hero comics you have, the types of issues you have, the star tickets you have left that you didn’t use during auctions – so depending on how many comics you’ve managed to get, counting up the various symbols and figuring out how to best organize your sets for the most points can be a bit of a chore. My best recommendation to alleviate this is to simply keep track as you play with tally marks on how much of any one type you have in a set at any given time and adjust after the end of each set-building phase.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Comic Hunters’ initial “WOW!” factor and draw is thanks to all of the classic <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/comics/marvel-comics">Marvel comics</a> featured on the cards. It’s longevity and how well it keeps your interest will depend entirely on how much you like drafting and set collection games.  I had a fine time with the game (especially with the added adversary aspect at lower player counts mentioned earlier). I found the inclusion of having multiple drafting types helps the experience, but I never stopped wishing that there was another layer to the game. Maybe you could trade with others, or maybe there was a way to influence what the most desirable comics were midgame to try and swing things in your favor. Instead, you get drafting with a side of drafting, with a bit more drafting. The most interesting aspect of Comic Hunters is how you pay for the cards in your set with other cards you drafted, causing me to look for things I wanted and also chaff that I could snag to pay for the cards I wanted to collect. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the art of all the covers is nice, and it was fun to stumble across issues featured in my own collection, the same can’t be said for the quality of the components themselves, with the gameboard being the only part that felt solid. The cardboard used for the player markers and comic-type tokens is incredibly thin, and even when I was punching them out of the board, they came on, I was worried I would tear them. The cards don’t feel much better; in my copy, the cards seemed to have an odd lip around them, with paper that's stiffer than I would like. In an ideal world, I would love to have a bit larger and sturdier cardboard tokens or better-feeling cards, but with the game coming in at $25, I can give the lower quality a bit of a pass.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Where to Buy</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QODE6D?object_uuid=7265e117-ee68-4d71-b34a-ef48d7ab8436&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp6J24?object_uuid=7265e117-ee68-4d71-b34a-ef48d7ab8436&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Barnes &amp; Noble</a></li></ul></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Nov 8, 2024 7:00 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">With a small box, a low price tag, and a healthy dose of Marvel nostalgia, Comic Hunters is an enticing game. For fans of drafting and set collection board games, Comic Hunters is an easy recommendation. If that mechanic isn’t quite your thing, then this may not be the game for you, even if you are a massive fan of Spider-Man and friends. Comic Hunters has a great idea and theme behind it. The idea of trying to hunt down that one elusive comic to complete your collection could easily be applied to versions that feature sports cards, DC comics, video games, and more.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
