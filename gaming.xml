            <p>Everybody stay calm. You're about to read about landlords and the prospect of paying rent. Don't worry, there probably aren't any landlords in the room right now. There are, however, new landlords in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, should you choose to install this <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-cyberpunk-2077-mods">mod</a> that introduces a whole bunch of expanded mechanics and details when it comes to cyberflats.</p>
<p>It's called Eviction Notice, and it's a substantial overhaul of how housing works in the futuristic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>. Gone are the days of just living for free in Megabuilding H10, or walking up to one of the newer pads added in by the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-update-15-is-out-now-with-better-ai-reworked-perks-appearance-customisation-and-more">1.5 update</a> and paying a one-time fee for permanent access. Clearly these options are too idealistic, and your merc with a toaster transplanted into their face needs to battle their most terrifing foe yet: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cd-project-devs-want-to-call-out-big-problems-like-homelessness-and-the-wealth-gap-in-cyberpunk-2077-sequel">fiscal responsibility</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Enter this <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/23187?tab=description">"story-driven rent system"</a> that modder DarkFortuneTeller has put together. Once it's installed, the five main apartments you can live in across Night City require regular rent payments if you want to avoid being evicted. All of this is communicated and maintained by "an eclectic cast of real estate agents, chat bots, and landlords" that the mod establishes as characters via a series of over 450 new text messages they'll send you at various points.</p>
<p>When you lay down that initial payment on a flat, which the mod treats as a security deposit, you'll get a message from your soulless chatbot or soulless human landlord introducing themselves. I assume it feels like the opening to a Souls boss fight, except this time with a selfie that wouldn't feel out of place on your aunt or uncle's Facebook profile. "They each have a unique personality (and a few surprises) that I hope you enjoy discovering," DarkFortuneTeller writes of these leech-like Lichdragon Fortissaxes.</p>
<p>One of them even has a loyalty quest you can complete to earn a discount on your rent and the option to buy the Glen apartment outright. The modder plans to add more of these quests via future updates, as well as extra "special requests" that look to work like hotel room service for the swankier digs. You'll be glad to learn they've already implemented the ability for toffs who buy the Corpo Plaza flat to order flowers delivered to their pad, I assume in case their mum visits.</p>

</figure>
<p>"The goal was to add an additional layer of storytelling and difficulty, without dominating the entire gameplay experience," DarkFortuneTeller wrote of their work, "In the early game, you should feel the added pressure of making sure you have enough to cover the rent at the end of the week. You may even decide to downsize by moving out of Megabuilding H10 to save a few eddies. You'll also need to make choices about how many apartments you should rent at once."</p>
<p>In line with that, the game's first act doesn't require you to pay any rent. Then, once V's found their feet and gained a certain brain passenger, they're introduced via text to an estate agent called Bob. Bob can help you do things like move in and out of different flats, with those you've moved out of no longer requiring rent payments. How often rent must be paid, and several other aspects of the mod's systems, can be tweaked via an in-game menu that uses <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4885">Mod Settings</a>.</p>
<p>Impressively detailed realism-themed mods like this one are usually a bit hit-or-miss for me, but I reckon this might well be one I give a go, having <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-money-making-how-to-make-eddies-fast">fairly easily afforded</a> nearly all of the game's flats only a bit of the way into Act 2 of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-update-23-motors-into-your-life-this-week-with-new-cars-auto-driving-a-taxi-service-and-more">post-2.3 update</a> Cyberpunk playthrough I started a couple of weeks ago. After all, there's nothing like having to pay tribute to wrathful deities who can chuck you onto the streets at a whim to really make those side-gigs feel more meaningful. If you fancy giving it a go, you'll also need Cyberpunk load order staples <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4198">ArchiveXL</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/7780">Codeware</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/2380">RED4ext</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/1511">redscript</a>, and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4197">TweakXL</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-gets-its-most-effective-horror-mod-yet-a-story-driven-rent-system-featuring-landlord-selfies]]></content:encoded>

              <p><em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s open beta weekend drew in over a half a million people playing at the same time, smashing the all-time concurrent player record of <em>Call of Duty</em>. People, we have ourselves a good-old-fashioned FPS game-off.</p> <p>In these awful times, where ludicrous shareholder expectations and bigwig dividends drive publishers into wantonly firing hundreds of developers at a time, gaming rivalries feels like such an anachronism. There used to be a time when we could revel in two major franchises going head-to-head, massive companies trying to outdo the other, albeit with legions of overly-invested fans on either side spoiling it with their fervor. Now, that just sounds like a recipe for at least one well-respected development team getting wiped out.</p> <p>But, if there’s any franchises that can survive an old-fashioned two-game race, it’s&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em> and&nbsp;<em>Battlefield</em>. In fact, most of the previous big-noise battles involved <em>Call of Duty</em> at some point–the very first game in 2002 was created by a bunch of <em>Medal of Honor</em> devs who’d walked out on EA after a contract dispute, setting up its first rivalry. But for a very long time now, <em>CoD</em> has walked alone, dominating the holiday season every year no matter how mediocre it might be. Not this year though.</p> <p>This weekend, as recorded by&nbsp;<em>SteamDB</em>, the public beta for EA’s&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em> peaked at <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3081410/charts/">521,079</a> concurrent players. The best&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em> has ever managed is <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1938090/charts/">491,670</a>. Now, those&nbsp;<em>CoD&nbsp;</em>numbers are hardly to be sniffed at, but it’s worth remembering this is based on the combination of both&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6</em> and&nbsp;<em>Warzone</em> combined, and indeed after the extremely mainstream game has been available to buy in stores, as well as being the first&nbsp;<em>CoD</em> to be included day one as part of Xbox Game Pass. Then, if you want to argue for the other side, the&nbsp;<em>BF6</em> weekend was free and didn’t require pre-ordering the game, so might not be at all representative of how many people will show up to buy the game when it launches October 10.</p>

 <p>Still, EA must be dancing foot to foot. <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-huge-player-count-steam-beta-jurassic-forza-castle-crashers-2000616307">The beta had over 300,000 trying to play it</a> before it even started, and then generated headlines with both <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-bf6-open-beta-revive-medic-help-me-ea-fps-ps5-2000616628">how people were playing</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-cheating-cheaters-hacks-ea-dice-secureboot-pc-2000616686">how others were cheating</a>. Beating a Goliath like&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em>, no matter the specifics, must be giving everyone involved a lot of confidence in the new game, especially following <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-2042-the-kotaku-review-1848123654">the extremely muted response</a> to 2021’s <em>Battlefied 2042</em>, even <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-2042-bf2042-season-2-two-02-impressions-dlc-1849496591">after a year of fixes and updates</a>, with <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-2042-refund-petition-ea-bf2042-change-1848524654">hundreds of thousands demanding their money back</a>.</p> <p>Of course, we have no idea how many people&nbsp;<em>total</em> played the beta. Concurrent player numbers are the only real measure we have, and while a very useful measure of popularity, don’t give us the whole picture. It could be that half a million people played total, all showing up at once, or that the 480,000 who played on Sunday were made up of many people who weren’t included in Saturday’s peak. Only EA could tell us, and unless they skew enormously favorably, likely won’t.</p> <p>Whether these numbers will be replicated on release remains to be seen. Activision is being extremely shy about&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 7</em>‘s release date, only pinning it down to before the end of 2025. My guess is that the publisher will avoid releasing too close to the initial buzz for <em>Battlefield 6</em>, perhaps opting for an early November date, hoping to pick up players who’ve burned out after a month of <i>Battlefield</i> and are looking for their next game. That’s not going to stop anyone (including us) comparing the two games in meticulous detail, of course.</p> <p>There’s a second, extended open beta weekend for&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>&nbsp;this week, starting Thursday 14 through Sunday 17.</p>

<p><a href="https://uk.turtlebeach.com/products/airlite-fit-wired-gaming-headset-nintendo-switch-2?Color=Charcoal+Black&amp;srsltid=AfmBOoqqGxjQC5pKcsfuS3eUsng3rzE_7ozq7uRb9y29Bpz3gg-nIrPnPX4">Turtle Beach's Airlite Fir for Switch 2</a> is a little less expensive than the wireless Atlas Air headset that we've got placed on our best-of-list, though, to the tune of over £100, in fact. Yes, this brand new wired headset comes in at a very reasonable £19.99/€24.99, making it a hugely affordable bit of kit.</p>
<p>As an updated version of the company's Airlite Fit for Switch 1, a headset that was very well-received when it launched earlier this year, this <em>should</em> be a very decent choice for anyone looking for something that isn't gonna cost them a fortune, or as a solid choice for kids that you don't mind seeing get a little bashed about.</p>
<p>In terms of updates over the Switch 1 version, well, there doesn't seem to be any internal changes, the differences seem to be of a cosmetic nature only, with some new detailing and an all-new choice of colour for Switch 2 fans.</p>
<p>Here's some further details from the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Working with our partners at Nintendo, we are excited to release our latest Airlite Fit headset for a lightweight and comfortable gaming experience, licensed for Nintendo Switch 2...With proven, excellent audio performance at an affordable price, the Airlite Fit enhances the amazing experiences on Nintendo Switch 2 for gamers everywhere.”</p>
<p>Enjoy a superior level of gaming and comfort with the new Turtle Beach Airlite Fit wired gaming headset for Nintendo Switch 2 and Nintendo Switch systems. Officially licensed and expertly designed in-house, this headset delivers finely tuned audio through high-quality 40mm speakers, providing an immersive experience for both casual and competitive gamers alike. The elevated over-ear jersey knit cushions offer exceptional comfort, letting gamers hear every crisp high and deep low while effectively blocking out external noise.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Several reports indicate that Battlefield 6’s anti-cheat software is asking players to remove Valorant from their systems. </p>



<p>Electronic Arts announced that Battlefield 6’s open beta was their <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-biggest-ever-ea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">largest open beta to date</a>. However, the test version of the game was plagued by cheaters, with BF6’s anti-cheat engine blocking over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-anti-cheat-blocked-cheating-attempts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">330,000 cheating attempts</a>. Interestingly, the same cheat engine seems to be facing an issue with Valorant. </p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-anti-cheat-wants-players-to-uninstall-valorant">Battlefield 6 Anti-Cheat Wants Players to Uninstall Valorant </h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/battlefield-bf-battlefield-6-bf6-anti-cheat-valorant-conflict/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGamer</a>, several reports about Battlefield 6’s anti-cheat engine facing issues with Valorant have surfaced on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mlwcbl/battlefield_6_just_told_me_to_uninstall_valorant/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">r/Battlefield</a>. All the reports include a screenshot of the same ‘Security Violation’ pop-up, which states that BF6 failed to launch due to ‘general software incompatibility’. The pop-up further asks players to “uninstall the conflicting software, or adjust its settings”, and the software in question is Valorant. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>A post by Revolutionary Sun on <a href="https://x.com/_WCS_/status/1954339677647040" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> states that Battlefield 6’s anti-cheat engine, Javelin and Valorant’s anti-cheat engine, Vanguard, are clashing due to secure boot kernel-level access. </p>



<p>In other news, Battlefield 6 Open Beta surpassed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-battlefield-6-conucrrent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">500,000 concurrent players</a> on Steam, crossing Call of Duty’s all-time high. Additionally, the former Blizzard boss thinks that BF6 will “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-is-going-to-boot-stomp-call-of-duty-this-year-according-to-former-blizzard-boss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">boot stomp</a>” Call of Duty this year, which in turn will be better for FPS games.

            <p>On 9th September, Riot Games' fighting game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/project-l">2XKO</a> will release into its closed beta. The game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/league-of-legends-free-to-play-fighter-officially-named-2xko">first announced officially in February 2024</a>, would appear to the layperson as a quick turnaround. The reality for those who have kept their eyes peeled for any crumb of info about the game couldn't be further from the truth.</p>
<p>Back in March 2016, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/3/8/11181204/riot-games-acquires-radiant-entertainment/">Riot Games acquired Radiant Entertainment</a>, developers of forward-thinking fighter Rising Thunder. It's here that whispers about a Riot fighting game first circulated. Then, in 2019, Riot Games revealed the then-called <strong>Project L</strong> as part of the publisher's 10th anniversary. This 1v1 fighter would later be scrapped, with development restarting towards the 2v2 duo play fighting game we have today.</p>
<p>The consequence of this timeline is that for the ultra dedicated 2XKO fans, this game has been almost a ten years in the waiting. For those with a decent memory, six years and counting. As such a perception has risen among a portion of the fighting game fanbase, one of impatience and general confusion as to why things have taken so long.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>At Evo 2025, I sat down with both 2XKO executive producer Tom Cannon and game director Shaun Rivera, and asked whether the game was revealed too early, and the conflict between what the team considers the 'proper reveal' versus the 'perceived reveal' of a game a decade in the making. Would they go back and re-think the reveal of Project L if they could?</p>
<p>"I don't know that I would," says Tom Cannon. "For sure, there was a cost to doing that. It puts a clock in player's minds, now the meme is [that there's been] nine years of development. The reality was that we were deep in R&amp;D when we showed that. But we needed the player's reaction to that announcement to sort of kick us in the butt, and inspire us to make something that was… special and different."</p>
<p>Cannon continues: "On the timeline when we don't do that, I don't know if we end up with <strong>this</strong> game. There were costs for sure, but y'know, when we showed that we paid a lot of attention to how fighting game fans were reacting. The reaction we got was 'oh wow, that looks interesting, I'll check it out'. We wanted people jumping out of their chairs! We didn't get that reaction, so we had to do better and take it back to the shop."</p>
<p>Rivera shares Cannon's lack of regret on the matter, pointing to the openness of the development process as a strength of 2XKO, and Riot Games in general: "For our team, we haven't spent decades making a fighting game. We're learning as we go. One of the things that I really love about working at Riot - I just celebrated my 13th anniversary - this company really encourages all their developers working there to talk to players. When I think back to myself when I played fighting games a long time ago, I wanted to know what the developers were thinking.</p>
<p>"The fact we have this opportunity to put this game in front of players like in Alpha Lab 1 and 2, and at Evo, it's something I'm pumped about. To your point, hey, has it been too long? I think people just want to play the game. But we're learning as we go through, and we have this date now: 9th September."</p>

</figure>
<p>While, these days, information and play tests for 2XKO are abundant, those early years were often islands composed of teases separated by oceans of radio silence. Can anything be done about the perceived development time for Riot's fighting game? Rivera doesn't believe so.</p>
<p>"Not really. Honestly, once Radiant was acquired, there's a lot of amazing folks who worked on Rising Thunder who are still on our team today - Tom and Tony included. We're sitting at Evo, right? Once people hear that and go, 'cool, fighting game when?' With the first 1v1 version of the game we tested with players before my time, there was a feeling that it was cool, but that it wasn't good enough.</p>
<p>"I've been on the project for five years, we made the choice to make a 2v2 duo play game. It's a big difference, right? This version of the game has not been the full length of time, but there's no way to avoid that acquisition."</p>
<p>When asked if this perception versus reality is a problem, he concluded by stating there's only one thing the team can do about it: get the game in front of people and build from there.</p>
<p>"Sometimes you've just got to deal with it, you know. This is one of those instances where there was a lot of love for Rising Thunder, Tom and Tony.  It's no surprise that there's excitement around that. It's something we've got to push through, and at the end of the day the way you solve it is by getting the game in front of players and keep making it better over time."</p>
<p>With 2XKO, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/with-2xko-riot-aims-to-make-a-beginner-friendly-fighting-game-but-will-that-ever-be-possible">Riot aims to make a beginner-friendly fighting game</a>, and taking this long in development is a key aspect of that plan. We're going to have to wait just a little bit longer, though, to see whether that decision - and the cost of the notably early reveal - will bear any fruit.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/was-riot-games-fighting-game-2xko-revealed-too-early-interview]]></content:encoded>

<p>The developers of Pokémon TCG Pocket, DeNA, have revealed that they are aiming to release a ‘major update’ in 2025. </p>



<p>During the latest earnings <a href="https://ssl4.eir-parts.net/doc/2432/ir_material3/256980/00.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report</a>, DeNA revealed several details about Pokémon TCG Pocket’s progress over Q1 FY2025 and their future actions. The report states that average monthly active users for the first quarter were approximately 39 million. Close to 60% of the virtual currency consumption came from international markets, and subscriptions are seeing “steady demand”.</p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-tcg-pocket-s-major-update-will-focus-on-retention-and-login-frequency">Pokémon TCG Pocket’s Major Update will Focus on Retention and Login Frequency</h2>



<p>Regarding future actions, DeNA states that “New user acquisition remains steady”; however, the retention rate of existing users is decreasing compared to the initial launch period. Maintaining a monthly active user base has become a priority for them. The developers have recognised “initiatives to improve retention rate and login frequency, such as enhancement of collection experience.”</p>



<p>The developers are now planning and developing a “major update” for Pokémon TCG Pocket, which will focus on improving the retention rate and login frequency of users. The details of this update will be announced later; however, we do know that DeNA is planning to release it “within this calendar year”. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lego-batman-is-getting-the-skywalker-saga-treatment-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1266852/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A recent claim suggests that a LEGO Batman game inspired by LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is scheduled to release in 2026. </p>



<p>The last LEGO title players received was Horizon Adventures, based on PlayStation’s popular series. Since then, we have received a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-party-announced-for-september-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release date</a> for a new game, LEGO Party, which is an upcoming 4-player party game. Now, reports indicate that a LEGO Batman game is in development, scheduled for release in 2026. </p>



<h2 id="h-lego-batman-will-cover-multiple-movies-in-skywalker-saga-style">LEGO Batman Will Cover Multiple Movies in Skywalker Saga Style</h2>



<p>Details about the LEGO Batman title, following the style of The Skywalker Saga, come from LEGO Game News on <a href="https://x.com/LEGOTtNewsI/status/1954565600816107616" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter). The account had previously reported on a <a href="https://x.com/legottnewsi/status/1947420735846420926" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">rumour</a> that stated the next LEGO game by TT Games will follow multiple movies based on Batman. Moreover, the game could potentially be revealed at Gamescom 2025’s Opening Night Live. </p>



<p>Their new post follows up on the previous rumour, stating “The next Game is a Skywalker Saga styled LEGO Batman that is not connected to the original trilogy (Due Spring 2026).” In the comment section, the user has also stated that there’s a strong chance that this game will feature “one Gotham city and you can choose the era.”</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>ICYM: Here’s an overall review of the 2023 TT Games RUMORS that occurred in January of that year with little more extra context. </p><p> – LEGO Disney and the LEGO Marvel Guardians Game was cancelled</p><p> – A ‘Skywalker Saga’ styled LEGO Harry Potter Game was in the pitch stage, but… <a href="https://t.co/1Pz5PCH2xH">pic.twitter.com/1Pz5PCH2xH</a></p></div>— LEGO Games News (@LEGOTtNewsI) <a href="https://twitter.com/LEGOTtNewsI/status/1954565600816107616?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 10, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga was a title that allowed players to start playing from any trilogy and included all nine films. Players were also able to visit different popular locales from the Skywalker Saga films, with the game allowing them to unlock and explore 23 other planets. </p>



<p>The same post also provides players with information on other LEGO games that were cancelled. It seems LEGO Disney and LEGO Marvel Guardians of the Galaxy were scrapped. Furthermore, there was also “A ‘Skywalker Saga’ styled LEGO Harry Potter Game” being pitched, but it never went past it.” Players should approach these details about the LEGO Batman game and other titles cautiously, as they lack official confirmation.</p>



<p>In other news, a LEGO Nintendo Game Boy set is scheduled for release in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-nintendo-game-boy-price-pre-order/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">early October</a>. Also, here’s Insider Gaming’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-party-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-on preview</a> of LEGO  Party!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Crossfire franchise is about to expand with a new installment that looks very different from most of its predecessors. The series was created by Smilegate in 2007 and had enormous success, especially in China, as a tactical first-person shooter centered on objective-oriented game modes. For a while, it was even reportedly the most played game in the world before League of Legends surpassed it in 2017.</p>



<p>Smilegate tried to conquer the West, too, with CrossfireX, a new entry made specifically for the Xbox One and Xbox Series S|X consoles with the help of Remedy Entertainment, who handled the single player campaign portions. The single player was premium, while multiplayer was free-to-play. Even so, CrossfireX  utterly failed, receiving negative scores from critics and shutting down around fifteen months after its launch. Here on Wccftech, Kai Tatsumoto <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/crossfirex-no-remedy-for-global-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rated the game 4/10</a>:</p>



<p><em>Remedy’s inclusion into CrossfireX’s single-player campaign is perhaps the best part of the package that I could recommend. With extremely dated multiplayer mechanics that have been bandaged up with all of the modern retention techniques to keep players coming back to the mediocre shooter fare, CrossfireX is certainly a title that I wouldn’t be looking to recommend for anyone looking for their weekend FPS fix. Once you take away Remedy’s campaign offerings and look purely at Smilegate Entertainment’s multiplayer component, you’re left with a shooter mode that ultimately feels cheap despite how much effort is spent into extracting money and time from the player.</em></p>



<p>After that attempt, Smilegate tried a real-time strategy game called <a href="https://wccftech.com/crossfire-legion-full-version-release-date-free-weekend/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crossfire: Legion</a> and made by the franchise veterans at Blackbird Interactive (Homeworld 3). That game received better reviews but didn't really gain a fanbase, either, and will be delisted next week on Steam.</p>



<p>Now, Smilegate has unveiled a new title called Crossfire: Rainbow. This is once again a first-person tactical shooter, but with a heavy horror theme, from the looks of it. It also only shows the main player, suggesting this won't be an online title, although it may still have multiplayer modes for all we know.</p>

<p>Indeed, only scant details are available online at this time, although an official website can be found <a href="https://cfh.qq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. We'll monitor any new information worth reporting on this intriguing project. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The first Battlefield 6 open beta has ended after an intense weekend of record-breaking action, but that’s not the end of the line for the game. Electronic Arts has lined up a second test that’ll come later this week, but <strong>when does the Battlefield 6 beta end </strong>for good? And when it does, what are your options?</p>



<p>Read on to learn everything you need to know about the Battlefield 6 beta end times and where it goes from there.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-beta-end-times">Battlefield 6 Beta End Times</h2>



<p>The next Battlefield 6 open beta is scheduled to run from August 14 (08:00 UTC) to August 18 (08:00 UTC). That means the end time for the next Battlefield 6 open beta is at 01:00 PT / 04:00 AM ET on August 18. You’ll get an entire four-day window to play Battlefield 6, but it could be your last chance until the game comes out on October 10.</p>



<p>That brings me to your options going forward.</p>



<p>Once you’ve enjoyed the Battlefield 6 beta, you’re free to sit back and wait until October to get your hands on the full game, <strong>or </strong>you can try your luck with Battlefield Labs, which <strong>should </strong>reopen following the end of the Battlefield 6 beta.</p>



<p>Here’s a guide explaining <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-sign-up-for-battlefield-labs/">how to get into Battlefield Labs</a>.</p>



<p>The Battlefield 6 beta went nuts during the first weekend of play, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-battlefield-6-conucrrent/">more than 500,000 players</a> joining the fun on Steam <strong>alone</strong>. It skyrocketed on platforms like Twitch, hitting almost 900,000 concurrent viewers, far more than any Call of Duty game (except Warzone) has ever managed.</p>



<p>The second round of the Battlefield 6 beta isn’t expected to be any different from the first, but feedback gathered during the opening window will help shape some of the balancing tactics going into the second stage.</p>



<p>Have you already been enjoying the game and are wondering when the Battlefield 6 beta ends? Let me know if you’re disappointed that it’ll be over soon on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Dragon Age, like Mass Effect, didn’t have the best time when its most recent title was released. In October 2024, BioWare and Electronic Arts dropped Dragon Age: Veilguard, which wasn’t well received by audiences, much like 2017’s Mass Effect: Andromeda. However, Mass Effect has an advantage over Dragon Age in that the series boasts a trilogy remaster.</p>



<p>When recently challenged on why Dragon Age doesn’t have a trilogy remaster, or a ‘Legendary Edition’, former BioWare executive producer of more than 20 years, Mark Darrah, explained what’s up.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-do-it-with-the-money-you-have">‘Do It With The Money You Have’</h2>



<p>Mark Darrah departed BioWare in 2022 after spending 24 years rising through the ranks at the company. He saw some of the most popular games of certain eras go out the doors at BioWare, including the Mass Effect ‘quadrilogy’ and every Dragon Age game bar last year’s Veilguard.</p>



<p>In a recent interview with MrMattyPlays, Darrah got onto the topic of a Dragon Age trilogy remaster (not remake) in the vein of the Mass Effect Legendary Edition, explaining why it probably won’t ever be a thing:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I honestly think they should do – I don’t think they will – but I think they should do a remaster of the first three. One of the things we pitched at one point, pretty softly, was to retroactively rebrand the first three games as if they were a trilogy and call it the Champion’s Trilogy.</p>



<p>Maybe you do that, and as a first step, you take those three games (and maybe Veilguard), you shine them up, you re-release them, probably remaster, not a remake, see what happens, and then maybe go from there.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Darrah highlighted the stark similarities between the ‘states’ of the Mass Effect franchise and the Dragon Age franchise, but admitted that the latter is much harder to remaster than the former. Not only that, but there’s <strong>no money </strong>coming from EA to support the idea:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>EA has said this publically, they’re kind of against remasters. I don’t really know why, it’s strange for a publically-traded company to seem to be against free money, but they seem to be against it, so that’s part of it.</p>



<p>The other problem is that Dragon Age is harder than Mass Effect to do.</p>



<p>One of the earliest things was, let’s do Frostbite Tools, and then let’s find a mod house that seems talented and just uplift them and pay them to do a remake of Dragon Age Origins.</p>



<p>There were lots of pitches around it, is there a way we can bring Dragon Age Origins forward?</p>



<p>The studios ruin their financials within themselves. I think, to some degree, EA’s stance was, ‘Sure, go ahead and do it, but do it with the money you already have.’ We couldn’t do it with the money that we already have, because we’re doing all these other things.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The full interview can be seen here:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>Dragon Age: Veilguard scored well in the review stakes when it was released last year, but failed to resonate with the general audience, as reflected in its low aggregate scores on platforms like Steam. </p>



<p>Do you think a Dragon Age trilogy remaster could revive the franchise a little? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In a fresh interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pd9OG3HmN0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with YouTuber MrMattyPlays</a>, former BioWare veteran Mark Darrah revealed that Electronic Arts refused several pitches from the studio to remake or remaster Dragon Age: Origins and, potentially, the second and third game, too. </p>



<p><em>I'm not pitching a Dragon Age to EA right now. I don't know what I'd want to do, to be honest, to go forward with it. I mean, I honestly think they should do - I don't think they will, but I think they should do a remaster of the first three. One of the things that we pitched at one point, pretty softly so pitch is a massive overstatement, was to kind of retroactively rebrand the first three games as if they were a trilogy. We'd call it the Champions trilogy, so you have these big, larger-than-life heroes. You've got the Hero of Ferelden, you've got the Champion of Kirkwall, and then you've got the Inquisitor. I think as a first step, you take those three games, and maybe Veilguard, you shine them up, re-release them, and see what happens and go from there.</em></p>



<p>Darrah, an Executive Producer on the first three Dragon Age games and <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-mass-effect-team-helping-mark-darrah-advisor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a consultant on the fourth</a>, said that the publisher has been historically reluctant to do remasters. While they did the successful <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-legendary-edition-pc-highest-concurrent-player-count/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mass Effect Legendary Edition</a> a while ago, that was made easier by the fact that all those games were powered by Unreal Engine technology, whereas Dragon Age: Origins was powered by the proprietary Eclipse Engine, DAII by the Lycium Engine (an upgraded version of the Eclipse), and Inquisition by Frostbite.</p>



<p><em>EA has historically been, and I don't really know why but they've even said this publicly, they're kind of against remasters. I don't really know why. It's strange for a publicly traded company to basically be against free money, but they seem to be against it. That's part of it. The other problem is that Dragon Age is harder than Mass Effect to do; to some degree, unknowably harder. Maybe only a little bit harder, maybe a lot harder.</em></p>



<p><em>One of the very earliest things for Joplin was, let's do Frostbite tools, and then let's find a mod house that seems talented and just uplift them and pay them to do a remake of Dragon Age: Origins. There were lots of pitches around, 'Is there a way we can bring Dragon: Age Origins forward?'</em></p>

            <p>If you've been wondering just how <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>'s Secure Boot requirement and anti-cheat system Javelin have been holding up during Battlefield 6's gargantuan open beta test, AC from EA's Anti-Cheat team has revealed that during the Open Beta alone, Javelin has blocked over 300,000 attempted cheat efforts and reviewed 100K+ potential cheaters.</p>
<p>"Your reports help us zero in and lead us to finding up-and-coming cheat communities, reporting one actual cheater often can lead to new detection techniques and help us keep them from impacting your experience," <a href="https://forums.ea.com/discussions/battlefield-6-beta-feedback-en/update-battlefield-6-update-on-secure-boot--cheats/12439803">AC explained in a forum post updated over the weekend</a>. "Anti-Cheat isn't one and done, it's an ever-evolving battlefield, and what has worked for us previously or in different games doesn't always work in all of them."</p>

<p>"Since Open Beta Early Access’s launch, Javelin has prevented 330,000 attempts to cheat or tamper with anti-cheat controls, and [players have] reported 44,000 instances of potential cheaters during day one and another 60,000 so far today," AC added.</p>
<p>"We are already using these with our own Gameplay Integrity team to add and improve our detections for Battlefield 6. They are also working with the Battlefield Positive Play team, to actively remove those reported we confirm to be cheaters."</p>
<p>For those wondering why DICE was requiring Secure Boot in the first place, AC explained that Secure Boot "is not, and was not intended to be a silver bullet".</p>
<p>"Secure Boot is how you're helping us build up our arsenal. It’s another barrier that helps us make it harder for cheat developers to create cheat programs, and makes it easier for us to detect it when they do," AC wrote.</p>
<p>"Secure Boot prevents your machine from running with vulnerable drivers enabled. So if Secure Boot is running and we see those drivers loaded, we know something's a bit off."</p>
<p>Battlefield 6, is set to release on the 10th October. Everyone who requested access to Battlefield 6's Labs tests has been given access to these weekend tests, which - it turns out - is a lot of people. Don't worry if you can't get on this weekend, though; <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1954200952455544937">you can still complete the Weekend 1 challenges next week</a>, too.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6s-multiplayer-takes-a-bold-risky-new-direction">Connor's already spent some quality time with the highly-anticipated shooter, writing</a>: "[Playing Battlefield 6] leaves me in a state of cautious optimism. I think the building blocks for a truly fantastic Battlefield game are here with Battlefield 6 - perhaps even an all-time great - but I need to see a little more, need to play a little more. I need to see where the dice fall, whether the gamble of bold gameplay changes land well - where the hivemind of Battlefield's playerbase find new strategies beyond the this-beats-that approach of old, say - or whether they simply muddy an otherwise potentially brilliant experience."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6s-anti-cheat-system-has-already-prevented-330000-attempts-to-cheat-or-tamper-with-anti-cheat-controls]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Microsoft has "assured players that Turn 10 and Playground Games will continue to support Forza Motorsport and Forza Horizon 5".</p>
<p>In the wake of brutal cuts which saw <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-june-2025-tracking-the-situation-as-it-happens">over 9000 employees laid off from Microsoft last month</a>, including across its gaming divisions, the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rares-everwild-reportedly-cancelled-following-xbox-job-cuts">Rare's Everwild</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-and-new-zenimax-mmorpg-reportedly-cancelled-as-part-of-latest-microsoft-cuts">The Initiative's Perfect Dark reboot, and a new ZeniMax MMORPG were all cancelled</a>, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/candy-crush-developer-king-reportedly-replacing-laid-off-staff-with-ai-tools-they-helped-to-build">roughly 200 staff from Candy Crush developer King were laid off</a> and reportedly replaced by the AI tools they helped to build.</p>
<p>At the time, Microsoft told Eurogamer the layoffs were "necessary to position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace". A few days later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/forza-motorsport-is-no-more-claims-former-turn-10-employee-following-microsoft-cuts">we reported Forza Motorsport was "no more", according to a former employee at developer Turn 10 Studios</a>, though it was emphasised that the Horizon series will continue.</p>

<p>Now Microsoft has again stressed that support is ongoing, writing on social media: "Dear Forza Community, we know many of you have questions about what’s next for the Forza franchise, and we appreciate the support of our incredible community.</p>
<p>"We wanted to assure players that Turn 10 and Playground Games will continue to support Forza Motorsport and Forza Horizon 5. To start, here’s more info about what’s coming next to Forza Motorsport". The post then linked to a <a href="http://aka.ms/FMUpdate21Tours">webpage</a>.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Dear Forza Community, we know many of you have questions about what’s next for the Forza franchise, and we appreciate the support of our incredible community.

<p>Interestingly, Microsoft didn't outline what's next for the Horizon franchise, only pledged commitment to the latest in the series, Forza Horizon 5. As racing driver and content creator Steve Alvarez Brown, aka SuperGT, <a href="https://x.com/_SuperGT/status/1953515312621449397">pointed</a> out, "this offers zero clarity as to whether Forza Motorsport will continue beyond the current game."</p>
<p>Last month, we learned <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon-5">Forza Horizon 5</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-xbox-console-exclusive-forza-horizon-5-is-ps5s-highest-selling-game-of-the-year-so-far-says-analyst">was the highest-selling game on PS5 this year so far, surpassing 3 million copies sold</a>. Though previously an Xbox-exclusive, Forza Horizon 5 released on Sony's rival platform at the end of April.</p>
<p>By comparison, Forza Horizon 5 has been played by more than 45.5 million players across Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S, though predominantly via the Game Pass subscription, since its release in 2021. On Steam, it's sold a further 6.5m copies (also since 2021).</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-stresses-it-will-continue-to-support-forza-motorsport-and-horizon-5-despite-cuts-at-studio-turn-10]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-where-on-earth-are-the-switch-2-soundtracks-on-nintendo-music</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/talking-point-where-on-earth-are-the-switch-2-soundtracks-on-nintendo-music.1266651/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Music" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/499efa333a40a/nintendo-music.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life / Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p><em>Ohhhhh, Zeebraaaa, Zeebraaaaa, ZEEBRAAAAA!~</em></p>
<p>Here I am, tapping out once again to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6E0eAReCvU">the Zebra Bananza theme</a>. It's a song fit for Carnival, a blend of styles from all across Latin America — the Brazilian Samba, the Cuban Salsa, the Argentinian Tango. Every time DK beats his chest and transforms into the buffest Zebra you've ever seen, I attempt to sing along with Pauline, even though I don't understand the Kong language.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> is a game all about music, but if I want to go and listen to it on my downtime or while out for a drive? Well, it's time to pull out the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_music">Nintendo Music</a> app and rock ou... wait, <em>it's not on there?</em></p>
<p>Nintendo has a rich musical history, one that it's gradually celebrating and acknowledging via this app, which it introduced last year for NSO subscribers. It's a nice little bonus if you're already playing for those SNES and Game Boy games on your Switch.</p>
<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2be9e29c54860/donkey-kong-bananza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life / Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ideally, I'd rather Nintendo just released its music on the likes of Spotify and Apple, but I completely understand that the company wants complete control of its extensive library. And it's done a good job of supporting it with weekly updates to the library from its deep catalogue of tunes. This week, we got <em>all</em> of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/pilotwings">Pilotwings</a> music, not just the SNES one. Last week, it was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/mario_paint">Mario Paint</a> to coincide with the NSO release. I regularly pop on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/super_mario_galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> in the car.</p>
<p>But Nintendo is missing a trick. We know there's a gold mine of music to dig out from the archives, and far too many omissions to highlight. But where's the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> soundtrack? Where's the multi-genre delights of the Switch 2's launch game?</p>
<p>Mario Kart World is already two months old, yet if I'm jonesing to jig down the streets to the funky sounds of Crown City or sway to the smooth and slow arrangement of Steam Gardens, I have to go to YouTube in the hopes that fan uploads haven't been taken down yet.</p>

<p>When publishers, developers, and composers choose to share and sell their music is obviously up to them. Big hitters like <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/death_stranding_2_on_the_beach">Death Stranding 2</a> drop their OSTs the same day as the game is out. Atlus is particularly good at getting its soundtracks up as soon as possible; <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/raidou-remastered-the-mystery-of-the-soulless-army">Raidou Remastered</a> was available on launch day, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a> followed its PlayStation and Xbox release just a few months later. And there are so many indie titles that you can stream day-and-date, <a href="https://bandcamp.com/discover/video-game">or pick up on Bandcamp</a>.</p>
<p>The newest game soundtrack on Nintendo Music is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_4">Pikmin 4</a>'s, composed by Kenta Nagata, Asuka Hayazaki, and Soshi Abe — although you wouldn't know that from the app because the composers aren't credited. That game is two years old at this point; can you even buy the soundtrack in a store or online? Well, unless you can find and splash out on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C7mqZKKPr9F/?img_index=1">this lovely Mother Onion limited vinyl</a>, which contains 14 of the game's tracks? Nope. Admittedly, Nintendo is doing a lot better than it was when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-video-game-music-is-more-popular-than-ever-so-why-is-nintendo-so-behind">I ranted about video game music three years ago</a>. But its music app strategy is odd to me.</p>
<p>I don't really expect them to turn around and pop DK Bananza on there on Tuesday — that game just came out, and companies like Square Enix often wait a few months, sometimes years, before sharing game music on streaming services. I don't blame anyone for holding back on DK's melodic magic for a few months. But what better way to share the magic of something like Mario Kart World's open roads than dropping the Super Bell Hill rearrangement or the title music on the app? You don't even need to put the whole thing on there.</p>

<p>In the grand scheme of things, it's really just a tiny drop of annoyance in an ocean of problems. I care more about crediting artists, composers, and arrangers than having the shiny new music on my app, which I don't have to pay extra money for. And look, if Nintendo wants to charge an extra buck or two a month for NSO just to stick the brand new Switch 2 soundtracks on there? I'd consider it.</p>
<p>Nintendo could even pull a big Mario Paint and drop GameCube soundtracks along with NSO drops. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker">Wind Waker</a> is already available, but we're missing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/mario_smash_football">Super Mario Strikers</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/f-zero_gx">F-Zero GX</a>. Imagine getting both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/fire_emblem_path_of_radiance">Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</a> and its excellent soundtrack on the same day.</p>
<p>I do think Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bananza's music will eventually come to the app. It might take months, maybe a year, but they'll be there. More GameCube titles will also get their time in the sunlight, hopefully paired with their Nintendo Online release.</p>
<figure><a title="Mario Kart World Dino Dino Jungle" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e35b0117669f5/mario-kart-world-dino-dino-jungle.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life / Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I'd still love Nintendo to be a bit more proactive with its music, though. A video of the Kong Bananza song, complete with lyrics, on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_today">Nintendo Today</a> just isn't going to cut it. I need the Freezer Layer song to sparkle in my ears, or the Forest Layer theme to chill out to.</p>
<p>Plus, we've got a contender for one of the best soundtracks of the year in Mario Kart World, and maybe one of Nintendo's best OSTs of all-time, yet I can't even go out and buy the soundtrack, or any of the songs. Without fans, I'd be left scrambling to try and find how to listen to this music outside of the game. Is that really what video game music deserves?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>One player has gone viral for spending an astonishing $32,000 in NBA 2K25 in just five months on microtransactions.</p>



<p>The clip was posted to <a href="https://x.com/Troydan/status/1953657155896095112" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a>, which showed YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@2KOGGaming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">2KOG</a> going through his microtransaction purchases for NBA 2K25 on the PlayStation Store, where he revealed that he’s spent an astonishing $32,831.68 on the game.</p>



<p>The clip reveals that transactions started on March 31, 2025, and ended on August 5, 2025, the date the clip was recorded. All of the transactions are for the game’s Virtual Currency Pack, with the highest costing $160.48 each.</p>



<p>You can watch the full clip below:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The YouTuber himself revealed that he’s learned his lesson from spending such a large amount of money, and warned others that it’s not worth chasing cards or spending large amounts of money for content creation. </p>



<p>What’s worse is that despite him spending $32,000, he’s still not obtained all of the best cards in the game. In fact, just by watching his video, he would probably need to spend an equal amount of money to get near completion.</p>



<p>“One things for sure, I will not spend this much again, because you don’t get rewarded for it. As much as I spent, I should have everything in the game, but it’s not even close,” he said. </p>



<p>NBA 2K26 also releases on Setpember 5, 2025, which will make all of his purchases pretty useless if he was to move on to the next game.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/is-this-seat-taken</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mini-review-is-this-seat-taken-switch-sit-down-and-get-comfy-with-this-short-simple-puzzler.1266606/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<p>Someone's sitting there, mate</p>
<p><strong>Version Reviewed:</strong> European</p>
</section><section><p>I'm the type of introvert who's made an art of choosing the right seat in public places. With such honed skills, I assumed a puzzler like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/is_this_seat_taken">Is This Seat Taken?</a> would be second nature, and I was <em>mostly</em> right. This adorable indie might not bring anything radical to the table, but it's a perfectly pleasant pick-up-and-play experience, that will undoubtedly scratch any low-stakes puzzle itches.</p>
<p>Strung together by a loose story about a rhombus with dreams of treading the boards (yes, really), Is This Seat Taken is about organising people into the right spots so that everyone's preferences are satisfied. This might be at the cinema or museum, a taxi or a boat, but each person (well, "shape" might be more accurate) has their own conditions to meet, and they can be rather fussy.</p>
<p>Things start simple: slot this handful of shapes into a taxi, and make sure persons A and C are sitting by the window. But each stage brings a new challenge. In the cinema screen, some guests will use their phones or chat. On boats, you'll get party groups who need to be kept separate from those who just want to sightsee. And everyone wants to steer clear of guests who forgot to shower.</p>
<p>The idea of performing such feats of organisation in the real world is enough to break me out in a cold sweat, but Is This Seat Taken couldn't be more chilled. There's no timer and no punishment for putting somebody in the wrong place. Heck, you can even finish the level without everyone sitting comfortably — though you'd lose valuable 'thumbs up' points, and my respect, in the process.</p>
<p>Busier stages can feel a little trial-and-error-y, and the absence of any kind of hint system meant I had to pull everyone from their temporary places and start from scratch on more than one occasion; I would love an undo/reset button for this kind of thing. Fortunately, no puzzle outstays its welcome. I polished off every level (in which there are five or six stages) in around six hours, and stages themselves are broken down into micro-challenges, primed for anyone who wants to squeeze in 10 minutes of gaming while the pasta's cooking. It feels tailor-made for precisely this.</p>
<p>The onscreen cursor is smooth and intuitive, the characters are cute, and you can even use touchscreen controls in handheld. If it all sounds rather mobile puzzler, that's because it is — I appreciated every new challenge and tweak when I'd come back to the game, but two or three levels on the trot felt a little repetitive.</p>
<p>All in all, Is This Seat Taken is solid pick-up-and-play puzzler. It may not do anything new or unique, but the condition-meeting gameplay loop is primed for anyone after a low-stakes distraction. It won't keep you occupied for hours on end, but it'll do an almighty job of reminding you that your seating preferences are not to be scoffed at.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/is-this-seat-taken]]></content:encoded>

<p>We've got another duel on our hands this time, as we mosey over to the first (and best) WarioWare game out there: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/warioware_inc_mega_microgameusd">WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgame$!</a>. Perhaps the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/ufo-50-gets-a-surprise-shadow-drop-on-switch-today">surprise launch</a> of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ufo_50">UFO 50</a> on Switch has put minigame collections on the brain (not that UFO 50 is anything like WarioWare, mind), but it got us in the mood to look back at this GBA classic, for which there are <em>two</em> drastically different covers.</p>
<p>It's another match-up between East and West this time, so let's get into it. Ready? Vote!</p>

<h2>North America / Europe</h2>
<figure><a title="WarioWare GBA - NA/EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4f68052b54add/warioware-gba-naeu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/3917-warioware-inc-mega-microgame">Nintendo / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Gosh, talk about iconic covers, eh? The design used in Europe and North America is all about colour. The WarioWare logo is put front and centre, but Wario and all of his minigame crew take up sections around it, with their distinct looks and bright colouring making each and every one a real eye-catcher.</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>

<p>The Japanese cover goes for something... different. Gone is the <em>in-your-face</em> colour and multiple characters, here replaced by a calming light blue background, with Wario's distinct facial features adorning the middle. It's nothing like as hectic, nor as eye-catching, we'd say, but damn, it's a classy look.</p>
