            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/fallen-aces-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Fallen Aces</em> is clearly a labor of love. Developed by Trey Powell and Jason Bond, this<a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/new-blood-interactive"> New Blood Interactive</a>-published title nails this hand-drawn, noir-inspired mafia game and offers a compelling introduction to the crime-ridden city of Switchblade City. Main character Mike's adventure through these mean streets offers up a compelling story full of twists and turns. This is one tasty helping of gabagool, boys.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fallen-aces-rat.jpg?itok=8SuDPaBi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fallen-aces-rat.jpg?itok=gLcBK_Vd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's immersive in that you can grab a rat and use it as a weapon.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Fallen Aces</em> -- the Next Great Immersive Sim?</h2>
<p><em>Fallen Aces</em>' story is surprisingly involved and features beautifully-crafted comic book style cutscenes. This serves as the perfect way to keep the narrative flowing without getting in the way of gameplay, which is where the real meat of <em>Fallen Aces</em> is.</p>
<p>This is a full-on immersive sim, no doubt about it. Fallen Aces<em> </em>offers unparalleled freedom in your approach to each and every situation. You'll go through the mean streets of Switchblade City, navigating ports full of goons, booby-trapped junkyards, fancy clubs, and more.</p>
<p>The best way to convey the total freedom <em>Fallen Aces</em> offers is by explaining how a typical mission goes. My favorite has Mike infiltrating an opulent mansion filled to the brim with goons. Find evidence for a murder, and get the hell outta' there. Quick and clean, right?</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fallen-aces-mansion.jpg?itok=wEMM7xZf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fallen-aces-mansion.jpg?itok=0sTROKXC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nice house. Would be a shame if some goons ruined it.</figcaption></figure><h2>Mansion Infiltration</h2>
<p><em>Fallen Aces</em> doesn't hold your hand when it comes to your approach, so there are many different side pathways or hidden entrances and exits to your objective. Going through the front of the mansion? Bad idea -- there's armed thugs. I'll go around the side and look for a quiet side entrance.</p>
<p>This mission also equips you with some handy tools -- a blackjack (no doubt paying homage to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/20-years-of-thief-ii-fan-missions"><em>Thief</em></a>) and a tranquilizer gun. Perfect for my side objective, asking that I don't kill any bad guys throughout the mission. The side entrance is being patrolled, so I sneak up behind the guy and whack 'em with the blackjack, and hide his body for good measure so as not to alert the others.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fallen-aces-docks.jpg?itok=vQO0i4_3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fallen-aces-docks.jpg?itok=GCsxDgdS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Look out for sharks!</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that this mission takes place at night. Lights illuminate certain areas near the front of the house, but this side entrance I'm aiming for is covered by trees and the shadows will help keep me unseen. I hop the fence, take out a few more guards quietly, and find a side entrance to the kitchen.</p>
<p>Drat, more guards. They're all over the place like roaches, so I do what I do best -- be stealthy, and don't get caught. Only, a goon turns the corner and immediately knows I'm up to no good, so there goes my cover. Nothing a few fists can't fix.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/combat-fallen-aces.jpg?itok=MXnt9JM1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/combat-fallen-aces.jpg?itok=skuvkmXe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Don't bring a knife to a gunfight, like this bozo.</figcaption></figure><h2>Speak with Your Fists in <em>Fallen Aces</em></h2>
<p>The developers are bold to introduce a mostly melee-focused FPS game, but they've somehow succeeded. See, when stealth fails, you can always rely on your fists or blunt force object you might find in the environment. Fist-fighting is quick, punchy (in more ways than one!), and doesn't feel clunky at all.</p>
<p>You're able to parry or block blows from baddies, which adds just a bit more depth to the combat system. Though you're better off just whacking them over the head with a pipe or stabbing them with a broken bottle a few times. The environment is as much your weapon as the items you carry, so use it to your benefit.</p>
<p>In one instance, I saw a banana peel and I just <em>knew</em> that this could be useful. Throwing it down in front of a goon, he'll trip over in a comical way. That gumball machine in the corner store? Throw someone into that, it'll break, and these goofs'll start tripping on gumballs like a bunch of doofuses.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fallen-aces-combat_0.jpg?itok=hXWsxpsZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fallen-aces-combat_0.jpg?itok=OYVR0jNM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Don't mess with a man with a pipe.</figcaption></figure><h2>Stealthy or Not? The Choice is Yours in <em>Fallen Aces</em></h2>
<p>Switching between stealth and combat was my go-to for completing this mansion mission. With a complex layout and plenty of other entrances and exits, I made a quick escape after some more armed goons arrived to take Mike out.</p>
<p>This is the core gameplay loop for <em>Fallen Aces</em>, but if you're bold, you can go all-in without worrying about stealth. Sneaking in always provides a more intriguing and complex experience, however, as the thrill of not getting caught and finding weird or hidden paths forward is what I love about immersive sims such as this.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fallen-aces-cutscene.jpg?itok=Nvz1UkUC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fallen-aces-cutscene.jpg?itok=r5N9WfSg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Cutscenes are shown through these lovingly crafted, comic book-style pages.</figcaption></figure><p>The other missions in <em>Fallen Aces</em> are just as compelling -- the finale of this first episode, in particular, feels even more lethal and high-stakes than the previous few. Finding a way into this great big nightclub with no real direction for my target, relying only on my senses -- it takes me back to that opera house from <em>Thief</em>.</p>
<p>In its current state, <em>Fallen Aces</em> is not a long experience, but it's still one I didn't want to end. There's one episode worth of content and it's polished as polished can be, and two more are on the way. If this is any indication of what we have in store for the other two, man, this game would make even Tony Soprano proud.</p>

<p data-characters="357" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Monopoly GO</em> seasons typically last anywhere from one to three months. During this time, you collect stickers to complete albums, which reward you with dice, cosmetic tokens, and a ton of cash for your landmark upgrades. Let’s find out what happens to any leftover stickers you have at the end of a season and whether your stars carry over to the next.</p> <h2 id="h-what-happens-to-sticker-stars-when-a-season-ends-in-monopoly-go" data-injectable="false">What happens to sticker stars when a season ends in Monopoly GO?</h2> <p data-characters="413" data-current-count="413" data-injectable="true">What happens to your stars at the end of a <em>Monopoly GO</em> season depends on the season itself. For example, while the previous Monopoly Origins season turned your stars into a vault for the next album set, the current <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/monopoly-go-all-making-music-album-stickers-and-rewards-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Making Music season</a> converts your stars into dice rolls. So far, each season has had different conversions for stars, and it’s unknown what Monopoly Games will do once it ends later this year.</p>
 <p data-characters="334" data-current-count="334" data-injectable="false">For the Making Music season and album set, any leftover stars you have will convert to dice rolls. One star equals one dice roll, with the maximum being 700 stars for 750 dice rolls. In other words, if you don’t plan to purchase a last-minute vault for extra stickers, you’ll at least start Monopoly Games with extra dice.</p> <p data-characters="484" data-current-count="818" data-injectable="false">Overall, this is a solid conversion rate compared to what you get from vaults. With each vault, you can get a maximum of 230, 420, and 575 dice, while the star-to-dice exchange at the season’s end can give you far more. On the flip side, you can also get extra stickers by buying vaults, but this comes at the risk of not getting what you need to complete your albums. You can also <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-trade-stickers-and-stars-in-monopoly-go/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">give sticker stars to friends</a> if they want to take a shot at an expensive vault for extra cards.</p>

And one of the most exciting parts of the attraction is seeing where life has taken her after that movie. Following the successful opening of her restaurant, Tiana’s Palace, there next to the beautiful Mississippi River in New Orleans, she’s continued to grow her business. But this time, she’s included members of the community, and built a new, beloved brand called Tiana’s Foods.”</p>

But Disney Parks senior vice president of creative development Carmen Smith says Tiana’s story will continue beyond the ride.</p>
<p id="cKbb4G">“Our partners at Walt Disney Animation Studios have also been amazing about this attraction’s development,” said Smith. “We’re so excited that Tiana’s story will continue after the attraction. And that’s with a new show coming to Disney Plus.” </p>

<p id="XSpFv1">The <a href="https://www.polygon.com/disney-plus/2020/12/10/22168776/disney-princess-shows-disney-plus-tiana-moana-baymax-zootopia">Tiana show was previously announced back in 2020</a>, along with a Moana series, but production news has been scant. The <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24065414/moana-2-teaser-trailer-announcement">Moana series was retooled into an upcoming theatrical movie</a>, but beyond a few writer-director announcements and delays, there hasn’t been news about the Tiana show in quite some time. It was originally supposed to debut in 2022, but then was pushed to 2023, then to 2024, with the announcement of <a href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/tiana-disney-plus-animated-series-joyce-sherri-lead-writer-director-1235749236/">Joyce Sherri as showrunner</a>. No specific premiere date has been announced. </p>
<p id="D2nB9I">If the Tiana show’s summary is still accurate, it will see Tiana setting off for Maldonia, where her husband, Naveen, hails from, and stepping up as crown princess. But her New Orleans heritage is still a huge part of her life. The setting difference means the story of Tiana’s Bayou Adventure won’t have significant plot ramifications for the show. An Imagineer that Polygon spoke to at the event maintained that the ride is “about a specific story in a specific moment here at Tiana’s Foods.”</p>
<p id="ULOYWX">But it’s hard to imagine that some of the details established by the ride — especially Tiana managing an employee-owned company — will be <em>totally </em>ignored by the upcoming show. Smith’s words imply that Walt Disney Imagineering and Walt Disney Animation Studios have been working together at least a little to establish a canon for Tiana. After all, Tiana is a business owner and chef first, and a princess second; leaving behind the restaurant and business she worked her whole life for doesn’t seem like the Tiana way.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/banana-clicking-game-not-a-scam-developer-insists<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The developers of Banana, a game about clicking a Banana which has <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/banana-clicking-game-banana-now-the-11th-most-popular-game-of-all-time-on-steam">usurped Baldur's Gate 3 and Hogwarts Legacy on Steam's most-popular games of all time list</a>, have insisted it's not a scam.</p><p>A post on Discord from one of the three listed developers and co-owner of Banana, aestheticspartan, said the team had parted ways with one of its members after it emerged they were accused of being involved in a Steam scam previously. This team member has denied any involvement in a scam, saying instead an influx of money obtained through the Steam marketplace was the result of a bug.</p><p>Despite their involvement, "there is no scamming or scam going on," aestheticspartan insisted. Banana's gameplay literally involves clicking a banana repeatedly, but its main draw is in its dropping of Steam items which can be sold on the official marketplace. Banana gives out different bananas as its item, and clicking on the game once in a while nets players a couple per day.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/18/banana-1718705246631.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Banana has an interesting revenue split.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Most of these items are listed for just a few cents each, meaning the players of Banana are often spending and gaining very little at a time, but this likely doesn't matter to Steam owner Valve or the development team.</p><p>That's because both get a cut of every marketplace sale. <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/61F0-72B7-9A18-C70B" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Valve takes 5%</a>, to a minimum of $0.01, and the developer takes another small percentage, the exact total of which is unclear in this case, but likely follows the same conventions as Valve's to a minimum of $0.01.</p><p>Buyers and sellers don't see the same numbers on Steam's community marketplace, as the seller chooses the amount and the buyer sees the total of that number plus fees. This would explain why no banana item is available for less than $0.03 — they're likely listed at $0.01, but another $0.01 for Valve and $0.01 for the developer adds up to the $0.03 total.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/19/screenshot-2024-06-19-173635-1718815016161.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>These tiny numbers add up though. Using the most basic example, the plain Banana item (compared to the banana that looks like a Panda or any other obscure design), we can see how much the developer and Valve potentially make from Banana.</p><p><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/2923300/Banana" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a> itself features an hour-by-hour breakdown of how many of these items are sold. Using the latest full day example, June 18, 2024, an eye-watering total of 1,993,669 of this single item were sold.</p><p>Valve therefore potentially earned a total of $19,936.69 from this single Banana's sales over a 24-hour period, a number more than likely earned by the developer, too. This standard drop is one of 81 items being sold on Banana's community marketplace.</p><p>This is the most common item, however, so it's being sold in larger quantities than other items. The Rainbow Banana, for example, is currently listed for around $0.75 but generally sells for less than 50 per hour instead of the thousands of the most common Banana. The most expensive item, the Crypticnana, of which only 25 exist, has been sold four times for values of more than $1,000 since June 17.</p><p>While this is a colossal price compared to the most basic Banana for the buyer and seller, Valve's 5% means it only nets $50 per $1,000 sold on these. It's therefore the $0.01 minimum policy affecting large quantities of low-selling items that make Valve and the developer the most money. A total of 14 items are listed at the minimum $0.03 amount, and each one sells thousands per hour.</p><p>Developer aestheticspartan's insistence Banana isn't a scam is therefore likely legitimate, but it's also almost certainly earning the development team tens of thousands of dollars a day, if not more. As for why it's so popular, developer team member Hery told <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24173617/banana-clicker-game-steam-egg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polygon</a> Banana is a real-life "infinite money glitch." "I do believe that the reason why it mostly caught on is because it’s a legal infinite money glitch," Hery said. "Users make money out of a free game while selling free virtual items."</p><p>They also admitted Banana had a bot problem early on, with only around one third of all concurrents being actual players. Whether or not that figure has changed since Banana blew up remains to be seen, though Hery said the developement team has contacted Valve for help with the issue.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

Image credit: Paradox.</figcaption></figure></output><p>“This is difficult and drastic news for our colleagues at Tectonic, who’ve worked hard on Life by You’s Early Access release,” Fredrik Wester, CEO of Paradox Interactive, said.</p><p>“Sadly, with cancellation of their sole project we have to take the tough decision to close down the studio. We are deeply grateful for their hard work in trying to take Paradox into a new genre.”</p><p>Life by You, which Tectonic had worked on since 2019, initially set an early access release date for September 2023, but it was delayed to May 2024 before Paradox announced an additional delay to June 4. Two weeks before June 4, Paradox delayed the game indefinitely.</p><p>Delventhal alleged Paradox told Tectonic Life by You wouldn’t launch just two weeks before the June 4 release date, and staff only found out they’d lost their jobs when the studio closure was publicly announced this week. Delventhal said Tectonic tried to save Life by You by finding potential buyers or even going indie, but to no avail.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We spent a month in purgatory, and did everything we could to prove to them we were worth launching.</p></div><p>“I've known for some time that we might be getting shut down,” Delventhal said. “We were actively working on a hyper-moddable life sim called Life By You. An indie answer to the aging IP that is the Sims but instead focussed heavily on UGC.</p><p>“And as far as it goes, we were doing extremely well. </p><p>“I cannot share specific numbers, but I can say that we had an internal metric we were aiming for that had been approved, and that we exceeded that number by a significant portion. We also got a thumbs up a few weeks before launch.</p><p>“Then two weeks before launch we were told we wouldn't be launching. And just now that we've all lost our jobs. We were only informed of this via a public announcement.</p><p>“We were not told why. Instead we spent a month in purgatory, and did everything we could to prove to them we were worth launching, including things like finding potential buyers or suggesting cutting ties and going indie. We heard virtually nothing back.</p><p>“I was warned against writing anything about this experience. That it may hurt my future career or even that legal action could be taken against me. I have chosen to ignore these warnings.</p><p>“To be honest, I have guesses about what happened. And while I can't conjecture, I'm sure you have guesses too. As a business owner, some of them are understandable, but many of them are not. We were a strong team on a strong project ready to launch to a strong audience.</p><p>“Really I'd like to be much more fire and brimstone about it. I'm pretty pissed, not gonna lie. But I'm trying to stay kind and respectful. So instead I'll say: this industry has become a place in which you can deliver more than expected, have AA money behind you, and still have the rug pulled two weeks before launch.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>When Paradox announced the cancelation of Life by You, Wester issued a statement, below, insisting the game would not “meet our expectations.”</p><p>“For a long time, we’ve held hopes for Life by You and the potential we saw in it, but it is now clear that the game will not be able to meet our expectations,” Wester said. “A version that we’d be satisfied with is too far away, and therefore we are taking the difficult decision to cancel the release.”</p><p>It’s tough times for Paradox after a string of high-profile failures. Wester admitted “we’ve performed poorly in recent releases” in his statement, while insisting “we have a very solid financial position and a strong core game portfolio, which keeps us confident about our future.”</p><p>Last year’s disastrous release of <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/cities-skylines-ii"><u>Cities Skylines 2</u></a>, which developer Colossal Order is still working to address, was just one title that hit Paradox’s bottom line as well as its reputation. In October 2023, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-lamplighters-league-a-big-disappointment-for-paradox-as-it-confirms-22-million-write-down"><u>Paradox called The Lamplighters League a "big disappointment"</u></a> as it was forced to record a $22 million write-down. Paradox has also delayed jail sim <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/prison-architect-2"><u>Prison Architect 2</u></a> a number of times, the latest to this September after the discovery of "unexpected issues occurring too often.” The Paradox-published <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2"><u>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</u></a> has endured a troubled development too, although a release date now looks in sight.</p><p>The closure of Tectonic is the latest in a string of studio shutdowns and layoffs that have hit the video game industry hard in recent years. Thousands of staff have been impacted by cuts right across the industry, with layoffs at the likes of Microsoft, Sony, and Embracer, to name a few. Just this week <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/embracer-shuts-down-alone-in-the-dark-developer-pieces-interactive"><u>Embracer shut down Pieces Interactive after Alone in the Dark failed to meet sales expectations</u></a>.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>Look, who knows when we’ll see <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-5">Fallout 5</a> - there’s an increasingly less-than-zero chance we’ll all be living in a real post-apocalyptic nuclear wasteland by the time Bethesda get around to revealing anything, if <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elder-scrolls-and-fallout-creators-bethesda-want-to-release-games-more-often-but-making-them-last-is-more-important">their deliberately slow approach</a> to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-6">The Elder Scrolls 6</a> (it’s been nearly THIRTEEN years since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>) is much to go by. Still, even without a full sequel, Fallout is all around us - in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/well-whaddya-know-therell-officially-be-a-season-two-of-amazons-very-popular-fallout-tv-show">multiple seasons of a television show</a>, in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-is-headed-to-fortnites-next-season">Fortnite</a>, and now in Call of Duty.</p>

<p>Not one to be outdone in the how-many-popular-licences-can-you-cram-into-one-video-game race, Call of Duty is following up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>’s own recent addition of Fallout skins with its own crossover with the series.</p>
<p>I’ll admit, it’s not an especially exciting take on a world full of strange mutants, ghouls, radioactive creations and a questionable satirical take on 1950s America. <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/06/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-warzone-wzm-fallout-141-bundle">Call of Duty’s collaboration with Fallout</a> boils down to the chance to stick your military shooterpeople in the blue-and-yellow jumpsuits of vault dwellers. Vault 141 specifically, going by the number on the back of the suits - which doesn’t correlate to any Fallout vault we’ve seen in the games or live-action series, but instead references Task Force 141, the shooty all-star crew of Modern Warfares 2 and 3 made up of Price, Ghost, Soap and Gaz.</p>
<p>The Fallout Vault Dweller tracer pack stuffs in more than 15 items in total, including two Fallout-themed gun blueprints for a “Vault-Tec Approved” M16 and “Atomic Disintegrator” HRM-9, a couple of charms, a calling card, decal, emblem, sticker and loading screens.</p>
<p>The Fallout items can be used in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3">Modern Warfare III</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone-20">Warzone</a> and Warzone Mobile, with more goodies from gun camos to charms due to be offered as part of an in-game Vault Dwellers event from June 20th to June 26th. You’ll get extra XP if you’re using one of the vault dweller skins, too. Look, I'm sure there's plenty of people out there excited for some blue pyjamas to do murder in, but they're <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-is-getting-in-the-gundam-robot">not exactly Gundams</a>, are they?</p>

            <p>If you were playing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy XIV</a> in December 2021, you will remember the launch of its last expansion <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-endwalker">Endwalker</a> - though not for all the right reasons. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/final-fantasy-xiv-endwalker-review">otherwise fantastic</a> cap to the near-decade-long Hydelyn-Zodiark was beset by a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/final-fantasy-xiv-giving-players-a-free-week-in-apology-for-queues">barrage of technical problems</a> at launch, as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ffxiv-endwalkers-early-access-launch-is-here-and-already-has-long-server-queues">the MMO’s servers buckled</a> under the weight of record numbers of players, leading to hours-long queues to login that would often end in an error that then kicked you back into the queue. As someone that sat there for literal hours watching the numbers tick down, it wasn’t a great time - even if the wait was, ultimately, worth it.</p>

</div>
<p>With next expansion <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail">Dawntrail</a> approaching, the question of how FF14’s servers will cope is once again upon us. Fortunately, the game’s team promise that they’ve taken “precautionary measures” since the gruelling experience of Endwalker nearly three years ago, bumping up the number of data centres and introducing whole new worlds for players to join to help account for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-mmos-mmorpgs">MMO</a>’s boom in players over the pandemic and beyond.</p>
<p>Even so, the developers caution that things may still struggle under the sheer number of players logging in for lengthy Dawntrail marathons, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/39210/view/4160844172256662009?l=english">detailing some of what to expect</a> and how they’re hoping to make things at least a bit smoother than Endwalker.</p>
<p>In short: expect to find yourself in a queue once Dawntrail opens up to early access on June 28th, before its wide release on July 2nd. The devs do reassure that even if it seems like the number isn’t going down, you will be moving forward - though it’s worth noting that those paying for a subscription (which you’ll need for Dawntrail anyway) will be prioritised over those playing the base A Realm Reborn and earlier expansions Heavensward and Stormblood in the game’s free trial. Honestly, if you’re not up to Dawntrail and desperate to see the new story and duties as soon as you can, I would really recommend steering clear in the meantime. You won’t be able to even create characters on a congested world, so definitely don’t jump in now.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/final-fantasy-14-viper-job-dual-handed-blue.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Square Enix</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Even once you’re in, there’ll continue to be some restrictions. Like with Endwalker, travelling between some data centers and visiting other worlds will be limited. That’ll remain the case until at least patch 7.01, though could last up to 7.05 if things are really bad. Needless to say, you’ll probably want to make sure you return any characters to their home world before Dawntrail arrives to avoid ending up stuck. Travelling between individual regions of the map will also be limited (get ready to see "Unable to move areas due to congestion" a lot), so you might have to wait a little before moving through areas.</p>
<p>The game’s auto-kick feature will crack down on inactive players more harshly, too - so don’t expect to be able to just sit in Limsa Lominsa to save your place while you grab a night’s sleep. Automatic logout will now occur after 30 minutes of inactivity - though, honestly, it’s just polite to log out if you’re not actually playing regardless, in my opinion.</p>
<p>Other efforts will include a queue system for instanced duties, including dungeons and main scenario quests, when congestion is particularly heavy, plus the return of separate instances for areas of the map - you can switch to a specific instance via an aetheryte, as in Endwalker.</p>
<p>In other words, it sounds like the team are doing all they can to try and remedy the pains of logging in suffered during Endwalker, but definitely don’t expect things to be as smooth as normal once the expansion hits. See you in the queues.</p>

            <p>When it comes to the ultimate showdown of all-time great fighting games, Marvel vs Capcom 2 might well take my personal bet for being the best of the best. I spent countless hours throwing down with housemates, friends and random passers-by who looked like they were up for a brawl during my teenage years. Yet the arcade classic has - as far as I can tell - never been given a proper PC release before the recent announcement of a new bundle of the comic-book crossover series headed to Steam this year.</p>
<!--more-->
<div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span> </p>
</div>
<p>Marvel vs Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics, as said bundle is officially dubbed, will bring together both Marvel vs Capcom 2 and its predecessor Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes  - which again, I don’t think has ever had an official PC version - with five other games starring Marvel’s roster of superheroes with or without Capcom’s brawlers.</p>
<p>The list includes Capcom’s first Marvel-based fighting game, X-Men: Children of the Atom, which effectively applied Street Fighter II’s gameplay to the Marvel heroes. That, at least, did make it to PC, albeit back in 1997. Capcom and Marvel’s second game, Marvel Super Heroes, swapped X-Men for more of a mix, including the likes of Avengers members Captain America, Spider-Man and Hulk alongside Wolverine, Juggernaut, Magneto and Psylocke. That will see its first PC release in this new collection.</p>
<p>Pre-Marvel vs Capcom crossovers X-Men vs Street Fighter and Marvel Super Heroes vs Street Fighter will be in here, too. As a fun historical tidbit, the games are particularly notable for introducing Variable Assist, a precursor to the assist mechanic that would go on to be a key part of MvC, though they also never made it to PC.</p>
 <p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>Rounding out the package is The Punisher, which is a beat ‘em up rather than a competitive fighting game. The 1993 Final Fight-like was only ever released on Sega Genesis outside of arcades, but was the first game to emerge from Capcom and Marvel’s partnership, making it a progenitor of sorts to the MvC series. Fortunately for us, the PC version in the collection will be based on the beloved arcade original, rather than its widely-derided console port.</p>
<p>Alongside the games themselves, the Fighting Collection will pack in some neat historical treats such as a museum and choice of display filters, plus some modern trimmings - including online multiplayer across ranked, casual and lobby matches with rollback netcode (including co-op for The Punisher), a spectator mode and leaderboards. All of the games will also have a training mode if you’re a bit rusty.</p>
<p>The Fighting Collection <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2634890/MARVEL_vs_CAPCOM_Fighting_Collection_Arcade_Classics/">will hit Steam</a> sometime later this year, also meaning all these games will find themselves on the Steam Deck through official means. A very welcome return.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/perfect-dark-reveal-shows-both-ue5-pros-and-cons-with-lumen-and-low-native-resolution.905967/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-trailer-analysis-unreal-engine-5-pros-cons-lumen-resolution/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Earlier this month during the big <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/xbox-games-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Games Showcase</a>, we finally got our first look the Unreal-Engine-5-powered “AAAA” <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/perfect-dark/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Perfect Dark</a> revival, with Microsoft claiming what we saw was actual gameplay. Now, that comes with a number of asterisks – what we saw was clearly a very curated vertical slice of the game and it isn’t even clear if the footage was running on PC or Xbox Series X, but still, Microsoft insists it was gameplay, so it bears analysis.</p>
<p>Enter the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tech heads at Digital Foundry</a>, who have gone over the Perfect Dark trailer, and found it exemplified both the strengths and weaknesses of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unreal Engine 5</a>. You can check out Digital Foundry’s full video below, provided you have around 10 minutes to spare, or you can scroll on down for our rundown of the important points.</p>
<p><iframe title="Perfect Dark Gameplay Trailer Breakdown: Immersive Sim Meets Mirror's Edge?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zW_ssHy918I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>First off, there’s the question of what the Perfect Dark trailer was running on. Digital Foundry suspects it was PC, but the performance and resolution of that trailer indicates it may have been running on more limited Xbox Series X hardware. Then again, it could just be that the PC version of Perfect Dark hasn’t been properly optimized yet or they were intentionally running the game on PC with XSX equivalent settings.</p>
<p>Moving on from that question, it does seem like Perfect Dark is tapping into Unreal Engine 5’s suite of tools, with Digital Foundry clearly identifying Lumen lighting techniques in use. It seems like the game is likely using software-powered Lumen, rather than the potentially-more-versatile hardware-based Lumen, but that isn’t rare (few games use hardware Lumen).</p>
<p>Less positively, like seemingly most UE5 games, the Perfect Dark demo had it share of performance issues. Per Digital Foundry, framerate during the trailer is “not stable” and pixel counting reveals it was running at around 1440p. Further analysis seems to show the gameplay was actually upscaled to 1440p, and that its native resolution was somewhere in the range of 720p to 960p.</p>
<p>Again, this was just an early vertical slice of the game – it’s likely the game is still a couple years away at least, so take all this with a grain of salt. The game may change quite significantly before launch and the underlying UE5 tech will also be updated. That said, in a lot, if not the majority, of cases, games are actually <em>downgraded </em>from their early vertical slice showings. We’ll see what happens in this case.</p>
<p>Perfect Dark is coming to PC and Xbox Series X/S. A release window has not been specified.</p>

<p>When the Marvel vs Capcom Fight Collection was announced on Tuesday, it was met with overwhelming praise from fans around the world. The only problem was that Marvel vs. Capcom Fight Collection isn’t going to be available on Xbox consoles.</p>



<p>No, when it launches later this year, it’ll be available only on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 (playable on PS5), and Steam. But why not Xbox?</p>



<p>According to a new report from <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/capcom-skips-xbox-with-another-game-as-square-enix-steps-up-with-several-new-titles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a>, it has to do with Capcom’s MT Framework that the game’s are built on. The outlet’s source say that Capcom “has no pipeline for porting older MT Framework titles to Xbox’s modern system, which makes it more expensive to deliver the same titles than it would porting them to PlayStation 4, Switch, or PC.”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out directly to Microsoft and Capcom for comment on this report. Should a response be received, this story will be updated accordingly.</p>

<p data-characters="367" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">For the entire time I’ve been a fan of <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/when-did-magic-the-gathering-come-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Magic: The Gathering</a></em>, which started at some point during the UK’s various staggered lockdowns, fans have revered <em>Modern Horizons 2</em> as one of the greatest sets to grace the TCG. Not only has its value never dropped, but every content creator I follow has nothing bad to say about it, often using boxes for giveaways. </p> <p data-characters="486" data-current-count="486" data-injectable="true">That’s why, when Wizards of the Coast announced <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/mtg-modern-horizons-3-release-date-set-information-and-where-to-buy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Modern Horizons 3</a></em>, I knew I needed to get in on it and pay attention. It would hopefully be the new standard for sets in <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> until <em>Modern Horizons 4</em>. Now that it’s out, we know that this set absolutely lived up to our extremely high expectations. The <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/mtg-modern-horizons-3-precon-commanders-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Commander Precons</a> are great, the Collector Boosters are fantastic, and the set is just great fun to play with, build decks around, and admire in a collection.</p>
 <p data-characters="303" data-current-count="303" data-injectable="false">So when offered the chance to sit down with senior game designer Michael Majors and product architect Mike Turian, I wanted to ask about everything: the goals for <em>Modern Horizons 3</em>, the designs, the story implications and more. Here’s everything we learned about the set from two of its designers.</p> <figure data-current-count="603" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="88" data-current-count="88" data-injectable="false"><strong>What makes the <em>Modern Horizons</em> sets such massive cornerstones of <em>MTG</em> expansions for you?</strong></p> <p data-characters="541" data-current-count="629" data-injectable="true"><strong>Michael Majors</strong>: “There are multiple components. One is that I’ve always loved Modern. It has a deep card pool that enables and rewards creative deck building. That has always been my favorite part of <em>Magic</em>, figuring out ways to combine disparate pieces or diamonds in the rough in exciting ways that result in a sum greater than its parts. Giving folks more toys to add to their metaphorical sandbox is a real highlight for me, and I take a lot of joy in providing interesting ways for people to express themselves through the cards.</p>
 <p data-characters="732" data-current-count="732" data-injectable="true">“The second is that <em>Modern Horizons</em>, by nature, not formally connected to a particular plane or story, gives us the opportunity to make both creative allusions and rich mechanical mashups that would be considered out of place or potentially too complex in a normal frontlist release. The product line was originally pitched as a ‘Time Spiral 2,’ a block known as a love letter to fans of <em>Magic</em> way back in 2006. Since then, there’s been a lot more <em>Magic</em> made that’s available to reference and draw upon. <em>Modern Horizon</em>’s creative conceit, which I often refer to<br>as ‘canonically out of place and time,’ gives us a ton of freedom to combine interesting ideas and reintroduce old characters.”</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="79" data-current-count="379" data-injectable="false"><strong>What were the team’s goals when sitting down to create <em>Modern Horizons 3</em>?</strong></p> <p data-characters="79" data-current-count="458" data-injectable="true"><strong>Michael Majors</strong>: “The short version was try not to break Modern too badly.</p>
 <p data-characters="459" data-current-count="459" data-injectable="true">“Joking aside, there were a lot of challenges and expectations that needed to be managed. Tradeoffs are always going to be a reality. We had received ample data and feedback at that stage that <em>Modern Horizons 2</em> was probably too pushed, and while fans of <em>Magic</em> love cracking open and playing with powerful cards, we needed to pivot in a slightly different direction. From the beginning, I knew we couldn’t “compete directly” with <em>Modern Horizons 2</em>.</p>
 <p data-characters="407" data-current-count="407" data-injectable="true">“Early on, there was exploration done to find some lapsed themes that were a part of Modern and Standard previously that fans could be excited about if they were brought back. This resulted in some cornerstones of the set – Eldrazi, and Energy, as well as some one-off designs that aren’t intended to overwrite the usefulness of cards that folks already own but give them new options to play with.</p>
 <p data-characters="468" data-current-count="468" data-injectable="true">“From the beginning, I intended <em>Modern Horizons 3</em> to target three primary audiences – competitive Modern players per the set’s namesake, Commander players, and folks who have nostalgia for <em>Magic</em>’s history. A looser goal was that many of the most exciting cards in the set could overlap with multiple portions of these audiences. Some examples of this are the energy rares referencing powerful cards from <em>Magic</em>’s past, Necrodominance, and Birthing Ritual.</p>
 <p data-characters="364" data-current-count="364" data-injectable="false">“The internet likes to joke that the <em>Horizons</em> product line is ‘Commander Horizons,’ but again, products like these require tradeoffs. Nobody would end up happy if the product had 200 shots at Modern, not only for its overall implications on the format but the simple reality that it would be impossible for the format to absorb that much content.</p> <p data-characters="656" data-current-count="1020" data-injectable="true">“On a micro level, <em>Modern Horizons 2</em> providing a bevy of both powerful individual rate cards as well as many strong answers to those rate cards. For the most part, we didn’t focus as heavily on <em>MH3</em> on providing more answer cards, with some exceptions, but wanted to give more power back to synergy cards, engines, and other lapsed strategies from Modern’s past. A good example of this is the MDFC Flip Planeswalkers. They’re individually powerful cards but shine the brightest when incorporated in some specific types of strategies – Spell-based combo, Graveyard strategies, Sacrifice decks, and Life Gain, to name a few possibilities.”</p>
 <p data-characters="131" data-current-count="131" data-injectable="false"><strong>Did you use <em>Modern Horizons 1+2</em> as baselines or reference points when putting this set together? Or did you look at <em>MTG</em> as a whole?</strong></p> <p data-characters="335" data-current-count="466" data-injectable="true"><strong>Michael Majors</strong>: “Absolutely, both! I admit, after having done all three of these sets, I’ve used a lot of my ideas, but grounding the set in more firm mechanical space (Energy, Eldrazi, Modifications) as well as getting fresh perspectives from team members helps a lot for creating more awesome and nostalgic content for folks.</p>
 <p data-characters="464" data-current-count="464" data-injectable="true">“We also give ourselves a lot to work with – essentially all of <em>Magic</em>’s history! In this case, we even went into Magic’s future – sort of. While <em>Modern Horizons 3</em> is releasing after <em>Murders of Karlov Manor</em>, of course, I loved the concept of using Collect Evidence on a graveyard-based card so much that we even pulled a mechanic forward from a set that hadn’t come out yet while we were designing <em>Modern Horizons 3</em> for Detective’s Phoenix.”</p>
 <p data-characters="109" data-current-count="109" data-injectable="false"><strong>Are there any particular moments in the <em>Modern Horizons 3</em> story that you’re particularly excited about?</strong></p> <p data-characters="624" data-current-count="733" data-injectable="true"><strong>Michael Majors</strong>: “As noted previously, <em>MH3</em>’s story larger takes place out of time and space, but we do get to capture a few specific moments and characters that are always awesome to see. The headliners are the MDFC Flip Planeswalkers – seeing their spark moment, as well as the Eldrazi, most notably Emrakul, the World Anew back dropped against the Innistrad moon that would become her prison. Some other highlights include seeing Shilgengar, Sire of Famine – the Elder Demon that Sorin’s family makes a pact with, as well Genku, Future Shaper – Tamiyo’s husband with whom they run an orphanage.”</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="262" data-current-count="562" data-injectable="true"><strong>The Eldrazi seem to draw upon the unknowable gods and ancient creatures from the entire cosmic horror sub-genre. How do you approach such powerful beings and bring them in line with all <em>MTG</em> cards so they’re not as overpowered as they would be in real life?</strong></p>
 <p data-characters="522" data-current-count="522" data-injectable="true"><strong>Michael Majors</strong>: “The mana system of <em>Magic</em> does a lot of work for us! They are way more powerful than the normal creatures you might see in <em>Magic</em>, but that’s the beauty of the game, you really must work for them. The question is where and how do you strike a balance of making players excited and satisfied by working so hard to cast these extremely powerful creatures. We want to make their arrival on the battlefield feel like an event that players will talk about – something worthy of their reputation.”</p>
 <p data-characters="236" data-current-count="236" data-injectable="false"><strong>Unlike most sets, <em>Modern Horizons 3</em> seems to draw a line at where <em>MTG</em> expansions have reached and pulls mechanics from them to help push the game forward. Which ones are you most excited about in <em>Modern Horizons 3</em> specifically, and why?</strong></p> <p data-characters="602" data-current-count="838" data-injectable="true"><strong>Michael Majors</strong>: “Energy! It’s cool and both tricky to develop and play with. I viewed it as a large opportunity to make cards that we can’t traditionally make – as an alternate resource, Energy really puts pressure on players to build around it synergistically and gives more freedom to us as designers to concentrate power among a very specific portion of the card pool. We wouldn’t really be able to make direction allusions to Recurring Nightmare or Alluren without severely powering them down, but using a restriction like Energy, we can make powerful cards worthy of their callbacks.</p>
 <p data-characters="418" data-current-count="418" data-injectable="true"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em> isn’t all card mechanics and playing the game, though, a decent chunk of the fan base consists of collectors who just want to pick up the cards and own them, <em>Magic: The Gathering Arena</em> players, and those who just want to watch others play but understand the cards on a deeper level by owning them. I’m certainly guilty of having purchased Commander Decks and not played with them yet. </p>
 <p data-characters="64" data-current-count="64" data-injectable="false"><strong>What was the inspiration for the Ripple Foil effect in this set?</strong></p> <p data-characters="432" data-current-count="496" data-injectable="true"><strong>Mike Turian</strong>: “We are always looking to find new, striking foil treatments for <em>Magic</em>. Ripple Foil has an amazing sheen to it, much like looking out at a ripple in a serene lake. With <em>Modern Horizons 3</em> being a celebration of Magic, we went out and searched for a treatment that would amplify the beauty of the artwork. Ripple Foil had that quality of being striking and making the already amazing art stand out even more.”</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Magic Madhouse</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="141" data-current-count="441" data-injectable="true"><strong>We’ve not seen Collector Commander decks since the launch of the<em> Warhammer 40K</em> sets. Why did you want<br><em>Modern Horizons 3</em> to have these?</strong></p>
 <p data-characters="736" data-current-count="736" data-injectable="true"><strong>Mike Turian</strong>: “When we set out making the first <em>Modern Horizons</em> set, we knew that it would appeal to players of the Modern format, and it did. What also happened was our community of Commander players got excited by the cards in <em>Modern Horizons 1</em> too. We saw this happen again in <em>Modern Horizons 2</em>. As it turns out Commander players love powerful and appealing cards. So, when we were planning out <em>Modern Horizons 3</em>, it made sense to be able to create cards with the feel of a Horizons set that were focused on solely the Commander audience. With the Commander decks being part of <em>MH3</em>, we were able to create new designs that had the feel of being part of <em>Modern Horizons 3</em>, without having to worry about how they played in Modern.</p>
 <p data-characters="364" data-current-count="364" data-injectable="false">“From there, the Collector editions of Commander decks had been quite popular with <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> and with <em>MH3</em> we saw a chance to combine the new Ripple Foil treatment with the cool new Commander-focused designs. The reception for the Collector Commander has already been so positive, I’m glad we could bring it all together for <em>Modern Horizons 3</em>.”</p> <p data-characters="116" data-current-count="480" data-injectable="true"><strong>If you’re allowed to reveal it, what is your favorite card, or cards, that you worked on from the set and why?</strong></p>
 <p data-characters="377" data-current-count="377" data-injectable="false"><strong>Michael Majors</strong>: “Phelia, Exuberant Shepherd. I’m very biased. She’s based off my dog. The thought process was essentially: people like dogs. I have a corgi; and we’ve never done a corgi. Ok, how would I show a corgi in <em>Magic</em>’s language? They’re herding dogs. Flickering things is like herding. If she herds your things, she gets a treat. And here we are.”</p> <p data-characters="139" data-current-count="516" data-injectable="true"><strong>What would you like players, both long-time fans and newcomers, to get out of <em>Modern Horizons 3</em> as they pick up cards and sit down to play?</strong></p>
 <p data-characters="431" data-current-count="431" data-injectable="false"><strong>Majors &amp; Turian</strong>: “Have fun and explore the possibility space. I’ve absolutely loved watching content creators brew with the cards even this early, and the fact that some of the cards don’t have so-obvious homes gives me a lot of joy as a deck builder. Whether you have nostalgia for the references and mechanical mashups of <em>Modern Horizons 3</em> or not, we hope that players everywhere love playing with the cards.”</p>

An <strong>Xbox  Game Pass Ultimate subscription</strong> can help, though, as it’ll provide day-one access to many of the titles currently in development.</p><p>Thankfully, CDKeys is now selling <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdkeys.com%2Fxbox-live%2F1-month-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-xbox-one-pc">one-month subscription codes for $10.19</a> (about $7 off) and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdkeys.com%2Fxbox-live%2F3-month-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-xbox-one-pc">three-month codes for $27.99</a> (about $23 off), the latter of which is a better deal. CDKeys is a trusted merchant here at <em>The Verge</em>, so don’t feel deterred if you’re unfamiliar with the name. The online retailer specializes in selling heavily discounted key codes for gaming products, whether you’re looking to save on subscriptions, full games, in-game currency, or post-launch DLC. </p><div><p>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate offers access to more than 100 titles, including new first-party releases on day one, which you can play on multiple devices. The pass also gives subscribers access to exclusive deals, online multiplayer, and Microsoft’s cloud gaming service, Xbox Cloud Gaming.</p></div><p>You can redeem the codes no matter which region you’re in, and you should be able to purchase and stack as many as you’d like so long as you’re under Microsoft’s 36-month pre-pay limit. (Not all of the codes at CDKeys are region-free and stackable, so double-check that you’re buying the correct one using the links above.) Plus, in this instance, both new and existing subscribers can redeem the digital codes.</p><p>You’ll certainly want to consider extending your subscription or finally making the jump from Game Pass Core, as Xbox has put together arguably one of its strongest gaming lineups ever going into 2025. Perhaps the most significant launch is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24172052/gears-6-xbox-summer-game-fest-trailer">an all-new <em>Gears of War</em> prequel subtitled <em>E-Day</em></a>, which follows the friction that Marcus Fenix, Dom, and the rest of their COG cohorts experienced when the locusts first emerged.

            <p>The original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil">Resident Evil</a> might be returning to PC - and soon! - if recent signs hold true. An age rating for the 1996 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">survival-horror</a> classic was recently confirmed by European suitability judges PEGI, hinting at an impending (re-)release for the almost three-decade-old zombie game.</p>

<p>Before you butt in to tell me that Resident Evil 1 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/304240/Resident_Evil/">is already on PC</a>, it’s time for some clarification! The <a href="https://pegi.info/search-pegi?q=Resident+Evil&amp;op=Search&amp;age%5B%5D=&amp;descriptor%5B%5D=&amp;publisher=&amp;platform%5B%5D=&amp;release_year%5B%5D=&amp;page=1&amp;form_build_id=form-ATBS9F3l3HEr1D9FIZavGcU82YJkYSz9MyGRwstz_Po&amp;form_id=pegi_search_form">new PEGI rating</a> spotted by Gematsu refers specifically to a PC port of the very original Resident Evil released on PlayStation in 1996, rather than the later remake released first for GameCube in 2002 before then serving as the basis for the more recent (relatively, anyway) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-resident-evil-hd-remaster">HD remaster from 2015</a>. (If you’re wondering: it’s a PEGI 18, obviously.)</p>
<p>A second point of clarification for those smart-asses still holding up their hands: yes, the original Resident Evil from 1996 has <em>technically </em>already been released on PC before, hitting Japanese computers the year of its release before finding its way to North American and European keyboards-and-mice the following year.</p>
<p>However, that PC version dates from the age of disc drives and CRT monitors - both of which are now dead enough to rise from the grave as shambling techno-corpses themselves - and has never been released digitally through the likes of Steam, Epic Games Store or GOG. So this’ll mark the first time in almost 30 years that the very first, non-remake Resident Evil has been available to play without hunting down a secondhand physical disc or taking, ahem, <em>other </em>routes.</p>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">The original Resident Evil (1996) has been rated for PC in Europe. Resident Evil was technically already released for PC in 1996, but I guess it's not actually available via Steam or any digital marketplaces these days. <a href="https://t.co/hVHlkCWRrx">pic.twitter.com/hVHlkCWRrx</a></p>— Gematsu (@gematsu) <a href="https://twitter.com/gematsu/status/1802945852689801265?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 18, 2024</a></blockquote></div> <p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>There’s still time to squeeze in one more clarification, don’t you fear. The PEGI rating doesn’t make completely clear if this Resident Evil will be the very original or its expanded Director’s Cut, featuring rearranged item and enemy placements alongside some new costumes, a better gun (which had a random chance to blow zombies’ heads off, like in the remake) and a beginner difficulty mode, which was only ever released for PlayStation in 1997. However, given that the PEGI entry does specify "Resident Evil (1996)" and the Director’s Cut has never escaped PlayStation, it may well be the vanilla original for now.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, PEGI's entry states the release date of the Resident Evil PC port as June 18th - yesterday. That might be a mix-up with the date the rating was approved, or it might mean that a surprise re-release isn’t very far away…</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24181252/boys-vought-on-ice-lets-put-christ-back-christmas<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="wByDyS">There is no amount of sonic pain composer Christopher Lennertz won’t endure for his bud of 30 years Eric Kripke, the current showrunner of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24176428/the-boys-season-4-review-new"><em>The Boys</em></a>. Lennertz previously listened to endless amounts of boy band slop to pen the Super-Sweet single <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8wIfVnaorc">“Rock My Kiss”</a> for season 3 and pushed himself to write the gooiest sentimental track imaginable for Starlight’s pop-star moment, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw_OHwI5dUQ">“Never Truly Vanish,”</a> and now he’s back with season 4’s “Let’s Put the Christ Back in Christmas.”</p>
<p id="Qd942u">“If there’s anything I can say about <em>The Boys</em>, it’s that we do our research,” Lennertz tells Polygon, with minimal eye twitch.</p>
<p id="wOmPjF">Former fraternity brothers who embarked together into Hollywood with no money and a high tolerance for Taco Bell, Lennertz and Kripke have formed a mind-meld rapport thanks to years on <em>Supernatural</em> and <em>Revolution</em>. So the writer knew he could deliver minimal instruction for what he wanted for the proposed Vought on Ice sequence in season 4 episode 3, “We’ll Keep the Red Flag Flying Here,” Lennertz says. </p>
<p id="d88P6Y">“I get literally one short paragraph that says, ‘Homeland and Maeve as ice skaters come out, sing a Vaught-produced song about war on Christmas, there’s a nativity scene and Jesus, and then everybody gets killed.’ And then it says something about ‘putting Christ back in Christmas.’ That’s the whole assignment.”</p>
<p id="xt1xnh">The dynamic between showrunner and composer is more about vibes. As Lennertz began work on “Let’s Put the Christ Back in Christmas,” he began watching video after video of Ice Capades, Disney on Ice, Frozen on Ice, and any other bit of source material that could inform the finished dance. “I knew I needed sleigh bells and I knew it needed to be fast,” he says. Then the Vought of it all pours in, which Kripke is good for. Around the time Lennertz was matching high notes to laser sounds, his old friend was sending him articles about the latest anti-Christmas fearmongering. Lennertz recalls the news of Candace Cameron Bure’s <a href="https://ew.com/tv/candace-cameron-bure-new-christmas-movies-wont-feature-lgbt-love-stories/">deal with the Great American Family network</a>, and her stance against Hallmark Channel’s LGBTQ+ representation in Christmas movies, as an exasperated-sigh-worthy beacon for the satire.</p>
<p id="33Sgtw">“[Eric] has very little patience for that kind of silliness, as do I,” Lennertz says. “We’re pretty open people. So that was sort of our job from the very beginning.”</p>

<p id="31FsRC">Lennertz’s big dream for the sequence was to go bigger than anything <em>The Boys </em>had done before. This was not his first big showstopper number — Lennertz previously worked with musical legends Alan Menken and Marc Shaiman to expand <em>Hawkeye</em>’s fake Avengers show <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22800803/hawkeye-cast-rogers-the-musical-song"><em>Rogers: The Musical</em></a> into <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23612226/rogers-the-musical-disney-parks-hawkeye-captain-america-broadway">an actual stage event for Disney California Adventure</a> — and his mind immediately went to Broadway to fill the vocal roster for the song. While the actors on screen are all ice-skating professionals, the song touts Andrew Rannells (<em>The Book of Mormon</em>) as Homelander, Shoshana Bean (<em>Hairspray</em>, <em>Hell’s Kitchen</em>) as Maeve, and James Monroe Iglehart (<em>Aladdin</em>, <em>Hamilton</em>) as Jesus.</p>
<p id="gc9TzC">“I texted Eric, and I was like, ‘Can we shoot for big Broadway stars and make this a big cameo thing?’” he recalls. “And as soon as I got the permission for that, I’m like, <em>Well, that’s gotta be Andrew</em>. And then we got a Black Jesus in James Monroe Iglehart, who then of course Vought makes into a white Jesus later, which is so Vought. [...] Thankfully, they all said yes. And they were all my first choice, every single one of them. I got real lucky.”</p>
<p id="y7Pu6t">The finished version of “Let’s Put the Christ Back in Christmas” is painfully real, as far as schmaltzy ice-skating dance numbers go. Then it just becomes simply… painful. You can watch the unstained version above, but for the whole bloody affair, head to Prime Video, where the first three episodes of <em>The Boys</em> season 4 are currently streaming.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/banana-developer-says-game-isnt-a-scam/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>The developer <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/banana-steam-make-money/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">behind the viral clicker game</a> Banana is coming to the game’s defense, saying it’s not the scam people are making it out to be.</p>



<p>Taking to the game’s official Discord server, co-owner aestheticsparn said that there is “no scamming” happening with Banana. In fact, the developers want to make the game more than what it currently is.</p>



<p>“We cannot wait to turn this game into something bigger and better than just a clicker game,” they wrote. “Please stay on the lookout as we have been and still are working on a large amount of updates to improve the game and let you all do much more with your bananas.”</p>



<p>If you don’t know what Banana is, it’s a pretty simple concept. You open a banana, click said banana, earn drops that vary in value, and repeat. Where the actual value comes in, it’s unclear. However, people seem to be hooked on it as it has become the <a href="https://steamdb.info/charts/?sort=peak" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ninth-most-played game in Steam history</a>, ahead of game’s like Baldur’s Gate 3, Hogwarts Legacy, Apex Legends, and more.</p>



<p>Along with the overall goal of what they hope to achieve with the game, it was revealed that a member of the team was let go after it came to light that they were previously involved with a Bitcoin scam on the Steam marketplace.</p>



<p>“As you all have heard by now Theselions used to be involved in a steam market ‘bitcoin’ scam/bug,” aestheticspartan said. “We did not know about this until recent videos started to point this out and we had a talk almost immediately with the whole team about the situation. </p>



<p>“We gave him the chance to explain the situation to us and we know he is showing remorse and is sorry about what happened in the past.”</p>



<p>One issue that sits with the game is that there is likely a bot problem. With it being free on Steam, users are able to create hundreds of extra accounts in order to try and get more and rarer banana drops.</p>



<p>“Unfortunately we are currently facing some problems around botting, since the game takes basically 1% to no resources of your PC, people are abusing up to 1000 alternative accounts in order to get Rarer drops or at least drops in bulk,” one developer known as Hery told <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24173617/banana-clicker-game-steam-egg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>.</p>

Developer NetherRealm has insisted this cap lets it create flashier cutscenes, but some players have said the switch from 60 to 30 and back again is jarring.</p><p>Now, in <a href="https://mortalkombat1.bugs.wbgames.com/patch-notes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a fresh update for Mortal Kombat 1</a>, that 30fps cap is removed with the addition of a new graphics setting that increases the lock to 60fps on PC only, but it’s worth noting that NetherRealm warned this setting is intended for PC gamers with high-end rigs.</p><p>The patch, also available on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, makes a number of character fixes, including to the recently released DLC character Homelander. The patch notes are below.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Mortal Kombat 1 - Homelander First Look Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Also this week, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-dev-delays-ferra-kameo-launch-announces-takeda-release-date">NetherRealm delayed the launch of Kameo character Ferra and announced the release date of the final Kombat Pack 1 DLC character, Takeda</a>. Ferra, the small fighter who sat atop the hulking Torr as part of the combined Ferra &amp; Torr character from Mortal Kombat X, was set to hit Mortal Kombat 1 in Kameo form later in June, but now launches alongside Takeda's early access release on July 23.</p><p>Thoughts now turn to what follows for Mortal Kombat 1 during its second year, with NetherRealm yet to announce future DLC plans.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/creatures-of-ava-wants-you-to-save-its-many-adorable-animals-in-august.905910/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/creatures-of-ava-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>11 bit studios and developer Inverge have announced the&nbsp;<em>Creatures of Ava&nbsp;</em>release date, and the adorable-looking creature-saving action-adventure game (that's a lot of hyphens) is launching very soon.</p>
<p><em>Creatures of Ava&nbsp;</em>is arriving on August 7th across PC and Xbox Series X|S, and if you've ever wished that creature-collecting games focused a little less on "collection" and a little more on actually helping the species in question, this one's for you.</p>
<p>11 bit and Inverge's game takes place on the titular planet of Ava, which an infection known only as The Withering is slowly destroying. It doesn't take a genius to spot the ecological parallels of this one, but that doesn't make them any less timely.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/creatures-of-ava-release-date-flute.jpg?itok=bARyUrQx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/creatures-of-ava-release-date-flute.jpg?itok=WztVLJkK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Creatures of Ava&nbsp;</em>wants you to help save its many adorable species of animal.</figcaption></figure><p>Perhaps somewhat surprisingly, the game is not a life sim, nor is it an open-world survival-crafter. Rather, it's an action-adventure game with an intriguing-sounding "non-violent combat system".</p>
<p>It'll offer four distinct biomes to explore, each with different creatures to discover and save. Said creatures range from dinosaur-like bipeds through to flying creatures reminiscent of mosquitoes, and plenty more besides.</p>
<p>Some of the creatures may look more dangerous or intimidating than others, but this isn't a game where you'll have to worry about getting blindsided by a giant stegosaurus, so don't worry.</p>
<p>You can check out a short but rather adorable trailer showing off a few of&nbsp;<em>Creatures of Ava</em>'s, well, creatures right here.</p>

<p>As well as the creatures themselves, you'll also meet with the Naam, a tribe of Ava's inhabitants who have their own unique customs to learn.</p>
<p>Those inhabitants will teach you melodies on the flute that you can use to pacify and tame some of Ava's wilder creatures. As you can tell, this one's all about working in harmony with nature rather than against it.</p>
<p><em>Creatures of Ava&nbsp;</em>arrives on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2304440/Creatures_of_Ava/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/creatures-of-ava/9NV5LTSPHQD2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on August 7th, and it's also coming to Game Pass on day one. Give it a look if you want to bring out your inner animal lover.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-stories-2-sales-pass-the-two-million-mark.905907/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-stories-2-sales-two-million<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has revealed that&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Stories 2&nbsp;</em>sales have reached a major milestone almost three years after the turn-based RPG's original release.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e240619.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a press release</a>,&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter 2: Wings of Ruin&nbsp;</em>has sold over two million copies since it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-stories-2-wings-of-ruins-release-date-and-more-revealed-in-digital-event">released in July 2021</a>. It originally launched on PC and Nintendo Switch before <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-stories-2-announced-for-ps4-monster-hunter-stories-release-date-revealed">coming to PlayStation 4</a> last week.</p>
<p>The aforementioned press release doesn't break down what proportion of the game's sales are attributable to each platform, nor how much of a sales boost the PS4 version of&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Stories 2&nbsp;</em>may have provided.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-stories-2-sales-field.jpg?itok=19zUUSE5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-stories-2-sales-field.jpg?itok=yzjP1X13 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Monster Hunter Stories 2&nbsp;</em>offers turn-based RPG action with a&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>twist.</figcaption></figure><p>On July 20th, 2021, around eleven days after&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Stories 2&nbsp;</em>originally launched, Capcom announced that the game had <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e210720.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">sold a million copies</a> around the world.</p>
<p>That means it's accrued another million since then, although that million has obviously been a lot slower to come than the first million was. Still, two million sales for a turn-based&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>spinoff is solid.</p>
<p>Of course,&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Stories 2&nbsp;</em>hasn't managed to reach the same level as mainline&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>does, but that's hardly fair given that the series is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-series-sales-100-million-anniversary">one of Capcom's biggest earners</a> alongside <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-village-sales-10-million">franchises like&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil</em></a>.</p>
<p>As for why&nbsp;<em>Stories 2&nbsp;</em>has captured so many people's imaginations, Capcom says it's down to the "engaging all-new story about Monster Riders", as well as other elements "unique to RPGs".</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Stories 2</em>, it is, believe it or not, the followup to&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Stories</em>, and just like that game, it's a turn-based RPG with a reduced focus on hunting compared to the main series.</p>
<p>In&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Stories 2</em>, you play as the grandchild of legendary Rider Red, and you must investigate the reason behind Rathalos disappearing around the world.</p>
<p>As your journey unfolds, you'll recruit "Monsties" (d'aww) to your cause, hatching them from eggs and raising them to fight for you in battle.</p>
<p><em>Monster Hunter Stories 2&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1277400/Monster_Hunter_Stories_2_Wings_of_Ruin/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10007583" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 4</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/monster-hunter-stories-2-wings-of-ruin-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.

    <div>
  

        <p>"What I see in Veilguard is a game that finally bridges the gap."</p>

            <p>
Former Dragon Age executive producer Mark Darrah <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bioware-veterans-casey-hudson-and-mark-darrah-have-left-the-studio">left BioWare in 2020</a>, commenting that "I know that Dragon Age won't just survive without me, it will thrive". We'll never quite learn the truth of that claim, for Darrah has now rejoined BioWare to work as a consultant on the recently revealed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>. He reckons it's thriving. Specifically, he thinks this is the most enjoyable Dragon Age's combat has ever been. Shhh, nobody tell the Inquisition.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
"What I see in Veilguard is a game that finally bridges the gap," Darrah told internet-based magazine <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive/2024/06/18/a-deep-dive-into-dragon-age-the-veilguards-combat-abilities-skill-tree-and">Game Informer</a> in a new preview that digs a bit deeper into the game's newly tactical management-lite fisticuffs. "Uncharitably, previous Dragon Age games got to the realm of 'combat wasn't too bad.' In this game, the combat's actually fun, but it does keep that thread that's always been there. You have the focus on Rook, on your character, but still have that control and character coming into the combat experience from the other people in your party." 
</p>
<p>
The piece also includes some commentary from game director Corinne Busche, who notes that Dragon Age's combat has long been in a state of flux, and justifies the shift towards real-time as making It Feel As Though You're Actually There. "Every single entry reimagines what combat is like and I would say our goal was to make sure we had a system that allowed players to feel like they actually were able to step into the world of Thedas," Busche told the site. "They're not a player observing from afar - they are inside of this world. Being this authentic world that's brought to life, the combat system needs to support that, so you are in control of every single action, every block, every dodge, every swing of your sword."
</p>
<p>
I'm always a bit grumpy about arguments that real-time combat is more immersive, authentic, or what-have-you than, say, turn-based. Dragon Age is a game in which I float in the air outside my character's body while they shoot purple lightning at demonic incarnations of pride. I am never going to feel like I'm "inside of this world", even if I push the button that fires that specific lightning bolt. I'm more convinced by Busche's following remarks that she wants Dragon Age: The Veilguard's combat and upgrades to hinge on "real numbers" - that is, chunky figures such as +25% whose impact can actually be understood at a glance. 
</p>
<p>
In general, Veilguard's upgrades are "about changing the way you play, not the statistical minutiae", Busche explains, with passive abilities including guaranteed critical hits and jump attacks. I would say that Inquisition's fussier percentages do change the way you play, but Veilguard's system definitely sounds like it'll involve less time in menus doing sums. The transition here reminds me of the transition from Darkest Dungeon 1 to Darkest Dungeon 2, which also simplifies the stats into multiples of 12.5, and is none the worse for it.
</p>
<p>
There's also some detail about companions, who get smaller upgrade trees than that of main character Rook (in Inquisition, each character has access to broadly the same quantity of options). They're levelled up by ranking up your Relationship with them, which earns a skill point; it sounds like they don't accrue XP the old-fashioned way, though the picture is unclear.
</p>
<p>
"[Companions] are their own people," Busche said of how companions act in the fray. "They have their own behaviors, they have their own autonomy on the battlefield, they'll pick their own targets. As their plots progress, they'll learn how to use their abilities more competently, and it really feels like you're fighting alongside these realized characters in battle." It's still important to wield character abilities in tandem, however. Busche gave the example of one character slowing time so that another can fire off a heavy knockdown attack, allowing the player to land a finishing blow. "It is a game about creating this organic sense of teamwork."
</p>
<p>
In <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-first-45-minutes-of-dragon-age-the-veilguard-feel-as-much-like-mass-effect-2-as-inquisition">my own first look at Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> I wrote that "I am definitely in mourning for the less kinetic, more strategic Dragon Age that might have been, but I'm more excited for Veilguard than I thought I'd be after copping the first trailer". Since then we've learned that the game will <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-strips-your-rpg-party-down-to-two-companions-but-theyll-be-deeper-with-a-lot-more-banter">restrict you to a couple of companions in battle</a>, in another step away from Inquisition's party-based tactics. So yeah, still grieving a bit, but I remain hopeful that The Veilguard will prove an entertaining action-RPG if not the Dragon Age fourquel I wanted. The key thing, for me, will be the plot. I don't mind this being a slicked-back punchfest if there's a gorgeous dark fantasy melodrama involved. Fingers crossed I'm able to play again before release and get a sense of events beyond the prologue.

<p>Ubisoft is facing some controversy with the “Assassin’s Creed Shadows Dubbing Challenge” contest for TikTok, announced on June 18. The winners of this contest will be granted a unique opportunity to delve deeper into the captivating world of voice acting, joining a recording session led by seasoned professionals, including the renowned Danny Wallace (Shaun Hastings). </p>



<p>Participants will also be able to lend their voices to a secondary NPC, with their dubbing to be featured in the highly anticipated Assassin’s Creed Shadows upon its release.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Contestants must follow Assassin’s Creed or Ubisoft TikTok accounts according to their preferred language out of the seven options. From there, they must choose one of the Assassin’s Creed cutscenes being progressively added to those accounts this week. Then, you must use the ‘Duet Feature’ and record yourself reading the script. Once that is done, post the video on your TikTok account with #AssassinsCreedDubbingChallenge. The team will then choose the best performer for each language.</p>



<p>After emerging victorious in the Ubisoft contest, the Assassin’s Creed team will fly you to London to lend your voice to a secondary NPC for AC Shadows. Furthermore, you will undergo specialized voice training under the guidance of a professional coach and will have a personal recording session. While this opportunity might seem like a dream to Assassin’s Creed players, industry experts have criticized it, labelling the contest as exploitative.</p>



<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ubisoft-accused-of-exploiting-fans-by-offering-voiced-roles-in-assassins-creed-shadows-as-contest-prize/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=ubisoft-accused-of-exploiting-fans-by-offering-voiced-roles-in-assassins-creed-shadows-as-contest-prize" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Destructoid</a>, Senior voice artists such as Rufus Wright from Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, Jennifer Caitlin Roberts from Fire Emblem Heroes, and Jack Sapsford have voiced concerns about this challenge. <a href="https://x.com/rufusgwright/status/1803186900271763584" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Wright</a>, who has dedicated countless hours to voicing Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, a job for which he was compensated as a professional, stated, <em>“Using fans to work for free is a really, really bad look, particularly when these games gross billions of dollars.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/JackSapsford/status/1803119281036738711" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sapsford</a> chimed in, stating that voicing lines for characters is considered <em>“a job and not a competition” </em>He also advised that contestants should remember to charge $250 per hour for their work. On the other hand, <a href="https://x.com/akaGhostBird/status/1803334410777026819" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Caitlin Roberts</a> raised another important issue, asking Ubisoft whether we could get “confirmation” that the fan submissions will not be used to train AI, highlighting the ethical implications of the contest.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/warzone-devs-have-nerfed-c4-explosives-and-the-community-is-split/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=warzone-devs-have-nerfed-c4-explosives-and-the-community-is-split<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="174" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Raven Software has dropped a nerf to reduce the effectiveness of C4 explosives, and while some <em>Warzone</em> players are delighted, a vocal group is not pleased with the decision. </p> <p data-characters="286" data-current-count="286" data-injectable="false">In a tweet late on June 18, Raven confirmed they had “shipped a minor update that includes changes to C4.” The patch reduced the explosive’s throw velocity by 15%, brought its radius down from eight to seven meters, and toned down outer radius damage from 155 to 138. </p> <figure data-current-count="586" data-injectable="true"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>🗒️ <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Warzone?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Warzone</a></p><p>We've shipped a minor update that includes the following changes to C4:</p><p>• Throw velocity has been reduced by 15%.<br>• Radius has been reduced to 7 meters, down from 8.<br>• Outer radius damage has been reduced to 138, down from 155.</p></div>— Call of Duty Updates (@CODUpdates) <a href="https://twitter.com/CODUpdates/status/1803222366702514281?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 19, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure>
 <p data-characters="255" data-current-count="255" data-injectable="false">C4 has always been useful, and at times has been dominant in the meta. Most often, they are used to eliminate downed opponents, as you can simply throw one in the general direction of an injured enemy, press your trigger, and blow them back to the lobby. </p> <p data-characters="262" data-current-count="517" data-injectable="true">Recently though, they’ve been used more often as an offensive weapon against opponents who are not downed, and players were complaining about their range and the damage output, so it’s no surprise that many of the comments in response were in favor. </p>
 <p data-characters="254" data-current-count="254" data-injectable="false">However, there were dissenting voices too, with some calling it “lame,” while others suggesting they should have been focusing on other things, like the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/mw3-devs-are-finally-nerfing-the-overpowered-kar98k-but-not-everyone-is-happy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upcoming nerf for the Kar98k</a> or issues with anti-cheat or the game’s party system. </p> <p data-characters="171" data-current-count="425" data-injectable="true">For some, the nerfs simply don’t go far enough, with a player named Tom responding: “That’s barely a change at all, still going to be overpowered.”</p>
 <p data-characters="457" data-current-count="457" data-injectable="false">Still, it’s an improvement on days gone by, when the C4 was so powerful that you couldn’t spot an opponent without seeing a C4 flying through the air toward you. This nerf isn’t going to make them unusable, but should make them a little more balanced. If you can throw one and get it at your enemy’s feet, you’ll still be able to blow them to smithereens, so I wouldn’t suggest ditching them from your loadouts just yet. </p>

            <p>Yesterday, we <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-shutter-studio-tectonic-and-cancel-troubled-sims-competitor-life-by-you">learned that</a> Sims-like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/life-by-you">Life By You</a> had been canceled, and its developers Paradox Tectonic had been shut down by parent company Paradox Interactive. Later the same day, game designer Willem Delventhal shared more a detailed account of his experience working on the game through to its cancellation, via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7208887303224606720/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>

<p>Paradox <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sims-contender-life-by-you-gets-delayed-once-again-this-time-indefinitely">delayed Life By You indefinitely on 21st May</a>, having previously announced that it would launch on 4th June. According to Delventhal, however, it wasn't till some weeks after that the developers were told that they were being laid off.</p>
<p>“Two weeks before launch we were told we wouldn't be launching, and just now that we've all lost our jobs” Delventhal writes in the LinkedIn post, which has attracted messages of support from other former Paradox Tectonic staff. "We were only informed of this via a public announcement.”</p>
<p>The “public announcement” in question was yesterday’s post from Paradox Interactive CEO Fredrik Wester. “This is difficult and drastic news for our colleagues at Tectonic, who’ve worked hard on Life by You’s Early Access release,” said Wester. “Sadly, with cancellation of their sole project, we have to take the tough decision to close down the studio.”</p>
<p>Paradox, says Delventhal, never really communicated the reasons for suspending Life By You's release. “Instead we spent a month in purgatory, and did everything we could to prove to them we were worth launching, including things like finding potential buyers or suggesting cutting ties and going indie. We heard virtually nothing back.”</p>
<p>Life By You has long had a reputation for being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sims-contender-life-by-you-gets-delayed-once-again-this-time-indefinitely">a difficult project</a>, thanks to repeated delays, but Delventhal - who’s part of <a href="https://indiegameacademy.com/">educational workshop The Indie Game Academy</a> - says the team had been doing "extremely well" in recent months.</p>
<p>"I cannot share specific numbers, but I can say that we had an internal metric we were aiming for that had been approved, and that we exceeded that number by a significant portion," he writes in the post. "We also got a thumbs up a few weeks before launch."</p>
<p>Delventhal has his own speculations about why Life By You was cancelled, commenting that "as a business owner, some of them are understandable, but many of them are not", but he doesn't want to indulge in conjecture.</p>
<p>"We were a strong team on a strong project ready to launch to a strong audience," he concludes. "Really I'd like to be much more fire and brimstone about it. I'm pretty pissed, not gonna lie. But I'm trying to stay kind and respectful. So instead I'll say: this industry has become a place in which you can deliver more than expected, have AA money behind you, and still have the rug pulled two weeks before launch."</p>
<p>Paradox Interactive reported <a href="https://videogames.si.com/news/paradox-financials-2023">record revenue last year</a>, but a decrease in profits.</p>

<p>June 18th: Today, Paradox Interactive announced that following its cancellation of <em>Life by You</em>, it's also <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/media/press-releases/press-release/paradox-interactive-to-close-down-paradox-tectonic" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Paradox Interactive to close down Paradox Tectonic">closing the game's developer</a> Paradox Tectonic, laying off 24 employees as a result.</p>
<p>Original Story Below</p>
<hr><p>Fans of cozy life simulators got some sad news today. Paradox Interactive has announced <em>Life By You</em>, their highly anticipated life simulator, has been shelved. This is disappointing for fans of the project since it was seen as competition for EA's <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/sims-4" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>The Sims</em></a> series.</p>
<h2>The <em>Life By You</em> Cancellation</h2>
<p>The cancellation of <em>Life By You</em> was announced in a <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/life-by-you-is-cancelled.1688889/">Paradox forum post</a> by Deputy CEO Mattias Lilja. Lilja mentions that the decision was difficult and a failure on Paradox's part to meet expectations.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/life-by-you-conversation-system-screenshot.jpg?itok=yblRMSCR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/life-by-you-conversation-system-screenshot.jpg?itok=XvgszgKL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Guess we won't see this get any more polish.</figcaption></figure><p>Lilja continues stating the developers were given a fair shot to realize the game's potential, citing two different delays as well as choosing to hold off on an Early Access release.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A few weeks back, we decided to hold off on an Early Access release in order to re-evaluate <em>Life by You</em>, as we still felt that the game was lacking in some key areas. Though a time extension was an option, once we took that pause to get a wider view of the game, it became clear to us that the road leading to a release that we felt confident about was far too long and uncertain. This is not to say the game has not shown any promising qualities; <em>Life by You</em> had a number of strengths and the hard work of a dedicated team that went into realizing them. However, when we come to a point where we believe that more time will not get us close enough to a version we would be satisfied with, then we believe it is better to stop. This is obviously tough and disappointing for everyone who poured their time and enthusiasm into this project, especially when our decision comes so late in the process.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Overall, Lilja's explanation of <em>Life By You's</em> cancellation is measured and principled; putting accountability on management. It puts into perspective the promises and ambition the game touted on its Steam storepage. It also sours our preview of the game, which held promise.</p>
<p>The cancellation of <em>Life By You</em> is a shame for fans of the recent trend of cozy games. Life simulators are built around pleasant suburban environments and a relaxed atmosphere. These have included high profile releases like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/disney-dreamlight-valley" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Disney Dreamlight Valley</em></a>, and smaller indie titles like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/cozy-grove" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Cozy Grove</em></a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/was-metroid-prime-4-running-on-switch-2<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">IGN asked tech experts Digital Foundry to analyse the gameplay footage to get the definitive answer.</h2></div><section><p>While this week’s Nintendo Direct was full of surprises, perhaps the biggest was that we finally got a release date for Metroid Prime 4 and, more importantly, our first proper look at gameplay seven years after it was initially announced. It was enough to send <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C8X_tCXyYCw/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>some fans into meltdown</u></a> and it’s with equal parts relief and excitement to know the long-awaited sequel is finally coming in 2025.</p><p>But once the dust settled, some parts of the internet started asking the question: Was Metroid Prime 4 running on Switch 2? The release date certainly ties in with everything we know about the Switch successor, plus there are moments in the trailer when it looks like a step up from what we’ve seen on the original Switch hardware. Of course, Nintendo would never come out and say what the demo was running on so IGN sought the advice of the next best thing – the tech experts at <a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Digital Foundry</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>For years, Digital Foundry has been analysing video game performance to an unparalleled level and recently did a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-inside-nvidias-latest-hardware-for-nintendo-what-is-the-t239-processor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>deep dive into what we can expect from Nintendo’s next-generation of hardware</u></a>, so it’s better placed than anyone to provide trustworthy insight into Metroid Prime 4’s gameplay reveal.</p><p>So, was Metroid Prime 4 running on Switch 2?</p><p>Digital Foundry’s technology editor Richard Leadbetter gave us the definitive answer: “It's looking great and there are a couple of nice effects in there we took a closer look at, but ultimately, all the evidence points to this game running on the original Switch. The internal rendering resolution counts out at 900p, which is the same as Metroid Prime Remastered. And as good as it is, there are some aliasing issues and even some very minor frame-rate drops. Everything about the visual make-up is consistent with a really well-made Switch game, where Retro has an excellent track record. I can imagine the development studio is really happy that people are making a connection with Switch 2, mind you.”</p><p>So although many were convinced we’d had our first look at a Switch 2 game in Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, the truth is it’s likely running on existing hardware. While that’s disappointing for some, it’s also hardly surprising; I expect Nintendo to pull out all the stops when the Switch successor is finally revealed rather than stealth-drop our first look at the end of an (admittedly surprising) Nintendo Direct.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There's a few things at play but ultimately it's the skill of the developer working on a fixed platform they've had time to get to know over a great period of time</p></div><p>That said, developer Retro Studios should be congratulated because making a game look this good on technology that’s over seven years old is no mean feat, and Leadbetter explains how Retro might have managed to achieve it: “There's a few things at play here but ultimately it's the skill of the developer working on a fixed platform they've had time to get to know over a great period of time. That singular focus makes great things possible. Another good example would be Halo 4 on Xbox 360 – at the end of a console's lifecycle you get to see the hardware pushed in ways you would have never envisaged earlier on.”</p><p>Another reason the gameplay demo could look as good as it does is because it might be representative of what the final game will look like rather than exactly how it’ll turn out. It’s certainly not uncommon for this to be the case with early looks at games and it’s also not the first time Nintendo has done something similar, as Leadbetter reveals: “Nintendo has released some trailer assets that looked better than the final release games. There's the now legendary '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLlZBwN_-C4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Too Big For Switch</u></a>' trailer for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Nf51ixmR9o" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>trailer for Bayonetta 3</u></a> that ran consistently at 60fps where the final game certainly does not. However, in this case, with this developer and a game in gestation for this long, the instinct is to say that this is Switch 1 and representative of the actual console experience. If it were on Switch 2, we'd expect anti-aliasing via DLSS  – there is none at all in this trailer – and a higher output resolution, for starters.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>[For Switch 2] I'd expect any kinks in performance to be ironed out, while running at a higher resolution, potentially augmented by DLSS</p></div><p>While all evidence points to Metroid Prime 4’s gameplay reveal being on original Switch hardware then, there’s no doubt given its 2025 release that it will eventually make it onto the Switch 2. Indeed, cross-gen games have long been part of every new console cycle for years and it would make sense that Retro is developing an upgraded version of Metroid Prime 4 for when Switch 2 finally comes out. Which begs the question – what improvements can we expect to see over Metroid Prime 4 running on the original Switch? We can only theorise right now, but Leadbetter has his thoughts: “It’s a tricky one because it's as much about Nintendo's cross-gen strategy as it is about the capabilities of the hardware. One thing that always stands out from running Switch games on PC emulators is how scalable the artwork is. The quality of the art itself benefits immensely from higher resolutions, while gameplay benefits from higher frame-rates. At the very least, I'd expect any remaining kinks in performance to be ironed out, while running at a higher resolution, potentially augmented by DLSS. If there are noticeable loading times, you'd expect those to be reduced as Switch 2 has faster storage plus a hardware decompression block to ease the load on the CPU.”</p><div data-cy="carousel"><h3>Nintendo Direct June 2024 Games</h3><p>Every game featured in the Nintendo Direct on June 18, 2024.</p></div><p>Of course, faster loading times and improved visuals are commonplace for cross-gen games running on more powerful hardware, but personally it’s something I’m still excited for – not just for Metroid Prime 4 but also Nintendo’s other back catalogue. I would buy a Switch 2 in a heartbeat if it brought out improved versions of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom and I’m sure I’m not alone.</p><p>But we don’t know what Nintendo’s approach will be with Switch 2 right now. Many are hoping for backwards-compatibility, myself included, but what about cross-gen games running on Switch 2? “The question is whether Nintendo goes for 'easy wins' like higher resolutions, higher precision effects and so on, as we've seen on Sony and Microsoft consoles before”, says Leadbetter. “Or will it dip into the Switch 2's feature set more extensively and push for more game-changing effects. It does support ray tracing, after all.”</p><p>If Nintendo’s past has taught us anything, it’s that it doesn’t like to follow in the footsteps of others so I’m hoping Nintendo goes all out with Switch 2.</p><p><em>Alex Simmons is IGN's Features Director.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
