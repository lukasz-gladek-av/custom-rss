            <p>Xbox boss <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> said its brand identity is "evolving" now keeping first-party games exclusive to its own platform is no longer "a path for [Xbox]".</p>
<p>When asked by independent games journalist <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/phil-spencer-120725254">Dustin Legarie</a> if, like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a> would continue to have an "exclusivity window" on Xbox systems, Spencer replied with a strikingly simple: "No."</p>

<p>"There's no reason for me to put a ring fence around any game and say this game will not go to a place where it would find players, where it would have business success for us," Spencer explained.</p>
<p>"Our strategy is to allow our games to be available.</p>
<p>"Game Pass is an important component of playing the games on our platform, but to keep games off other platforms?" Spencer added."We don't think is the path… that's not a path for us. It doesn't work for us."</p> <div>

<p>"What we're doing now we think really enables us to build the best platform for the world's best games. 'Cos the world's biggest games are available in multiple places, and more and more creators are asking us, how do we stay connected when our game might be playable in all these different places, and we want Xbox to be absolutely the platform that enables that.</p>
<p>"We think that makes us unique. Most of the other platforms out there are single platform on single device, whether that's PC, whether that's mobile, whether it's a console.</p>
<p>And we want Xbox to be a platform that enables creators across any screen that people want to play on."</p>
<p>When pressed on whether Xbox's change in strategy means it may lose its identity, Spencer was firm about that, too.</p>
<p>"I hear them. I'm pretty active in our playerbase, and I'm active in the community. I listen. I think our identity will continue to evolve, which, frankly, it always has. But when I hear concerns, I hear concerns about is: my library of games safe. Am I still going to be able to play the games. And I think over the years, I'm proud of the commitment we've shown to respecting purchases on our platform through back compat, through cross entitlement, Xbox Play Anywhere, through crossplay. Things that we've done to enable people to continue to play, so I hear that.</p><p>"I see the investments we're making in platform and how we want Xbox to show up in multiple places, and your library to be available there. When I think about buy-to-stream - so when if I buy a game, I'll be able to stream it to devices - this is all about making sure that your library of games that you own on Xbox are playable in multiple places, so I'd say it's in evolution of our identity. But I believe it's an identity that this industry needs.</p>
<p>"When you think about where this industry is now and you see the challenges, the business challenges that are out there for many companies, I think us making games more accessible to more people has just gotta be front and centre for us as an industry so we continue to see great games that we've seen over the years."</p>
<p>The comments echo Spencer's position at the end of last year, when he said there were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phil-spencer-says-no-red-lines-over-any-xbox-game-coming-to-nintendo-or-playstation">"no red lines" over any Xbox game coming to Nintendo Switch or PS5</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24351383/handheld-pcs-challenge-switch-2-editorial<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>I stopped buying most games for my Nintendo Switch the day I bought a Steam Deck. My Switch has been a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23920647/super-mario-bros-wonder-review-nintendo-switch">Mario</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch">Zelda</a> machine ever since. It’s simple: the Steam Deck took the Switch’s best trick — pick-up-and-play portability — while offering more games that run better. I can easily resume the ones I started on my desktop PC, or continue to play portable titles on my desktop and marvel at improved graphics.&nbsp;</p><p>But the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24051677/nintendo-switch-2-pro-rumors-news">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, coming later this year, may change that value proposition. Not only will it continue to be <em>the</em> console that attracts families and kids with inventive, surprising, must-try exclusive Nintendo games that use <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24343722/switch-2-joy-cons-details-magnets-drift-nintendo">its detachable Joy-Cons’ many tricks</a>, but it also has a real chance at convincing the enthusiasts who might otherwise buy a handheld gaming PC — or who were waiting for handheld PCs to become less of a wild west.</p><div><figcaption><em>The Switch 2’s newly magnetic Joy-Con.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Gif: Nintendo</cite></p></div><p>The Switch 2 may meet or beat the Steam Deck in performance. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">If history’s any indication</a>, it should <em>easily</em> sell better than every handheld gaming PC combined. When the original Nintendo Switch launched nearly eight years ago, there was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/1/14772530/nintendo-switch-review-zelda-breath-of-the-wild">almost nothing to play but <em>Zelda</em></a>, and Nintendo held its game catalog in an iron grip — but now, the backwards-compatible Switch 2 will launch with one of the <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/platform/?sort=games&amp;order=desc">largest and most welcoming libraries of all time</a>, rivaled only by smartphones and computers. The Switch could theoretically become the new baseline for game developers to target, and the most reliable place to find new handheld-friendly titles.</p><p>So: How can <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22579493/valve-steam-deck-gaming-handheld-pc">the budding handheld PC revolution</a> escape the shadow of the Switch 2? I won’t say I know for sure, but I <em>did</em> just check the industry’s temperature at CES 2025, the world’s biggest tech show — and I’m afraid PC handhelds may stay in that shadow unless the industry does more.&nbsp;</p><p>Handheld ergonomics was one bright spot going into 2025. While I still prefer the Deck’s overall feel, practically every PC handheld I touched had nicely sculpted grips that made them more comfortable to hold than their predecessors. From the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338654/i-finally-touched-the-msi-claw-8-ai-plus">8-inch MSI Claw 8 AI Plus</a> and Lenovo <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows">Legion Go S</a>, to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/13/24342995/i-played-with-the-new-legion-go-2-too">the 8.8-inch Legion Go 2</a>, and the giant <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337860/intel-brought-a-big-honking-stereo-3d-handheld-gaming-pc-to-ces-2025">11-inch Tencent Sunday Dragon</a>, even the largest Windows handhelds didn’t feel as awkward as some of their first-gen predecessors.</p><p>There are four places I think the industry has to change — and maybe, band together — if these handhelds want a meaningful piece of the Switch.&nbsp;</p><div><figcaption><em>A year made a huge ergonomic difference to Lenovo’s handhelds in particular. (The new one’s on the left.)</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto</cite></p></div><p><h3>Operating system</h3></p><p>Buyers need to know that their game will be ready to <em>play </em>when they press the power button on a handheld. That’s the Nintendo Switch experience, and it’s similar to how the Steam Deck works once games are downloaded — but it’s far from what Windows handhelds currently offer.</p><p>That’s why the three biggest pieces of handheld gaming news at the show had little to do with the hardware itself. They were about ditching today’s version of handheld Windows.&nbsp;</p><p>First, Lenovo revealed it would produce <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows">the first authorized third-party handheld</a> to ship with Valve’s easy-to-use SteamOS instead of Windows — something only the Steam Deck has done so far. Second, Valve told us it would bring <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338405/valve-steamos-beta-other-handhelds-beyond-steam-deck">a SteamOS beta to additional third-party handhelds</a> as soon as this April. Third, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338778/microsoft-xbox-handheld-pc-gaming">a Microsoft executive told <em>The Verge</em></a> that the company would finally do something meaningful about its bloated Windows experience on handhelds later this year, combining “the best of Xbox and Windows together.”&nbsp;</p><p>These moves are heartening, as it’s a Wild West in handheld PC land. Most companies opt for a copy of Windows that doesn’t reliably launch games or sleep and wake properly, defeating some of the purpose of a pick-up-and-play handheld experience. They’re filled with difficult-to-navigate UI and unnecessary bloatware, too — to the point that today, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/30/24329005/bazzite-asus-rog-ally-x-steam-os-editorial">a community-created fork of Valve’s SteamOS UI is already a far better experience</a> than Windows.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s also good for SteamOS fans: while the Steam Deck is a great platform for SteamOS, we’ve already seen the Deck can’t compete with the Switch by itself. Game publishers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/12/23999300/fortnite-on-steam-deck-sweeney-says-valve-needs-tens-of-millions-of-users-to-justify-it">don’t see the raw sales numbers</a> to bring big multiplayer games like <em>Fortnite</em> or <em>Valorant</em> to SteamOS. (They say <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/31/24284644/apex-legends-loses-linux-steam-deck-support-anti-cheat">cheaters are too big a risk</a>.)</p><p>But, while the CES moves are significant, Valve, Microsoft, and Lenovo are non-committal about how much things might improve. Microsoft would only give me the barest hints about making Windows feel more like an Xbox game console at some point later this year. Lenovo is hedging its SteamOS bet <em>hard —</em> not only will the Legion Go S ship in both Windows and SteamOS varieties, the Windows version will go on sale months earlier, and Lenovo won’t commit to SteamOS for its larger, later-in-2025 handheld.&nbsp;</p><p>No other company announced a SteamOS handheld at CES, either, save for PC maker GPD, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337913/no-valve-isnt-working-with-gpd-to-bring-steamos-to-its-handheld">with a claim that was apparently false</a> or lost in translation. Valve told me it has no other partner devices currently in the works for SteamOS, though it’d be happy to work with more companies. I believe every handheld maker should give SteamOS a shot.</p><div><figcaption><em>CES 2025 brought huge handhelds like this 11-inch Acer, and they’re </em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/17/24344308/asus-rog-flow-acer-nitro-blaze-steam-deck-giant-pc-handheld-experiment"><em>not necessarily a bad idea</em></a><em>!</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div><p><h3>Screen</h3></p><p>This one’s easy: to maximize performance, battery life, economies of scale, and offer a closer-to-game-console experience, handheld PC makers should <em>universally adopt</em> a 1080p-or-lower-resolution HDR OLED screen with variable refresh rate.&nbsp;</p><p>Many PC manufacturers are wasting what little performance they can muster from a handheld chip and battery on a screen with far too many pixels for the task, artificially constraining performance and battery life in exchange for 1600p or 1200p sharpness that most gamers won’t miss on a 7-inch to 8-inch panel. Additionally, every handheld <em>without</em> a variable refresh rate screen is likely wasting a good chunk of the frames that their handheld can serve because their screen is artificially limiting their framerate — VRR was the Asus ROG Ally’s secret weapon, letting it play games more smoothly than competing handhelds even if rivals’ chips offered the same FPS.</p><p>Lastly, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23951655/steam-deck-oled-review#:~:text=in%20HDR%2C%20your%20games%20finally%20have%20real%20light">HDR is a revelation on the Steam Deck OLED’s screen</a>, letting both native titles and the HDR games I stream from my PS5 feel like they’re filled with real light that explodes out of the screen. It’s something Windows desktops and laptops have never consistently offered the way today’s consoles do, but handhelds could be the gateway to changing that.</p><p>Is a screen like the one I’m describing expensive or hard to find? Band together, PC companies, and surely a display maker can change that for you.</p><p><h3>Chips and battery</h3></p><p>Unless you count the Nvidia Tegra at the heart of the Nintendo Switch, AMD is the leader in handheld chips. But its semi-custom <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/1/24021717/speaking-of-handheld-pc-gaming-chips-heres-an-incredible-look-at-the-steam-decks-apu">Aerith and Sephiroth parts</a> for the Steam Deck feel like the <em>only </em>ones proactively designed with power-sipping handhelds in mind, leaving everyone else at a portability disadvantage. And it sounds like AMD’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337300/amd-ryzen-z2-z2-extreme-z2-go">new Z2 line</a> might not be all that different.</p><p>AMD’s Z1 batch of chips in handhelds like the Asus ROG Ally wasn’t originally for handheld; they’re mildly tweaked laptop processors that need 17 or 18 watts to begin to hit their stride, enough for a complete handheld to drain a typical 50Wh battery pack in well under three hours with mildly intensive games.</p><p>The Z2 line is similarly a set of tweaked laptop chips, and while AMD told me some may offer more performance at the same power and add improved efficiency tweaks, the total consumed power may not decrease. Lenovo product manager Alex Zhu told me it’s looking at running its Legion Go S’s Z2 Go chip at around 20 watts, which might give it worse battery life than the 15-watt-and-below Steam Deck even if its GPU is more capable. AMD also confirmed the Z2 Go is less powerful than the prior-gen Z1 Extreme.</p><p>AMD senior fellow Mahesh Subramony told me the company’s flagship Z2 Extreme chip, on TSMC’s shrunk-down N4P process node with a mix of newer Zen 5, Zen 5c and RDNA 3.5 cores, should be both more efficient and much more capable than the Z2 Go, and quite a bit better than the Z1 Extreme as well, but it’s not a leap forward. That may require AMD’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24336246/amd-radeon-rx-9070-series-rdna-4-fsr-4-ces-2025">even newer RDNA 4 graphics</a>, and it may require bespoke processors.</p><div><figcaption><em>The MSI Claw 8 AI Plus uses an Intel Lunar Lake chip.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>Don’t hold your breath if you’re hoping Intel might provide meaningful competition in the handheld chip realm. While early reviews of the Intel Lunar Lake chip in the revised MSI Claw 8 AI Plus are quite promising, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/1/24285513/intel-ceo-lunar-lake-one-off-memory-package-discrete-gpu">its pricey Lunar Lake chip may be a bit of a one-off</a>, with future Intel parts steering away from the power-saving on-die memory that Intel experimentally added. I’m curious if that’s why <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/msi-claw-8-ai-faces-launch-with-limited-availability-first-units-already-in-gamers-hands">MSI hasn’t fully launched the Claw</a> as expected.</p><p>Meanwhile, Intel certainly has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/3/24311594/intel-under-pat-gelsinger">bigger fish to fry right now</a> than making custom handheld chips. “It’s not a market that we’re actively pursuing, but it’s a market we’re happy to enable,” Intel VP of technical marketing Robert Hallock tells me of handheld gaming. “It is somewhat extracurricular,” he added, explaining that it’s a fun and exciting but small market and that Intel has to pick its battles. “We’re coming off admittedly, about five, six years of strife and we have to decide where we want to invest.”.</p><p>Some manufacturers have been able to improve the battery life disadvantage of today’s off-the-shelf AMD chips by including a much larger battery pack — the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24204770/asus-rog-ally-x-review-handheld-gaming-pc">Asus ROG Ally X</a> doubled the size of its predecessor’s pack to 80 watt-hours, and it’s no longer the only 80Wh handheld you can buy. But that comes with size and weight tradeoffs that can <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/2/24169709/asus-rog-ally-x-price-release-date-inside-gaming-handheld">only be partially engineered away</a>.</p><p>We need handheld makers to join together and make a case for better chips.</p><div><figcaption><em>The Steam Deck still starts at $399, even if the $529 OLED model is superior.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by The Verge</cite></p></div><p><h3>Price</h3></p><p>The PC industry also needs to cut prices if it wants a chance to eat Nintendo’s lunch.&nbsp;</p><p>The Nintendo Switch debuted at $299 in 2017 — around $380 in today’s money — and the OLED version arrived at $349 in 2021. A year later, Valve’s Steam Deck debuted at $399. But today, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/30/24329005/bazzite-asus-rog-ally-x-steam-os-editorial">the only Windows handheld gaming PC I can recommend</a> costs $799, roughly twice the price of an entry-level Deck, and most Windows handhelds have started at $600 and up. High-end options are great, but the space may remain niche without low-end options, too.&nbsp;</p><p>Only the least expensive model of Lenovo’s SteamOS variant of the Legion Go S <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows">will lower that bar to $499</a> this May. And all of those prices are still more than Sony or Microsoft charges for a TV console with far more performance, and likely more than Nintendo will charge for the Switch 2.</p><p>I’m not sure what <em>exactly</em> PC makers would need to do to challenge the Switch on price, but it’s likely not simple. Valve CEO Gabe Newell <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-deck-price-valve-gabe-newell-400-dollars-painful-but-critical">said it was “painful” but “critical”</a> to launch the Steam Deck at $399, hinting that the company may have followed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Razor_and_blades_model">razor-and-blades business model</a> where console makers initially sell hardware at a loss, then make the money back as people buy games. If so, that’s a tough act to follow, as no other PC maker controls the world’s largest PC games store and can afford to subsidize a handheld that way.</p><p>But not every console has been a loss leader: Nintendo reportedly never sold the Switch at a loss, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22609150/sony-playstation-5-ps5-loss-profit">Sony stopped selling the PS5 at a loss</a> less than a year after its debut. So it’s possible to cut prices with the right bill of materials and economies of scale. Lenovo explicitly told me it worked with AMD on the Z2 Go chip to help lower the Legion Go S’s price, for example.</p><p>To compete with Nintendo, a company like Microsoft or Valve or even Sony needs to lead the charge, securing the components and offering the right operating system for dozens of true Switch competitors Imagine dozens of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24339889/microsoft-xbox-handheld-windows-operating-system-changes-notepad">portable Xboxes</a> or PlayStations or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/6/24315098/valve-steam-machines-steamos-steam-deck-vr">Steam Machines</a>, instead of each PC maker marching to the beat of their own drum.</p><p>I think it’s time for an industry-wide push on handheld gaming. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23948529/nintendo-switch-steam-deck-handheld-consoles-gaming">It might be the future of gaming, period</a>. There’s too much at stake to tackle it one half-baked Windows handheld at a time. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Here's what each one is going for by singles value at the time of writing, which should give you a few reasons to grab an ETB or five and get some Shrouded Fable opened.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Duskull 068/064:</strong> Currently going for around £20, which has shot up £7 since November 2024</li><li><strong>Dusclops 069/064:</strong> Recently sold listings are £15 and £16, give or take, raising by a couple of bones from roughly £12 in November 2024.</li><li><strong>Dusknoir 070/064: </strong>This bad boy has been sitting on the £20 fence since release.</li><li><strong>Cresselia 071/064:</strong> £10-£14 is the current going rate, slightly up from its £9 kick-off beginning of November 24.</li><li><strong>Munkidori 072/064:</strong> This cheeky Monkey is valued at around £13, up from £10 on November 24.</li><li><strong>Fezandipiti 073/064: </strong>We'll be generous and say The Fez is currently selling for around £8, which is where it's been perched since Shrouded Fable dropped.</li><li><strong>Okidogi 074/064: </strong>Another cheap yet stunning IR at around £7 right now, which has mostly stayed at the same value since launch.</li><li><strong>Persian 078/064:</strong> This literal bad boy is fetching up to £60 right now, making this an insane chase card. It's doubled in value since launch, making this an excellent card to keep ahold of.</li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2">SIRs I'd Love To Pull From Shrouded Fable</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/26/am-2x1-14-1737889789894.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company International</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">SIRs are usually more valuable than IRs due to their rarity and playability, but it also comes down to their artwork and is anyone actually likes the Pokémon. Here's my favourites, good luck pulling these (pocket) monsters:</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Okidogi ex 090/064:</strong> At around £20, the price for Okidogi ex has dropped by around £5 since launch. This means we can expect £20 to be around the going rate until Shrouded Fable goes out of print.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Munkidori ex 091/064</strong>: At roughly £18, this Monkey hasn't climbed at all really since launch. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Fezandipiti ex 092/064: </strong>The Fez ex's value dropped from £35 at launch to around £26, but it's still a stunning card.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Pecharunt ex 093/064: </strong>We're looking at £15 to £20 on this one right now,  with highs going up to as much as £25 at launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Cassiopeia 094/064:</strong> At the time of writing, Cass sells between £30 and £40, which is an excellent price for THE chase card of this set. Similar to Persian IR, this card used to double its value back in November 2024.</p><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-violetshroud"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet—Shroud">Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet—Shrouded Fable Elite Trainer Box</h2></p><div catalogid="a21f8400-73a9-45ce-9858-820e19d2ee30" id="214392"><div id="214392" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet—Shrouded Fable Elite Trainer Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Elite Trainer Box is your starter kit for Shrouded Fable.

			<p>Ubisoft's President reportedly agreed to greenlight a new <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-mirage-enhanced-for-ps5-pro-runs-at-4k60-with-pssr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a> DLC, which would be funded by Savvy Games Group from Saudi Arabia.</p>
<h2>The Streets of Baghdad May Expand to New Content as Ubisoft Reportedly Agrees on DLC Development for Assassin's Creed Mirage</h2>
<p>Ubisoft's new installment in the Assassin's Creed franchise might not be the only thing fans will be receiving this year, as the company is rumored to expand the previous one. After more than a year since its launch, we are hearing that the <em>Assassin's Creed Mirage</em> is getting its first-ever DLC.</p>
<p>This might be a bit surprising since <em>Assassin's Creed Shadow</em>s is very close to its launch, and getting DLC for the Mirage edition is a report that nobody saw coming. The Shadows will be launching on 20th March 2025, which is roughly two months from now, and the supposed DLC for the Mirage Edition is also coming this year.</p>
<p>The report comes from the French publication Les Echos via prominent AC leaker '<a href="https://x.com/xj0nathan/status/1882849239434232101" target="_blank" rel="noopener">j0nathan</a>'. The report suggests that after the visit to Saudi Arabia, Ubisoft's president, Yves Guillemot,&nbsp;<span>agreed to the DLC development for&nbsp;<em>AC: Mirage</em>, which Ubisoft wasn't initially </span>interested in. Ubisoft has partnered with Savvy Games, which will be a major contributor to this project.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Assassins-Creed-Mirage-Ray-Tracing-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The game was initially designed to be a DLC itself and was supposed to continue the Valhalla storyline, but eventually made it to the game market as an individual installment. The game launched in October 2023 but hasn't got a single DLC since that time. Therefore, it's quite a surprise since the launch of Shadows is pretty close.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that it is still a rumor, and we still need official confirmation from Ubisoft about this matter. However, considering Odyssey got its crossover three years after its release, which was after the launch of Valhalla, the Mirage DLC doesn't look unfeasible. Still, there are not enough reports to confirm the news, and we have yet to hear about its exact launch date. Until then, stay tuned.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98go-play-fortnite%E2%80%99-optic-methodz-gives-advice-to-young-players-grinding-cod.1092132/</guid>

<p>The Call of Duty esports scene isn’t in the best place, that much is for certain. In the last year or two, Activision has tried to shape up the ecosystem a little and has made some positive changes, but prize pools are getting lower, viewership has taken some hits, and Black Ops 6 is currently in the gutter – just a little bit.</p>



<p>During a recent stream, some of the most prolific OpTic personalities, including Scump, Methodz, and Crimsix, sat around the fireplace to talk about the state of COD esports.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-you-can-actually-make-money">‘You Can Actually Make Money’</h2>



<p>Scump dropped a bombshell (admittedly a somewhat obvious one) by stressing that if <strong>he </strong>were trying to become an esports pro all over again right now, he wouldn’t pick Call of Duty as his game:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>If I was an 18 year right now, or 16, or whatever age you’re starting in gaming and I was trying to pursue being a professional in a video game, Call of Duty would not even be on my radar.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Methodz echoed Scump’s sentiment, stressing that the Call of Duty scene’s minimum age requirement is too much of a blocker that’s potentially preventing young superstars from finding a spot in the CDL.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’ve been saying to go play Fortnite.</p>



<p>I’m saying, listen bro – unfortunately… This is crazy to me, the age limit…</p>



<p>The fact it’s still an 18 age limit – I was a pro at 14. Like, there’s a lot of 14 to 18 year olds that would probably turn some heads that just can’t play. But I’m like, dude, if you’re 15, why the f*** would you be grinding COD?</p>



<p>Go play Fortnite, you can actually make money in that.</p>
</blockquote>











<p>In the current system, pro players can’t enter the Call of Duty League until they’re 18 years old. It’s not mirrored in every other esports title, of course. For instance, Counter-Strike’s ‘donk’ just turned 18 this weekend and spent the last year becoming known as one of the best players in the business, racking up some mind-boggling achievements in his debut year.</p>



<p>The OpTic guys say that there are so many competing titles in the esports space that Call of Duty shouldn’t even be on your list of potential targets. Do you agree? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>On social media, John ‘Bucky’ Buckley, a senior team member at Pocketpair, revealed how he has been inundated with messages and propositions since the firm announced a publishing endeavour. Bucky, who was recently promoted to the role of Communications Director and Publishing Manager, was transparent in a recent post on Twitter (X).</p>



<p>He wrote, ‘I think I might have underestimated how much interest there would be.’</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-do-whatever-you-want">‘Do Whatever You Want’</h2>



<p>Earlier this week, Palworld’s developer, Pocketpair, revealed ‘Pocketpair Publishing’. At the same time, Surgent Studios, the creator of Tales of Kenzera, announced that it would be the first major partner of the publishing arm, working with the team to create a new horror game.</p>



<p>On <a href="https://x.com/Bucky_cm/status/1882582384052457558" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, John ‘Bucky’ Buckley revealed that within 15 hours of publishing the Pocketpair news, he’d received more than 1,600 connection requests, emails, and propositions from small developers wanting to work with the label.</p>



<p>On Twitter, Bucky shot up, pulling in several hundred followers just as the news broke.</p>



<p>In the comments under his post, Bucky was grilled on the nature of Pocketpair’s publishing initiatives, curious to know how involved the company would be with the developer:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We give you money. You make game. </p>



<p>If you want help with marketing or something we’ll help out, but otherwise do whatever you want. </p>



<p>We’re giving devs the financial freedom to make games they want so they DON’T have to get wrapped up with stinky rule makers and bullies.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was revealed recently that Pocketpair Publishing is ‘100% self-funded’. In a statement, the company wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>As a completely independent publisher, we are uniquely positioned to help developers create the games they want, free from the complications of dealing with third parties who may not have their best interests at heart. </p>



<p>Pocketpair and Pocketpair Publishing are beholden to no one. </p>



<p>We remain dedicated to making fun games, and we’re so excited to now be able to help others bring their own fun games to life.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If you want to work with Pocketpair Publishing, it’s as simple as <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/publishing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">heading to the website</a> and selecting ‘Pitch Your Game’.</p>



<p>Is this a huge win from Pocketpair, or do you see them falling prey to the very thing they’re trying to avoid? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Avowed will be released worldwide on February 18, slotting into an already busy month for the RPG genre. For a while now, prospective fans have been eagerly scooping up any tidbits of information about the game, and most recently, the discussion turned to how the game is laid out.</p>



<p>In a recent interview with Xbox Wire, Obsidian’s developers sat down to talk about the lack of an open-world environment in Avowed. It’s very much by design and is a deliberate, strategic decision to encourage players to have e better experience overall.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-you-can-do-whatever-you-want">‘You Can Do Whatever You Want’</h2>



<p>In a recent interview <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/01/24/avowed-choose-your-own-adventure-incredible-freedom/" rel="nofollow">with Xbox Wire</a>, Obsidian’s Berto Ritger, Carrie Patel, and Kate Dollarhyde walked readers through the nature of the ‘zones’ in Avowed.</p>



<p>This ambitious RPG isn’t an open-world game, but instead, it relies on a series of ‘denser’ regions locked behind borders that keep the pacing consistent and manageable.</p>



<p>During the interview, Dollarhyde – who works as a narrative designer – explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Pacing is really tough in open-world games.</p>



<p>You never know where the player is and what they’re doing at any given time. So having these zones that happen in sequence means we always know what content you’ve just come from on the critical path. Maybe not what side quests you’ve done, but we always know you’ve just had this core experience.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That sentiment was echoed by Ritger, region director at Obsidian:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think it’s a good pacing mechanism.</p>



<p>We know roughly what you’ve done before you’ve gone to the next thing. It’s still a very open structure within those zones, where you can do whatever you want for the most part, but it’s not one contiguous area where you could be anywhere at any moment.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Having smaller, more detailed regions or zones has enabled Obsidian to scope in and focus on delivering a more immersive, choice-driven experience for players. Even with the zones being scaled down from the open-world models we might be more used to in these grand RPG titles, we can still expect there to be plenty of meat on Avowed’s bones.</p>



<p>Do you plan on picking up Avowed when it’s released on February 18? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

There's plenty of products to choose from, with Elite Trainer boxes being the best value for money right now, but why open this set in particular? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here are some of my favourite pulls from Pokémon: Scarlet and Violet - Paradox Rift. This isn't about the newly coined "pokéinvesting" term; it's about showing everyone how to enjoy Pokémon cards to ensure everyone has their fair share of going in-store, ripping packs with friends and family and having fun with the hobby. Let's get into it:</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Yveltal - 205/182</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/25/pcmag-shopping-cards-20-1737824691226.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company International</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's hard to see why Paradox Rift was such an oferlooked yet, but it seems other trainers are catching on to its illustration and Secret Art Rares in 2025, This stunning Yveltal card has jumped from around £10 around October 2024 straight to around £25 looking at recent sold listings, so this would be a great card to look after on a trainers binder.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Groudon - 199/182</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/25/pcmag-shopping-cards-21-1737824772234.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company International</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Another epic card showing Groudon doing what he does best, teraforming Earth whilst wiping out life, Nice lad. He's currently going for around £80 right now, which is a steep climb from £39 back at the end of November. Those UK deals are looking better and better now, right?</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Gholdengo ex - 252/182</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/25/pcmag-shopping-cards-22-1737824846236.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company International</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Cheesestrings dude is well at home in Paldea now, so he shall now be known as Gholdengo. This card is currently going four around £25, which has gained an extra £10 from around October last year. I think this will be a slow burner alongside Ghimeghoul Secret art that has matches artwork. It's a set of art cards that trainers will want to focus on pulling regardless!</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Garchomp ex - 245/182</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/25/pcmag-shopping-cards-23-1737824899335.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company International</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Garchamp is a beast, just look at that incredible artwork. The best part is that whilst the value of Garchomp ex - 245/182 is rising, it's still at a reasonable £30. It's value are more than double since October 2024, which means it's going to be a solid pull that will slowly climb up in value as Paradox Rift goes out fo print and off store shelves in 2025.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Roaring Moon ex - 229/182</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/25/pcmag-shopping-cards-24-1737824973077.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company International</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Roaring Moon ex has suprised me value wise, kicking off at around £5 mid-2024 and just about double to around £10. Personaly I think this has potenial to hits the £40 mark in 2025 thanks to the Pokémon popularity due to it being able to knock any Pokémon out in one hit and a powerful stadium card-based 220 attack. Playable or not, the artwork just rocks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's some links to the Pokémon TCG: Paradox Rift products on sale online right now.

The RTX 5070 Ti and RTX 5070 will follow that with their own releases in February, but some are already getting a sneak peek at the GPUs’ software benefits through DLSS 4.</p><p>Tom Warren’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349619/nvidia-rtx-5090-review-test-benchmark"><em>Verge</em> review</a> of the $1,999 RTX 5090 indicates it’s expectedly a powerhouse, but not quite the generational leap that the RTX 4090 was over its own predecessor. That didn’t stop <em>The Verge</em>’s Sean Hollister from being impressed with the two-slot RTX 5090 Founders Edition GPU when he stuffed it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349976/nvidia-rtx-5090-fe-small-form-factor-sff-hands-on">into his aging small-form-factor PC</a>. </p><p>Along with the 50-series GPUs comes <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337402/nvidia-dlss-4-upscaling-announcement-ces-2025">DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation</a>, a software trick that may be just as big a story as the hardware itself. This latest version of DLSS uses AI to predictively generate frames, making it possible to run games at higher resolutions without taking the same framerate hit they would without DLSS 4 turned on. Gamers who are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24350558/nvidia-dlss-4-frame-generation-cyberpunk-2077-transformer-graphics-update-patch">already trying DLSS 4 out</a> in <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>using RTX 40-series GPUs report seeing huge improvements already.</p><p>We’ll be keeping up with all the news about Nvidia’s RTX 50-series GPUs right here at <em>The Verge</em>.</p></div><section id="updates-section"><ul><li role="article" id="stream-entry-caa3630a-bcdb-467c-b368-1a677ad29fb9"></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-91bd7a43-471e-47c8-89f2-39e7d6f43bba"></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-5cd0eaef-1c6f-4ba4-b197-57c89fe8f67d"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349619/nvidia-rtx-5090-review-test-benchmark">Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 review: a new king of 4K is here</a></h2><div><figure><span><span></span></span><p><cite>Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge</cite></p></figure></div><p>Nvidia’s RTX 4090 was a beast of a graphics card. It was a huge GPU that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23398201/nvidia-rtx-4090-review-test-benchmark">delivered true 4K gaming</a> for those who really wanted it and a huge jump in performance over the previous-generation RTX 3090. Naturally, the company’s latest top-of-the-line GPU, the GeForce RTX 5090, now has a lot of expectations riding on it when it arrives on January 30th.</p><p>But at $1,999, the RTX 5090 is steep — $400 more than the RTX 4090 Founders Edition at its launch. (It could run you even more in the form of a new power supply or higher electricity bills, especially if you want to run games like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> in 4K.) </p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349619/nvidia-rtx-5090-review-test-benchmark">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-e35ff62d-24fc-46ff-b09f-4328dfb9ee93"></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-b2e686c1-44f6-4156-a308-5b38f054bd07"><div><p>The RTX 5090 might be in short supply.</p><p>Nvidia’s upcoming RTX 5090 launch on January 30th might be met with limited stock, according to some system builders and retailers.

It’s a claim that’s been echoed on YouTube, TikTok, and social media networks and has generated a debate over the RTX 50 series and DLSS 4’s Multi Frame Generation. </p><p>So, can a $549 RTX 5070 really deliver the same level of performance as a $1,599 RTX 4090?

            <p>Avowed will not only let you customise your character's appearance but also the background "that will shape how the world perceives and responds to you", too.</p>
<p>In a series of posts on X/Twitter, Obsidian let fans in for an early peek at the fantasy RPG's Character Creation menu, where players can choose between an Arcade Scholar, Court Augur, Vanguard Scout, War Hero, and Noble Scion, all of which determine what dialogue options and starting weapons you'll have available to you when you kick off your adventure.</p>

<p>"You hail from the Aedyran Empir, but who exactly are you, Envoy?" Obsidian teased on social media (thanks, <a href="https://x.com/AvowedtheGame/status/1882518769563512842">TheGamer</a>). "Stranger still, you have never learned which god touched your soul.</p>
<p>"In the Character Creation menu, you'll have the opportunity to customize your Godlike character and choose a background that will shape how the world perceives and responds to you."</p> <div>

</p></div>
<p>For Noble Scion, we got to see exactly what's special about this background, too.</p>
<p>"You were born to a noble house of great influence, middling wealth, and questionable morals," the description said. "When scandals and succession disputes saw your family cast down, you threw yourself on the emperor's mercy, and he shielded you.</p>
<p>"Canny yet refined, you have become a formidable force at court and an invaluable ally to the emperor."</p>
<p>Don't worry about the character creation locking out any equipment and abilities you find in-game, though - Obsidian reassures us that "all equipment and abilities are available to you regardless of your background.</p>
<p>Avowed will released next month, 18th February, on PC (Steam and Battle.net) and Xbox Series X/S, with day-one access for Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass subscribers. Those who pay £90 (or $90) for the game's Premium Edition, however, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avowed-selling-five-days-early-access-if-you-pay-90">can play five days early</a>.</p><p>"'Your worlds, your way' isn't just a motto for Obsidian - it's how they design quests, regions, combat, and more," Xbox teased after this week's Developer Direct. "Learn how player freedom is at the heart of Avowed, making it a quintessential 'Obsidian RPG'."</p> <div>

            <p>Four studios are battling it out to once again reboot Capcom's Resident Evil movie franchise, only this time, PlayStation Productions is also on board.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/resident-evil-reboot-zach-cregger-1236117563/">Hollywood Reporter</a>, Warners Bros. and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> are amongst a number of hopefuls looking to reboot Constantin Film's horror series alongside PlayStation's production company.</p>

<p>Whilst little else is known about the project at this time, it's thought Shay Hatten (John Wick: Chapter 4, Army of the Dead) is on board to co-write the seventh major instalment of the horror movie series. The prior six movies all starred Milla Jovovich apart from the last attempted reboot which released in 2021.</p><p>There was also an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-new-resident-evil-show-has-already-been-cancelled">ill-fated Netflix show that was unceremoniously cancelled</a> within a month of its debut episode following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-new-resident-evil-series-is-going-down-badly-with-fans">disappointing reviews</a>, with one commenter stating: "Terrible; followed by more terrible; just when you lose all hope; it smacks you with even more terrible".</p>

Whether they’re <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/15/16151292/undertale-playstation-4-vita-release">pushing the boundaries of the medium</a> and or offering <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24082252/balatro-review-poker-roguelike-videogame">a creative spin on classic ideas</a>, indie games can be just as interesting as big-budget epics.</p><p>Sometimes, though, indie games can fly under the radar. But we here at <em>The Verge</em> love seeking out hidden gems, so we want to use this space to share some of our favorite smaller games that we’re checking out so that you might find something new, or potentially your next obsession.</p><p>We’ll be highlighting interesting games you may not have heard of and sharing a little bit about why you should play them. This list will be updated pretty frequently, too — so check back often to see some new recommendations. </p></div><section id="updates-section"><ul><li role="article" id="stream-entry-536262cb-a0dd-424e-b4ed-acbc0477d41f"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/25/24351112/lok-digital-review-word-game-iphone-android-steam">Lok Digital is a surreal puzzle game full of made-up words</a></h2><p>At a glance, <a href="https://lok-digital.com/"><em>Lok Digital</em></a> seems like another cute and clever word game, a perfect distraction to keep on your phone for idle moments. But look closer, and it’s clear something just isn’t right. Yes, it’s a game about creating words to fill out a puzzle board. Except those words aren’t actually real — and they all have special powers. Think of it like an alien take on Scrabble. It takes a while to wrap your head around, but <em>Lok</em>’s surreal setup makes for an excellent brain-scratching puzzler.</p><p>There is actually a story of sorts here. <em>Lok</em> takes place in a black-and-white fantasy realm, and your goal is to help little worm-like creatures progress through each level. The stages are grids of squares, and your goal is to turn each one black. (I have no idea how this helps the creatures move, but just stay with me here.) You turn them black by placing letters to spell out words. Completed words will black out squares, and certain words also have the ability to black out even more.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/25/24351112/lok-digital-review-word-game-iphone-android-steam">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-e887dbd2-3c1e-4d9f-b3e5-a1e680b6e5d9"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/18/24344598/antonblast-review">Antonblast is an out-of-control platformer with its heart in the ’90s</a></h2><p><em>Antonblast</em> is kind of like playing a zany Saturday morning cartoon. It’s brash, maximalist, and often, you’ll feel like you don’t actually understand what’s happening. Somehow, that chaos gels into something that actually makes sense — and, at times, is even calming.</p><p><em>Antonblast</em> just launched in 2024, but it looks like a long-lost side-scrolling platformer from the 16-bit era of the SNES or Sega Genesis. That’s not just due to the fantastic pixel art. There are fun touches like delightfully ’90s-era character designs and Mode 7-like effects, such as your character splatting against the screen when you die, that really make it feel like a missing classic of the era.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/18/24344598/antonblast-review">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-0e685471-7967-498d-a4ed-3c7d132ba74e"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24339211/skate-city-new-york-review-apple-arcade">The best mobile skateboarding game now has a New York sequel</a></h2><p>For me, skateboarding has always been about getting into a flow state. Much like playing <em>Tetris</em>, I’m at my best when I’m skating almost subconsciously, not thinking and acting in the moment. It’s not an easy zone to get into, and music has always been my shortcut. So the greatest compliment I can give to <em>Skate City: New York</em> is that I’ve spent the past week fine-tuning the perfect playlist, all so that I can also perfect my runs in the game.</p><p><em>New York </em>is a sequel to the original <em>Skate City</em>; both are available through Apple Arcade, though the first game was eventually ported to consoles as well. It comes from Snowman, the studio behind the <em>Alto </em>series, and the shift to New York is a lot like the move from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/19/8064545/altos-adventure-iphone-ipad-snowboarding-game"><em>Alto’s Adventure</em></a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/21/17035830/altos-odyssey-sequel-iphone-game-ios-adventure-snowboarding"><em>Alto’s Odyssey</em></a>.

That’s according to Developer Second Dinner, which <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1882957014898454727">announced yesterday</a> it was starting the process of restoring the game to Google’s Android app store at 6PM PT / 3PM ET that day. The developer <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1882905320001089938">said in another post</a> it expects the game to return to both Google’s and Apple’s app stores “as early as next week.” </p><p><em>Marvel Snap </em>was caught up in the TikTok outage last weekend because its original publisher, Nuverse, is owned by TikTok parent company ByteDance. The game came <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/20/24348353/marvel-snap-tiktok-ban-back-online">back online for players</a> on Monday and <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1881535498709266691">Second Dinner said</a> it planned to “bring more services in-house and partner with a new publisher.” As of now, <em>Marvel Snap </em>is still “provided, operated, and managed by Nuverse,” according to the <a href="https://sf19-draftcdn-sg.ibytedtos.com/obj/ies-hotsoon-draft-sg/Snap/snap_privacy_policy_en.html">privacy policy</a> on the game’s website.</p><p>An admin of the <a href="https://discord.com/servers/marvel-snap-978545345715908668"><em>Marvel Snap</em> Discord server</a> also announced a set of compensation packages for players affected by the outage. As seen in screenshots <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MarvelSnap/comments/1i99zmp/compensation_galore/">posted to Reddit</a>, that includes in-game credits, tokens, and special variants for accounts that were created in the US or that showed US activity in the 30 days prior to the outage. Non-US players will also get a “Global Gratitude Package” with similar, though fewer, benefits. </p><p>Other apps that went down last weekend, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/21/24348629/capcut-back-online-us-tiktok-bytedance">such as CapCut</a> and Lemon8, have since come back online but still aren’t listed in the iOS and Android app stores. Although President Donald Trump has directed the US Attorney General <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/20/24348213/trump-tiktok-ban-executive-order-sale-delay-china">not to enforce the US TikTok ban</a>, it’s unclear whether he can shield Apple or Google from legal liability if they host the apps in defiance of the law.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
