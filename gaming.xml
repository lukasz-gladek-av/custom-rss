            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wolfeye-ex-arkane-new-rpg<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Weird West&nbsp;</em>developer Wolfeye Studios, which was founded by a number of ex-Arkane developers, has announced that its next project will be a first-person action RPG with a sci-fi vibe.</p>
<p>In a press release, the studio, which is led by Arkane founder&nbsp;Raphaël Colantonio, says that it's "just wrapped pre-production" on its newest project. This means the game, which currently remains nameless, is now "full steam ahead in production".</p>
<p>Prior to release (whenever that happens to be), Wolfeye says it will run an "exclusive and limited private alpha" for the game in order to gauge players' reactions and shape the development process with community feedback. The studio has also shared a first look at some artwork for the upcoming action RPG.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ex-arkane-wolfeye-sci-fi-action-rpg.jpg?itok=n7R81aIY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ex-arkane-wolfeye-sci-fi-action-rpg.jpg?itok=qW7uaQPW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Wolfeye's new sci-fi game looks pretty imposing.</figcaption></figure><p>In the aforementioned press release, Colantonio says he's confident that fans of&nbsp;<em>Dishonored&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Prey&nbsp;</em>will "feel at home", as will "fans of RPGs in general".</p>
<p>The untitled game does not yet have a publishing partner, but Colantonio says the studio is searching for one, and that the limited private alpha for the game will happen sometime next year.</p>
<p>If you're interested in participating, you can sign up for it <a href="https://wolfeye-studios.com/signup" rel="noopener" target="_blank">via Wolfeye's official website</a>, where you'll also find some rather evocative-looking artwork bearing the logo of a fictional company called "Candis Technologies".</p>
<p>Whatever this project turns out to be, it'll be the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wild-looking-weird-west-is-wolfeye-studios-debut-title">second game developed by Wolfeye</a> after 2022's&nbsp;<em>Weird West</em>, which was an isometric action RPG that saw players taking control of five distinct characters rather than creating their own.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wolfeye-studios-weird-west_0.jpg?itok=hoAxdm9p 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wolfeye-studios-weird-west_0.jpg?itok=2rE8M1UO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Weird West&nbsp;</em>was Wolfeye's first game.</figcaption></figure><p>As a first effort,&nbsp;<em>Weird West&nbsp;</em>was impressively ambitious, but I have to admit I found it lacking in character and spread a bit too thin, so I'm seriously hoping Wolfeye can step it up for its second game.</p>
<p>At any rate, it's nice to see ex-Arkane devs being given another chance. Perhaps if this game is successful, Wolfeye could poach some of the folks left jobless after Microsoft's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown">closure of Arkane Austin</a>, although there might be a bit of a geography problem in that regard. Only time will tell.</p>

			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-early-pc-better-ambient-occlusion/">God of War Ragnarok</a> PC system requirements have been revealed today, and they are not particularly demanding compared to other games released this year.</p>
<p>As confirmed on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/08/08/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-system-requirements-revealed/">Official PlayStation Blog</a>, the game will require at least an Intel i5-4670k or AMD Ryzen 3 1200 CPU and an NVIDIA GTX 1060 or AMD RX 5500 XT GPU and 8 GB RAM to run at native 1080p resolution, 30 FPS average, and low settings. Running the game at higher resolutions and better framerates will be more demanding, although the requirements for native 4K resolution at 60 frames per second look reasonable, as users will need an Intel i5-11600K or<br>
AMD Ryzen 7 3700X CPU, NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti or AMD RX 7900 XT GPU, and 16 GB of RAM.</p>

So there was a lot of hype surrounding EA’s new <em>College Football 25.</em> After a decade of modding and hacking those older versions of the game to keep them updated with new players and teams, we now have a big new college football sim to enjoy. And many are enjoying it, with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ea-college-football-25-ncaa-14-biggest-game-playercount-1851595253&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ea-college-football-25-ncaa-14-biggest-game-playercount-1851595253"><em>EA College Football 25</em> hitting over 713,000</a></span> players during the game’s early access launch on console. </p><p>For the most part, players and critics have been pretty positive about the new game, but nothing is perfect, so EA has released its second large update for College Football 25. This update includes eight new shotgun formation plays for 35 teams, new uniform options, balance changes, and more. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-college-football/college-football-25/news/college-football-25-campus-huddle-title-update-august-8th-2024&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-college-football/college-football-25/news/college-football-25-campus-huddle-title-update-august-8th-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Update 2  is out now on Xbox Series X/S and PS5</a></span>.

Recruiting is a delicate balance as we want to try to make things as realistic as possible, while also allowing players to live out their football fantasies.

Still, it also retains a lot of familiar gameplay mechanics and concepts that ensure if you played the previous games, you’ll feel right at home. Whether you’re a returning player well-versed in <em>Cat Quest</em>’s history, or you’re brand new to the franchise, we’ve compiled a solid list of tips to help you get started in this feline-focused adventure.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196773" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Summer Soulslike Keeps Looking Better And Better" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="95" data-playlist="196773,196742,195150" data-current="196773"><div><p>This Summer Soulslike Keeps Looking Better And Better</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196773/196773_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196773/196773_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196773/196773_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196773/196773_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22330.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h2026"><a id=""></a><strong>Visit Lovepurr Castle ASAP for Healpaw Spell</strong></h2><p>Previously, gaining spells was just about buying them from a mysterious cavern. But this time out, there can sometimes be more to it. For instance, there are three missing Lovepurr Chronicle books, and you’ll want to find them. As soon as you obtain your first Lovepurr Chronicle, head over to Lovepurr Islands on the northeastern side of the map and speak to Clawford inside Lovepurr Castle. He’ll be so elated to see that you’ve brought one of the three missing books back to him that he’ll grant you the Healpaw spell. This powerful healing spell is an invaluable tool you should keep equipped at all times.</p><p>Note: If you haven’t found any Lovepurr Chronicles books yet, you can snag one in Lovepurr Cave directly north of Lovepurr Castle. Have we said “Lovepurr” enough times yet?</p><figure id="" data-id="318a8648fcda3823f88f62cee1ee58ba" data-recommend-id="image://318a8648fcda3823f88f62cee1ee58ba" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1032" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A boat on the way to the Lovepurr Islands." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A boat on the way to the Lovepurr Islands." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Gentlebros / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="318a8648fcda3823f88f62cee1ee58ba" data-recommend-id="image://318a8648fcda3823f88f62cee1ee58ba" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1032" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A boat on the way to the Lovepurr Islands." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h2027"><a id=""></a><strong>Hold off on upgrading your gear too early</strong></h2><p>Within an hour or so of playing <em>Cat Quest III</em>, you’re likely to stumble upon a smithy named Kidd Cat in Purvanna, who can upgrade your weapons, armor, and accessories in exchange for coins. However, since some of the game’s opening battles aren’t terribly difficult, it’s a good idea to play and explore for a few hours before investing many of your hard-earned coins in upgrades. This gives you time to discover new gear that may appeal to you far more than some of the earliest choices.</p><h2 id="h2028"><a id=""></a><strong>Synergize! Synergize! Synergize!</strong></h2><p>Speaking of gear, there are plenty of weapons, pieces of armor, accessories, and spells in <em>Cat Quest III</em>, and you’re obviously free to mix and match them any way you’d like. However, if you want to become an ultimate powerhouse, you’ll want to equip synergetic items.</p><p>For instance, if you find that you’re enjoying being an agile and aggressive melee-based combatant, grab a fast weapon (such as a set of claws) and combine them with armor and accessories which boost your attack speed or power. Similarly, you can combine gear designed for specific types of magic to become a powerful sorcerer of sorts. Play around with what works best for you and go all in!</p><figure id="" data-id="7f6cca6ddf964d2ebab90ae2b76fa33e" data-recommend-id="image://7f6cca6ddf964d2ebab90ae2b76fa33e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The cannon power menu." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The cannon power menu." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Gentlebros / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7f6cca6ddf964d2ebab90ae2b76fa33e" data-recommend-id="image://7f6cca6ddf964d2ebab90ae2b76fa33e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The cannon power menu." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h2029"><a id=""></a><strong>Check the accessory and ship menus every 5 to 10 levels</strong></h2><p>New levels come at a brisk pace in <em>Cat Quest III</em>, and reaching milestones brings expansion slots for your accessories and ship blueprints. As such, every time you reach a new level that is a multiple of five, head into the menu and check to see if you’ve unlocked any fresh slots to equip an accessory or ship upgrade, so that you’re always getting the most out of what the game has to offer.</p><h2 id="h2030"><a id=""></a><strong>If you’re stuck, Lightmouse has you covered</strong></h2><p>In addition to <em>Cat Quest III</em>’s various star-topped obelisks that point you in the direction of your next main objective, there’s someone helpful hanging out in the lighthouse in Pawt Purvanna. They go by the name “Lightmouse”, and they’ll happily give you insight into what you should be doing to progress, as well as offer up some useful tips about gameplay. If you’re ever feeling stuck, give Lightmouse a visit to see if they can give you a hand.</p><hr><p>There’s no shortage of content to see in <em>Cat Quest III</em>’s 10 to 15 hours of feline pirate-themed gameplay, and we hope these tips gave you a head-start on your adventure. Now go hop in your ship and take to the high seas!<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

However, we know some of you may want to recreate the original experience of playing these games, so you’ll be able to switch between the original and rearranged soundtracks.</li><li><strong>Change Fonts</strong> – The console release of <em>Final Fantasy I</em> to <em>VI</em> gives you the option to switch between two different fonts: the default font and a new pixel-based font that recreates the feel of the original games.</li><li><strong>Turn Off Random Encounters</strong> – Sometimes you just want to explore in peace, so a feature in the <em>Pixel Remaster</em> games lets you turn off random encounters completely. This means you can roam the world without being harassed by monsters. That also means you won’t get stronger, so be careful how you use it…</li><li><strong>Adjust <a title="Companies > Experience [210 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a></strong> – Speaking of getting stronger, want to speed things up a little? Boost features let you adjust the experience gained by up to four times.

It makes battles fly by!</li><li><strong>View Extras</strong> – Get a closer look at the many monsters you’ll face in the bestiary, marvel at the beautiful illustrations in a gallery, and enjoy the incredible soundtracks in a music player.</li></ul><p>All these features are, of course, optional, but they mean that players of all types—from those who played the originals to those who have never played a classic <em>Final Fantasy</em> game before—can have a great time with these six awesome <a title="Genres > Adventure [1,654 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a>s.</p><p><strong>What games are part of <em>Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster</em> series?</strong></p><p>For those who haven’t experienced these incredible games on PC and mobile, the FINAL FANTASY Pixel Remaster series comprises <em>Final Fantasy I</em> through <em>Final Fantasy VI</em>, giving fans a chance to relive some of the most beloved <a title="Genres > RPG [16,477 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPGs</a> of all time in a way that perfectly captures the spirit of those original games.</p><p>But if anything, we’re even more excited for new fans who’ll get to experience them for the very first time. These games are true masterpieces, and the Final <em>Fantasy Pixel Remaster</em> series offers the best way to play them yet!</p><p>Let’s take a closer look at the games in the series.</p><ul><li><strong><em>Final Fantasy</em></strong> – This is the ironically named game that started it all. You take control of the Warriors of Light, off on a journey to defeat four fiends and restore peace to the world. So many of the elements of the series that we’ve come to know and love make their debut right here in this very first entry: a massive world full of mystery, some iconic monster designs and that incredible music.</li><li><strong><em>Final Fantasy II</em></strong> – The second game in the series introduces a new world, new characters and something that would become a trademark of the series: innovation. The story focuses on the conflict between the hostile Empire of Palamecia and the rebel resistance. A small group of heroes is all that stands between the world and ruin. <em>Final Fantasy II</em> demonstrates the developers’ willingness to push their boundaries and try new things. For example, rather than sticking to the predictable, the game features a proficiency system in which characters skill with weapons and abilities increase the more they used them. Fun fact: this is the <em>Final Fantasy</em> game that introduced the world to chocobos! Now that’s a legacy.</li><li><strong><em>Final Fantasy III</em></strong> – When darkness falls and the land is robbed of light, four young heroes are chosen by the crystals to head off an exciting journey across a vast and hostile land. This critically-acclaimed entry in the series innovated with a flexible job system, which lets characters change their roles in combat at any time. Many of the most famous elements of <em>Final Fantasy</em> started here too—for example, it was the first to introduce summons, including series mainstays Bahamut and Shiva!</li><li><strong><em>Final Fantasy IV</em></strong> – <em>Final Fantasy IV</em> delivers one of the richest and most powerful stories in the series. It’s filled with characters and scenarios that fans continue to love to this day. It focuses on the dark knight Cecil, who finds himself stripped of his position and rank when he questions his king’s increasingly troubling orders. When he’s sent on a simple delivery mission with his friend Kain, the shocking events that follow send him and a group of allies on an incredible journey of betrayal, love and redemption. This is the first game to feature the Active Time Battle (ATB) system, which combines turn-based and real-time elements to create fast-paced and strategic combat.</li><li><strong><em>Final Fantasy V</em></strong> – The world of <em>Final Fantasy V</em> is on the verge of destruction because the elemental crystals that bring life and prosperity to the lands have lost their power. The only hope lies in four heroes: Bartz, Princess Lenna of Castle Tycoon, pirate Faris and the mysterious Galuf. Driven together by fate, they set off on a quest that to save the planet itself. As well as refining the ATB system, <em>Final Fantasy V</em> expands your strategic options massively through a greatly expanded job system, which let you customize your characters with 22 different jobs.</li><li><strong><em>Final Fantasy VI</em></strong> – <em>Final Fantasy VI</em> is a game that’s beloved by fans and critics alike. That’s partly thanks to its incredible setting and story. It’s set in a land where magic has disappeared, and humanity has instead turned to iron, gunpowder, steam and other technology. Actually, it would be more accurate to say that magic is mostly gone – a young woman enslaved by the evil Empire still has the power. When she encounters a powerful ancient being called an Esper, she sets off a chain of events that will have epic and terrible consequences.</li></ul></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Warner Bros. Games has revealed plans to license its IP out, given the high interest from third-party developers, as well as the success of games like Hogwarts Legacy.</p><p>On a recent <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wb-discovery-wants-to-license-franchises-batman-harry-potter-studios" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">investors call,</a> Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav said, "We have 11 studios here, and we have a lot of IP. And there's also a lot of interest among others in coming to take advantage of some of that IP for gaming, which we're looking at."</p><p>He continued, "Because as [president of global streaming and games JB Perrette] said, we need to get bigger, and the IP that we own and the value that it has in the gaming space is something we're looking to take advantage of." Zaslav explained that the success of Hogwarts Legacy was because players were able to immerse themselves into the world, and now Zaslav wants to make video games more of a priority.</p><p>Perrette also noted on the call that Warner Bros. is looking to grow in the free-to-play gaming business in order to balance out the cyclical and more hits-based nature of premium console and PC games. As part of that initiative, that's why <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/following-game-relaunch-multiversus-developer-now-has-a-new-owner/1100-6525200/" data-ref-id="1100-6525200">Warner Bros. acquired Player First</a>, the developer behind the free-to-play game MultiVersus.</p><p>The cyclicality can be seen by Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League's underperformance, which caused Warner Bros.' gaming revenue to <a href="https://s201.q4cdn.com/336605034/files/doc_earnings/2024/q2/earnings-result/WBD-2Q24-Earnings-Release.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">decrease by 41%</a> when compared to last year, which saw the release of Hogwarts Legacy's. Still, Warner Bros. is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warner-bros-doubles-down-on-live-service-games-spot-on/1100-6521729/" data-ref-id="1100-6521729">doubling down on live-service games</a>.</p>

That includes <em>Legacy of the Moonspell</em>, <em>Tides of the Foscari</em>, <em>Emergency Meeting</em>, and April’s <em>Operation Guns </em>which added a <em>Contra </em>crossover. The base game is $5 and all of the DLC combined is an additional $9. Plus there are all of the free updates that have added all sorts of other characters and easter eggs. </p><p>Why did it take this long? Poncle, a tiny indie team, has been taking its time with ports, working on one console a year. While Microsoft was on the ball with an Xbox version shortly after the 2022 PC release, Vampire Survivors didn’t come to Nintendo Switch until a year later, with a fantastic free mobile version taking precedence early on. Poncle blamed the more recent holdup on Sony’s submission process, noting that the team <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/poncle_vampire/status/1805231013280256451&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/poncle_vampire/status/1805231013280256451" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">had never put a game on the PlayStation store before</a></span>.</p><p>In the meantime, <em>Vampire Survivors</em> has spawned dozens of worthy clones, copycats, and clever adaptations.

Like <em>Slay the Spire </em>before it, <em>Vampire Survivors</em> seems to hit on something archetypal that elevates its mashup of mechanics into its own subgenre.</p><p>It’s nice that PlayStation owners will finally be able to see what all the fuss is about.

It can be tough looking for a starting point but don’t worry, we’ve got you covered!</p><h2>D&amp;D: What You Need To Know</h2><p>Getting into Dungeons &amp; Dragons (D&amp;D) can be overwhelming; there are so many campaigns and thousands with an encyclopedic mind about all things D&amp;D. We've got you; here's a simple guide to help you get started on your epic journey. </p><p>Begin by grasping the game's fundamental concepts and gathering the essential materials. Once you understand the core mechanics, you can dive into character creation and start playing with a group of friends. Here's how to get started:</p><ol data-cy="list"><li><strong>Understand the Basics</strong>: D&amp;D is a tabletop role-playing game (RPG) in which players create characters and embark on adventures in a fantasy world. The game is typically played with a Dungeon Master (DM) who narrates the story and controls the non-player characters (NPCs) and monsters.</li><li><strong>Get the Core Rulebooks</strong>: You'll need the <a href="https://zdcs.link/0PDE5?object_uuid=9c237f79-ce01-40f7-87fb-d9a48b511903&amp;t=article" target="_blank"><u><em>Player's Handbook</em></u><u>, </u><u><em>Dungeon Master's Guide</em></u><u>, and </u><u><em>Monster Manual</em></u><u>.</u></a> These books provide all the rules and lore necessary to create characters, run adventures, and understand the game's mechanics.</li><li><strong>Join a Group</strong>: Find a group of friends who are interested in playing or joining an existing group. If you need help finding a local group, online platforms like <a href="https://roll20.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Roll20</u></a> and <a href="https://discord.com/invite/dnd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Discord </u></a>can help you connect with other players.</li><li><strong>Create Your Character</strong>: Use the <em>Player's Handbook</em> to create your first character. Think of the Player's race, class, background, and personality. This is your chance to get creative and make someone you'd enjoy playing.</li><li><strong>Start With a Simple Adventure</strong>: Beginners should start with a pre-written adventure. <em>Lost Mine of Phandelver</em> is an excellent choice for new players and DMs. It offers a balanced introduction to D&amp;D gameplay and storytelling.</li></ol><h3><strong>Choosing the Right Miniatures</strong></h3><p>Miniatures add a visual and tactile element to D&amp;D, making battles and encounters more immersive. Selecting the right miniatures enhances the gameplay experience, offering a tangible representation of characters, monsters, and environments. Here's a guide on what to buy to get the most out of your D&amp;D sessions:</p><ol data-cy="list"><li><strong>Player Characters (PCs)</strong>: Invest in a miniature representing your character.

Understanding these modes can help you decide which type suits your group best. Here are some standard game modes:</p><ol data-cy="list"><li><strong>Campaign Play</strong> is the traditional mode in which players embark on a long-term adventure, progressing their characters over many sessions. It requires a consistent group and a dedicated DM to manage the story and progression.</li><li><strong>One-Shots</strong>: These are single-session adventures that can be completed in a few hours. They are great for introducing new players to the game or playing when a regular campaign session is impossible.</li><li><strong>Skirmishes</strong>: These combat-focused sessions emphasize tactical battles rather than stories. Players can quickly set up scenarios and engage in fighting, making them a good choice for those who enjoy the combat mechanics of D&amp;D.</li><li><strong>West Marches</strong> is a style of play in which multiple DMs and a large pool of players participate in a shared world. Sessions are player-driven, and the world evolves based on the actions and discoveries of different groups.</li><li><strong>Solo Play</strong>: While D&amp;D is typically a group game, solo adventures and modules are available for players who want to experience the game independently.</li></ol><h3><strong>Final Tips</strong></h3><p>Getting into D&amp;D is more than just the game; it's about spending time with the community, sharing stories, and having fun. Start small, engage with others, and most importantly, enjoy the process. The journey is as much about the experiences and memories you create along the way as about the adventures your character embarks on. Here are some final tips to help you along:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Start Small</strong>: You don't need to buy anything all at once. Begin with the essentials and gradually expand your collection.</li><li><strong>Join Online Communities</strong>: Engage with other D&amp;D enthusiasts on forums such as <a href="https://www.myth-weavers.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Myth Weavers</u></a>, social media, and websites like<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u> D&amp;D Beyond</u></a>. These communities are great for tips, inspiration, and support.</li><li><strong>Have Fun</strong>: Remember, D&amp;D is about storytelling, creativity, and having fun with friends. Don't stress too much about the rules or perfection—just enjoy the adventure!</li></ul></section><div><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Aug 8, 2024 1:25 pm</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>There have been all sorts of Fortnite <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-item-shop-wont-stop-being-weird/1100-6520635/" data-ref-id="1100-6520635">item-shop anomalies</a> over the past year and a half, but things have gotten exceptionally weird lately. We're about a week away from a new season, but every Fortnite diehard has their focus on the same thing today: the item shop. The news that items and skins from future battle passes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-ends-exclusivity-for-future-battle-passes/1100-6525606/" data-ref-id="1100-6525606">will be eligible to be sold in the shop</a> starting 18 months after the end of each season is just the capper (so far) on a week in which the item shop simply refused to be normal. Following months of the item shop seeming unhinged and uncontrollable, this week has given us our most surprising item shop gaffes yet.</p><p>Let's run down the current strangeness. Last week, the item shop briefly sold a jam track from last season's battle pass in the shop, before Epic hid it from the shop and forced refunds to those who purchased it. Also last week, every item in the shop claimed it was leaving on August 6, even though items in the shop never rotate in or out as one collective like that. After that didn't happen, everything shifted to saying it would rotate out on August 13, which is just as untrue.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Fortnite x Fall Guys Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>The most significant goof of them all came this past Tuesday; Epic accidentally sold The Paradigm skin for the first time since it was released in 2019--despite the fact that it was advertised and sold back then as <a href="https://www.facebook.com/story.php?id=100064597183531&amp;story_fbid=2844969895580316&amp;_rdr">an exclusive release</a> timed to the Season X finale event. It was intended to never be sold again. For Fortnite's most diehard digital collectors, to say the surprise was monumental would be a dramatic understatement--it was, honestly, as much of a shocker as the change to battle pass exclusivity would be 12 hours later, and it kicked off a pretty bizarre evening.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4346820-fortnitetheparadigm.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4346820" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4346820-fortnitetheparadigm.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4346820"></a><figcaption>The original Paradigm skin from Fortnite Season X.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4346820-fortnitetheparadigm.jpg"></figure><p>Epic's first response to the accident was to remove The Paradigm from the item shop after an hour without any comment on the situation. An hour after that, Epic declared that it would, as with the Swim Free jam track from the Chapter 5 Season 2 battle pass popping up in the shop last week, be refunding new buyers and <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteStatus/status/1821001329042493935" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">removing the skin from their lockers</a>. Another hour later, Epic reversed course and declared that anyone who purchased The Paradigm during its brief return window would be refunded <em>and also</em> get to keep the skin.</p><p>Those who had it back in the day will get a new, exclusive alternate style to prove their status as an OG, as well as a new option to refund their purchase from half a decade ago, just in case some players are annoyed by the fact that the item's rarity has unexpectedly changed in an instant.</p><p>So yes, that's right: If you were among those who scrambled to buy The Paradigm on Tuesday, you're getting it for free; you should receive a refund in V-Bucks within a few days.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1821024926150881445" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Change of plan! Bought The Paradigm tonight? You can keep her!<br>Her accidental return to the Shop is on us... so if you purchased The Paradigm during this evening's rotation, you can keep this Outfit and we'll refund your V-Bucks soon-ish.<br>We plan to create a brand new variant…</p>  — Fortnite Status (@FortniteStatus) <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteStatus/status/1821024926150881445?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 7, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>The response from the community to all of this was immediately vociferous. About four hours after the shop reset, the top six topics on the Fortnite subreddit were about The Paradigm and how Epic had handled the situation. Because the skin was so rare and important to the Fortnite storyline in the past, lots of folks had been waiting a very long time to purchase it--Fortnite previously included a Brie Larson version of this character in the Chapter 3 Season 4 battle pass as an alternative. At the same time, a lot of players who had The Paradigm originally were angry that the skin was available again after it had been sold to them as an exclusive--some of those people had undoubtedly only bought it because of that alleged exclusivity.</p><p>While the inclusion of The Paradigm in the shop was seemingly an error, it was one that actually required some effort. The Fortnite item shop looks extremely different than it did in 2019. Presumably, all the shop assets related to The Paradigm would have had to be updated by an actual person to meet the current item shop's aesthetic standards.</p><p>Epic's decision to both give new purchasers their V-Bucks back and allow them to keep the skin is likely a consequence of a lot of people spending real human currency on V-Bucks to buy it. It's no exaggeration to say there are people who have been checking the item shop daily for <em>years</em> for exactly this moment, despite having no reason to think it would ever actually happen. This is in <em>sharp</em> contrast with the Swim Free jam track, which carried no demand whatsoever since it was available for free to anyone who played Fortnite during last season.</p><p>So while Epic can unilaterally issue V-Buck refunds for these purchases, the real-money purchases to obtain those V-Bucks would still need to be addressed, and that's a far more complicated thing with platform holders like Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo having to be involved. Giving buyers their V-Bucks back and also letting them keep the purchase is the path of least resistance--and it builds a little goodwill among some of Fortnite's most hardcore users in the process. But it also once again demonstrates how oddly out-of-control the Fortnite item shop continues to be month after month, or even day after day at some points over the last year and change.</p><p>From the outside, all this remains a confusing--and admittedly somewhat amusing--mystery. The shop doesn't have a mind of its own, so why does the system that operates the digital store seem so indecipherable to its creators? Suppose Epic doesn't intend to sell a particular item. How does it keep happening that for periods of minutes or days at a time, several times dating back for more than a year now, such items keep becoming available for purchase? The financial cost of these mistakes may prove to be a mere rounding error for the video game giant, but the reputational cost is arguably more severe by routinely frustrating and/or confusing the game's most dedicated players. Also, consider this sort of thing probably doesn't look great to the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/refunds/fortnite-refunds" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">government agencies</a> and regulatory bodies that have already been scrutinizing Fortnite's item shop practices for years.</p><p>This whole ordeal with The Paradigm also demonstrates why Epic is only planning to bring back items from future battle passes and not the current and old ones--beyond just the myriad potential legal issues doing so might create. The uproar about The Paradigm was immense despite the fact that, realistically, few people actually owned it. Battle pass skins, by extreme contrast, are <em>the </em>most commonly owned skins, and so there would be far more people who actually cared about whether they come back--the fighting about it would never end. It's just a mess Epic doesn't need to step in right now. So for the foreseeable future, do-overs, like the current Deadpool and Wolverine shop skins, will continue to be the way Epic creatively brings back battle pass items.</p><p>We'll keep monitoring the enigmatic Fortnite item shop for accidental re-releases, regrettable refunds, and other head-scratching items for sale.</p>

		<p>Saber Interactive and Focus Entertainment have shared an extended multiplayer gameplay video for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>, showcasing the 3-player PvE Operations, and the PvP Eternal War mode. Space Marine 2 is coming out across <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC on 9th September.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 - Extended Multiplayer Gameplay" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/moaWKtTq1zc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Taking place on Planet Kadaku, the mission sends the team out to reach a refinery and use its stores to destroy the swarm of Tyranid aliens. Right from the off, you get to see a motley selection of Space Marine gear, with jump packs, Power Hammers, Power Swords, shields, scoped Bolters and more, taking on Tyranids big and swarmy – the Carnifex battle gives off some Monster Hunter vibes, to me.</p>
<p>The action then jumps to PvP competitive multiplayer, with 4v4 battles between Space Marines and Chaos Marines – there’s sure to be plenty of fun character customisation options there. The game mode shown here was Capture and Control.</p>
<p>Both modes feature six playable classes – Tactical, Assault, Vanguard, Bulwark, Sniper and Heavy – and lean in on a customisation system for your own Space Marine. It’s not just cosmetics, but will let you level up your weapons through play with a shared progression system. After launch, Saber will roll out content updates to add more Operations missions, PvP maps, weapons and more.</p>

<p>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2’s main story campaign will see the Ultramarines and Captain Demetrian Titus (now demoted to Lieutenant after the original game) stepping into the breach to face off against the Tyranid hordes invading the Imperial worlds of Avarax and Kadaku. While he might have been demoted, Titus has undergone the Rubicon Primaris process to transform him into a taller, stronger and faster Primaris Space Marine – a relatively new narrative twist in the 42nd millenium, after the return of the Primarchs.</p>
<p>Dom got to go <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/01/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-preview-better-the-boltgun-you-know/">hands on with Space Marine 2 back at Gamescom last year</a>, writing “Combat in Space Marine 2 is unapologetically gritty, focussing on the risk and reward of executions to renew your ability bank. Blood flies out of everywhere, which is little surprise when the Space Marines are packing swords with chainsaws built in and boltguns with ammo the size of your fist. There’s a cool parry move to utilise, and you have to mix up your approaches as you deal with ever-larger Tyranid enemies. They behave as you’d expect, like a flood of alien locusts that swarm towards you, intent on turning you to mulch. Better you do it to them first, then!”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/enshrouded-sales-3-million<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Keen Games has announced that&nbsp;<em>Enshrouded&nbsp;</em>sales have topped another big milestone since the game's Early Access release in January, and the devs have also shared some interesting statistics about the game to celebrate.</p>
<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Enshrouded&nbsp;</em>has hit three million sales. As a reminder, the game managed to reach the million-player mark <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/enshrouded-million-players">in only four days</a>, reaching two million sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/enshrouded-two-million-players">less than a month</a> after its release.</p>
<p>Indeed,&nbsp;<em>Enshrouded&nbsp;</em>may not be attracting as many players as it did during the peak of its popularity, but it's still drawing around 10,000 players per day <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1203620/charts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">according to SteamDB</a>, which isn't bad going at all.</p>

<p>According to the devs, more than 90 million hours of&nbsp;<em>Enshrouded&nbsp;</em>have been played so far, and in those 90 million hours, 150 million player deaths have been registered. Ouch.</p>
<p>Almost 700,000 players have reached&nbsp;<em>Enshrouded</em>'s level cap of 25, and since development on the game began, Keen Games has doubled in size, with its longest-standing employee having been with the company for 19 years. Now that's service!</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Enshrouded</em>, it's an open-world survival-crafting game in which you (and, optionally, your friends) venture into the deadly Shroud in order to gather resources, battle powerful enemies, and carve out a life for yourself.</p>

			<p>Crytek has announced the addition of a new Wild Target coming to <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-nvidia-geforce-game-ready-driver-out-now-hunt-showdown-1896-gets-dlss-level-zero-extraction-launches-with-dlss-3/">Hunt: Showdown 1896</a>, which will be added to the game alongside a new event called Scorched Earth. This new Wild Target and event will both be available to players on August 15, launching on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
<p>The Hellborn can be found lurking around the peaks of the new Colorado map, Mammon's Gulch. In addition to the Hellborn, Scorched Earth includes three Pacts for Hunters to pledge to as they make their way into the depths of the Rocky Mountains.</p>
<p>Hellborn are a source of immense heat, and can be tracked down audibly by listening in Dark Sight. For those on the lookout for this new Wild Target they can be found at multiple locations. However, they are a considerable threat to players, as they can cover the Hunters in slag, scorching everything in its wake. In addition, the Hellborn howls incredibly loud, which attracts the attention of many other Hunters, meaning you have some additional threat to contend with.</p>
<p>Along with the new Wild Target for players to hunt down, the Scorched Earth event for Hunt: Showdown 1896 also brings new ammo and weapons. This includes the 1865 Carbine, the Infantry 73L base rifle with a sniper variant, Bear Trap and a Crossbow Deadeye scoped variant.</p>
<p>A new Weekly Challenge system has been implemented to support players who join in the Scorched Earth event in the middle of it, as well as a Battle Pass which includes free and premium rewards for players to unlock.</p>
<p>There are three Pacts that Hunters can take in the Hunt: Showdown 1896 Scorched Earth event. The first pact is The Lawful Pact. This is to try and establish Hunter authority in the Gulch under Wyatt Preston's command.</p>
<p>Second is The Wilderness Pact, where Hunters don't trust in the law to any degree. Instead, they stay out in the wilderness to defend the sanctity of the mountain ranges, while punishing those who try to exploit it.</p>
<p>Third and finally, there is The Demented Pact, which resurfaces under the veil of darkness, following signs of Corruption. Hunters who take this Pact seek to nurture and multiple the wonders that the Sculptor has wrought.</p>
<p>Each Pact comes with its own traits that can make it beneficial to a Hunter. Players can pledge to their Pacts at Supply Points, which gives them exclusive Pact-specific Traits. In addition, some existing Traits gain bonus Conditional Traits for those who pledge to specific Pacts.</p>
<p>The trailer for the Scorched Earth event and the Hellborn Wild Target is now available to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiO-DVP8AGg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">watch on YouTube</a>.</p>

The first game played a lot like a traditional BioWare <em>D&amp;D </em>game, despite being set in the company’s self-created universe. You could take control of any member of your party, and pause battles to possess each and decide on their next moves. By the third game, <em>Inquisition</em>, while you could still control other characters, the emphasis had moved much more toward focusing on your main, and much more on the action. It seems that transition is now complete.</p><p>Talking to <em>Edge</em>, BioWare’s Corianna Busch told the magazine, “On the experiential side, we wanted you to feel like you are Rook.” That’s the pre-determined main character of <em>Veilguard</em>, albeit <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-character-creator-options-races-1851564939&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-character-creator-options-races-1851564939">one you can design to look how you wish</a></span>. “You’re in this world, you’re really focused on your actions,” the game’s director continued. “We wanted the companions to feel like they, as fully realised characters, are in control of their own actions. They make their own decisions.”</p><p>However, that’s not the only reason. (And wouldn’t be the best one, given how much I’ve bonded with my own character in previous <em>Dragon Age</em> games, to the degree where it just felt <em>wrong</em> to be playing as one of the companions.) Busch also told the UK magazine that <em>Veilguard</em> “is a much higher actions-per-minute game. It is more technically demanding on the player.” Apparently during playtesting, it was found that letting people control the companions “wasn’t actually adding to the experience. In fact, in some ways it was detrimental.”</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-gameplay-trailer-dreadwolf-rook-1851532144&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-gameplay-trailer-dreadwolf-rook-1851532144">From the early footage</a></span>, it’s pretty clear that <em>Veilguard</em> is a full-on third-person action game, on top of being an RPG. Which we’re totally down for. But it’s certainly going to be a cognitive shift, losing the ability to direct companion actions—let’s just hope their AI is up to it.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Splitgate 2, the upcoming free-to-play team-based shooter, has finally gotten a full gameplay reveal ahead of its first Alpha later this month.</p>



<p>In the gameplay reveal, players get a look how the combat will work in the game along with the overall visuals. Also shown throughout the reveal are the new factions that debut in Splitgate 2.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Official Gameplay Reveal | Splitgate 2" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Oua2iTVFbJI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>There are three factions in total, each having their own abilities to help vary the game’s playstyle. The Aeros faction are a fast-paced group with a Rush ability that allows for more agile movement on the map. The Meridian faction offers Hypersight and Time Dome systems that “give a huge boost to support class players, arming them with the ability to assist the whole team”.</p>



<p>Lastly, the Sabrask faction is known as the “toughest” in the game. </p>



<p>“The Sabrask Smart Wall is truly advantageous in a head-to-head gun fight and combined with a few perfectly thrown grenades, this faction can have powerful offensive potential in controlling an area,” developer 1047 Games said.</p>



<p>Splitgate 2 is scheduled to launch in 2025, and will be available on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC. Those that want a chance to play early will be able to register for an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2918300/Splitgate_2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Alpha test via Steam</a> that takes place from August 21-25.</p>

<p>Roblox has officially been banned in Turkey (Türkiye) over concerns of child exploitation.</p>



<p>In a statement posted on <a href="https://x.com/yilmaztunc/status/1821259391087341579" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter on Wednesday</a>, Minister of Justice Yılmaz Tunç said that access to the game “and its links” have been blocked.</p>



<p>“It is everyone’s duty to look out for, protect and support the best interests of our children, the guarantor of our future,” he said. “Turkey is one of the countries that closely follows developments in the world and uses technology in the best way. However, using technology in a negative way is never acceptable.”</p>



<p>No other reasons, or further explanation, were given for the game’s ban in the country.</p>



<h2 id="h-roblox-s-response-to-being-banned">Roblox’s Response To Being Banned</h2>



<p>In response to the ban in Turkey, Roblox says that it respects the laws in countries it operates in.</p>



<p>“We’ve spent almost 20 years making Roblox one of the safest online platforms for our users, particularly the youngest, and ensuring the safety of our users is at the core of everything we do,” the company said in a statement. </p>



<p>“We respect the laws and regulations in countries where we operate and share local lawmakers’ commitment to children. We look forward to working together to ensure Roblox is back online in Türkiye as soon as possible.”</p>



<p>This isn’t the first time child exploitation has been brought up against Roblox. Just last month, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/?srnd=undefined" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg published a story</a> on how the company has been fighting a — sometimes losing — battle against child predators within its game.</p>
