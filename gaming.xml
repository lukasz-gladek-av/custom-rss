			<p>The Xbox Series X sales have increased significantly in Japan following the announcement of a <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-gets-price-rise-in-japan-increasing-by-90/">PlayStation 5 price increase</a> which will go into effect next week.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/ps5-price-increase-in-japan-sends-xbox-consoles-soaring-up-sales-charts/">Automaton</a>, on Yodobashi, one of Japan's biggest retailers, the console reached number 8 in the games and consoles charts this morning, which is an amazing result, considering the system wasn't even in the top 100 yesterday. With the PS5's price increase, the Xbox Series X has become an enticing purchase, as it now costs the equivalent of $100 less. In addition, it seems like it has become difficult for Japanese players to even purchase a PlayStation 5 system, as the pre-rise stock has been completely sold out at most retailers.</p>
<p>Considering how much the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S have struggled in Japan since release, this is definitely good news for Microsoft as it gears up to release new models of both systems, including a <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-all-digital-announced/">Series X All-Digital model</a> coming with a 2TB SSD. On the other hand, the negative sentiment surrounding the PlayStation 5 couldn't have surfaced at a worse time, with Sony supposedly preparing to announce the PlayStation 5 Pro <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-design-reveal/">early next month</a>. The increased specs over the base and the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler, which will make the system <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-100-faster-upscaling-epic-settings/">feel even more powerful than it actually is</a>, may not be enough to convince Japanese customers to pay more to play titles that are also coming on Xbox Series X, such as the upcoming Monster Hunter Wilds, which has been cited by many on Japanese social media as the game that made them want to purchase a PlayStation 5.</p>

			<p>It took a long time, but Square Enix finally <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xiv-xbox-announced-crossplay-square-enix-on-xbox-going-forward/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> Final Fantasy XIV on Xbox consoles earlier this year. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naoki-yoshida-on-dawntrail-criticism-community-feedback-and-the-future-of-final-fantasy-14" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking</a> with Eurogamer at Gamescom 2024, producer Naoki Yoshida discussed the community's response to the launch and reiterated Square Enix's commitment to Microsoft's console platform.</p>
<p><em>Players have been waiting a long time for the Xbox release of Final Fantasy XIV, but I'm happy to say that we've seen a really strong response on Xbox. We've seen communities starting to establish and now they're growing. We've had a pretty good response on Xbox.</em></p>
<p><em>With Final Fantasy XIV as an opportunity, we can take this opportunity to strengthen the community on Xbox towards the Final Fantasy franchise. I think this is where we would take more communication and work on establishing the community moving forward. And this is important, not for Final Fantasy XIV, but, I would say, for Square Enix. With Final Fantasy XIV's release on Xbox, Phil Spencer spent a lot of his time and a lot of effort and put in a lot of hard work into making it a reality. So we would like to make the best of that and further deepen the relationship with Xbox gamers moving forward.</em></p>
<p><em>I want you to just take this as a general argument, but when it comes to the Xbox platform and the fact that it was difficult for Japanese titles to be released on the platform, that's tied into the fact that in the Japanese market there is an extremely low number of users on Xbox. And naturally, because we are Japanese developers, we have a desire for many people in our country to play our games. I think that applies to developers in any country, whichever country they come from, they want many people from their own country to play their games. Because of that, it's really a tough point in terms of a business standpoint. I think that's generally one perspective of how you can look at things in terms of the situation.</em></p>
<p><em>However, at Square Enix, we have been changing our policy. So now we are moving towards the policy of releasing our games on a multiplatform basis, and we really want as many players as possible to play our titles. So with Final Fantasy XIV as the starting point, we do want to release more Square Enix games on Xbox, and there will be more of our titles released on Xbox. So I hope players will look forward to future things to come on the platform.</em></p>
<p>Yoshida is referring, of course, to the new multiplatform strategy <a href="https://wccftech.com/square-enix-unveils-new-business-plan-with-aggressive-multiplatform-strategy-and-quality-over-quantity-focus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> in May by Square Enix. It was largely due to the disappointing sales of PlayStation 5 exclusives like Final Fantasy XVI (also produced by Yoshida-san) and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. The former, in particular, is just about to launch on PC, and it's not at all far-fetched to imagine it will eventually launch on Xbox, too. It may be more tricky with the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy, as Sony is believed to have secured those games for good.</p>

<p>The PS5 Pro‚Äôs design details have surfaced online, and it seems that the mid-gen refresh console will be similar in design to the PS5 Slim model.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reliable gaming news source <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/voici-le-nom-le-design-de-la-nouvelle-console-de-playstation-avec-plein-dautres-details-inedits-59094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">billbil-kun</a> recently shared more details about the upcoming console, including the official name, design details, announcement window, and more. According to their latest report, as everyone expected, the mid-gen console‚Äôs official name was PS5 Pro. Read about the design details, announcement window and more below. </p>



<p>Billbil-kun finding the information suggests that it‚Äôs been uploaded on the backend of retailer websites‚Ä¶ somewhere, suggesting that the console will soon be announced. </p>

<h2 id="h-ps5-pro-design">PS5 Pro Design </h2>



<p>The report states that the PS5 Pro design will feature ‚Äúthe same white colour‚Äù for the outer panels as the previous models. On the front of the console, players will find 2 USB-C ports and a power button. Additionally, there will be three ‚Äúblack stripes‚Äù across both side panels instead of the Slim‚Äôs one stripe. Lastly, the PS5 Pro model is a bit bulkier than the Slim models.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-controller-and-announcement-window">Controller and Announcement Window</h2>



<p>Moreover, according to the images billbil-kun has received, the PS5 Pro doesn‚Äôt seem to have a disc drive; however, this needs to be confirmed. Regarding the controller, the Pro model will still feature the standard DualSense Controller in the box. Lastly, the report states that the PS5 Pro ‚Äúwill be announced very soon‚Äù and could be announced as early as ‚Äúthe first half of September 2024.‚Äù&nbsp;</p>



<p>Insider Gaming previously reported that a PlayStation <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/september-2024-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">State of Play event</a> is seemingly scheduled for the end of September, and the PS5 Pro announcement could arrive during this event.

            <p>
The design of Sony's under-wraps but much-discussed PlayStation 5 Pro model has reportedly been posted online. 
</p>
<p>
Prolific leaker <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/voici-le-nom-le-design-de-la-nouvelle-console-de-playstation-avec-plein-dautres-details-inedits-59094">bilbil-kun</a> today posted an illustration showing the console model - which looks very similar to that of the base PS5 - and provided a few more details on its reveal. 
</p>
<p>
White in colour, with two USB-C ports and a power button on the console's front, the only major difference is the three ridged lines on the console's shell. This is an upgrade to the one ridged line on the PS5 Slim.

<p>
The PS5 Pro will be offered as a digital-only model, reportedly to keep costs down, though today's report suggests it may still be possible to affix the PS5 disc drive add-on to it - although this is not confirmed either way.
</p>
<p>
There are no changes expected to the PS5 DualSense controller, meanwhile.

<p>
The leak of the PS5 Pro's design comes just weeks ahead of its formal announcement, today's report states, which is expected next month - in September.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer and Digital Foundry have been tracking PS5 Pro's path to release over the past year, since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-df-weekly-are-the-latest-switch-2-and-ps5-pro-leaks-actually-plausible">leaks first popped up in the summer of 2023</a> that Sony was prepping a more powerful PS5. In February of this year, CNBC stated there was now <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-5-pro-expected-this-year-report">"broad concensus" that Sony was indeed preparing PS5 Pro</a> to launch "in the second half of 2024". 
</p>
<p>
In March, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-5-pro-leaked-specs-appear-online">PS5 Pro technical specs appeared online</a>, which Eurogamer understands to be accurate. Digital Foundry did its own analysis, and dubbed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-spec-analysis-playstation-5-pro-the-most-powerful-console-yet">PlayStation 5 Pro to be "the most powerful console yet"</a>. April brought word that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/which-games-will-get-sonys-ps5-pro-enhanced-label">Sony was prepping a "PS5 Pro Enhanced" label</a> for new games (or older ones with new patches) that will take advantage of its upcoming hardware. And yet <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-df-weekly-new-ps5-pro-gpu-details-emerge-including-a-235ghz-max-boost-clock">more PS5 technical details arrived in May</a>. 
</p>
<p>So, will you be buying PS5 Pro?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>How do you remake a cult classic? Change too much and you alienate the hardcore fans of the original, whilst failing to adapt and imrpove ancient mechanics will leave modern audiences cold. Despite having a good stab at it, it‚Äôs a conundrum that NatsumeAtari never manage to satisfyingly resolve during the course of their retro 2D slash ‚Äòem up, Shadow of the Ninja- Reborn.</p>
<p><iframe title="Shadow of the Ninja - Reborn" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5u6KyZsKNLo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The original Shadow of the Ninja arrived on the NES in Europe way back in 1991. It was a 2D 8-bit side-scrolling platforming ninja ‚Äòem up; one that stood out in a shadowy genre thanks to its hugely enjoyable 2 player co-op, which saw two ninjas leaping, dashing, and lobbing shuriken with wanton abandon. Now, thirty-something years since its EU debut, Shadow of the Ninja has been reborn under the watchful eye of Tengo Project. Meanwhile, original creatives Dynamic Productions and Iku Mizutani have returned to handle character illustrations and music respectively. And their involvement has paid off, as the presentation of Shadow of the Ninja Reborn is absolutely spot on. Graphically, whilst still a humungous improvement on the original‚Äôs 8-bit visuals, Reborn retain its predecessor‚Äôs distinctive pixel-coated retro-charm. </p>


<p>Character models are so chunky you can almost chew ‚Äòem; huge mechs clunk into battle, oiled-up beefcakes flex their biceps before charging into battle, whilst gun-toting robo-mercs unleash bullet hell every moment they can get. It‚Äôs so charming, so bonkers, it‚Äôs like the 90‚Äôs never went away! The sprites of returning ninjas Hayate and Kaede are delightful too. Their range of animations are beguiling, and they both look cool slicing through hordes of minions ‚Äì even if Kaede has, once again, seemingly forgotten to wear any pants. The music is ‚Äì of course, considering Mizutani‚Äôs return ‚Äì grin-inducing guitar-wailing brilliance. Whilst the environments themselves ooze with incidental details; lightning flashes, thunder brews, and rain pours. The atmosphere that Shadow of the Ninja ‚Äì Reborn gives off is palpable, who needs polygons huh?</p>


<p>Local co-up is present, correct, and as fun as ever. So, why doesn‚Äôt Shadow of the Ninja Reborn deliver on all of its promise? For me, it is too respectful of the original game. The 90‚Äôs era levels have been re-produced with likely too much diligence; often becoming a teeth-gnashing grind of pixel-perfect leaps, endless bad-guys, and a peculiar pre-occupation of making it hard to tell if a surface can be clung to or not. My skilled ninja warrior would often hilariously bounce off a wall rather than attach to it, even though visually the wall looked virtually identical to the other‚Äôs I had been clambering on. </p>
<p>Controls are unnecessarily fussy too. Climbing is messy, with Hayate and Kaede rarely behaving themselves and dying unnecessarily because of it. Whilst only being able to access one collected power-up at a time fails to add any of the intended strategy, just frustration as you drink a health-potion rather than lobbing that bomb. There‚Äôs also a definite input lag, which, when combined with some old-school difficulty levels, can create some near unscalable difficulty spikes. So much so in fact, that my regular local co-up pal soon bounced off the arduous challenge, forcing me to go it alone through what proved be an interminable slog, despite the inclusion of occasional ‚Äì and much welcome ‚Äì check points.</p>

<p>Whilst the correct balance of homage and reinvention when it comes to a remake will always be subjective, I can‚Äôt help but feel that Shadow of the Ninja ‚Äì Reborn is too devoted to its predecessor. If you want that old-school uber-challenging retro experience, warts and all, then you‚Äôll love what you find here, for the rest of us, a few more modern design sensibilities would prove a welcome respite.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Shadow of the Ninja - Reborn looks the part, this is a sumptuous 2D scroller that clearly loves the 1990s with unabashed and borderline obsessional desire. It effectively emulates the experience of playing a game from that era too. The problem is that includes dodgy controls, plentiful gameplay frustrations and difficulty spikes so sharp they‚Äôd make a 42-year-old man cry. And they did.	</p></div>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-design-reveal/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-5-pro-to-feature-similar-design-of-base-model-reveal-set-for-early-september.966879/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-design-reveal/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-2tb-storage/">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> design won't be much different that that of the current base model, according to a new report from a reliable leaker.</p>
<p>Earlier today, well-known leaker billbil-kun <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/voici-le-nom-le-design-de-la-nouvelle-console-de-playstation-avec-plein-dautres-details-inedits-59094">provided</a> some new information on the yet-to-be-released system, confirming that it will unsurprisingly be named PlayStation 5 Pro, judging from the front of the final packaging they were able to see. The front of the final packaging also revealed the console's design, which looks pretty much the same as the current base model, barring a few minor differences and a slightly thicker size.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, the PlayStation 5 Pro may be released without a disc drive, as the packaging seen by the leaker shows the system without one. The leaker, however, couldn't confirm if this model will be the only one to get released. Additionally, the console will come with a standard DualSense controller.</p>
<p>Regarding the timing of the announcement, billbil-kun couldn't precisely confirm when the PS5 Pro will be revealed, but it shouldn't take much longer, as the long-rumored system should be revealed during the first half of September.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-original-resident-evil-2-from-1998-comes-shambling-and-groaning-back-to-pc.966876/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-original-resident-evil-2-from-1998-comes-shambling-and-groaning-back-to-pc<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Step this way please, fans of pre-rendered backgrounds and pixellated blood spatters. There is something waiting for you in the window of the local internet video game store, GOG.com. Resident Evil 2, the original 1998 survival horror, is now buyable, downloadable, and yes, even playable on PC. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>It's up <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/resident_evil_2">on GOG for ¬£9</a> currently, boasting "Improved cutscenes and subtitles" while also making the bonus character scenarios unlocked from the beginning. For those who've forgotten, these are the two special runs you can do featuring gas-masked military man Hunk, or giant piece of sentient soy, Tofu. This port also seems to squash a few long-standing bugs. "Fixed issues with Rooms 114 and 115 (missing text), Room 210 (invisible diary), and Room 409 (looping sound)," says the blurb. Intriguing.</p>
<p>This is all part of an ongoing roll out of the original zombie-zappin' scarers. Resident Evil 1 was put on sale <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-original-resident-evil-from-1996-comes-back-to-pc-after-decades-of-gathering-flies">a couple of months ago</a>, while Resident Evil 3 has also been <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/resident_evil_2">listed as "coming soon"</a> since then. It's not the first time any of the games have been out on PC, but it is now the easiest (legal) option when it comes to frollicking around Raccoon City in your big bloodstained bandage.</p>
<p>Old Resi 2 is a good aperitif if you've recently played the Resident Evil 2 remake. The remake plays with your memories of the late-ninties statue-pusher in some fun ways. You might gingerly walk down the much beautified bottom floor corridor of the police station, muttering in mental preparation that the first licker will appear overhead shortly. But then... it's nowhere to be seen. Only later, when you're lulled into puzzle solving mode, does the monster show up on another floor entirely, skittering across the ceiling with nary a FMV cutscene to steady your nerves. Well played, Capcom, you got me. </p>
<p>Since these small differences are set against a largely faithful recreation of the original's spirit, they stand out as fun expectation-bouncers rather than iconoclastic upheaval. As you can probably tell, I played a lot of Resi as a young 'un, and I'm fond of the remake. If the various <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/resident-evil-code-veronica-and-0-remakes-are-rumoured-to-be-in-development-at-capcom">rumours about remakes for Code Veronica and Resident Evil 0</a> prove to be true, perhaps we'll see more clever modernisations. But even without those, there is something valuable in going back to the source material, even if you never actually played it in the bright, free beauty of the 1990s. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We hope this small change helps players with hearing loss, and we will continue to work hard to improve accessibility so that everyone can have a better gaming experience.</p><p>- Replaced missions in Hard Infiltration Operations with more combat-oriented ones.</p><p>- Increased the EXP reward for completing Hard Infiltration Operations. Also increased EXP for defeating monsters by 1.5 times.</p><p>- You can now acquire rare basic materials as a reward for completing Hard Infiltration Operations.</p><p>- Increased EXP for defeating monsters in Normal Infiltration Operations by 1.5 times.</p><p># Director's Comment</p><p>The 1.1.0 update brings many changes to Hard Infiltration Operations. We've changed some of the pre-existing missions such as Occupation, Defense, and Escort to Extermination or Destruction to give players a run-and-gun styled fast-paced combat experience as they enjoy repeated farming. The reward system has also been adjusted to reflect this: we've significantly increased the amount of EXP gained from defeating monsters and completing missions in Hard Infiltration Operations, and while Special Operations are still the better option for farming EXP, Infiltration Operations can now provide a decent amount of EXP as players farm items. Additionally, we've increased the amount of rare basic materials you can receive from clearing Hard Infiltration Operations. We'll continue to add more content that allows players to enjoy their favorite styles of combat.</p><p>- Added directions to appear when using Ecive during missions.</p><p>- Monsters will no longer target players who are participating in other missions.</p><p>- Story dialogues will no longer be repeated in Hard Difficulty missions. As a result, Hard Difficulty missions will not play additional voice lines or subtitles.</p><p>- Changed the Immunity mechanics of certain Named Monsters. Replaced the sphere destruction mechanic of Eterllick, Celdir, Dmigor, and Plaudia with shooting weak points.</p><p>- Increased the barrier hit range of Named Monster Eterllick.</p><p>- Players will no longer be teleported when joining Largescale Outpost missions.</p><p>- Increased the Gold reward for completing Hard Difficulty Largescale Outposts by approximately 3 times.</p><p>- Improved the routes so that shards acquired from Void Fragments can be used on the Fusion Reactor in the same battlefield.</p><p>- More than doubled the amount of shards obtained from Void Fragments.</p><p>- Changed monster types and spawn locations in certain Void Fragment missions.</p><p>„Ñ¥ "Hagios: Dune Base," "Vespers: Moonlight Lake," "Echo Swamp: Abandoned Zone," and "Fortress: Frozen Valley"</p><p>- Removed the starting requirements (Void Shards) of Void Fusion Reactors and added requirements (Void Shards) to the Reconstructed Devices that appear in Fusion Reactors.</p><p>- Made an improvement so that only one type of shard is required when using the Reconstructed Device in a Void Fusion Reactor.</p><p>- Reduced the time to interact with Reconstructed Devices.</p><p>- Summoned Reconstructed Devices now expire 10 seconds after all participants have used them.</p><p># Director's Comment</p><p>With the 1.1.0 update, we've made adjustments so that a single playthrough of a Void Fragment will yield enough Void Shards to use the Reconstructed Devices in Fusion Reactors once. We've also improved accessibility by making Void Fragments and Fusion Reactors on the same battlefield drop and require the same type of shards. While you can still obtain two types of shards from Void Fragments, the Reconstructed Devices in Fusion Reactors now require only one type of shard, further improving accessibility.</p><p>We are constantly monitoring feedback to further improve Outposts and Void Fragments. For long-term improvements, the dev team is considering ideas to evolve Outposts into a non-stop combat experience, as well as improving the farming accessibility of Void Fragments and Fusion Reactors with the integration of content.</p><p>In this 1.1.0 update, we've also changed the spawn location of certain Void Fragment missions to provide an efficient way to farm shards for each attribute. In addition, we've added snipers in certain Void Fragment areas to prevent the use of macros.</p><p>We hope these changes will make your farming experience more enjoyable.</p><p>- Players can now view the "Past Mission Results" from the menu after completing Special Operations, allowing them to restart the mission.</p><p>- Improved display of the mission tooltip information on the Special Operation and Infiltration Operation World Map screen.</p><p>- More than doubled the amount of shards that can be picked up in Special Operations.</p><p>- Acquire additional Descendant EXP when completing waves in Special Operations.</p><p># Director's Comment</p><p>We've made adjustments to Special Operations so that there is improved efficiency when farming EXP. While we recognize many players enjoy leveling up through Sterile Land Mine Blocking, we still believe it's not as rewarding as other EXP farms that require a simpler play, such as Void Fragments.</p><p>As a result, in this update, we've added EXP when clearing waves in Special Operations. The fastest, "Mine Blockade," will now give you about 1.5 times more EXP than before, while "Resource Defense" and "Neutralize Experiment" will give you 2 times more EXP. We hope this will help players level up more efficiently across various Special Operations.</p><p>(2) UI/UX</p><p>- Fixed issue to allow multiple socket types to be assigned to a single module socket.</p><p>„Ñ¥ The socket type applied to Loadout Setting 1 can also be used for Settings 2 and 3 as well.</p><p>- For slots with multiple socket types, the socket type can be changed from the selected menu</p><p>„Ñ¥ Each socket type for Loadout Settings 1, 2, 3 can be changed so they all may differ.</p><p>- Fixed issue to allow the dismantling of equipment during combat.</p><p>- Added dead zone settings to the game controller options.</p><p>- Made improvements so that the Amorphous Materials linked to Fusion Reactors are displayed in the acquisition information, like Intercept Battles.</p><p>- Made improvements to allow the ability to designate the quantity of researches when researching enhancement materials.</p><p>- Reduced research time for [Standard/Precision] Ion Accelerator, Phase Exchanger, and Adjustment Control Axis.</p><p># Director's Comment</p><p>We have added the ability to select the quantity of researches when researching enhancement materials. One consequence of this change is that only two studies in the research list will result for each enhancement material. This means, previously, multiple Adjustment Control Axis could be simultaneously created; now, when it comes to Adjustment Control Axis, only two can be researched at the same time.</p><p>With the addition of the research quantity selection feature, players can now research up to 500 Adjustment Control Axis at a time. This allows them to conduct more research in one go, reducing the number of visits to Anais. However, the inability to simultaneously conduct multiple research will reduce the amount of enhancement materials that can be acquired in a short period of time.</p><p>While we want to give players new features, we also want to make sure that players in certain situations aren't losing out. As a result, we've shortened the time it takes to research enhancement materials so that despite only doing one research at a time, you'll still acquire a similar amount of enhancement materials as before. We hope this will help players research and utilize enhancement materials more efficiently.</p><p>- Made improvements to display only modules you have in duplicate when combining modules.</p><p>- Increased the number of symbols that can be displayed, when designating them as Attached Items, to 8.</p><p>- Made improvements to allow the ability to set an "Equipment Option" category in "Filter all as junk" for Reactors and External Components in equipment.</p><p>- Changed the display location and design of the random options to improve inventory slots. Removed displays for the Reactor's attributes/Arche type and fixed the display for External Components set effects.</p><p>- The Reactor icon has changed so that it now varies, depending on the Arche type.</p><p>- Changed some External Component icons to differentiate their appearance based on their DEF, Shield, and HP stats.</p><p># Director's Comment</p><p>Previously, in Update 1.0.7, we added information for random options, Arche type of Reactors, and External Component sets for item icons. The feedback we received was, that players were distracted, as there was too much information included. Based on this, we've made improvements so that the icon information is presented in a cleaner, more organized way. Dev Team will continue to listen to the valuable feedback given by community and players as we continue to make improvements to the game.</p><p>- Schematized the "Amount of Owned Equipment" tooltip in inventory.</p><p>- Significantly increased the quantity of Shape Stabilizer you own.</p><p>- Improved the map to show the location of records needed to be found when progressing Descendant related quests.</p><p>- Made improvements by adding a Tracking On tab when researching, making it easier to view the tracked target.</p><p>- Improved the Intercept Battle screen to display the number of Linked Amorphous Materials players have at each Intercept Battle.</p><p>- Improved the ability to view "Mission Details" through the mission tooltip on the map.</p><p>- Improved the display of the red dot when there are unacquired Battle Pass items.</p><p>- Improved the ability to purchase a one-time, large quantity of enhancement materials at the shop.</p><p>- Improved the ability to preview each component of a bundled product without moving the screen.</p><p>- Improved the ability to view each Evolution Stage of an evolving skin in the shop.</p><p>- [Console] Added attributes and Arche keywords, by type, to the Descendant and Weapon Module screens, making it easier to find modules on console platforms as well.</p><p>(3) Descendants</p><p>- Jayber</p><p>„Ñ¥ Fixed an issue where some stats were not reflected in Jayber"s "Turret."</p><p>Skill Power Modifier, Additional ATK for skills when attacking Colossus/Legion of Darkness/Order of Truth/Legion of Immortality, Incoming Damage Modifier</p><p>„Ñ¥ Improved Jayber's "Turret Sync" effect to apply to summoned turrets.</p><p>„Ñ¥ When equipping skill module "Turret Engineering," instead of improving summoned turrets to create a "Turret Zone," increased cooldown of "Turret Engineering."</p><p>- Blair</p><p>„Ñ¥ Improved Blair's "Pitmaster" Skill so it now increases the Critical Hit Rate by the number of "Flame Zones" he has, up to a maximum of 5.</p><p>„Ñ¥ Increased Blair's "Flame Zone" Skill DMG.</p><p>„Ñ¥ Increased the DMG dealt by Blair's "Burn" Skill effect.</p><p>„Ñ¥ Made changes so that Blair's "Extinguish" Skill no longer retrieves "Flame Zones."</p><p>„Ñ¥ Improved "Taste of Aggression" effect to stack for the "Extinguish" Skill.</p><p>„Ñ¥ Improved the MP Heal per "Flame Zone" from the "Taste of Aggression" and "Power of Fire" effects to be proportional to Blair's Max MP.</p><p>„Ñ¥ Increased the maximum amount of "Flame Zones" that can be absorbed through the "Extinguish" Skill.</p><p>„Ñ¥ Increased the duration of the "Blaze Up" Skill, reducing its MP cost.</p><p>„Ñ¥ Improved the "Burn Taste" Skill so that the skill can be halted when pressing the button during use.</p><p>‚Ä¢ Increased skill DMG of the "Burn Taste" skill and improved it to be affected by duration-related modules.</p><p>‚Ä¢ Increased the Max Stack when equipping the "Incendiary Bomb" skill module, and reduced MP cost.</p><p>‚Ä¢ Increased the number of "Small Fireballs" for the "Deadly Cuisine" skill when the "Classic Chef" skill module is equipped, and increased the effect of the "Pitmaster" skill based on the Flame Zone count.</p><p>- Ajax</p><p>‚Ä¢ Improved Ajax's "Orbit Barrier" and "Hyper Cube" barrier to be affected by attribute resistances, and increased the barriers' HP and DEF ratios.</p><p>‚Ä¢ Increased the ratios of barrier-related stats when the "Life Barrier" and "Void Barrier" skill modules are equipped.</p><p>‚Ä¢ Fixed an issue with continuously recovering shield for "Void Walk" and "Matrix Recomputation" skills and increased the Max Shield Up ratio.</p><p>‚Ä¢ Improved the "Void Walk" skill to have faster motion transitions when used while enhanced.</p><p>‚Ä¢ Modified the "Body Enhancement" skill to increase HP, DEF, and Shield, and improved it to grant 100% Void Energy when used, but increased the Cooldown and Skill Cost.</p><p>‚Ä¢ Changed the "Void Walk" skill so that it can be stacked when the "Void Charge" skill module is equipped, and increased the damage dealt proportional to DEF when using the "Void Walk" and "Expulsion" skills.</p><p>‚Ä¢ Improved "Void Charge" to restore "Void Walk" stacks and reset the Cooldown of "Expulsion" when used while enhanced.</p><p># Director's Comment</p><p>In this update, we've made balance adjustments to Ajax, Blair, and Jayber.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/-a-rising-tide-floats-all-boats-xbox-on-the-universal-benefits-of-accessible-design<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Around six years ago, Xbox took a leap of faith. The company unveiled the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2018/05/16/xbox-adaptive-controller/">Xbox Adaptive Controller</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a new type of gamepad that defied traditional design conventions in service of a singular mission: make video games accessible to all.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The console maker has devoted itself to that goal in the subsequent years, rolling out new accessibility options for its video game software, bringing external developers into the fold so they can test their own accessibility features, waiving the licensing fee for accessible hardware developed through its 'Designed for Xbox' program, and building entirely new devices such as the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/console/microsoft-unveils-new-accessibility-hardware-including-xbox-adaptive-thumbstick">Xbox Adaptive Joystick</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Discussing those initiatives with Game Developer at Gamescom 2024, Xbox senior accessibility product manager Kaitlyn Jones and principal designer Chris Kujawski explain the benefits of accessible design‚Äìwhether you're talking about hardware of software‚Äìare profound but can often be easy to miss.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We define accessibility as 'ensuring that anybody who wants to be able to use or play can do so.' It can mean a lot of different things [...] so it does vary, but our general philosophy is that a 'rising tide floats all boats.' When it comes to accessibility, we don't compete. We just want anyone to play regardless of the title or platform," says Jones.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Collaboration a &quot;core part&quot; of Xbox's accessible design process">Collaboration a "core part" of Xbox's accessible design process</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In practice, Microsoft applies that philosophy by working directly with disabled players. Kujawski explains there's a saying within that community: "nothing about us, without us." That, he says, influences every decision Xbox makes.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's why, for example, the company took a myriad of Xbox Adaptive Joystick prototypes to a hospital in Seattle so they could be put through the wringer. The team have to understand use-cases that might not be immediately apparent. In this instance, that testing slalom highlighted the need for the Joystick to be mountable on solid surfaces, allowing it to be used by people who might not be able to hold it in their hand.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We are not designing something and then handing it over," adds Kujawski. "It's a co-design process. So throughout the process there are many different checkpoints and many different departments‚Äìwhether that's individuals or charities or hospitals.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The team has built a huge network where folks can get feedback from, so that's a very core part of the design process. In addition to that, the halo effect [of our work] has meant that accessibility has become a part of our game design process. We don't make products now without doing an accessibility check."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those checks means Xbox now strives to make everything down to the cardboard boxes that house its consoles accessible. No detail is too small, and no compromise is too big.&nbsp;</span></p><p>The Xbox Adaptive Controller debuted in 2018</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That wasn't always the case. Kujawski explains each new accessibility concept has to be pitched up the chain. The team has a fluctuating roadmap of products that are "always competing for space," and will often cook up experimental 'proof-of-concept' projects before entering the pitching room.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"[Pitching] has gotten easier since the Adaptive Controller," says Kujawski. "There's more of a pull. [The Adaptive Controller] wasn't a hard sell, necessarily, but there was a lot of explaining to do. Because leadership gets pitched ideas all of the time, so at the beginning it's just one of many. But because of the unique nature of [our projects] and the match to Microsoft's mission, it has become easier."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Jones adds there's now a "better understanding" internally about how accessibility can have a positive impact on an entire playerbase. "For example, our co-pilot feature, [now called] '</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://support.xbox.com/en-GB/help/account-profile/accessibility/copilot">Xbox Controller Assist</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">,' was pitched to leadership as something that would allow a parent and a child that was just learning to game to be able to play together," she continues.&nbsp; "Now we know it's also a really fantastic accessibility feature, so I think discussing those alternative use cases that just make experiences more viable for anyone is really important."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Notably, Jones says there's never any pressure on the accessibility team to "sell a certain number of units," although pricing is very much a consideration. "What we do want to do is ensure that product is as low cost as possible," she adds. For example, in a bid to keep costs down for consumers, Xbox chose to make its Adaptive Joystick wired instead of wireless.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"[That way] we don't have to pay for battery," says Kujawski. "It also makes it lighter. There have been other joysticks on the market like this, that are hardwired to USB. With those, you have one length of cable. We ship with a two meter cable but we made it removable on purpose, so if you're playing right next to the Xbox Adaptive Controller you can switch that out. We're always making those trade-off and asking 'what gives us the most flexibility, what helps us with cost, and what expands the reach of the products?.'"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Building products that are accessible, flexible, and affordable is evidently paramount. But what about products that last? Kujawski reiterates that Xbox is in this for the long haul. That means it won't be refreshing its slate of accessibility hardware on a whim. These are devices built to transcend console generations (and whatever comes beyond). "We would definitely get a lot of negative feedback if, say next generation, this [device roster] doesn't work," he adds. "That's a real bad look and it's just a bad policy. The longevity of it is super important."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/community/for-everyone/accessibility">You can learn more about Xbox's range of accessibility tools and hardware on Xbox Wire</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

            <p>Back in March, Bungie <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-replace-marathon-director-amid-reports-of-creative-leadership-shake-up">announced a leadership reshuffle</a> on their Marathon reboot project, with former Valorant dev Joe Ziegler replacing veteran Bungie designer Christopher Barrett as director. It seems there was more to that story than concern about the progress of Marathon. According to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-28/-marathon-video-game-director-barrett-was-ousted-over-inappropriate-behavior">new Bloomberg report</a> citing anonymous sources, Barrett was in fact fired this spring after he was accused by several female Bungie staff of inappropriate behaviour.</p> <!--more-->
<p>What does "inappropriate behaviour" mean? According to two of Bloomberg's sources, it means unwanted comments upon the appearance of lower-level employees, requests to hang out together, suggestions that he could use his wealth and power to advance their careers, and invitations to play truth-or-dare.</p>
<p>According to Bloomberg's sources, Barrett would befriend women in various Bungie departments and bombard them with text messages which, the site says, "blurred the lines between professional and personal". Several people interviewed described Barrett's advances as unwanted, and said that they felt uncomfortable given Barrett's greater seniority at Bungie. Bloomberg have reviewed some of the text messages in question, but aren't sharing details to avoid exposing their recipients. </p>
<p>Bloomberg claims that Barrett was eventually let go following an internal investigation in which at least eight women raised complaints about him. That last bit is according to eight sources, including both some of the women who reported Barrett and others who were involved with the investigation or spoke to the women who raised complaints. Barrett's departure was kept quiet: certain Bungie staff apparently thought that he had gone on sabbatical, but then discovered that his company accounts had been disabled.</p>
<p>In a statement to Bloomberg, Barrett both pushed back against the claims and apologised for his behaviour. "I feel that I have always conducted myself with integrity and been respectful and supportive of my colleagues, many of whom I consider my closest friends," he wrote. "I never understood my communications to be unwanted and I would have never thought they could possibly have made anyone feel uncomfortable. If anyone ever felt that way about their interaction with me, I am truly sorry."</p>
<p>Bungie parent Sony Interactive Entertainment, meanwhile, have told Bloomberg that they take "all complaints of misconduct very seriously" and that "it is our policy and practice to investigate every complaint promptly and take action based on the findings of our investigation", without commenting on Barrett's case in particular.</p>
<p>It's not clear how far back Barrett's alleged misbehaviour goes, but this isn't the first time we've heard about predatory behaviour at Bungie. Back in 2021, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-report-battle-soul-work-culture-harassment-crunch">IGN</a> published an extensive report on life at the Destiny studio, citing 26 current and former staff. Those interviewed shared experiences of "overt sexism, boys' club culture, crunch, and HR protection of abusers, as well as more complex stories of microaggressions, systemic inequalities, and difficulties in being heard".</p>
<p>The news about Barrett comes as Bungie "reposition" for an uncertain future, following what leaders have described as a period of "overly ambitious" expansion and "misfires" in a time of general economic precarity. The studio recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/destiny-creators-bungie-lay-off-220-people-and-form-new-studio-within-sony-to-stave-off-financial-ruin">laid off hundreds of people and formed a new studio within Sony</a> to shore up their finances.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>News for Bungie continues to be bleak, especially for Marathon, the upcoming PvP extraction shooter set in the sci-fi franchise created in the 1990s.</p>
<p>A few hours ago, Jason Schreier <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-28/-marathon-video-game-director-barrett-was-ousted-over-inappropriate-behavior?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTcyNDg2NDU0OCwiZXhwIjoxNzI1NDY5MzQ4LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTSVhUWktEV0xVNjgwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.lJDK2mJTGM2v8mjO2siujiOigS68jyckaTagfGlXp_A" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> a story on Bloomberg to reveal why Game Director Christopher Barrett was <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-directed-valorant-director/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">replaced</a> earlier this year by former Valorant Game Director Joe Ziegler. According to Schreier's sources, Barrett was fired following a misconduct investigation prompted by at least eight female employees reporting inappropriate behavior from the Game Director.</p>
<p>The investigation verified that Barrett made advances and suggested that, thanks to his power within Bungie, he could help advance the female employees' careers. Schreier also shared a statement from Barrett:</p>
<p><em>I feel that I have always conducted myself with integrity and been respectful and supportive of my colleagues, many of whom I consider my closest friends. I never understood my communications to be unwanted and I would have never thought they could possibly have made anyone feel uncomfortable. If anyone ever felt that way about their interaction with me, I am truly sorry.</em></p>
<p>Interestingly, other Bungie employees weren't initially told of the circumstances of Barrett's departure. They were led to believe that he was on a sabbatical year, but that wasn't actually the case.</p>
<p>While this is just a single person leaving the Marathon team, there's more problems bubbling under the surface, at least according to insider Tom Henderson, who <a href="https://twitter.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/1828872921168916612?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1828872921168916612%7Ctwgr%5E85321f9de4618fd7479349abb24eabce6358fef8%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.everyeye.it%2Fnotizie%2Fmarathon-spacciato-gioco-bungie-pericolo-secondo-tom-henderson-738593.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted</a> that the game is 'cooked' based on his info. The game was originally meant to launch in 2024, but Bungie <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-is-the-latest-gaming-studio-to-suffer-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delayed</a> it to 2025 alongside the delay of Destiny 2: The Final Shape.</p>
<p>The design of Marathon is ambitious, with the developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-wants-players-actions-to-affect-everyone-in-marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planning</a> to create a world of persistent zones where player actions actually matter and influence everyone else in the game. Perhaps they're having problems executing that high-level vision.</p>

Speaking to Eurogamer at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> with regards to the forthcoming Shadows of the Damned remaster, Mikami discussed the topic of a new Dino Crisis game - it's the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dino-crisis-is-the-series-most-capcom-fans-want-to-see-get-a-new-game">series most Capcom fans want to see make a return</a>, according to a recent survey.

</p>
<p>
Mikami said he was surprised at the fan reaction to Dino Crisis, but it seems the popularity of Monster Hunter has put him off continuing the series.

<p>

"I'm very surprised to hear that," said Mikami in relation to fans wanting more Dino Crisis. "The awesomeness of dinosaurs and the stuff you can do with dinosaurs, that's been kind of really nailed down by Monster Hunter in recent years. 
</p>
<p>
"So even if I were to decide to make a remake or a new version of Dino Crisis, I don't really feel like there's a whole lot of space for that kind of game right now, just since Monster Hunter has become such a big game. But yeah, it is surprising."
</p>
<p>
When Capcom announced <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/exoprimal">Exoprimal</a>, its online dinosaur-inspired shooter, many fans jumped to Dino Crisis, only to be disappointed.
</p>
<p>
"The concept is pretty different from that of Dino Crisis," said Mikami, when I compared the games. "I guess the fans got their expectations up, but here we are."
</p>
<p>
The last game in the series was Dino Crisis 3 released in 2003 and since then it's reached cult classic status. However, there's no official word on any form of remake, remaster, or new game in the series.
</p>
<p>
And, despite rumours, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/looks-like-dino-crisis-ridge-racer-2-and-soulcalibur-are-heading-to-ps-plus-premium">Dino Crisis is yet to appear on PS Plus</a>.
</p>
<p>
Mikami, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-creator-shinji-mikami-left-tango-gameworks-to-break-free-from-survival-horror">left Tango Gameworks</a> ahead of its closure and has opened a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-director-shinji-mikami-founds-new-company">new studio called KAMUY</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/29/marvel-rivals-preview-a-new-better-overwatch/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Last week I managed to get some time with Marvel Rivals, the next big PvP shooter set to (excuse the pun) rival games such as Overwatch and the like. Marvel is obviously a licence to print money and generally, you can slap Marvel branding on anything these days and you know it will do well to some degree. Of course, there‚Äôs an element of burnout as well. People are just a little bit sick of Marvel, because let‚Äôs face it, it‚Äôs everywhere.</p>
<p><iframe title="Marvel Rivals | Stars Aligned - Official Launch Date Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a49DJ2bj9Gs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>NetEase Games doesn‚Äôt care one bit about all that, and has set out to make an actual banger of a third-person PvP shooter. I have to use Overwatch as a comparison because, for all intents and purposes, it‚Äôs Overwatch with a Marvel skin. Well, sort of.</p>
<p>The key difference is the switch-up from first-person to third-person, and to be quite honest, this feels a lot better. Overwatch was littered with fancy skins which you only saw in key moments during gameplay. In Rivals, you get to see them all the time, which, if you‚Äôre spending money to see these skins, is kind of a big deal.</p>
<p>The starting roster is already enjoyably large, with lots of your favourite Marvel characters involved. Some of the more obvious ones such as Iron Man, Hulk and Thor make an appearance, but then you have some not-so-well-known characters make an appearance too which is nice, such as Jeff the Baby Land Shark and Luna Snow.</p>


<p>I must have put about fifteen to twenty hours into Rivals so far and still didn‚Äôt manage to play the whole roster, trying to give ample time to the ones I did try. Surprisingly, despite being a fan of the big green guy, my go-to main quickly became the thunder goddess Storm. Her ability to stay in the air and hurl the elements at enemies from above just appealed to me. And when she drops her ultimate ability, oh man, things get messy. I was regularly dropping at least three to four enemies at a time in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>So yeah, much like Overwatch, ultimate abilities play a big part of matches, with them building up as you play, and then dropping them at key moments to pull back control from the enemy team. Most of them feel very well designed and perfect for the character pulling them off. One of my favourites was Magik, who, when activating her ultimate, transforms into the Darkchylde version of herself, dealing more damage with her attacks and abilities. Hulk‚Äôs ultimate works in a different way and is honestly brilliant. It works in stages; he starts as Banner and can immediately activate his ult from the beginning to ‚ÄòHulk out‚Äô, then, charging the ultimate again lets him Hulk out even further, turning him into Monster Hulk, an even stronger version. During this mode, he gets an ultimate called World Breaker, which sees him do a move on a single enemy which you may have seen in a popular Avengers movie. It‚Äôs truly great!</p>

<p>During the Gamescom beta, NetEase threw two new characters into the mix, Captain America and the Winter Soldier. Cap felt as he should, quite defensive and a great support for the team. One of the games I had with him saw our team hold the enemy at their spawn point. Maybe we got lucky, but I felt Cap‚Äôs leadership skills helped. Winter Soldier on the other hand feels very strong. A little too strong at the moment. His ultimate has the chance to trigger multiple times and feels very oppressive. I‚Äôm not too worried about this now as there‚Äôs just over three months to release so he can be adjusted by then, but if he does release in that state‚Ä¶ We are all in trouble.</p>
<p>He‚Äôs not the only character that needs adjusting as some do feel like auto-inclusions in team lineups and it would be nice to see a bit more variety. I lost account of the amount of Venoms and Doctor Stranges I would see on opposing teams.</p>
<p>As for the game modes, well, you‚Äôd be forgiven for thinking that you are playing Overwatch. It‚Äôs pretty egregious, but I‚Äôll be honest, they pull it off well. It‚Äôs unapologetically similar, but it works so well and dare I say it, is done better here. Of course, it could use a little tuning to make sure things like the Overtime mechanic don‚Äôt last for ages but aside from that, it‚Äôs pretty much there.</p>

<p>The other big question on everyone‚Äôs lips is how will this game be monetized? Right now we don‚Äôt know. A battle pass system was put in place during both betas letting you unlock new cool skins for characters. Blizzard have been very aggressive with their monetisation to the point where the fan base has had enough. Corporate greed won the battle over at Blizzard and now players are being charged ¬£20 and upwards for skins for their favourite heroes.</p>
<p>Nothing has been announced yet for Marvel Rivals but my fingers are crossed that NetEase doesn‚Äôt get too greedy, because Rivals has the potential to be amazing and bad monetisation practices have the potential to ruin the experience. Time will tell, but as always, I‚Äôll remain hopeful.</p>
<p>Right now, Marvel Rivals has the potential to take up a lot of my time. I‚Äôm gagging to play more and the 6th of December cannot come soon enough.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-changes-black-ops-6/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Activision recently hosted Call of Duty NEXT, the showcase designed to present the future of the COD ecosystem. During the show, countless changes were revealed to be coming to Warzone in the next few months, with a pivotal makeover taking place when Black Ops 6 is released at the end of October.</p>



<p>The team revealed a new small-form map, Area 99, and they confirmed that in 2025, Verdansk will make a return as a large-scale map, but elsewhere, some sizeable changes are in the pipeline.</p>



<p>Read on to learn about everything changing in Warzone soon.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-refreshing">Refreshing</h2>



<p>Area 99 promises to be an exciting, fast-paced map for those who love a bit of Resurgence. It‚Äôs an ‚Äòatomic-themed‚Äô map centred around a nuclear power plant, which links it quite nicely with Black Ops‚Äô Nuketown map. </p>



<p>When Black Ops 6 is released on October 25, Warzone will prepare to receive a stack of updates, including the adoption of the new ‚ÄòOmnimovement‚Äô mechanics being introduced with the next iteration of the Black Ops series. As you‚Äôd expect, every weapon and most of the equipment from Black Ops 6 will also be brought into Warzone.</p>



<p>With the ‚ÄòCarry Forward‚Äô mechanism applying this time around, Activision‚Äôs teams will be porting almost every weapon from MWII and MWIII into the newest version of Warzone. </p>



<p>On the topic of weapons, players will now be able to carry a melee weapon into Warzone as a third selection. When it comes to Perks, users will be able to pick three Perks that they drop into the Warzone with, as well as a ‚ÄòWildcard‚Äô, which hasn‚Äôt been seen in the Call of Duty ecosystem for several years. It‚Äôs the first time Wildcards will be available in Warzone‚Äôs five-year history.</p>



<p>For completionists, Activision will be stacking up the challenges in Warzone. This will give players something to grind for, and the assortment of challenges will include weapon mastery tasks, reticle challenges, and ‚ÄòDark Ops Calling Card‚Äô challenges, the nature of which is being kept under wraps.</p>



<h2 id="h-but-there-s-more">But There‚Äôs More</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>It doesn‚Äôt end there.</p>



<p>Raven Software revealed that the backpack mechanic is being stripped from the game and that the inventory management function is going back to basics. Everything from money to your armour plates will be kept in an easily accessible menu that makes cumbersome backpacks a thing of the past.</p>



<p>Satchels are making a return, though. When you pick them up, you‚Äôll either boost your armour plate storage <strong>or </strong>your ammunition capacity.</p>



<p>Raven has also tweaked many of the in-game mechanics tied to movement and quality-of-life features. For instance, using ziplines and ascenders has been made much more streamlined, and live ping duration has been decreased to stop the markers from obscuring your vision. </p>



<p>Finally, it was confirmed that when the first season of Black Ops 6 and Warzone arrives later this year, it‚Äôll bring with it Battle Royale Ranked Play, which is good news for the more competitive players on the platform.</p>

<p>Activision has announced the grand return of Verdansk to Call of Duty: Warzone. It‚Äôll arrive in the game in just a few months, making a reappearance more than three years after it was last seen on the platform. It might have popped back up in Warzone Mobile, but let‚Äôs face it, it wasn‚Äôt ever <strong>the same</strong>.</p>



<p>Verdansk is where it all began for every Warzone player. In 2020, it served as the first Warzone map, and it became an instantly recognisable environment for tens of millions of players pouring onto the battle royale platform.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-return-of-the-king">Return of the King</h2>



<p>In 2025, Verdansk is coming back to Warzone, but there are still a lot of unknowns up in the air.</p>



<p>It‚Äôs unclear what ‚Äòform‚Äô Verdansk will take. The general assumption is that it won‚Äôt look like the ‚ÄòOG‚Äô Verdansk map, but nobody can say what evolution it may have undergone over the last three-and-something years. When it was the defining Warzone map, it underwent a few changes, including a facelift (and a time travel sequence of sorts) for Black Ops Cold War.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>All Activision has shown so far is an outline of the region. It was enough to spark intense excitement within the community, though. Verdansk has an iron-like grip around the nostalgia centres of millions of gamers worldwide. It‚Äôs where we lived out the COVID-19-induced lockdowns of 2020 and beyond. In Verdansk, we made friends and enemies, and for some of us, we made <strong>a name </strong>for ourselves.</p>



<p>It‚Äôs a side note, but I fell in love with Verdansk and Warzone so hard that I secured a Guinness World Record for the longest battle royale marathon, going the distance on the map and entering the history books. My name is still against that record and I was the first person in history to secure it.</p>



<p>Are you excited about the return of Verdansk in Warzone?</p>

Artichoke seeds aren't sold until year 2 and grapes are grown on trellis, making those slightly more difficult options. Sweet Gem Berries are the most valuable crop, but the seeds are sold individually at the Traveling Cart, so it would take several in-game years of continuously growing them and turning them into seeds to have a full field's worth.</p><p dir="ltr">If you <span>want to complete the community center bundles to unlock the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stardew-valley-how-to-unlock-the-greenhouse/1100-6524916/">Greenhouse</a>, you will need to grow some less valuable crops, like corn. Corn continuously produces, but it's really only worth growing if it's done at</span> the beginning of summer.</p><p dir="ltr">Cranberries are the easiest crop to go for, since the plants continue to produce all season long, so you don't have to worry about replanting at any point.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/preserving-the-past-with-charles-cecil-game-developer-podcast-ep-46<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite existing in one form or another since the early 80s, people still have room in their hearts for a good ol‚Äô fashioned point-and-click adventure game. In fact, some folk (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>cough </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">zoomers </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>cough</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">) are just now learning how rewarding it can be to patiently peruse a plethora of pixels in hopes of finding the precise one that matters, or how frustrating it can be to come to grips with the developers‚Äô unique interpretation of human logic.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To learn more about bridging this generational gamer gap, Editor in Chief Danielle Riendeau sat down with adventure game designer and Revolution Software co-founder Charles Cecil to discuss Revolution‚Äôs forthcoming 4K remake of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2544110/Broken_Sword__Shadow_of_the_Templars_Reforged/">Broken Sword - Shadow of the Templars</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Produced by Jordan Mallory and with music by Mike Meehan, this is episode 46 of the Game Developer Podcast.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As was the case 30+ years ago, adventure game designers in 2024 must walk a bit of a tightrope when it comes to difficulty management. Cecil‚Äôs approach is to provide hints when necessary, but be sparing. Too little help and you risk frustrating the player, but too much and you rob them and their all-important sense of accomplishment.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">‚ÄúIt would be better to provide these little hints too infrequently than too frequently, because if a player is close to a solution, and they‚Äôre really excited by the fact that they‚Äôve worked [it] out, and then we give you a hint ‚Äì they‚Äôre going to find that very, very frustrating,‚Äù Cecil explains. ‚ÄúUltimately, people play these story games and they feel smart because they‚Äôre the ones driving the whole thing forward.‚Äù</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For Cecil, writing that player-driven story is a separate but symbiotic process from designing the various puzzles that ultimately underpin the experience.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">‚ÄúI‚Äôll come up with a two or three page story,‚Äù Cecil says, ‚Äúwhich obviously imagines how the gameplay can fit into that, and then in parallel, I will start designing the puzzles.‚Äù And while these two halves of the project ‚Äústay as separate documents,‚Äù they are also in constant conversation with each other as ‚Äúthe story is always affected and is complemented by the puzzles. ‚Ä¶ We'll be looking for great moments where the story and the puzzles come together in some sort of climactic moment.‚Äù</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the specific case of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Broken Sword - Shadow of the Templars: Reforged</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, not only does the remake provide a chance for younger players to experience the magic of the 90s computer classic, it also gives Cecil a chance to right the wrongs of the past.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">‚ÄúIn [a] particular scene, something that‚Äôs irritated me for nearly 30 years is that there is a drainpipe,‚Äù Cecil says. If the player decides to yank on the pipe, ‚Äúit comes away from the wall, and [the protagonist] says ‚ÄòWell, the clown didn‚Äôt escape that way.‚Äô‚Äù But in the original 1996 artwork for this scene, the pipe isn‚Äôt actually connected to anything, which means that the clown </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>obviously</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> couldn‚Äôt have used it to escape, even if he somehow fit inside.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really irritated me for so long, so I go to the artist: ‚ÄòPlease, just make me happy. Just draw the drainpipe so it looks like it goes up, beyond the top of the screen.‚Äô There are so many little things like that.‚Äù</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You too can experience the delight of finally finding the right pixel when </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Broken Sword - Shadow of the Templars: Reforged</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> launches on September 18. In the meantime, we recommend you listen to our charming little podcast, and then check what‚Äôs going on with the similarly forthcoming </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://showcase.gdconf.com/">GDC Showcase</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Editor-in-Chief, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Danielle is the editor-in-chief of Game Developer, with previous editorial posts at Fanbyte, VICE, and Polygon.

You can see everything the Call of Duty team had to show below, but don‚Äôt forget to keep checking in with IGN for any updates ahead of launch this fall.</p><h2>Verdansk is (finally) returning to Warzone</h2><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Run it back. Verdansk will return to Call of Duty <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Warzone?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Warzone</a> in 2025 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CODNext?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#CODNext</a> <a href="https://t.co/Y70gnYl2If" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Y70gnYl2If</a></p>‚Äî Call of Duty (@CallofDuty) <a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/1828873802551271432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 28, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>That‚Äôs right - Verdansk, the first Warzone map and the location that gripped millions back in 2020, will make its triumphant <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/verdansk-is-finally-returning-to-call-of-duty-warzone-and-fans-are-delighted"><u>return to Call of Duty players on PC and console in spring 2025</u></a>. It‚Äôs been three years since iconic locations like Stadium and Superstore left Activision‚Äôs battle royale mode, but we won‚Äôt have to wait much longer to visit them once again. It had to happen eventually, right?</p><h2>Black Ops 6 launch and beta multiplayer maps confirmed</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/28/bo6-cod-next-02-mp-002-1724887914477.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>All 16 launch maps coming to Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. Image courtesy of Activision.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Black Ops 6 is bringing in eight new maps for players to enjoy during the upcoming beta: Derelict, Rewind, Scud, Skyline, Gala, Pit, Stakeout (weekend 2), and Babylon (weekend 2). Protocol will also be available during this time as a training map but will also be playable at launch in October. We also have confirmation for the remaining maps, which include Lowtown, Payback, Red Card, Subsonic, Vault, Vorkuta, and Sand House.</p><h2>Every Zombies map will feature a Main Quest for players to complete</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Upgrading Wonder Weapons to mow down endless waves of zombies is fun, but the developers at Treyarch are upping the ante with new Main Quests to keep players moving through each twisted map. Every map included in Black Ops 6 will feature a different multi-stage Main Quest to complete, and in a <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/08/call-of-duty-next-black-ops-6-reveal-zombies-liberty-falls-showcase-intel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>blog post</u></a>, the team says they are ‚Äúas involved and difficult as they are entertaining.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúFor veteran Zombies players, and those newer players dedicated enough to drop in and scour the maps to solve clues and secrets," the post adds, "expect to be recompensed with unique and limited-time rewards. We can‚Äôt wait to witness the launch weekend hunts to completion!‚Äù</p><h2>New Black Ops 6 multiplayer mode Kill Order revealed</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/28/black-ops-6-kill-order-1724888458626.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Kill Order is coming to Black Ops 6 multiplayer. Image courtesy of Activision.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Every new Call of Duty game tends to introduce new modes to enjoy, and Black Ops 6 is no different. One of the multiplayer offerings set to arrive this fall is called Kill Order, a 6v6 battle where each team is tasked with keeping a high-value target (HVT) alive. With respawns enabled, every kill grants points, but taking out the HVT will get your team that much closer to victory. Activision also revealed a variation of the mode called Face Off Kill Order, which maintains the rules but turns off Scorestreaks and keeps the fight to closer-quarters Strike maps.</p><h2>Black Ops 6 zombies‚Äô Liberty Falls revealed as second launch map</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>New zombies means new maps, and it all starts with a small West Virginia town called Liberty Falls. Activision describes its new location as a ‚Äúonce-idyllic, now horrific‚Äù medium-sized map that has become taken over by an undead threat.</p><p>An <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/08/call-of-duty-next-black-ops-6-reveal-zombies-liberty-falls-showcase-intel#tormented" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>official blog post</u></a> describes Liberty Falls further: ‚ÄúBy the time you arrive ‚Äì assumed to be part of the Project Janus forces under the watchful eye of Security Chief John Blanchard ‚Äì the town is overrun, and the battle seems well and truly lost.‚Äù</p><h2>Sprays and emotes are back</h2><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sprays and Emotes return to Call of Duty: Warzone in Season 1 of Black Ops 6.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CODNext?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#CODNext</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackOps6?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#BlackOps6</a> <a href="https://t.co/J1Z5NTumrN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/J1Z5NTumrN</a></p>‚Äî Call of Duty (@CallofDuty) <a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/1828873955697914208?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 28, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Black Ops 6 will see the return of in-game sprays and emotes that can be used to taunt other players mid-match or, if you‚Äôre creative, toy with your enemies. Details about how many sprays and emotes will be available is a mystery, but it looks like players can at least expect classic taunts like clapping, giving a thumbs down, and more to make appearances.</p><h2>Area 99 revealed as the next Warzone map</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>While Verdansk promises a blast from Call of Duty‚Äôs past, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-warzones-next-map-is-area-99-the-birthplace-of-nuketown"><u>Area 99 will take Warzone into the future in Season 1</u></a>. This Resurgence map has been called ‚Äúthe birthplace of Nuketown‚Äù and features a worn-down aesthetic polluted with mannequins and other retro-themed buildings. Each point of interest takes players to a new area that should feel familiar to those who have visited Nuketown for themselves, and you can expect to explore it for yourself sometime soon after Black Ops 6 launches in October.</p><h2>Prestige progression returns to multiplayer, zombies, and Warzone</h2><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>TRADITIONAL PRESTIGE ARRIVES IN CALL OF DUTY: WARZONE</p><p>Players who reach level 55 in Warzone will be presented with a choice to enter Prestige to unlock new rewards. Account progression will be updated as part of Season 1. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CODNext?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#CODNext</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackOps6?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#BlackOps6</a></p></div>‚Äî Call of Duty (@CallofDuty) <a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/1828871369422967029?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 28, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Old-school Call of Duty fans will remember the Prestige system, which allows players to continue earning rewards even after they reach each season‚Äôs level cap. There will be 10 levels of Prestige to reach, with each said to be inspired by past Call of Duty: Black Ops titles. Activision calls the new and improved mechanic ‚Äúthe most rewarding Prestige system ever‚Äù in Black Ops history, promising a lot of content to unlock in <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/08/call-of-duty-next-black-ops-6-reveal-global-systems-key-innovations-announcement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>an official blog post</u></a>. Expect Prestige to launch with multiplayer and zombies and with Warzone in Season 1.</p><h2>New Black Ops, new gameplay</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>While excitement for things like omnimovement grows, the developers behind Call of Duty took the time at COD: Next to detail some of the other changes coming to the formula this fall. Time to kill (TTK) will be a bit faster than players remember from Black Ops Cold War, for example, and while enemy health bars are a thing of the past, you‚Äôll be able to see your character‚Äôs health bar on your HUD if you‚Äôd like. Slide canceling and audio improvements were also promised, but you can also look forward to features like map voting and more.</p><h2>Black Ops 6 Wonder Weapons reveal new and returning guns</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/28/bo6-cod-next-03-zm-010-1724887920863.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The Thrustodyne Model 23 makes its debut in Liberty Falls. Image courtesy of Activision.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Wonder Weapons are a zombies staple, so it should be no surprise to see that the Ray Gun is back and better looking than ever. The small, handy tools has been given a visual upgrade this time around, and it‚Äôll still pack a punch on every map if you manage to acquire it. The Thrustodyne Model 23, meanwhile, is Black Ops 6‚Äôs new weapon. You‚Äôll be able to find and use it to suck up zombies exclusively on Liberty Falls.</p><h2>Warzone will feature Carry Forward Content from past Call of Duty games</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/03/16/warzonemobileign1-1710576086840.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Enjoy cosmetics from previous Call of Duty games as Warzone continues.</figcaption></figure></output><p>COD: Next brought the confirmation that, as Warzone evolves, it will continue to support weapons, blueprints, Operators, Skins, and ‚Äúthe vast majority of the cosmetics‚Äù from games like Modern Warfare 2 and Modern Warfare 3. With this comes the promise of full integration with everything yet to come with Black Ops 6. In other words, Warzone is only getting bigger and shows no sign of stopping anytime soon.</p><h2>Ranked multiplayer arrives just weeks after launch</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Like other recent entries in the Call of Duty franchise, Black Ops 6 will be receiving a Ranked mode for those looking for their competitive fix. While Ranked has sometimes taken a while to launch in the past, Activision promises that the mode will release with Season 1, just weeks after launch this October.</p><h2>Someone already launched a nuke in Black Ops 6</h2><blockquote data-theme="light">‚Äî Treyarch Studios (@Treyarch) <a href="https://twitter.com/Treyarch/status/1828847893761142939?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 28, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Black Ops 6 doesn‚Äôt come out until October 25, and its closed beta won‚Äôt launch for another few days. That didn‚Äôt stop streamer JustHazzardous from securing and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/world-first-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-nuke-achieved-before-the-beta-even-launches"><u>activating an in-game nuke at COD: Next</u></a>. The requirements for a nuke in this year‚Äôs Call of Duty installment haven‚Äôt even been revealed yet, so while this doesn‚Äôt necessarily qualify as a COD: Next reveal, it‚Äôs still undeniably impressive and a good look at what's to come.</p><h2>Black Ops 6 beta rewards reveal new goodies for early players</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/28/bo6-cod-next-02-mp-042-1724887923793.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Black Ops 6 beta rewards revealed. Image courtesy of Activision.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Those who participate in the Black Ops 6 beta tests will have the opportunity to earn cosmetic rewards that they can carry into launch. Highlights include Squish and Squash Operator skin unlocks at level 20, as well as a Quick Draw emote that can be acquired at level 15. Getting to at least level 2 nets players an animated beta tester emblem.</p><p><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

                <p>At long last, the real star of SpongeBob SquarePants--pun fully intended--is getting a chance to shine. The Patrick Star video game was officially revealed this week and is coming to Nintendo Switch, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. As you might have guessed from the game's title, it stars Patrick in his very own adventure. <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1852087586275014526%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fspongebob-squarepants-the-patrick-star-video-game-preorders%2F1100-6526144%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Preorders are now live</a> for the game ahead of its October 4 release, including a special steelbook edition for Nintendo Switch and a standard edition available on PlayStation and Xbox.</p><div title="6526144 - Patrick Star video game steelbook preorder" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="2620" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6526144 - Patrick Star video game steelbook preorder" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://shop-links.co/1851969304830773460?u1=subid_value" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/shop-links.co\/1851969304830773460?u1=subid_value\n&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://shop-links.co/1851969304830773460?u1=subid_value ">Preorder SpongeBob SquarePants: The Patrick Star Video Game Steelbook Edition (Nintendo Switch exclusive)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://shop-links.co/1851969304830773460?u1=subid_value" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/shop-links.co\/1851969304830773460?u1=subid_value\n&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://shop-links.co/1851969304830773460?u1=subid_value ">$50</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>Nintendo Switch players can grab SpongeBob SquarePants: The Patrick Star Video Game in a special steelbook edition.

As the optimistic sea critter with an unstoppable appetite, you'll get to explore Bikini Bottom and unleash some mayhem in your wake. Famous locations like the Krusty Krab and Glove World can be visited, and the game is described as an open-world adventure full of challenges, treasure, and familiar faces. Yes, it's pretty much a fusion of SpongeBob SquarePants and Goat Simulator, which sounds like a solid recipe for fun.</p><h2>More SpongeBob deals and preorders</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4358827-spongebob.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4358827" data-ratio="0.552" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4358827-spongebob.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4358827"></a><figcaption>SpongeBob Squarepants: The Movie 4K Steelbook Edition</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4358827-spongebob.jpg"></figure><p>Something that will pair very nicely with Patrick's video game is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3Q53RCK?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">recently released Blu-ray of the very first SpongeBob movie</a>, which you can pick up at Amazon for $31 (normally $35). This 4K version of the animated classic features a steelbook cover that's basically a replica of SpongeBob, and could make a nice partner piece to the Patrick Star Video Game Steelbook edition on Switch. You're also getting a ton of extra content, like a documentary on how the film was made, music videos, featurettes, and more. And if you're looking for even more SpongeBob, you can preorder<a href="https://www.amazon.com/SpongeBob-SquarePants-Another-100-Episodes/dp/B0DB78SBPW?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> collections of the TV show in 100</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SpongeBob-SquarePants-Best-Episodes-Ever/dp/B0DB7FXLXF?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">300-episode DVD box sets</a>, both of which launch on October 15.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3Q53RCK?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SpongeBob Squarepants: The Movie 4K Steelbook Edition</a> -- $31 (<del>$35</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SpongeBob-SquarePants-Best-Episodes-Ever/dp/B0DB7FXLXF?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SpongeBob Squarepants: The Best 300 Episodes Ever (DVD)</a> -- $60 | Preorder, launches October 15</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SpongeBob-SquarePants-Another-100-Episodes/dp/B0DB78SBPW?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SpongeBob Squarepants: Another 100 Episodes (DVD)</a> -- $33 | Preorder, launches October 15</li></ul><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/astro-bot-ps5-dualsense-controller-preorder/1100-6525376/">Preorder Astro Bot And Limited-Edition DualSense Controller With This Bundle Deal</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-the-skywalker-saga-complete-digital-collection-is-only-20-at-amazon/1100-6526122/">Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga Complete Digital Collection Is Only $20 At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-atari-2600-gets-huge-price-cut-at-best-buy/1100-6520830/">Lego Atari 2600 Gets Huge Price Cut At Best Buy</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-preorder-guide/1100-6522523/">Star Wars Outlaws Preorders - Where To Find The Best Bonuses</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/buy-two-get-one-free-nintendo-switch-games-and-preorders-my-best-buy-members/1100-6525928/">B2G1 Free All Nintendo Switch Games - Zelda: Echoes Of Wisdom, Mario &amp; Luigi, And More Preorders</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-preorder-guide/1100-6525830/">Dragon Age: The Veilguard Collector's Edition Preorders Live Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-anthology-preorders-quakecon-2024/1100-6525656/">Doom Anthology Preorders Are Live - Comes With 6 Games, Steelbook Case, And Replica BFG</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/retrorealms-halloween-ash-vs-evil-dead-retro-game-preorder-guide/1100-6525752/">Halloween And Ash Vs.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/esports-world-cup-saudi-money-overwatch-soft-power<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Did you, the Average Gamer, know that for the last eight weeks an esports tournament had been taking place in Saudi Arabia, billed as the "World Cup" and boasting unprecedented levels of prize money?</p><p>I mean, maaaaybe you did, if you are super into esports. But for most of us the world just kept on spinning, the masses seemingly oblivious to the existence of the event at all, let alone the fact it had been going on for so long and costing the Saudis millions in money.</p><p>There are a few reasons for this! For starters, this ain't 2017;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-08/the-hype-around-esports-is-fading-as-investors-and-sponsors-flee" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the esports bubble has well and truly popped</a>, with leagues around the world forced to close and consolidate as advertisers cut back on spending and organisers realise that what once looked an unstoppable commercial juggernaut may have been more of a niche and unprofitable pursuit than anybody had bothered to recognize.</p><p>Then, you know, there's Saudi Arabia.<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/jun/07/saudi-arabia-deal-pga-major-step-sportswashing-golf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> The gulf state's soft power grab is a well-read playbook by now</a>, and while some entertainment pursuits--<a href="https://defector.com/pga-tour-has-suddenly-merged-with-liv-golf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like professional golf</a>--have well and truly rolled over for a share of the Public Investment Fund‚Äôs (PIF) cash, others, like football, are experiencing frostier times, with Saudi's efforts (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2021/oct/08/saudi-takeover-of-newcastle-leaves-human-rights-to-fog-on-the-tyne" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including buying big clubs</a>) meeting protests<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/4932881/2023/10/06/newcastle-saudi-city-reubens/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> and unease at every turn</a>.</p><p>Esports has proved to be no different. Everyone from<a href="https://richardlewis.substack.com/p/your-guide-to-a-guilt-free-esports" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Richard Lewis</a> to<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSwqlRHQObA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Travis Gifford</a> have raised questions over this event taking place in (and taking millions from) Saudi Arabia, a nation with a terrible human rights record and downright hostile attitudes to LGBTQA+ people (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/13/arts/glaad-video-games-lgbtq.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">who make up a significant portion of competitive esports viewership!</a>). Organisers<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq5x85zd71eo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> have even had to defend the event to places like the BBC</a>.</p><p>People did attend, and people did watch it at home, sure, but the event's global reception was a far cry from what organisers must have been hoping for, given the prize money on offer and the "world cup" billing.</p><p>During those eight weeks, I got a few emails and messages asking why we hadn't covered it. I can't speak for my colleagues, but <em>I</em> didn't cover it for multiple reasons. Firstly, I don't like esports. Secondly, like I've just spelled out, the whole Saudi thing is gross, so yeah, I had no interest in covering it!</p><p>Until I got an email after it concluded from some poor PR company hired to launder the tournament's messaging. It read, in full (emphasis theirs):</p><blockquote><p>Hi there,</p><p>Yesterday marked the conclusion of an incredible&nbsp;<strong>eight weeks</strong>&nbsp;for the inaugural&nbsp;<strong>Esports&nbsp;World&nbsp;Cup</strong>, where&nbsp;<strong>Team Falcons</strong>&nbsp;were crowned the first&nbsp;<strong>Club Champion</strong>&nbsp;at the Closing Ceremony - marking the biggest weekend in&nbsp;esports&nbsp;history.&nbsp;</p><p>Team Falcons were awarded&nbsp;<strong>$7 million (USD)</strong>&nbsp;in life-changing prize money from a&nbsp;<strong>prize pool of more than $60 million</strong>, alongside the&nbsp;Esports&nbsp;World&nbsp;Cup&nbsp;Championship Trophy, presented to CEO&nbsp;Mossad "Msdossary" Al-Dossary by HRH Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud, the Crown Prince and Prime Minister of Saudi Arabia.</p><p>In total, the&nbsp;Esports&nbsp;World&nbsp;Cup&nbsp;recorded more than&nbsp;<strong>500 million viewers</strong>&nbsp;who consumed over&nbsp;<strong>250 million hours of content</strong>, making it&nbsp;<strong>the most-watched tournament of 2024</strong>, with a&nbsp;<strong>peak viewership of 3.5 million</strong>&nbsp;during the League of Legends Grand Final.</p><p>Following Sunday's awards presentation, winning players were honored in the&nbsp;<strong>Celebration of Champions</strong>, which featured live performances from international music icons&nbsp;<strong>Steve Aoki</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Kid Cudi</strong>.</p><p>Read on for the full press release, alongside quotes from HRH Prince Faisal bin Bandar bin Sultan (Chairman of the Saudi&nbsp;Esports&nbsp;Federation), Ralf Reichert (CEO of the&nbsp;Esports&nbsp;World&nbsp;Cup&nbsp;Foundation), and Faisal bin Homran (Chief Product Officer of the&nbsp;Esports&nbsp;World&nbsp;Cup&nbsp;Foundation).</p><p>Best wishes,</p><p>The&nbsp;Esports&nbsp;World&nbsp;Cup&nbsp;team</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Every single paragraph of this email included a reason I did not cover this tournament.</p><p>Here we were, at the conclusion of eight weeks of competition, and what does the official summary talk about? Money. More money. Some dubious viewership figures, then money again, name-dropping a bunch of guys, then mention of Steve Aoki, a guy whose mindset is so rinsed he's into<a href="https://www.theverge.com/22999333/decoder-steve-aoki-crypto-web3-aokiverse-metaverse-music-industry-business-nft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> web3 shit</a> <em>and</em><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stephaniehirschmiller/2023/10/30/stepn-and-steve-aoki-are-gamifying-the-15-trillion-wellness-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em> </em>wellness scams</a>.</p><p>Where's the esports? Where's even a single mention of the matches, the suspense, the human drama? There's nothing here about the actual tournament, just a lot of talk about money, and just as we should all judge a person by their actions, you can judge a tournament by what it wants to highlight at the end of it.</p><p>The Esports World Cup wasn't about competition. It wasn't even about video games. It was soft power by brute force, speaking the only language big-league esports has ever known: empty bullet points about millions of dollars, as though the prize money is the point, and not the entertainment that precedes it.</p><p>Does any of this make the competition a success? Relative to the dollars spent, who knows. In terms of the Saudi royal family flexing their muscles to show who's in charge (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-announces-new-era-of-overwatch-esports-with-saudi-funded-partnership" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">professional <em>Overwatch</em>, for example, is awash in Saudi money</a>)? Probably.</p><p>But in terms of anything that actually matters--and remember, the money wasn't even the point here, soft power and sports investment is all about the politics and prestige--not even this email could mask the fact the world simply didn't care. Especially when it proudly boasts "the Esports World Cup recorded more than 500 million viewers", which sounds impressive, until they immediately follow it up with "...who consumed over 250 million hours of content". So half an hour each on average, then. For a tournament that went for <em>eight weeks</em>. Sounds about right.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/ify-nwadiwe-and-jacob-wysocki-chat-never-stop-blowing-up-being-new-at-table-and<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Never Stop Blowing Up</em>, the latest season from Dimension 20, has wrapped up, ending the adventures of the Amazing Action Stars led by Brennan Lee Mulligan. In this adventure a group of employees at a video rental store in Lake Elsinore, California, are pulled into a VHS of Never Stop Blowing Up, a bombastic action film that draws on every trope in the book.</p>
<p>Among those players were Ify Nwadiwe and Jacob Wysocki who we had a chance to catch up with last week to discuss being the new player in the Dome, what their characters took away from their time in the VHS, and why it's great to show off your nerdy pride.</p>
<p>Nwadiwe and Wysocki weren't the only members of the <em>Never Stop Blowing Up</em> cast that we were able to catch up with. If you're interested in more Never Stop Blowing Up then be sure to check out <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/how-brennan-lee-mulligan-created-never-stop-blowing-up-love-letter-to-80s">our interview with Brennan Lee Mulligan</a> where we discussed the newly crafted mechanics, and our interview with <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/izzy-rowland-and-alex-song-xia-talk-never-stop-blowing-up-how-cowardice-shaped">Izzy Roland and Alex Song-Xia</a> where we discussed character motivations whether 'too far' was possible in this game.</p>
<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed//xFyge5BlaII"></iframe></p>
<h2>How Does Brennan Lee Mulligan Prepare The Table?</h2>
<p>To begin our conversation I was interested in hearing how the concept of <em>Never Stop Blowing Up</em> was introduced, and how they were prepared for a season that would reach such insanity.</p>
<p>"This is my third D20 season, this is my second with Brennan; even with Bloodkeep, Brennan does a good job of starting. Before our Session Zero, he does a long spiel about the world of the game, he has like a soundtrack to it, you get really drawn in and that I really appreciated. It's changed how I do even home games," Nwadiwe explained.</p>
<p>This experience was different for Wysocki, a regular for fans of Dropout content but his first time on Dimension 20. "I was really nervous because of the monolith that is D20 and the Dome. I think I was like, 'I need to know as much as possible and I need to know the data,' and Brennan is just the best one there is."</p>
<h2>TTRPG Are Improv With Math</h2>
<p>Wysocki explained that through the work he and Brennan Lee Mulligan had done together improvising, he was able to relay how to use that improv ability and translate that to success in the Dome. "He imbued a lot of confidence and that 'this is the ultimate <em>yes and</em> season,' so go big and go crazy."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"You're here because you're big and you're crazy, so go big and go crazy."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I did ask both Nwadiwe and Wysocki if there was any point during the game that they did feel like they had gone too big, both immediately started shaking their heads from side to side.</p>

"As the GM, Brennan was 'Yes And'ing on a level. I think we were trying to preemptively stop thinking that might be too much and he was like, 'No, let it rip.'"</p>
<p>Wysocki chimed in "I feel like early on we were all break checking a little bit, and as soon as I was like, 'My car drives into the pre-established hanger that the secret society owns and that becomes a plane,' and that worked I was like, 'Oh, I can do whatever I want.'"</p>
<h2>A Newcomer to the Dome and TTRPG</h2>
<p>Wysocki might have had his first experience in the Dome with <em>Never Stop Blowing Up</em>, but it's not his first time with TTRPGs.</p>
<p>"I definitely was a late adopter in that world," Wysocki said. "I think up until this, I had done maybe four~ish home games. One was very long standing with a core group of people who figured out we could do this every other week for a year."</p>
<p>[Zac]&nbsp;<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9d883f0f-b3c9-43af-9035-65518840f883" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/zac-oyama-talks-fantasy-high-junior-year-gorgugs-development-and-how-elmville-is">Oyama</a> is a good friend of mine, he was the first one to ask, 'Do you want to try doing this for entertainment?' and he's got a great podcast called the Rotating Heroes," Wysocki added, speaking to his professional TTRPG experience. "He GMs and has a rotating cast of people that come in, and one character stays while another two might leave so you're always following one familiar character."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"[This was] my first experience of, 'Hey, you're going to get 12 hours of gameplay in a really small period of time and you have to make a beginning and an end.'"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wysocki expressed his thanks for getting that exposure. Moving from home games to professional audio podcast helped him be more comfortable for the filmed Dimension 20 experience.</p>
<p>Some kind words were shared about how Wysocki felt like 'the baby' at the table amongst the other players, but Nwadiwe reassured him that "he crushed it."</p>
<h2>What Actions Heroes Can Learn From Normal Folks</h2>
<p>A key portion of the epilogue was when all of the characters returned to their real bodies. No longer were we in the presence of Vic Ethanol and Greg Stocks, but it was Wendell Morris and Andy 'Dang' Litefoot back in Dave's Video Rental. During this time, each character expressed their growth in new relationships and perspectives on their lives and a definitive path to continue forward.</p>
<p>Knowing how much Wendell and Dang had grown from their experiences, I wondered if Vic and Greg would have grown at all from those same interactions.</p>
<p>"Vic would realize that he needs to get a better grasp on what 'La Familia' really means," Nwadiwe said. "That maybe if he truly wants to respect La Familia that he needs to consider what they want and not just to have a desire to win everything no matter what."</p>
<p>"I think [Greg] would probably take away that it's OK to unbutton the cufflinks, and maybe loosen the bowtie a bit," Wysocki said about Greg Stocks. "Maybe stumbling into a solution could yield positive results as well like living a little bit more on the instinct, that neurodivergent 'ooh shiny object.' He could become a little more loosey-goosey."</p>

<p>Before wrapping up I had to ask Nwadiwe about the unique dynamic that his characters shared. While other players were growing into the abilities and gaining the skillsets of the characters directly, Wendell had a number of moments, looking into mirrors, where Vic Ethanol would talk to him and encourage him directly.</p>
<p>This unique approach, Nwadiwe explained, comes from his experience with improv comedy and doing more but different. "I was playing improv at the table with some of the best improvisers in the world, and improv teaches us to 'yes and' but also heighten and do things differently."</p>
<p>After seeing everyone having the same fish out of water approach to it I was like 'OK, I want to do what they're doing but in a slightly different way, what's a way I can play this that highlights the coolness of what they're doing but adds another flavor to it?'"</p>
<p>This improv technique truly did allow for all characters to continue to expand their characters and fuel the chaotic world of the game right until it's conclusion.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/izzy-rowland-and-alex-song-xia-talk-never-stop-blowing-up-how-cowardice-shaped</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/izzy-rowland-and-alex-song-xia-talk-never-stop-blowing-up-how-cowardice-shaped-a-character-and-that-die-hard-is-a-christmas-movie.966708/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/izzy-rowland-and-alex-song-xia-talk-never-stop-blowing-up-how-cowardice-shaped<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Never Stop Blowing Up </em>is the latest season from Dimension 20. When a group of employees at a VHS Rental Store going out of business get Jumanji'd into an action movie filled with hard one-liners, convoluted plotlines, and every action trope in the book they need to gather their Macguffins to survive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We got to talk with Isabella Roland and Alex Song-Xia about their experiences in the world of <em>Never Stop Blowing Up</em> and what influenced their characters.</p>
<p>If you're interested in more<em> Never Stop Blowing Up</em> you can check out our interview where we talked about showing off your nerd with Ify Nwadiwe and Jacob Wysocki, or our conversation with Brennan Lee Mulligan about the creation of Never Stop Blowing Up and letting others take on the role of DM.</p>
<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed//NwXm6v6TLLc"></iframe></p>
<h2>Yippee-ki-yay Jack Manhattan</h2>
<p>In <em>Never Stop Blowing Up</em> Isabella Roland plays Paula Donvalson, a security guard for the Lake Elsinore strip mall that Dave's Video Rental inhabits. While in the real world, she's a 58-year-old divorcee who enjoys <em>Muriel's Wedding </em>and <em>Under the Tuscan Sun</em> when pulled into<em> Never Stop Blowing Up</em> she becomes Jack Manhattan a detective who came to LA to solve the case of his partner's death.</p>
<p>It was the shared love for action films between Brennan Lee Mulligan and Izzy Roland that led to Mulligan writing this adventure. I asked Izzy where her love of action movies came from.</p>
<p>Pausing for a moment Roland expressed that she wasn't entirely sure where it originated, that there wasn't a single point that fueled her love. "I think it's a love of all things very over the top, all of my biggest heroes and inspirations in comedy and acting are the ones who are bigger than life."</p>
<p>Listing off some of her inspirations Roland continued "Gilda Radnor was huge for me and Maya Rudolf, I love people who can't be reigned in and I think a lot of that is present in action movies too."</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/john-mclane-vent.jpg?itok=pNPAddFL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/john-mclane-vent.jpg?itok=cIG4Y6s0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Speaking of her favorite action film Roland was quick to highlight <em>Die Hard</em>. "I watch it multiple times a year and I watch it every Christmas because it is a Christmas movie"</p>
<h2>Kingskin, The Tortilla Chip Shaped Man</h2>
<p>Alex Song-Xia plays the valedictorian Liv Skyler who has been working at the rental store while trying to figure out if she wants to follow through with attending Stanford or whether she'll continue to search for something she'd rather do. A complete juxtaposition to her real form once she is pulled into <em>Never Stop Blowing Up</em> she becomes Kingskin, a hulking mob boss who could (and does) crush a man's body without breaking a sweat.</p>
<p>While Kingskin is tough on the outside, especially at the outset of the game, he really becomes the heart of the team of Amazing Action Stars but also of his own mob commonly complementing members like Doug Meat.</p>
<p>Song-Xia explained that this difference in position to character was due to "cowardice." Expanding on the idea Song-Xia continued "I couldn't commit to brutality."</p>
<p>Roland cut in to offer that she thinks it's down to Song-Xia being "a very compassionate and loving person"</p>

<p>"I was like 'I'm going to play so different from Conrad'," here referencing their character Conrad Schintz, a newsie in the cerebral city murder mystery of Mentopolis, "and immediately I went back to being earnest and compassionate."</p>
<h2>Into The Action Of <em>Never Stop Blowing Up</em></h2>
<p>Prior to playing in this season of Dimension 20 I was interested to hear what kind of primer they received for what they might have expected going into the game and it's homebrewed version of the Kids on Bikes game system.</p>
<p>Pausing momentarily to think about it Song-Xia revealed that there really wasn't much information that they were given. "We talked about action movies, and we discussed all watching one together, but I dont think that happened."</p>
<p>"I don't think that happened," Roland confirmed "Brennan told us 'be crazy, [...] we picked all of you for a reason so you should feel so inclined to go ballz to the wall'"</p>

<p>"It was a really good pep talk" Song-Xia added</p>
<p>As Jack Manhattan and Kingskin characters went from killing needlessly and throwing around bricks of cocaine to storming the White House dressed as a senator protecting themselves from bulletfire with a briefcase. Knowing that the season was filled with a series of circumstances each crazier than the next, many brought on by player made decisions, I asked if there was any point that they felt like they had gone too far.</p>
<p>Before responding I received affirming head nods from both Roland and Song-Xia</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Every episode."</p>
<p>Roland spoke specifically in regards to the final episode "I was like‚Ä¶ we can't do this‚Ä¶ we're not allowed to do this. But Brennan [Lee Mulligan] seemed confident and seemed like he had it all under control so‚Ä¶ okay"</p>
<h2>The Lessons We Teach Each Other</h2>
<p>A key aspect of <em>Never Stop Blowing Up</em> is that each of the 'real world' characters are able to learn from their movie counterparts and experiences through the movie. Having heard in the final episode how the 'real world' characters had grown I was interested to hear what action heroes Jack Manhattan and Kingskin had taken away from the experience.</p>
<p>"I think maybe Jack, he's an homage to John McClain, I think he would come out of it wanting to be less selfish and less self-involved. You can't just make every insane move that you want to make. People's lives are at stake."</p>

<p>For Kingskin Song-Xia hopes that "he would embrace his softer side a little more, his genuine warm feelings towards his henchmen and to not be so scared to show them how much he loves them." The sentiment took a comedic turn as Song-Xia mused on Kingskin's growth "I don't know if he would let them unionize or have better benefits, but he would say 'love you' sometimes"</p>
<p>Roland offered an alternative path of growth suggesting that Kingskin could become a therapist. Loving the idea Song-Xia added that they "hope Jack suggests it to Kingskin."</p>
<p>All ten episodes are now available of <em>Never Stop Blowing Up</em> available on <a href="https://dropout.tv/">Dropout.tv</a>, you can also watch the first episode for free on the Dimension 20 YouTube channel.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-addresses-controversial-leveling-changes-in-world-of-warcraft-the-war-within<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Slow down, life is to be savored.</h2></div><section><p>Earlier this week, Blizzard announced changes to how leveling from level 70 to 80 will work in recently-released World of Warcraft expansion, The War Within. And now, after criticism from players, developers are reassuring that the overall impact to leveling time will be "minimal."</p><p>The changes were announced yesterday in <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/leveling-difficulty-changes-incoming/1931861" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an official post</a>, with community manager Kaivax sharing that the team had noticed players coming into the new expansion content with endgame gear from the previous expansion, Dragonflight, were "extremely powerful relative to that intential content." The post goes on to say that a hotfix to be pushed today would "adjust the scaling of enemies in War Within leveling content to increase the power of lower-level enemies, bringing the duration of combat more in line with expected WoW behavior. These changes will be most noticeable at level 70, and will have a reduced impact as your level increases."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>All of that sounds relatively normal, and as someone who started playing The War Within in full Dragonflight endgame gear, they were desperately needed. Especially in the first half of the new expansion, I found I was easily killing even supposedly difficult enemies in just a few hits, and while it evened out over time, the speed of the experience meant I was blasting through content and levels so quickly I barely had time to blink. In fact, much of the community agreed something needed to be changed. But in the ensuing discussion, it became clear that there was significant frustration as to how Blizzard was handling it.</p><p>Players expressed two main concerns. The first, as demonstrated in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1f2m4qk/leveling_will_be_made_harder_with_hotfixes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">several of the top comments on this thread</a>, was that players coming into the expansion with terrible gear (perhaps because they skipped playing Dragonflight, or were leveling a new character) would be relatively underpowered and would disproportionately struggle with the content if their power was nerfed.</p><p>But a second issue players surfaced was the timing of the changes. The War Within technically launched back on August 22 for people who purchased the Epic Edition of the game. Its global launch was on August 26. That meant that people who paid for the more expensive version for earlier access essentially got four extra days of super speedy, overpowered leveling (including a period over a weekend) while those who didn't shell out the extra cash only experienced roughly a day and a half. </p><p>As <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1f2m4qk/comment/lk7gxc6/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one Redditor put it</a>: "The time to make that change was almost exactly a week ago. It's absolutely asinine to arbitrarily slow things down for people who are already behind the curve due to the late release. This is a situation where you need to just acknowledge you dropped the ball and leave things the way they are."</p><p>In response, Blizzard has issued some clarification on what the changes to leveling actually are in an attempt to assuage at least some of these worries.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We want to provide additional details on today's leveling changes and balance fixes to group content.</p><p>‚Ä¢ Changes aim to make the difficulty curve more gradual - enemy strength will actually increase by less per level in the mid-to-high 70s than it used to</p><p>‚Ä¢ Players coming in‚Ä¶</p></div>‚Äî World of Warcraft (@Warcraft) <a href="https://twitter.com/Warcraft/status/1828839377042374995?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 28, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Warcraft/status/1828839377042374995" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet</a>, Blizzard shared that the changes to leveling scaling would make the difficulty curve "more gradual" and that players coming into the expansion with basic leveling gear would find leveling "manageable" and "get powerful gear quickly." Meanwhile, players at level 78 and up should find combat "unchanged."</p><p>With the change now live, players are reporting that Blizzard's description of the shift is largely accurate, and is a much-needed balance adjustment. But frustrations about the update's timing still remain, exacerbated by existing irritation about The War Within's early access period in general. The four-day headstart for Epic Edition buyers has been fairly controversial, with top-level players expressing anger that it forced them to pay extra to stay on top of the early expansion competitive scene, and others just aggravated about missing out on what is technically the "launch day." </p><p>In Blizzard's favor, perhaps, is the reality that the early access period drastically cut down on server issues and queues on both the 22nd and the 26th, with players barely reporting any of the usual launch day friction in either scenario due to the split playerbase.</p><p>Game director Ion Hazzikostas called the early access period a "bit of an experiment" in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-game-director-calls-controversial-the-war-within-paid-early-access-an-experiment">an interview earlier this year</a>, and it's not clear whether we'll see Blizzard try the same thing for future expansions <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-announces-next-three-expansions-in-world-of-warcraft-the-worldsoul-saga-blizzcon-2023">Midnight and The Last Titan</a>.</p><p>We're currently in the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-review">process of reviewing The War Within</a> as its launch content slowly rolls out over the next few weeks, but our review-in-progress says that, "There's still a lot of The War Within I haven't seen yet, but I'm thoroughly enjoying myself so far, and that‚Äôs just about the highest praise I can give an expansion at launch."</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
