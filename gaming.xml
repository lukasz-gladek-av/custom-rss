            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/13/24320659/nintendo-switch-2-dbrand-killswitch<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo is inching ever closer to its promised deadline to reveal the Switch’s successor <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24150891/nintendo-switch-2-console-announcement-earnings-q4-2024">before April 2025</a>. But new leaks from case manufacturers appear to reveal exactly what the Nintendo’s next console could look like, and a few notable upgrades it might have over the original Switch.</p><p>We were inspired to write this article in the first place because of Dbrand’s just-announced “Killswitch 2” case. <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdbrand.com%2Fshop%2Fgrip%2Fnintendo-switch-2-cases">The website for the product</a> features an in-motion render of the case and, inside, a mockup of hardware that has some key differences from the Switch and Switch OLED: the new console appears to be larger, and it has a mysterious new second button on the right Joy-Con under the Home button. Accessory leaks over the past several days have shown a similar <a href="https://www.theshortcut.com/p/new-nintendo-switch-2-leak-all-but-confirms-how-the-console-will-look">potential</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-cases-screen-protectors-already-for-sale-via-chinese-sellers">design</a> for the hardware.</p><p>It seems Dbrand is reasonably confident in its case, but we asked CEO Adam Ijaz&nbsp;to be sure. He says Dbrand has “actual dimensions” — not an educated guess — based on a “3D scan of the real hardware.” (When we asked how he knows that, Ijaz only said “Nice try, Nintendo<em>.</em>”)</p><div><figcaption><em>Here’s a GIF we cut of the new case from Dbrand’s video.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Video: Dbrand</cite></p></div><p>Based on Dbrand’s measurements, the next Switch (which we’ll call the Switch 2) will both be larger and taller than Nintendo’s Switch OLED, but roughly the same thickness. <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fmy%2Fhardware%2Fswitch%2Fmodal%2Fspecs%2Fbody_oled.html">Nintendo’s spec sheet</a> shows its previous handheld is 242mm wide, 102mm tall and 13.9mm thick, where Ijaz says the Switch 2 should measure 270mm wide, 116mm tall, and 14mm thick, with the console portion taking up 200mm worth of that width. </p><p>Ijaz also says the kickstand will still measure around half the console’s height at around 55mm; a diagonal measurement of the cover glass supports previous rumors that it’ll have an 8-inch screen. </p><p>Ijaz says it’s his “understanding” that Joy-Cons are “magnetically attached” with an “an ejection button” that’s on the back of the Joy-Cons near the top, and his new case takes advantage of the detachable controllers — he says the controller portions of Dbrand’s case can detach with them inside.</p><p>He doesn’t know what the second square button is under the Home button, which he says has a “C” printed on it. The left Joy-Con in Dbrand’s mockup still has a button on the left Joy-Con, which is where you’ll find the capture button on the original Switch, so it’s unclear if this “C” button now means capture or if both buttons work differently. (Nintendo originally introduced C-buttons on the Nintendo 64 controller in 1996 as a way to control a game’s camera, before gamepads introduced a second stick to let you shift perspective.) </p><p>Ijaz says the joysticks stand 6.27mm tall, and the D-pad and ABXY buttons protrude by 1.57mm, with a 180mm wide kickstand, and back triggers that extend 14.1mm.</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->5</p><div><figcaption><em>Since the controller parts of the Killswitch 2 are detachable, this version uses a teal bungee cord, rather than a form-fitting design, to secure its protective travel cover.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Dbrand</cite></p></div></div><p>While Dbrand does seem to know a lot about the console, Ijaz is “genuinely unsure” about its potential release date. He says that Dbrand is working toward a late March or early April release for its case, though. Ijaz also doesn’t know about Nintendo’s possible TV dock for the Switch 2, but says that Dbrand’s assumption is that “the form factor will be similar to the previous gen.” He doesn’t know if the screen will be LCD or OLED.</p><p>While it’s highly unusual for an accessory maker to publicly reveal this much about a product from a powerful, litigious company like Nintendo, it’s not surprising that Dbrand’s the one stepping up to the plate. Having beef with console makers is an intentional (and often fun!) part of its marketing strategy, and Nintendo is a frequent target — like that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23713293/dbrand-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-skin">Zelda skin that was a middle finger to Nintendo’s lawyers</a>, or the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21231434/animal-crossing-switch-skin-nintendo-dbrand-copyright-price-design">“(not) Animal Crossing”</a> one. </p><p>Much of what Dbrand is showing and what Ijaz is saying lines up with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nacn4yqUY1s">a video from SwitchUp</a> showing what it calls a Switch 2 mockup sent to them by a case manufacturer. That mockup is clearly larger than today’s existing Switch OLED, and the new Joy-Cons are clearly bigger than the old Joy-Cons. You can also see the second square button under the home button there, the larger button under the triggers that presumably ejects them from the console, and a wide kickstand similar to the one on the Switch OLED.</p><p>One other nice addition? A second USB-C port on the top of the mockup, which theoretically means you’ll be able to plug in a charging cable while you’re using it in tabletop mode; with the current Switch, the charging port on the bottom is blocked when you’re standing it up on a table.</p><p>While we’re still waiting for Nintendo to actually announce concrete details about the Switch 2, the company has shared that the console will be able to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/5/24284745/switch-2-backward-compatibility-nintendo-online-preservation">play current Switch games</a> and it will have Nintendo Switch Online as well.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

As we were doing the run-up to the film, it was like, ‘Alright, Danny, try this on. Alright, try this on.’ At the same time, I was training. So the suit kept changing and changing. By the time it was ready for me to wear on set, I remember looking at it and being like, ‘Oh, that’s it. Holy shit!’”</p><p>I think we all had the same reaction as Ramirez after watching the latest trailer. Now, we just have to wait until February 14 to see the Falcon fully in action. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The Stockholm-based studio known for complex grand strategy games has partnered with Gamefound and Steamforged Games to bring their WW2 strategy series to gaming tables.</p>

<h2>The Hearts of Iron Board Game Announcement</h2>

<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/394360/view/782034509920993389" rel="nofollow">recent post</a> on the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hearts-of-iron-iv" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Hearts of Iron IV</em></a> Steam page, Paradox Interactive officially announced the <em>Hearts of Iron</em> board game. Much like source material, the game allows 2-5 players to take control of history.</p>

To these ends they must build political power, manage resources, and keep their nation stable.</p>

<p>They can play out real historical events or explore alternative histories. What if a Communist France competed against a Democratist Italy? The <em>Hearts of Iron</em> board game will facilitate that. Just be prepared for the time commitment since the estimated time to finish a game is about three hours.</p>

<p>Steamforged Games is developing the <em>Hearts of Iron</em> board game. The company has a glowing reputation in the tabletop industry for its complex, high-quality licensed board games, such as <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/horizon-forbidden-west-seeds-of-rebellion-is-kickstarter-success" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Horizon Forbidden West</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/runescape-kingdoms-games-finally-arrive-to-retail" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Runescape Kingdoms</em></a>. Furthermore, its team produces the widely popular <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> product line, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/epic-encounters-palace-of-drow-queen-and-lair-of-drider-review-new-shade-of" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Epic Encounters</em></a>.</p>

These include the intergalactic <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/stellaris" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Stellaris</em></a>, the urban planning sim <em>Cities Skylines II</em>, and the historical 4X series <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/europa-universalis-iv" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Europa Universalis</em></a> and <em>Crusader Kings</em>.</p>

<p>The Hearts of Iron board game will be arriving via crowdfunding campaign on Gamefound. At time of writing, the campaign hasn't gone live there are no further details on pledge levels or price. However, if you follow the campaign and pledge, you will receive a first player medal and a set of bonus focus cards at no additional cost.</p>

So even as a third game is apparently lurking in some office drawer at Naughty Dog, we haven’t anything truly new to talk about in years. <em>Part II</em> is an all-time top-five game for me, and even I’m tired of retreading it, though I’ll have to do it again when the second season of the show arrives next year. So yeah, let’s finally get Naughty Dog into a fresh new universe, and not one that it’s been taking us back to for the past two or three generations.</p><p><em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</em> is a new science fiction game in which space travel had advanced significantly by the mid-‘80s. Director Neil Druckmann has cited sci-fi anime like <em>Akira </em>and <em>Cowboy Bebop</em> as inspirations, and you can see that in just the brief glimpse we’ve gotten into the game thus far. There’s a retrofuturistic aesthetic to the first trailer, seen in details such as bounty hunter protagonist Jordan listening to compact discs and using CRT TVs in her spaceship. The game’s tone and subject matter look to be a far cry from the swashbuckling treasure-hunting and grim zombie-killing the studio has been focused on for so many years. Druckmann says it’s a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/arts/intergalactic-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-druckmann.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/arts/intergalactic-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-druckmann.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“return” to the studio’s action-adventure roots</a></span> which date back to the <em>Crash Bandicoot</em> series, though <em>Intergalactic </em>is clearly maintaining some of the cinematic prestige television aspirations of Naughty Dog’s recent projects.

I’m not thrilled to hear that Naughty Dog is seemingly attaching the same aspirations to <em>Intergalactic</em>, as Druckmann says that the studio is now primed to be “an I.P. powerhouse.” I could see it becoming tethered to this game just as it has been to <em>Uncharted </em>and <em>The Last of Us</em>. After the end of <em>Uncharted 4</em>, that series could (and should) go away, but if it’s just going to be replaced by another decades-long franchise that Naughty Dog returns to every other game, I hope it doesn’t also mean the studio won’t be free to explore its next big idea for another console generation or two. It seems safe returns to profitable franchises that are harvested again and again for every drop of profit that can be extracted is all big companies want right now, though</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kotaku-review-playstation-5-1851640280&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kotaku-review-playstation-5-1851640280"><em>Astro Bot</em></a></span><em> </em>launched this year, and despite being a tribute to PlayStation history, was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-playstation-ps5-references-characters-1851640150&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-playstation-ps5-references-characters-1851640150">notably lacking in PS5 games</a></span> to celebrate.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/game-of-thrones-kingsroad-is-an-action-adventure-rpg-set-in-westeros-but-its-only-for-mobile/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During The Game Awards 2024, Chinese publisher Netmarble aired a trailer for Game of Thrones: Kingsroad. If you were watching the show on a tiny screen at FullHD resolution or lower, it might have looked like everything Game of Thrones fans have ever wanted from a game based on Martin's beloved saga: an action-adventure RPG where we could stand side by side with the most important characters, who bore properly made likenesses and voiced by the real actors behind the award-winning HBO show.</p>
<p>However, if, like me, you were watching the show at 4K resolution and on a large TV, you likely immediately noticed that the visual quality was nowhere near those of other games that premiered in the show, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-gets-first-trailer-showing-off-cirilla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CD Projekt RED's The Witcher IV</a>. In fact, it looked a couple of generations behind, especially when it comes to things like hair and clothes.</p>
<p>There's a simple explanation for that: Game of Thrones: Kingsroad is, sadly, a game for Android and iOS devices. Sure, mobile games have gotten a lot closer than they used to be, but when it comes to the triple-A segment, there's still a massive difference with PC and console games. Sure, a PC version might be released at some point, but it wouldn't be the same thing as developing natively for PC and consoles first.</p>
<p>Anyway, the game will put you in the role of a new character who unexpectedly becomes the heir to House Tyre, a small noble house from the North. The character is customizable both visually and in terms of classes, of which there are three: Sellsword, Knight, and Assassin.</p>
<p>Netmarble (which previously made a Game of Thrones <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-of-thrones-mmorpg-for-mobile-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MMORPG</a> and a <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-of-thrones-beyond-the-wall-rpg-is-now-available-for-iphone-and-ipad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turn-based RPG</a>, both for mobile) shared the following statement from CEO Young-sig Kwon:</p>
<p><em>We believe Game of Thrones is a world rich with untold stories and adventures, and we’re pleased to bring Westeros to life in an exciting new way for gamers.</em></p>

<p>Netmarble aims to release Game of Thrones: Kingsroad at some point next year in Europe, America, the Middle East, Africa, and Oceania, while the timing for Asia hasn't been finalized yet. Meanwhile, you can sign up<a href="https://gameofthrones.netmarble.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> on the official website</a> if you're interested in getting updates.</p>

<p>It has been confirmed that Geralt of Rivia <strong>will indeed appear </strong>in The Witcher 4, but everyone involved is NDA’d out of their minds and can’t say exactly in what capacity he’ll surface.</p>



<p>It was just a few days ago that Doug Cockle, the veteran voice actor behind Geralt, confirmed that he’d ‘been slapped’ by CDPR for commenting about appearing in The Witcher 4. Now, CDPR itself has confirmed that Geralt will appear in the upcoming title, which was unveiled this week at The Game Awards.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-on-the-path">On The Path</h2>



<p>In the first trailer for The Witcher 4, a few seconds were reserved right at the tail end for a line from Doug Cockle in true Geralt form. It referenced staying on ‘the path’ that Witchers follow, and it commented on this being the beginning of a new saga.</p>



<p>The Witcher 4 will star Ciri in a leading role, which shouldn’t come as a surprise to the franchise’s truest fans. It has always been about Ciri, after all – it was <strong>expected </strong>that she’d take up the mantle of ‘The Witcher’ in this all-new game from CDPR.</p>



<p>In an interview <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/geralt-is-in-the-witcher-4-and-that-is-indeed-doug-cockles-voice-in-the-trailer-cd-projekt-confirms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with IGN</a>, CD Projekt confirmed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Geralt will appear in the game, but we don’t want to spoil his role precisely. You’ll have to wait to learn more for now.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>At the end of Blood and Wine, the final expansion for 2015’s The Witcher 3, Geralt effectively retired to a vineyard in Toussaint. What he’s been doing since then is anyone’s guess, but it’s now assumed to be canonical that Ciri took up the silver sword and went Witchering in his place. </p>



<p>In the trailer for The Witcher 4, we see an empowered Ciri consuming potions and using signs, which means she’s undergone the Trial of the Grasses, at the very least.</p>



<p>Perhaps Geralt of Rivia will appear in The Witcher 4 in a similar role that Vesemir served in The Witcher 3, as a wise old mentor.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to The Witcher 4? Let us know in the comments.</p>

<p>Have you ever wanted to own a 1/2 scale replica of The Witcher’s Ciri of Cintra? Well, thanks to Pure Arts, you can now do just that – but it’ll set you back $3,000.</p>



<p>Recently, the high-end collectables company unveiled a brand-new Ciri statue (nice timing), and it stands almost four feet tall. It’s limited to just 500 pieces and it’s arguably the most detailed statue I’ve seen in my entire life.</p>



<p>Do you think you’ll invest in the ultimate Ciri statue?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-unreal-detail">Unreal Detail</h2>



<p>Pure Arts’ Ciri of Cintra statue is nothing short of mind-blowing.</p>



<p>For $3,000, you’re getting a ‘hyperdetailed’ statue with glass eyes, individually punched synthetic hair, silicone skin, ‘real clothing’, and metal weapons. The team has assembled a design that uses real leather, hand-sewn elements, removable accessories, and a polyresin base for durability.</p>



<p>It weighs a whopping 14 kilos – 20.5 kilos if you include the packaging.</p>



<p>The statue depicts Ciri as she appears in 2015’s The Witcher 3, standing on a plinth alongside a piece of headgear (or perhaps <em>a head</em>) from one of the riders of The Wild Hunt. She’s midway through drawing her silver sword, looking intense and standing ready for a fight.</p>



<p>Pure Arts has also produced a similar statue of Geralt of Rivia. It’s almost the same size and weight as the Ciri statue, but the team has ramped up the detail on this one, individually implanting each beard hair on his face. It’s unparalleled, truly.</p>



<p>It’ll cost up to $300 to have these items shipped, and the Geralt of Rivia statue costs $3,499 for starters, so you’ll need to be prepared to part ways with a pretty penny to secure these figures.</p>



<p>Do you think you’ll invest? Let us know in the comments.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mafia-the-old-country/" data-ref-id="5000-640433">Mafia: The Old Country </a>not only takes players back in time to the early 1900s, but also to a new place in Sicily. Game director Alex Cox recently talked about why the team at Hangar 13 chose that setting and time for the new Mafia game after the latest entries were set in later time periods of mob history.</p><p>Cox said in an <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/12/12/mafia-the-old-country-preview/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">interview with Xbox </a>that while the first three Mafia games explored different eras of the American mafia, the team "loved the idea of heading to Sicily and exploring the early years of this fearsome crime organization."</p><p>For comparison, the original Mafia took place in the 1930s, with Mafia II picking up in the 1940s. Mafia III, meanwhile, was set in the late 1960s.</p><p>Cox went on to say that making The Old Country has been a "refreshing departure" for Hangar 13, as its staffers got to work on elements of the "rugged Sicilian countryside" as opposed to the busy cities of the other Mafia games.</p><p>"Building this story has been a great experience for everyone at Hangar 13--first learning about Sicilian history and the origins of the Mafia, then adapting that into an exciting criminal adventure," Cox said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrB-tEzp7ag" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FrB-tEzp7ag" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In particular, though, Cox said he's excited about elements of the time period, including horses, vintage vehicles, and knife duels. Taking place in the early 1900s means cars with hand-crank engines will appear in The Old Country, he said. "We've never had the player riding on horseback before! Galloping across the Sicilian countryside feels incredibly freeing and is unlike anything we've done in the past," Cox explained.</p><p>While no entry in the Mafia series has been set completely in Sicily, the first mission in Mafia II, titled <a href="https://mafiagame.fandom.com/wiki/The_Old_Country_(Mafia_II_Chapter)" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Old Country</a>, takes players to Sicily in 1943.</p><p>Developers from Hangar 13 visited Sicily to get a firsthand look and feel for the island and its culture. Cox went on to say that Hangar 13 has been working with a "local Sicilian partner" that gave the studio "invaluable guidance." The team also consulted Sicilian history experts to help the developers nail down things like era-appropriate bricks, music, and even swear words.</p><p>Because The Old Country is set in the early 1900s, players won't have access to modern weapons, so the game aims to make combat feel "more tactical and deliberate."</p><p>"We've leaned heavily into the 'tools of the trade' of a Sicilian Mafioso, from lupara shotguns to stiletto blades. There's real grit to these older, more traditional weapons," Cox said.</p><p>Finally, although The Old Country features a new main cast of characters and aims to appeal to newcomers to the series, Cox said existing fans "will get a kick out of how Mafia: The Old Country connects to the rest [of the franchise]."</p><p>The Old Country releases Summer 2025 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

By the looks of it, there are a few differences between the game and the series. In images Netflix has released of the game, players appear to be able to wield items like bats and balls. Also, the infamous glass bridge challenge appears to now let players all run across the bridge at the same time instead of individually like on the show. Also, a massive piggy bank swinging from a chain doesn’t look like it’s going to be easy to get past at the end of the bridge. </p><p>Alain Tascan, president of games at Netflix, spoke about what players can expect from the game at <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2024-trailers-announcements-world-premieres-1851720032&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2024-trailers-announcements-world-premieres-1851720032">The Game Awards</a></span>. <em>“Squid Game: Unleashed</em> is all about playing with (or against) your friends in the iconic games from the series like Glass Bridge and Red Light Green Light, so we’re inviting everyone into the chaos this holiday season.” </p><p>The second season of <em>Squid Game</em> premieres on December 26. You can catch up on the series by bingeing the first season, and then follow it up by trying to win the game yourself.

That's when Vincke interrupts and takes it away.</p><p>"Sorry about that! Uh, no. This thing? It needs a lot more time in the oven. By the time it's going to be finished it's going to be so big," Vincke exclaimed. "For the time being? You're going to have to wait." He then thanks fans for their massive support and hopes they enjoy the advent calendar this year.</p><p><a href="https://advent.baldursgate3.game/day/13-12-2023/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Last year's advent calendar</a> consisted of a memory game that became increasingly complex as the days went on. Rewards included a Grinch-like story and music downloads.</p>

                <p>Bandai Namco is making a bold pivot for Pac-Man’s 45th anniversary next year with Shadow Labyrinth. Announced at The Game Awards, the new game is a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pac-man-reimagined-as-a-hollow-knight-inspired-2d-action-platformer-shadow-labyrinth/1100-6528429/" data-ref-id="1100-6528429">wild reimagining of the iconic yellow puck</a>. Instead of a family-friendly arcade game, Shadow Labyrinth is a much darker take on the franchise that appears to pull inspiration from hits like Hollow Knight and Ori and the Blind Forest. The intriguing title is slated to launch on PC, Switch, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S in 2025, and preorders are already available for the physical Switch and PS5 versions at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DPLL3428,B0DPLKXWT5,B0DPLKM2FG,B0DPLLQ74T&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://howl.link/6kwrmksiyyrfk?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/1734115488128?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Best Buy</a>. Multiple editions are available, including a limited Secret Edition that's packed with extras.</p><h2>Shadow Labyrinth Preorder Bonuses</h2><p>Preordering at Best Buy unlocks the digital bonus “Original Arcade Sound FX.” It’s unclear if this is a retailer exclusive, or if others will offer the content when preorders become available elsewhere.
