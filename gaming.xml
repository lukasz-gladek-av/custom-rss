Call of Duty HQ, the popular military shooter’s current one-size-fits-all launcher, requires players to download tons of stuff they don’t want to access a new campaign or multiplayer mode and then delete the rest later. The new approach will require a big download initially starting August 21 as Activision reorganizes the Call of Duty HQ content ahead of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/cod-blops-6-beta-weekend-dates-pre-order-game-pass-1851593252&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/cod-blops-6-beta-weekend-dates-pre-order-game-pass-1851593252"><em>Black Ops 6 </em>beta later this month</a></span> on August 30, but will eventually result in players being able to install exactly what they want without eating up half of their PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X/S’s storage. </p><p>The biggest change is that <em>Call of Duty Warzone</em>, the free-to-play battle royale mode, will exist as a completely separate download from <em>Modern Warfare III</em> and later when it launches, <em>Black Ops 6</em>. Activision didn’t breakdown exactly what the file sizes will be for the games at that point, or for the initial updates players need to install to re-optimize Call of Duty HQ, but it did share how big the standalone <em>Black Ops 6 </em>beta will be on every platform. The biggest is 80GB on PS5 and the smallest is to 66 GB on Steam.</p><p>Players have long complained about <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/ModernWarfareII/comments/17qt3ph/the_call_of_duty_hq_is_possibly_the_worst_thing/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ModernWarfareII/comments/17qt3ph/the_call_of_duty_hq_is_possibly_the_worst_thing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how chaotic and ugly the Call of Duty HQ experience is</a></span>, and what a pain it’s been trying to make room for ever-bigger sequels on their hard drives, especially when big new updates rivaling the size of most average games are added on top of the existing space requirements. This peaked in absurdity earlier this year when the <em>Black Ops 6 </em>Microsoft store page revealed a total size of 309.85 GB for the upcoming game. Activision <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-website-says-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-weighs-in-at-an-eye-watering-30985-gb-update&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-website-says-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-weighs-in-at-an-eye-watering-30985-gb-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">quickly clarified</a></span> that the number in question included <em>MWII</em>, <em>MWIII</em>, <em>Blops 6</em>, and <em>Warzone</em>. Thank god that come October 25 players won’t have to fiddle with any of that nonsense anymore. I’m sure it will be an incredibly smooth handoff with no further wrinkles or issues. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">It's a big moment for Hunt: Showdown. The 1896 update overhauls the 2018 shooter's visuals, with an upgrade to the latest version of the CryEngine and all the improved lighting and audio updates that come with it. The changes are so dramatic that Crytek is ending support of the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of the game. Owners of the last-gen console versions, however, will be upgraded for free to the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions. It also adds the game's first new map in years (set in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, which is the first map set outside the swamps of Louisiana), and introduces new enemies, weapons, weapon variants, and cosmetics.</p><p dir="ltr">Controversially, it also overhauls the game's UI, which is earning Hunt: Showdown 1896 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/594650/Hunt_Showdown_1896/#app_reviews_hash" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"Mixed" recent reviews on Steam</a> despite the game's overall "Very Positive" rating. Most of the game's recent negative reviews remark on the UI change, with one negative review stating the new update "brought with it a UI that was designed for console players" and "barely functions," while another calls the new main menu and UI "disgusting."</p><p dir="ltr">There are gameplay changes too, with major adjustments to various Hunter traits like the widely used Necromancer trait, changes to make it so Hunters burn out faster when downed and on fire, reduced duration for Choke bombs, improved Trap placement, and reworked bullet physics, including bullet drop. Headshots will now always be an instant kill as well. The game's challenge system has also been overhauled, with all players now having the same weekly challenges, all the objectives of which are displayed on the in-game map.</p><p dir="ltr">For those interested in seeing what Hunt: Showdown 1896 is all about, the game is running a free weekend on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/594650/Hunt_Showdown_1896/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a> that ends on August 19, with an Xbox free weekend lasting until August 18. Hunt: Showdown 1896 is also discounted on all platforms by 20% until August 22, available for $24 instead of its usual $30.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-just-wanted-to-talk-to-a-human.954309/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/roblox-gift-card-robux-invalid-code<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last month my 11-year-old son was having a rough time at school, so my wife and I decided to cheer him up with a $50 <em>Roblox </em>gift card. We had only the best intentions, but the whole episode has turned into one huge drama.</p><p>First, yes,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gXlauRB1EQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> I know <em>Roblox </em>is not the ideal platform for kids his age (or any age) to be playing on</a>. I'm as aware of its shortcomings as anyone. But <em>Roblox </em>is the default communications platform for 11-year-old kids where we live. It's the place everyone hangs out in after school, talks shit and checks out each other's stuff, so with some safeguards in place--he's on a monthly stipend of Robux<em> </em>and we monitor which games he's playing--he's allowed to play.</p><p>The problem here wasn't with the games, but the platform and company itself. We bought him a physical card because it felt like more of a gift, something we could hand him and say "here you go, buddy" and have it mean more than just dumping some Robux into his account. We gave it to him on a Friday afternoon, and he <em>loved </em>it: he was ecstatic after a pretty shitty week at school and all seemed well!</p><p>We watched him pop the card off its cardboard backing excitedly, peel back the sticker protecting its code, punch the code in and...ah, fuck. Instead of adding $50 (or however much that is in Robux) to his account, we were greeted by some red text and the words INVALID CODE. After a quick google it seems this is pretty common, and mostly happens when you enter the wrong parts of the code in (like using "B" when you were supposed to use "8"). But after some substitutions on the most suspect characters, we were still getting INVALID CODE.</p><p>Another popular cause for this code (according to forums and Reddit at least) appeared to be when the retailer you bought it from didn't activate it properly at the register, so we jumped in the car and drove back to the department store where we bought the card in the first place. There we were told by customer service that it <em>had </em>been activated, and that if we were having any problems to please contact <em>Roblox </em>support.</p><p>I'd been trying to avoid that, given the track record of megacorps like this when it comes to customer service, but with little other option we emailed in--there was no phone number in Australia, of course--provided the details of what we'd run into and waited for a response. Eventually a <em>Roblox </em>representative named "Freddy" got back to us and asked for some photos of the card and receipt and my son's username. It felt like we were only hours away from a resolution.</p><p>We were, just not the one we were after. "Freddy" told us that the code had already been redeemed to a different account, that was that, and to have a nice day. Freddy, we were not having a nice day. <em>We </em>had not redeemed the code, that was...why we were contacting you in the first place. My son, now distraught, kept saying "but why can't I just get my $50", and while my wife and I knew the world was more complicated than that, his basic point was correct: why couldn't he just get his $50? Despite several follow-up questions, Freddy went silent, and we received no further response from <em>Roblox</em>.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="ELYSIUM Clip - &quot;Would You Like to Talk to a Human?&quot; (2013)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/klqn7oF41dc?start=245&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Our son had done everything right. We had done everything right. We'd been right there as he opened the card and typed it in, so knew that he hadn't redeemed it to the wrong account. We'd bought the card legally, paid legal tender for it and gone to all the right places for support. And still, we were shit out of luck, through absolutely no fault of our own. We'd been wronged and, like so many other places on the internet, there was no recourse. We were left feeling powerless as customers in a way that feels decidedly and depressingly modern.</p><p>This is what happened to us, at this particular point in time and this specific scenario, but we all know what it's like. Whether it's a cancelled flight, a shopping return, insurance dilemma or an issue on Facebook, in more and more aspects of our daily lives we're running into problems that you simply cannot solve because there is not a human being there to listen to you, and emails, bots and FAQs are not up to the task. Companies that make billions in profits, with operations around the world, are selling us goods and services and failing to provide even the most basic level of customer service, and I fucking hate it.</p><p><em>Roblox</em> made over $2 <em>billion </em>last year, I'm sure they could afford an Australian call centre or two <a href="https://x.com/BBW_BFF/status/786211687686770689" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">so I could explain my passions in person</a>. Instead I get some <a href="https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/15062331967764-AUSTRALIAN-TERMS-AND-CONDITIONS-FOR-ROBLOX-GIFT-CARDS-AND-CREDITS#:~:text=The%20value%20of%20any%20lost,access%20of%20your%20Roblox%20account." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Australia-specific rules that essentially tried to wash <em>Roblox's </em>hands of it</a> and I got "Freddy", who for all "his" inflexibility and canned responses could have been an AI for all I know.</p><p>Thankfully, this story has a happy ending. After days of silence and a number of unanswered emails to <em>Roblox</em>, I reached out to the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission, our federal government's consumer watchdog. I explained to them my situation and told them I thought <em>Roblox </em>had a duty to make good on my purchase, especially since they'd been unable or unwilling to answer my follow-up questions.</p><p>A few days later--such timing!--we got an email from a different <em>Roblox </em>rep, "Debby", who broke the company's silence to tell us that "as a one time courtesy" they were going to credit my son's account with $50. You know, a <em>courtesy</em>, to just give him the thing we paid for then went to all this hassle over. </p><p>In all, this process took over two weeks. Two weeks! I could have spoken to a human and sorted this out in minutes, but no, because <em>Roblox </em>either want to save money on call centres, eliminate human conversation in their customer service entirely in order to make ripping kids off easier or both, I had to email, drive back to a department store then involve the <em>government </em>to try and get my $50 back.</p><p>And the lesson I learned at the end of it? However terrible you think <em>Roblox </em>is, whether it's because of the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/roblox-online-games-irl-fascism-roman-empire/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fascists</a> or the <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/roblox-child-gambling-lawsuit-1234808313/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">child gambling</a> or the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTMF6xEiAaY&amp;vl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">labour exploitation</a>, there are always fresh and new ways to discover it sucks!</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s been 10 years since the previous game, so fans have been waiting awhile for this installment. Like the previous games, it’s set in the fantasy world of Thedas, where you’ll create a character and lead a team of heroes against evil forces.</p><p>The Veilguard is noticeably more colorful than previous entries, which leaned toward the brown and gray end of the spectrum. Characters have a stylized, almost cartoonish, look to them — a change that’s been somewhat controversial among the fan base. However, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/veilguard-the-first-dragon-age-game-where-the-combats-actually-fun-former-exec-producer-says">combat has gotten an overhaul</a>, to the extent that the developers say it’s “actually fun” now. You control a party of three (instead of four, like in previous games), and the combat is much more action-oriented.</p><p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Dragon Age: The Veilguard - Preview Gallery</h3></div></output></p><p>In case you’re worried about a lack of story, you can allay your fears: the script for Dragon Age: The Veilguard has roughly <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-a-massive-140000-lines-of-dialogue">140,000 lines of dialogue</a>. That’s quite a bit more than Dragon Age Inquisition’s already-considerable 88,000 lines — though not as many as Baldur’s Gate 3 or Starfield.</p><p>There will be plenty of customization options, including <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-reveals-a-host-of-customizable-difficulty-options-including-the-ability-to-turn-death-off-entirely">various difficulty settings</a>, as well as the ability to turn off death entirely.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-release-date-set-for-october<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard finally has a release date. BioWare announced today that we can expect to see it out this Halloween: October 31, 2024.</p><p>This news came alongside a release date trailer showing Solas conducting a ritual that's interrupted, and a fight between the Veilguard and a group of corrupt Elf gods. Oh, and a big dragon or two, of course.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The chunky near-three minute trailer shows off plenty of the high fantasy fans can expect in the highly anticipated next Dragon Age, such as a cute little griffon, nasty big tentacle monster, and much more. Plenty of its dramatic locations are shown too, alongside a touch of signature Dragon Age romance.</p><p>We can expect a lot more information about The Veilguard in the coming weeks thanks to a roadmap published by Bioware. Next week, we'll see a "high-level combat and PC spotlight," followed by "Companions Week" the week of August 26. And in September, we'll have an IGN first for the game with tons more detail.</p><p>It's been a long road to The Veilguard's release in October. It was first announced way, <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/dragon-age-4-the-dread-wolf-rises-teaser-breakdown">way back in 2018</a>, and later that year was given the title <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/dragon-age-dreadwolf-title-and-logo-officially-revealed-ign-news">Dragon Age: Dreadwolf</a>. In 2022, we learned that an alpha build of the game was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-dreadwolf-just-hit-an-important-stage-of-development">playable from start to finish</a>, and earlier this year <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/first-dragon-age-the-veilguard-trailer-revealed-alongside-familiar-faces-xbox-showcase-2024">we finally saw the first official trailer</a> with a fall 2024 release window.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Dragon Age: The Veilguard Release Date Trailer Stills</h3></div></output><p>At the time, it was revealed that the name of the game was being <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-dreadwolf-dragon-age-the-veilguard-gameplay">changed to Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> to place more emphasis on the party of protagonists, rather than returning Dragon Age character Solas, known as the Dreadwolf.</p><p>We've since learned plenty of tidbits about what to expect. The Veilguard apparently <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-a-massive-140000-lines-of-dialogue">has 140,000 lines of dialogue</a>, will be <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-is-steam-native-so-you-dont-need-the-ea-app-to-play-the-game-on-pc">Steam-native on the storefront</a>, has <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-reveals-a-host-of-customizable-difficulty-options-including-the-ability-to-turn-death-off-entirely">customizable difficulty options</a>, and will <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-will-allow-you-to-import-your-choices-from-previous-games-through-the-character-creator">import choices made in previous games</a>. We've also <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-voice-cast-revealed-including-erika-ishii-and-more">gotten a look at the game's voice cast</a>, and we've learned that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-confirmed-to-let-you-romance-any-companion-you-want-will-include-nudity-it-gets-pretty-spicy">all possible companions will be pansexual</a>.</p><p>Along with the release date, you can now <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-dragon-age-the-veilguard">preorder Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> ahead of October.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

                <p dir="ltr">Call of Duty is known for having massive file sizes that can eat up a ton of storage, especially on older consoles like PlayStation 4, but Activision is changing this before the launch of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-release-date-beta-and-more-leak-ahead-of-xbox-showcase/1100-6524072/" data-ref-id="1100-6524072">Black Ops 6</a>. Players will also have a better control over what Call of Duty content they download.</p><p dir="ltr">A large update is arriving alongside the launch of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii/" data-ref-id="5000-597446">Modern Warfare 3</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone/" data-ref-id="5000-572198">Warzone</a>'s Season 5 Reloaded on August 21. In addition to the new seasonal content, the update includes a few extra changes meant to shrink the file size, including reorganizing the game files, separating Warzone from the default download for annual titles, and implementing new texture streaming tech.</p>

<p dir="ltr">With this new update in effect, players will only be downloading the annual Call of Duty titles they purchase, and Warzone will be a separate download that they can choose to "opt-in" and download at that time. Alternatively, they can separately download it at any time.</p><p dir="ltr">Activision says, "Flexibility and choice matter. We want to give players the choice to download each Call of Duty, including Call of Duty: Warzone, when and how they wish."</p><p dir="ltr">The smaller file sizes also come from Call of Duty expanding its usage of texture streaming. The publisher explains by saying, "With these capabilities, we can cycle content that is less frequently used by players to a streaming cache, avoiding the need to download it directly to your device's storage. Going forward, more content will be included in this cache."</p><p>Activision warns that players will see a large file size for the initial update needed to make these changes, but this download will not permanently add the stated file size that Call of Duty takes up on each device. The update will instead reorganize game files and add the new tech to prepare for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-is-replacing-its-awful-ui-before-black-ops-6/1100-6525826/" data-ref-id="1100-6525826">Call of Duty's new user interface</a> arriving in October.</p><p dir="ltr">Players on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Xbox Series S|X and PC will acquire the entire update via a single download, similar to other updates that are needed before booting up Call of Duty.</p><p dir="ltr">PlayStation 5 players have a slightly different process. PlayStation 5 users will acquire this update via four separate downloads. The initial download will be similar to other updates that are needed before booting up Call of Duty, but a second update will be triggered within the Call of Duty app after first accessing MW3 or Warzone. After the second update is completed, there will be another download when specifically re-accessing MW3 and a final download when re-accessing Warzone.</p><p dir="ltr">Activision explains this more complicated process by saying, "The PS5 requires split downloads due to differences in file organization. The initial download may be larger in size for players who also have MW2 content installed."</p><p dir="ltr">As a thank you to the community for completing this download, the publisher is gifting players with a pack of Battle Pass Tier Skips and double XP tokens. From the start of Season 5 Reloaded until the end of Season 5, players who complete the download and login will receive:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">10 - 1-Hour Double Player XP Tokens (10 Hours Total)</li><li dir="ltr">10 - 1-Hour Double Weapon XP Tokens (10 Hours Total)</li><li dir="ltr">10- Battle Pass Token Tier Skips</li></ul><p dir="ltr">These tier skips and tokens will be delivered when the player first logs into Call of Duty after completing the Season 5 Reloaded update.</p><p>Black Ops 6 was previously mentioned to be a 300GB download, but Activision confirmed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/no-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-isnt-300gb/1100-6524154/">the game's file size isn't actually that large</a>, which will be thanks to the upcoming update. However, the game size can become quite large if a player chooses to have Modern Warfare 2, Modern Warfare 3, Warzone, all relevant content packs also installed.</p><p>Players can get hands-on with Black Ops 6 during the beta later this month, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-beta-dates-how-to-get-in/1100-6524124/">here's how to get the early access</a>. Black Ops 6 releases on October 25 for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC. Live gameplay for Black Ops 6 multiplayer will be revealed during the Call of Duty: Next event on August 28.</p>

            <p>
Lonely Mountains: Downhill, the brilliantly serene/controller-snappingly infuriating mountain biking game from developer Megagon Industries, is trading its wheels for a pair of skis later this year, with the arrival of newly announced follow-up, Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders.
</p>
<p>
Much like its predecessor, Snow Riders is all about getting from up to down as elegantly and/or speedily as possible. This time, though, its gorgeous mountain vistas are blanketed in thick snow and ice, lending a different dimension to proceedings as players attempt to perform tricks, discover shortcuts, and beat their best times with a pair of skis strapped to their feet.
</p>
<p>
Once again, there'll be challenges to complete and new equipment, outfits, and tricks to unlock during play, but Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders also introduces online competitive and co-operative multiplayer across a variety of modes.

<p>
Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders doesn't have a release date yet, but there won't be too long to wait - it's currently scheduled to release for PC <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2545360/Lonely_Mountains_Snow_Riders/">via Steam</a> before the end of this year. And if it's anything like its predecessor, there's ample reason to be excited.
</p>
<p>
"It's a magic game, conjuring a sense of life from what looks like trees of folded paper, rocks made real from crinkled blankets," Christian Donlan <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-of-the-year-2019-lonely-mountains-downhill-is-a-magic-game-of-pure-sensation">wrote</a> of Lonely Mountains: Downhill back in 2019. "At times I've felt more connected to the world of this game than my own. It does that through feeling, and feeling in the simplest and purest sense. Take a corner."

		<p>Virtual Reality marque nDreams has announced a brand new shooter, Vendetta Forever, a VR love letter to classic action cinema coming to PSVR 2 and Meta Quest 2 and newer in October.</p>
<p>A five-level demo is available right now from the Meta Quest store.</p>
<p><iframe title="VENDETTA FOREVER Announce Trailer | nDreams | Meta Quest &amp; PS VR2 UNLISTED" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CGYbI-eHzbs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Building off their growing experience with VR shooters, built up on games like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/08/19/fracked-review-psvr-shooter/">Fracked</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/29/synapse-review-psvr2/">Synapse</a>, Vendetta Forever will blend together rapid-fire gunplay with acrobatic style for something a little bit different. This is thanks to the new “Lo-Kill-Motion” system, where players will have to shoot to kill and kill to move, grabbing enemy weapons as you move forward to progress through a level.</p>
<p>Levels have been constructed as maze-like puzzles for players to progress through, using improvised weaponry to takedown enemies in a bloody path to the end of the stage. There will be collectibles to find, modifiers to try-out and online leaderboards aiming to power game replayability through the more-than-60 levels.</p>

As part of that, when you download an annual <em>Call of Duty</em> game, you’ll also be able to opt in to also download <em>Warzone</em> if you want. And if you just want to download <em>Warzone</em>, that will still be an option as well.</p><p>With Season 5 Reloaded, Activision also says that it is going to rely more on texture streaming, and players will be able to pick between “optimized” (the default) or “minimal” streaming. In mid-October, Activision plans to introduce a new user interface for browsing your <em>Call of Duty</em> games, too.</p><p>But to prepare for these changes, Activision says you’re going to have to download a big update as part of the Season 5 rollout that will reorganize game files and add new tech “to prep the way for the full player interface.” After that update is done, Activision says that <em>Call of Duty</em>’s footprint will go down because of the “file optimizations.” (PlayStation 5 players will have to download a series of updates because of “differences in file organization.”)</p><div><figcaption><em>A roadmap from Activision about upcoming </em>Call of Duty<em> updates.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Activision</cite></p></div><p>Because of the updates, Activision says that <em>Black Ops 6</em> will be a “smaller download at launch than <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III.</em>” The company doesn’t have a specific download size for <em>Black Ops 6</em> yet, but it says that the estimated file sizes shown on preorder listings don’t represent the “download size or disk footprint” for the game. (Activision has already <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-isnt-300-gb-after-all">had to clarify this</a> after an Xbox store page listing showed a jaw-dropping 309.85GB download.)</p><p>Activision will also be hosting a <em>Black Ops 6</em> open beta that starts on August 30th.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Now, it's Cosmic Storms. Due for release alongside the Stellaris 3.13 Vela update on September 10th, these are a paid "mechanical expansion" (priced at a rather chunky £11, $13 or €13, and available as part of the current season pass) that builds upon the game's existing Space Storms, "providing a deeper experience with strategically meaningful gameplay and beautiful upgraded visuals". Wash that down with new civics, precursor narratives, anomalies, archaeology sites, techs, edicts, a new Ascension perk, and new galactic community resolutions.</p><!--more-->

<p>As <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/281990/view/4346621462131326207">detailed on Steam</a>, there are eight of these new and violent instances of space weather, ranging from more straightforward Electric Storms to Nexus Storms of "unparalleled magnitude". Each may have positive and negative effects upon ships, worlds and civilisations caught in their path. When they sweep over your planets, they may reshape the geography and expose long buried treasures. </p>
<p>The developers are adding a "weather map mode" so you can play, er, whatever the interstellar equivalent of a meteorologist is, forecasting storms and predicting their motion. Ah yes, Astrometeorologist! You can also research technologies and buildings that let you attract, repel and (with an Ascension Perk) even create Cosmic Storms. There's also a new Storm Chaser origin seemingly consisting of nutters in Speedo goggles, who live for the thrill of running face-first into a cyclone the size of a solar system. As for the additional Precursor narrative chains, these "weave tales of civilizations long lost to the cosmic winds, with untold secrets buried beneath the stars".</p>
<p>Storm chasers, eh? It could almost have been timed to intersect with the new Twister movie, which I haven't watched because I think the new male lead is unbearable. Go munch on a hurricane, you smug macho berk. If you enjoy storms but prefer a more hands-on experience, maybe try <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1107320/OUTBRK/">OUTBRK</a> - it's an early access simulation of North America's legendary tornado alley.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A series of statues in a glass case were displayed alongside special branding that read, “Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver I &amp; II Remastered.” But the event came and went without any official announcement from Crystal Dynamics, leaving some disappointed and others hopeful that the collection was just waiting on an official announcement at GamesCom for another event.<br></p><p>That might still be in the works, but in the meantime it seems like the only way to revisit <em>Legacy of Kain<strong>:</strong> Soul Reaver </em>in any official capacity will be dropping $100  on an Evercade (the first game is on GOG for $1 at the moment).&nbsp;<em>Soul Reaver </em>was removed from Steam in 2021, and the original game has never been available on modern platforms. The three later entries in the series, <em>Soul Reaver 2</em>, <em>Blood Omen 2</em>, and<em> Legacy of Kain: Defiance</em> are also still available to play on PC currently. I’m sure the collection for the first two games will land their eventually as well. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It takes everything beloved about top-tier virtual reality action, jettisons the dull stuff, and lets players cut to the good part for 100 percent uncut gunplay purity.</p><p><em>VENDETTA FOREVER</em> is powered by the all-new LO-KILL-MOTION system. Players shoot to kill and kill to move—dispatching foes, then acrobatically grabbing their weapon as you zip forward to progress. Rampaging through the maze-like arenas becomes a strategic dance of gunplay and improvised weaponry, with each takedown taking players closer to the finish line.</p><p>There are collectibles to discover, game-changing modifiers to try out, and online leaderboards to dominate. From raucous saloon shoot-outs to high-tech hijackings, each moment across <em>VENDETTA FOREVER</em>‘s 60-plus unique levels is a chance to live your action movie power fantasy, all set to a pounding synthetic soundtrack.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p><!-- AD: content -->

                <p>Legendary's cinematic Monsterverse is set to enter the realm of video games in a big way later this year following the success of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/godzilla-x-kong-the-new-empire-has-monster-sized-box-office-debut/1100-6522293/" data-ref-id="1100-6522293">Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire at the box office</a>, with three Monsterverse games set to release in the back half of 2024.</p><p dir="ltr">One of those upcoming titles is the newly announced Kong: Survivor Instinct, described as a 2.5D action-adventure game set during and after the events of 2021's Godzilla vs. Kong. The game will see players take on the role of a father searching for his lost daughter through the wreckage left in the wake of Kong and Godzilla's battle. Of the three upcoming games, Kong: Survivor Instinct will be the only one released as a standalone product on PC and current-gen consoles.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTU_A1MsjfY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CTU_A1MsjfY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">In a press release, 7Levels co-founder Paweł Biela said working with the Monsterverse IP has been a "formative experience" for the developer, and that the game will allow the team to "show some of the fan-favorite Titans from a unique perspective."</p><p dir="ltr">As for the other two Monsterverse games on the way, one will be inside <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/roblox-game-client/" data-ref-id="5000-451936">Roblox</a>, where players will be able to "become Monarch operatives" and interact with various Titans in an interactive experience. The other is a 4X mobile strategy game, Godzilla x Kong: Titan Chasers. Developed by Hunted Cow Games and published by Tilting Point LLC, players in Godzilla x Kong: Titan Chasers will build bases, recruit Titan Chasers, and battle it out in turn-based combat with monsters on the newly emerged Siren Isles. When players aren't fighting monsters, they'll also be finding ways to engage with and support Godzilla and Kong themselves. The game is already playable in certain regions but will be releasing globally soon.</p><p dir="ltr">"The Siren Isles are just a small sliver of the world created by the films, but the story that will be uncovered, and the conflict unleashed by players and their competing alliances, promises to be no less momentous," Tomas Gonzales, Tilting Point senior game manager, said in a press release.</p><p dir="ltr">No exact release dates have been given for the three Monsterverse games, other than the news that they will each release in 2024.</p><p dir="ltr">As for when the Monsterverse will return to the big screen, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-3-may-be-coming-out-in-2026-next-monsterverse-movie-gets-2027-release-date/1100-6524604/" data-ref-id="1100-6524604">next film in the series is slated for a March 26, 2027 release</a> and will be directed by Grant Sputore.</p>
