			<p>Xbox president Sarah Bond was recently featured in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDmwJ7tuoD8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lengthy video interview with Mashable</a> as part of the press tour for the launch of the ROG Xbox Ally X (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which we reviewed here</a>). We already covered her comment <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-console-will-be-very-premium-very-high-end-curated-experience-says-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">about the next-generation console being 'very premium and very high-end'</a>, but there's also another interesting tidbit in that interview: Bond's statement about game exclusives, which she labeled as antiquated.  </p>



<p><em>We're really seeing people evolve way past that. Like the biggest games in the world are available everywhere. You look at Call of Duty, you look at Minecraft, you look at Fortnite, you look at Roblox. That's actually what's really driving community in gaming. That's where people gather. They have experiences. And the idea of locking it to one store or one device is antiquated for most people. You want to be able to play with your friends anywhere regardless of what they're on. And we're really leaning into that with this experience because it just opens up another way for you to play. As does cloud, as does PC, as does the consoles that we all own and have in our living room.</em></p>



<p>Bond's statement comes as no surprise given Microsoft's u-turn on exclusives. Xbox did attempt to pursue exclusives for its Xbox consoles for around fifteen years or so, even going as far as making pricey deals with Japanese developers for games like Ninja Gaiden, Lost Odyssey, Blue Dragon, and Ace Combat 6 to name a few.</p>



<p>However, that effort eventually dwindled down alongside the Xbox One's weak exclusives output. In 2016, Microsoft started bringing all its exclusive games to Windows PC, <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-pushed-quantum-break-pc-delay-microsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beginning with Remedy's Quantum Break</a>. That was the first extension of what an Xbox was. Much more recent is their choice to port first-party games to rival consoles like Sony's PlayStation and Nintendo's Switch. This major strategy shift took place in February 2024, when following a series of rumors Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-indiana-jones-not-going-multiplatform-4-older-xbox-titles-will/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that Obsidian's Grounded and Pentiment, Rare's Sea of Thieves, and Tango's Hi-Fi Rush would be released on the PS4/5 and/or Switch.</p>



<p>Many more games have since followed, including Gears of War: Reloaded, Forza Horizon 5, Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition, Senua's Saga: Hellblade II, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, and DOOM: The Dark Ages. This month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ninja-gaiden-4-bathed-in-blood/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ninja Gaiden 4</a> and The Outer Worlds 2 will launch day and date on PS5, Xbox, and PC.</p>



<p>Microsoft is really now looking to bring its games to as many devices as possible, but that's because, as they <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-has-lost-the-console-wars-next-gen-consoles-2028/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">candidly admitted in 2023</a>, they have lost the console wars. Sarah Bond also mentioned live service games, which certainly benefit from being available on the widest possible amount of platforms, but Sony and Nintendo, especially the latter, still put a lot of importance in non-live service games which can definitely boost hardware sales when exclusive to their console.</p>



<p>On one hand, I do wish all games were released across all platforms immediately. It would certainly be a big win for all gamers. On the other, I understand Sony and Nintendo's current stance, even though the former is already slowly moving toward multiplatform releases.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Players Are Arguing About Unrealistic Skins Again]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-wicked-grin-skin-argument/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-players-are-arguing-about-unrealistic-skins-again.1332415/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6’s first season approaches, and in the run-up to the inevitable drop, fans have started discussing the content coming in the impending update. One of the key points of contention involves a new <strong>blue </strong>skin, dubbed ‘Wicked Grin’. It’s one of the least unrealistic skins showcased so far for Battlefield 6, and some fans feel it’s the beginning of the end.</p>



<p>It has gotten to the point of a fierce debate on social platforms, with some diehard fans berating Electronic Arts and all associated studios for ‘already tainting’ Battlefield 6 with bizarre skins.</p>



<p>Do you think it’s that bad?</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-s-wicked-grin-skin-is-causing-fights">Battlefield 6’s Wicked Grin Skin is Causing Fights</h2>



<p>On social media, users shared images of the blue Wicked Grin skin, coming to Battlefield 6 with the season one update and assumedly being part of some Halloween-themed campaign.</p>



<p>It’s the most divisive skin yet, even more so than the skin that boasted some <strong>bright green elements </strong>that split the community down the middle a couple of weeks ago.</p>



<p>EA DICE announced that Battlefield 6 would be much more grounded ahead of release, and some have condemned the studio for already breaking that promise, less than two weeks after the launch of the game. Battlefield 6 has proven to be a marvel so far, with the community loving almost everything on offer, but these potentially destructive skins are not going down well with fans.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oddt46/grounded_skins_for_a_while_18_days_exactly/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">On Reddit</a>, one user wrote, ‘Man, that looks f***ing dumb,’ while another asked, ‘Why is it so much to ask for just regular military uniforms? Nobody is using this s***.’</p>



<p>Others defended the skin: ‘This is cherry-picked from a large selection of mostly regular military outfits. This sub is a cesspool, so I expect no different, but this is laughably misrepresented.’</p>



<p>Some have argued that it’s ‘far more grounded’ than some of the most inane Call of Duty skins, such as the Beavis and Butthead and Nicki Minaj crossovers that brought <strong>the strangest outfits </strong>to the Activision-backed shooter.</p>



<p>Do you think the Wicked Grin skin is so awful that you won’t want to see anyone wearing it in Battlefield 6? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> what you’re thinking.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-day-2025-what-to-expect/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/it%E2%80%99s-fallout-day-2025%E2%80%94here%E2%80%99s-what-to-expect.1332406/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Every year on October 23, the Fallout community comes together to celebrate Fallout Day, an official tribute to the franchise that recognizes the date in the game’s universe on which <strong>the bombs fell</strong>. It was the spark that ignited The Great War, bringing about the end of the world and the start of the Fallout franchise.</p>



<p>This year, the rumors have been circulating like wildfire, with many believing that Bethesda Game Studios is about to reveal a remaster of Fallout 3 or Fallout: New Vegas. We know a few things that are happening this Fallout Day, but what’s set to unravel as the day goes on?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-fallout-3-remastered-being-revealed-today">Is Fallout 3 Remastered Being Revealed Today?</h2>



<p>It’s Fallout Day, and that means a few things.</p>



<p>First, it means that Fallout fans worldwide are diving into their favorite post-apocalyptic games, soaking up the irradiated action that has evolved over the last quarter of a century. Second, it means that special streams, offers, and reveals are set to drop.</p>



<p>Later today, Bethesda Game Studios will host a special Fallout Day broadcast, and the consensus is that a new game, such as Fallout 3 Remastered or New Vegas Remastered, will be unveiled.</p>



<p>Some have even theorized that a Fallout Shelter 2 will shadowdrop.</p>



<p>In a recent post on social media, the Fallout team revealed a glimpse of what’s coming this Fallout Day:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Fallout Day is almost here! Tomorrow at 1 PM ET, join us for a special broadcast packed with:</p><p>✅ Fallout 76: Burning Springs Updates<br>✅ Fallout Shelter<br>✅ Fallout 4 and Creations<br>✅ New Merch Drops<br>✅ Community In-Person Events<br>✅ And a post-show celebrating the community! <a href="https://t.co/kcNTLrSf8E">pic.twitter.com/kcNTLrSf8E</a></p></div>— Fallout (@Fallout) <a href="https://twitter.com/Fallout/status/1981020245226594611?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>Let’s break down that list.</p>



<p><strong>Fallout 76: Burning Springs </strong>is likely a more in-depth look at the upcoming expansion, which brings Walton Goggins’ character ‘The Ghoul’ from the television show to the game.</p>



<p><strong>Fallout Shelter </strong>is seen by many as the sudden unveiling of a new release to expand the best-selling mobile-first game, but it’s more likely a new update of sorts or a limited-time event.</p>



<p><strong>Fallout 4 and Creations </strong>is the outlier in the list, as nobody is sure of what that means. It could be more officially-backed mods finding their way into the Creations platform on Fallout 4, or it could be something else entirely. Last year, Fallout 4 received a current-gen upgrade, and nothing has really changed since then. In just a couple of weeks, Fallout 4 will hit its <strong>tenth anniversary</strong>.</p>



<p>Maybe we’ll see a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-4-anniversary-edition-this-november/">Fallout 4: 10th Anniversary Edition</a>… Who knows?</p>



<p>New merchandise is available for fans to purchase, and a limited-time 40% discount is available in the Bethesda Gear Store. Also, a special post-show has been announced, set up to celebrate <strong>the community</strong> behind Fallout. This will be backed by the Fallout for Hope charity initiative and will last at least three hours.</p>



<h2 id="h-where-to-watch-fallout-day-2025-stream">Where to Watch Fallout Day 2025 Stream</h2>



<p>The easiest way to watch Fallout Day 2025 is via <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/bethesda" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bethesda Game Studios’ Twitch channel</a>. This is where the official stream will run, and if you miss it, you can check out the VOD to catch up on what was announced.</p>



<p><strong>Here’s when to watch Fallout Day 2025:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>1 PM ET</li>



<li>6 PM BST</li>



<li>10 AM PT</li>



<li>7 PM CEST</li>
</ul>

<p>Two new unlisted Switch 2 lifestyle commercials for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> have been spotted on Nintendo's official YouTube page. They're titled "Power Up Your Holidays", so we'll seemingly be seeing them in the lead up to the Christmas season.</p>
<p>Although these new trailers are only around 16 seconds each and spend a lot of that time focused on the player, they apparently include some <strong>spoilers</strong> about Samus' new adventure – so we would advise you navigate away from this page right now if you don't want to ruin any surprises for yourself.</p>
<p>Right, with this warning out of the way, you can see two bosses. One is called Xelios (a new "spherical" boss) and the other is known as Carvex (a "plant" boss which you might have already seen). We've taken screen captures, just in case Nintendo's trailers end up disappearing. You can see them at the bottom of these videos:</p>



<p>Nintendo has also ramped up its coverage of all-things Metroid this week with a bunch of <em>other</em> Metroid-related announcements. This includes the release of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/metroid_ii_return_of_samus">Metroid II</a> soundtrack on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_music">Nintendo Music</a>, and also some promotion of the upcoming Metroid Prime 1-3 art book. Nintendo has added a new Metroid reward to the My Nintendo Store, too.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Woojer Strap 4 Review—Small Size, Mighty Feedback]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/woojer-strap-4-review-mighty-feedback/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/woojer-strap-4-review%E2%80%94small-size-mighty-feedback.1332397/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>I received a Woojer Strap 4 alongside the Woojer Vest 4, and I was eager to see how the two devices stacked up against one another. While the Woojer Vest 4 is reserved more for immersive VR experiences, the Strap 4 is a more compact, simpler device that offers a scaled-down feedback experience.</p>



<p>What I found was that the Woojer Strap 4 shouldn’t be discredited just because it’s a smaller thing. This haptic feedback device offers a punchy solution for <strong>feeling audio</strong>, and whether you use it for games or music, you’ll be impressed with what it can do.</p>



<p>Read on to check out my full Woojer Strap 4 review.</p>



<h2 id="h-woojer-strap-4-is-energy-in-a-compact-package">Woojer Strap 4 is Energy in a Compact Package</h2>



<p>While the Woojer Vest 4 (<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/woojer-vest-4-review-new-generation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which I also reviewed</a>) is a full upper body solution, the Woojer Strap 4 is a single, simple, and discrete device that offers immense versatility. It’s designed to be used however you want, and with that in mind, it can be worn in several ways. Whether you want a low-cost immersion element for VR or something to enhance your enjoyment of music, this is it.</p>



<p>The Strap 4 is less than half the price of the full Woojer Vest 4, so it’s a no-brainer if you want an introduction to the haptic world without breaking the bank. You’ll be paying around $125 for the strap, which comes in a range of colorways and themes, and there are even some special edition straps featuring branding from top games like Black Ops 7 and Fortnite.</p>



<p>Once you’ve unboxed your Woojer Strap 4, you’ll find that the setup process is so swift and simple, and the Woojer app allows full customization of the device where sound profiles, inputs and outputs, and RGB layouts are concerned.</p>



<p>Putting on the Strap 4 takes seconds, and it’s designed to fit all body types. Even my larger frame was perfectly comfortable enveloped by the Strap 4. Once on, you’ll start blasting sound through the Strap 4, noticing how the punchy transducer translates all inputted sound into powerful, vibration-based haptic feedback.</p>



<p>It’s weird at first, but stick with it.</p>



<p>On a single charge, the Woojer Strap 4 can last around ten hours, which is about the same amount of time as you’d get with the Vest 4, only the Strap 4 takes less time to recharge. It’s a diverse thing that can be connected wirelessly via Bluetooth or wired with a range of inputs that accommodate almost every kind of device you might want to use.</p>



<p>At just 240 g, you’ll hardly notice the Woojer Strap 4, but you’ll feel those audio cues without a doubt. At the highest sensitivity, the Strap 4 will hit like a 12-gauge alongside certain sound profiles. I used the Strap 4 with a variety of games, but like the Vest 4, it felt the best for me with an explosive first-person shooter like Battlefield 6 or Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>You really do feel every shot, explosion, and punch.</p>



<p>It might seem like a bit of a gimmick, but if you want the most immersive gaming solutions possible, something like the Woojer Strap 4 should be right up your street.</p>



<p>Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.gg/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if the Woojer Strap 4 sounds like your kind of technology.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/woojer-vest-4-review%E2%80%94new-generation-same-great-feeling.1332388/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Woojer is back with another iteration of the Vest, an innovative haptic device that allows you to feel the games you play. It’s a somewhat comical device at first blush that reveals itself as something quite impressive on use, and having <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/woojer-haptic-vest-feel-games-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">used the Woojer Vest 3</a> a year ago, I can attest to the Woojer Vest 4 being an evolution of sorts.</p>



<p>With the Woojer Vest 4, users can secure punchy haptic feedback from any audio experience, but it’s marketed much more for <strong>gaming</strong>. That’s where I connected with the Woojer Vest 4, linking up with some pulse-pounding games to get the most out of this device.</p>



<p>Is the Woojer Vest 4 worth it? Find out in this snapshot review.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-woojer-vest-4-any-good">Is The Woojer Vest 4 Any Good?</h2>



<p>I was very familiar with Woojer, having used the Vest 3 for many hours across desktop and VR gaming experiences. It was a seamless transition into the Vest 4, which takes on mostly the same form and function but boasts a few changes. I noticed that it <strong>felt more comfortable </strong>to wear, despite there being few differences in the makeup of the Vest itself.</p>



<p>As I mentioned, the Woojer Vest 4 might look funny at first glance, but there’s a lot of clever technology lurking under the surface. This haptic device boasts six transducers that offer immensely powerful and physical feedback when playing games.</p>



<p>In case you’re unfamiliar with the concept, the Woojer Vest 4 offers physical and haptic feedback in collaboration with the sound emitted from your games, music, and movies. It takes an input and cleverly translates that into vibration and shocking feedback, allowing you to feel, at multiple points around your body, the sound that you’re hearing.</p>



<p>I was eager to use the Woojer Vest 4 in a few rounds of <strong>Battlefield 6</strong>, so I connected the device to my PC and linked it with my <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/astro-a50-wireless-headset-review/">Astro A50 headset</a> and <strong>felt every gunshot, explosion, and rumble of tank tracks</strong>.</p>



<p>If there’s one complaint I have about the Woojer Vest 4, it’s that the latency is a bit off-putting for reflexive gameplay, and even the in-built low-latency mode that can be activated via the Woojer app doesn’t change much.</p>



<p>That being said, it wasn’t a deal-breaker. The Woojer Vest 4 is truly a one-size-fits-all device, and it even accommodated my much larger frame for several hours (note: battery life is advertised as 10 hours maximum). If you play VR in tandem with the Woojer Vest 4 (like I did), you’ll get a little toasty under the device, but it’s designed to be as breathable as possible.</p>



<p>If you’ve never seen or used a Woojer Vest, you’ll quickly get to grips with the Vest 4. It’s easy to use, comes with handy start-up guides, and has an app with a clean UI that makes it a wonder to use. The front-facing control unit is easy to reach, there’s a nice spot of RGB lighting, and the inputs are tactile.</p>



<p>There are so few things I found that turned me off from the Woojer Vest 4. Even the price point has come down from the near $500 heights of the Woojer Vest 3. It’s now floating around $340, which is more comfortable. Talking of comfort, the Vest 4 comes in at around 1.6 kg, which is nothing when you consider the weight is distributed around your back, shoulders, and chest.</p>



<p>If you’re a VR fan and want to make your experiences much more immersive, I’d say the Woojer Vest 4 is an easy buy. If you’re a console or desktop-based gamer, it’s perhaps less worthwhile, and if you’re interested in getting the vest for movies or music, I’d probably suggest reconsidering that decision.</p>



<p>Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.gg/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if the Woojer Vest 4 sounds like your kind of technology.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Sound Blaster Katana V2X ‘gaming soundbar’ ticked more than a few boxes for me. It was punchy, easy to use, and it had a tasty splash of RGB that made it a tantalising pick for any gamer. When I was putting together my Katana V2X review, I put this two-part soundbar through its paces, and I’m pleased to say that it impressed me in every aspect.</p>



<p>The Sound Blaster Katana V2X from Creative is the culmination of decades of work in the audio space, and it’s a compact yet powerful thing that looks great and works with just about any device you connect to it.</p>



<p>Read on to scope out my full review of the Sound Blaster Katana V2X soundbar.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-katana-v2x-soundbar-is-power-in-a-small-package">The Katana V2X Soundbar is Power in a Small Package</h2>



<p>The Sound Blaster Katana V2X is a perfectly sized solution for gamers short on space but eager to achieve some of the best audio results possible. The soundbar measures just 600mm by 95mm and has a height profile of just 62mm, which means it should fit nicely in front of, under, or behind any setup, television or otherwise.</p>



<p>This soundbar comes with a company subwoofer that’s 423mm tall, 250mm deep, and 116mm wide, and despite that scaled-down size factor, I found it to be a <strong>very </strong>capable piece of equipment. It adds a tasty touch of bass to the core soundbar without needing anything more than a coaxial connection to the back of the device.</p>



<p>Let’s talk about that sound power.</p>



<p>The Katana V2X soundbar boasts tri-amplified amps and represents an evolution of the earlier models of the same soundbar. It has two mid-range drivers, two tweeters, and the bolt-on subwoofer drive, all of which combine to produce a deep audio range, cinematic diversity, and stunning clarity.</p>



<p>It doesn’t take much to run the Katana V2X soundbar, and you can connect it to <strong>almost anything </strong>via Bluetooth 5.0, HDMI ARC, optical, aux, and USB-C. I would be blasting music via my phone in one minute, then pressing a single button and connecting to a PS5 in the next.</p>



<p>This multi-functional soundbar even has built-in microphones, which is a nice-to-have rather than a need-to-have. It’s all customizable too, and the sound profiles, RGB strip, and saved settings can all be tweaked.</p>



<p>Creative has been in the business of audio technology since 1981, and the Sound Blaster technology has been tried, tested, and optimized over <strong>many</strong> <strong>years</strong>. It’s now at a point where the Katana V2X soundbar should be considered one of the best gaming soundbars you can get for the price.</p>



<p>If you’re interested in the Katana V2X soundbar, it’ll set you back around $259 – $280, depending on where you buy it. I’d say it’s worth every penny, especially if you’re looking for a compact yet powerful audio solution, preferably being twinned with a TV and home console arrangement.</p>

So, what about <strong>Tales of Xillia 2</strong>?</p>
<p>According to a new Famitsu interview, series director Yusuke Tomizawa has mentioned how a remaster of the sequel is "still in progress" – it just hasn't been formally announced yet, and he promises to share more information as soon as possible (translations via Gematsu):</p>
<blockquote>

<p>As for the "next remastered title" in the fantasy role-playing series, the team can't "provide the specifics" just yet, but the announcement is planned to take place "relatively soon". It's also mentioned how there are "more than two titles" currently in progress.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The pace of releases depends on the planning and development status—it could speed up or slow down. But even so, we’re hoping to deliver the fans as many titles as possible, as quickly as possible.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>PowerWash Simulator 2 has revealed its roadmap for 2026 ahead of its release and hints at some new free and paid DLC.</p>



<p>If you enjoy cozy games, PowerWash Simulator is a familiar name to all. The simple maintenance simulator took the world by storm in 2022, getting everyone to do something many hate doing: cleaning. With its huge popularity, the game teamed up with iconic IPs like Tomb Raider, Final Fantasy, and even <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-indie-world-showcase-august-2024-every-game-shown/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shrek</a>. A sequel was announced earlier this year, with a release date <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/powerwash-simulator-2-release-date-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed just this month</a>. Now, with its release in a few hours, Futurlabs has shown off its planned roadmap for 2026, as well as how it’ll spend 2025.</p>



<h2 id="h-powerwash-simulator-planning-three-major-paid-free-dlc-in-2026-teases-crossovers">PowerWash Simulator Planning Three Major Paid + Free DLC in 2026, Teases Crossovers</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We have our PowerWash Simulator 2 Roadmap to share with you all 💦</p><p>Coming in 2025/2026 ⤵️</p><p>– 3 Paid IP DLC<br>– 3 Free Caldera Chronicles Jobs<br>– A bucket full of other planned additions</p><p>For the rest of 2025 we’re focusing on fixes, further optimisations and QOL improvements! <a href="https://t.co/eUOk2bfEzP">pic.twitter.com/eUOk2bfEzP</a></p></div>— PowerWash Simulator (@PowerWashSim) <a href="https://twitter.com/PowerWashSim/status/1980972487199379614?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In a post from PowerWash Simulator’s <a href="https://x.com/PowerWashSim/status/1980972487199379614" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official Twitter/X account</a>, the roadmap for 2026 is now available. As shown above, the team plans to have new paid and free DLC every quarter, starting with Q1. No specifics were given for what to expect, but the free DLC, called the Caldera Chronicles, will likely be similar to the original’s Muckingham Files. As for the paid DLC, it’ll be based on other IPs, so we may see some zany crossovers like last time. </p>



<p>Additionally, updates to the game, including community events and costumes, will be added over time. No DLC or new content is coming out in 2025, as the team plans to focus on QoL and optimization fixes. Reviews for PowerWash Simulator 2 came out today, and, for many, it maintains the charm and fun the original did. Given how much of a sleeper hit it was, its sequel may just give it the attention it deserves. Plus, with a Day One release on Xbox Game Pass, it’s sure to keep many of us company (and make us clean freaks again).</p>



<p>Are you excited for PowerWash Simulator 2? What do you hope becomes DLC? Did you enjoy the original? Let us know in the comments and on <a href="https://discord.gg/Bhv3AMa5a9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Sonic Rumble is making its way to PC and mobile devices in early November.</p>



<p>The party royale game, which capitalizes on Fall Guys’ success, has been in development for quite some time. Gameplay consists of players choosing their favorite Sonic characters and duking it out with others in fun and interesting mini-games. Despite positive feedback from early playtests, Sonic Rumble was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-rumble-delayed-yet-again-by-sega/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">met with multiple delays</a>. Earlier this month, however, it was announced that the game would release in November. Now, we finally have the official release date, as well as a cool new trailer to debut it.</p>



<h2 id="h-sonic-rumble-sets-november-5th-2025-release-date">Sonic Rumble Sets November 5th, 2025 Release Date</h2>

</p></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://youtu.be/ZSF2uZ7W5Ac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a short YouTube video</a>, SEGA and Sonic Team officially reveal the release date for Sonic Rumble: <strong>November 5th</strong>. The game will launch on Steam, Google Play, and the Apple App Store, with pre-registration available now. Currently, there are no announced plans to bring the game to consoles like Nintendo Switch 2. Regardless, given its successful playtests, it may very well happen. Plus, given the popularity of similar titles like Fall Guys and the Sonic brand, it’ll likely gain some attention.</p>



<p>The last update for Sonic Rumble <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-rumble-pc-mobile-launch-november-2025/">provided some insight</a> as to what the full release will look and play like. With the playtests, the development team took the feedback from fans and fine-tuned many elements. For example, the progression and rewards system is now more streamlined, as well as an overhaul of the game’s user interface and onboarding. In addition, many new features like skills and joinable Crews with friends add more to the competitive side of the title. While it has taken a while for it to arrive, Sonic Rumble will finally see the light of day, and it won’t be long until we get to see how it goes.</p>

But even so, we’re hoping to deliver the fans as many titles as possible, as quickly as possible.”</p><p>Asked if that means the next remastered project will be announced soon, Tomizawa said, “I’m unfortunately unable to provide specifics about the next title yet. But the timing of the next remastered title announcement should be relatively soon… or at least, that’s the plan.”</p><p>As for a remastered <em>Tales of Xillia 2</em>, Tomizawa said, “As mentioned earlier, we’re following an ‘announce and release what’s ready quickly’ approach. In that vein, <em>Xillia 2</em> is still in progress, which is why it hasn’t been announced. We will do our best to deliver updates as quickly as possible.”</p><p>While there has not been a brand-new entry in the <em>Tales of</em> series since 2021’s <em><a title="Games > Tales of Arise [47 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/tales-of-arise">Tales of Arise</a></em>, which received a post-game story expansion called “Beyond the Dawn” in 2023, Tomizawa said, “As the <em>Tales of</em> series development team—as we always have throughout the history of the series—we continue to think about and work on new titles.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Home security used to mean signing expensive contracts with professional monitoring companies, paying installation fees and dealing with clunky equipment bolted to your walls. Ring changed that equation entirely by putting professional-grade security into a DIY package that anyone can install in an afternoon: The Ring Alarm 14-piece kit gives you comprehensive <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4931/">coverage for a typical 2 to 4 bedroom home, and right now it’s down to just $198 on Amazon, slashed from its regular $329 price</a> (40% off). This is an all-time low for a complete system that would cost you thousands in installation fees and monthly contracts with traditional security companies.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4931/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>What You Need for Full House Coverage</h2>
<p>This 14-piece system comes fully equipped with everything you’ll need to construct a strong security network all the way through your home. You <strong>get one base station, the system’s central brain, which connects all of your sensors</strong> and communicates through your smartphone via your home Wi-Fi network. Two keypads allow you to arm and disarm the system from two locations which is absolutely convenient where you have entries on different floors or want one on the bedroom for nighttime arming.</p>
<p>Eight contact sensors cover your doors and windows and they sense the exact moment the door or window gets opened. Two motion detectors provide extra security by detecting movement inside your home, catching burglars who would go around the entryways. You get a range extender so your signal gets through every corner of your home, even though your home has solid construction or your sensors are significantly far from the base station.</p>



<p>The contact sensor are simple but effective devices that mount in seconds using adhesive strips, avoiding any need for drilling or wiring. Each sensor has two parts: one attaches to the door or window frame, the other to the moving part. A magnetic connection keeps them talking to each other, and the moment that connection breaks because a door opens, the alarm triggers.</p>
<p>Motion detectors cover larger spaces like hallways, living rooms or basements: They use passive infrared technology to detect heat signatures from moving bodies, giving you interior protection even if someone manages to enter without triggering a contact sensor. The detection angle is wide enough to monitor an entire room from a corner mount, and they’re smart enough to distinguish between your pet cat and an actual person, reducing false alarms.</p>



<p>You get <strong>automatic cell phone notifications the second any sensor activates through the Ring app</strong>. You’ll be able to disarm and arm the system from your computer, view the status of the individual sensors, and view your security history to know definitively when doors opened or motion occurred. The app interface is intuitive and responsive, providing you total command anywhere you have cell reception.</p>
<p>It <strong>works seamlessly with Alexa</strong>&nbsp;so you are able to arm or disarm by issuing commands through any Echo device using your voice. Simple commands such as “Alexa, arm Ring Alarm in away mode” handle the whole procedure all by themselves. This <strong>voice integration becomes second nature soon</strong>&nbsp;whenever your grocery-stuffed hands are full or you are going to bed.</p>
<p>At $198 for complete coverage of a multi-bedroom home, this beats the economics of traditional security systems by a landslide.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/jackery-1500w-power-station-is-going-for-peanuts-and-amazon-adds-2-free-solar-panels-on-top-2000638342</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/jackery-1500w-power-station-is-going-for-peanuts-and-amazon-adds-2-free-solar-panels-on-top.1332271/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Power outages, camping trips or simply wanting energy independence at home all share one common need: reliable portable power that doesn’t tie you to the grid. The Jackery Explorer 1000 solves this problem beautifully and right now Amazon is offering an incredible deal that changes the game entirely: The power station normally retails for $799 on its own, but <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4930/">Amazon has slashed it down to $699 and is throwing in two 100W solar panels completely free</a>. That <strong>bundle would typically cost you $1,299, meaning you’re saving a massive $600 on this package</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4930/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why Is This Generation Station Different From Others?</h2>
<p>The Explorer 1000 represents a major upgrade from Jackery previous products: LiFePO4 battery chemistry on this item produces <strong>4,000 charge cycles and yet delivers 70% of original capacity</strong>&nbsp;or roughly 10 years of typical use. Compare this to previous lithium-ion products, which eventually start to fade even after 500 to 800 cycles, and you’ll understand why this style of battery chemistry is rapidly becoming the industry standard for heavy-duty portable power use. That long life translates to your purchase today still keeping your gear powered 10 years later.</p>
<p>The 1,070Wh capacity provides you with extensive runtime on multiple devices: You’ll be able to power a full-size refrigerator for approximately 10 hours, charge a laptop approximately 10 times or power a portable AC unit for several hours through a hot summer power outage. The <strong>unit supplies clean 1,500W of uninterruptible AC power continuously</strong> through three pure sine wave outlets, and <strong>3,000W of surge to power appliances</strong> and devices with high startup surges like power tools or air compressor appliances. Pure sine wave output is essential because it emulates the power you get from your household outlet, and it prevents the damage of computer equipment and new appliances.</p>



<p>The charge rate on this unit is absolutely stellar: Plug into any standard household outlet and you’ll be <strong>topped off 100% within the hou</strong>r thanks to the advanced ChargeShield 2.0 technology. That’s 7.5 times the charge rate of the original Explorer 1000 (v1) model and makes all the difference should you need to recharge rapidly between uses. Two 100W included solar panels recharge the unit 100% within 6 to 8 hours of favorable sunlight, giving you 100% fully off-grid power generation. These collapsible panels are compact and lightweight enough to bring along on any adventure and rugged enough to handle the elements.</p>
<p>Port selection keeps all your current charging demands met, thanks to <strong>three AC plugs, two 100W USB-C ports for fast laptop and tablet charging, one USB-A, and 12V auto port for accessories</strong>. That 100W USB-C outlet is strong enough to charge through a MacBook Pro full speed without the use of any of those big power adapters. You’ll be<strong> able to charge six gadgets all at once</strong>&nbsp;and this makes it ideal for camping excursions with the family or even as an emergency power hub.</p>



<p><strong>Weighing only 23.8 pounds</strong>, this power station remains light even though it packs a big punch. Its ergonomic handle ensures it can be conveniently moved from your automobile to your campsite or down the storm cellar. Its compact size won’t hog your valuable trunk space on long car rides or dominate your storage closet inside the house.</p>
<p>At $699 with two solar panels included, you’re getting emergency preparedness, camping power and energy independence for less than many standalone power stations cost without any solar capability.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-droideka-model-is-selling-for-pennies-star-wars-droid-figure-has-never-been-this-cheap-2000638337</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lego-droideka-model-is-selling-for-pennies-star-wars-droid-figure-has-never-been-this-cheap.1332250/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’ve ever watched Star Wars and found yourself mesmerized by those rolling, shield-generating battle droids that gave the Jedi such a hard time, you’re definitely not alone. The <strong>Droideka</strong> has always been one of the most visually striking droids in the entire saga with its menacing tripod stance and devastating firepower.</p>
<p>Now LEGO brings this iconic destroyer droid to life in a way that lets you display it proudly on your desk or shelf. And here’s the kicker: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4929/">this premium collectible is currently down to just $48 on Amazon, slashed from its original $64 price tag</a>. This is the first time this set has gone on sale since its release, and with a stellar 4.9 out of 5 star rating, it might run out of stock quickly.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4929/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why should you pay attention to this Droideka?</h2>
<p>The LEGO Star Wars Droideka brings interactivity to your collection with <strong>movable arms that replicate the realistic shooting motion</strong> these droids are famous for in <em>The Phantom Menace </em>and<em> The Clone Wars</em>. You can pose it in full attack mode, arms extended and ready to unleash a barrage of blaster fire or you can fold it into its iconic ball configuration for that classic rolling transport mode.</p>



<p>The construction of the build itself is very rewarding for the adult constructor looking for something interesting but not intimidating. Articulation points are well-crafted and provide solid movement within the arm joints without the flimsiness or looseness. You are able to remove and reattach the legs easily which makes the wheel transformation seamless and natural.</p>
<p>Apart from the actual main Droideka model, the set comes with thoughtful additional pieces to make it go beyond just an ordinary build and become an actual display item. You receive your<strong> own exclusive stand</strong> along with an information plaque to provide context of the Droideka within Star Wars history. You also get a <strong>special Lego Star Wars 25th-anniversary brick</strong> to commemorate a quarter century of the popular sets. For good measure, the set even comes with your own buildable, but smaller, Droideka model to sit atop the display stand.</p>



<p>The color scheme remains true to the original with metallic and bronze shades that evoke the threatening demeanor of these war droids. They are proportioned just right too, the tapered shield generators and signature head shape instantly recognizable to any Star Wars buff. That attention to detail makes it ideal for display with your other Star Wars collectibles or even just as a display item that’ll spark conversations.</p>
<p>At this lower price, you are getting wonderful value for the upscale LEGO set designed specifically for adult fans. That original price of $64 was already quite reasonable for the number of pieces and quality of display, but at $48, this is the absolute bargain for any Star Wars fans.</p>

In a statement sent to <em>The Verge </em>on Fandom’s behalf, Katie Schroeder confirmed Miller’s departure and noted that, while the company is currently being overseen by interim leadership, “we have not announced a new CEO as of yet.”</p><p>After leaving StubHub to <a href="https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/fandom-perkins-miller-ceo-1203129212/">join Fandom in 2019</a>, Miller oversaw the company’s <a href="https://variety.com/2022/digital/news/fandom-buys-tv-guide-metacritic-gamespot-1235391144/">$50 million acquisition of a number of entertainment content platforms</a> from Red Ventures including <em>TV Guide, Metacritic, GameSpot, </em>and <em>Giant Bomb</em>. At the time, Miller said that the deal was meant to “expand our business capabilities and provide immersive content for our partners, advertisers and fans.” The deal <a href="https://kotaku.com/giant-bomb-gamespot-metacritic-fandom-layoffs-1850008228">also led to</a> multiple <a href="https://aftermath.site/fandom-gamespot-screen-junkies-layoffs-restructuring">rounds of layoffs</a> for the editorial staff at some of Fandom’s newly-acquired properties. During <a href="https://siliconvalleyjournals.com/fandom-cuts-11-of-workforce-affecting-gamespot-and-other-gaming-outlets/">an all-hands meeting last October</a>, Miller pointed to corporate restructuring and missed revenue targets as some of the causes of the layoffs.</p><p>While Fandom’s IP-specific wikis are popular, they have become widely known for being difficult to navigate due to a preponderance of aggressive ads that often make pages unstable to the point of being nearly unusable. When asked about Fandom’s user experience during a <em>Decoder </em>episode back in 2023, Miller said that he thought “we’re doing our best to make it as elegant as we can, and yet, we need to drive the economics.”</p><p>Though Fandom hasn’t named who might replace Miller, the <a href="https://www.playonsports.com/"><em>PlayOn!

It's really quite interesting how, in a time where big budget live service games are doing anything they can to get you to continue playing (and importantly spend money on) them, the sort of spiritual opposite of this to rise out of this are games where you just hang out with a few buds doing silly nonsense that don't cost very much. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lethal-company">Lethal Company</a>, Peak, you know the kinds of games I mean, and yesterday a new one I quite like the look of arrived: RV There Yet?
</p>
<p>
First of all, kudos on the naming there, developer Nuggets Entertainment, just an all timer of a pun. In RV There Yet?, you and a few other friends play as what I can only describe as "the kind of guy who thinks going on a camping trip with an RV out in the middle of nowhere is a good time." The concept is quite simple: your vacation is over, you're trying to drive home, but, uh oh, the route you took is closed, so you have to find another way back, and hijinks ensue!

<p>
That might mean doing the very dad core thing of getting out of the RV and pushing or pulling the air to suggest you need to reverse or move forward, replacing a tire, smoking a cigarette, using a pulley system to lift up your RV, fighting off a wolf, grilling frozen meat patties, putting on a cassette tape with some age inappropriate tunes. Dad core stuff! Not to mention the most important core feature, "hats."
</p><p>
It's possible that RV There Yet? ends up as another log in the friendslop fire, but I do find it interesting to see the ways that the core concept of "four friends goofing around" has been explored. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc">Multiplayer</a> games typically don't appeal to me due to their frequently competitive nature, and while I don't have time for every single collaborative co-op game under the sun, it's nice to see online games opting for a different approach. Like Peak before it, RV There Yet? was a made during a game jam, once again showing you how limitations can often lead to some neat results.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/beefed-up-twitchcon-security-couldn%E2%80%99t-stop-the-internet%E2%80%99s-issues-from-spilling-over-into-real-life.1332238/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>TwitchCon, which took place last weekend in San Diego, California, is an overlapping series of cacaphonies. A quick stroll down the show floor reveals a hodgepodge of advertisers like State Farm, booths dedicated to high-profile games like <em>Resident Evil</em>, <em>The Sims</em>, and <em>Minecraft</em>, a tabletop section, a music stage Twitch CEO Dan Clancy has been known to perform on, and eventually, an esports arena. There are also panels in various rooms, as well as an artist alley like you’d find at Comic-Con or an anime convention. But these are all distractions. The real main event – the reason people spend hundreds of dollars to attend – is the streamers.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite all the aforementioned sights and sounds, one scene defined TwitchCon 2025. During a meet and greet on Friday, Emily “Emiru” Schunk was approached by a man who proceeded to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/twitch-faces-backlash-popular-streamer-emiru-says-was-assaulted-twitch-rcna238496" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">grab ahold of her and attempted to forcibly kiss her</a>. Schunk’s personal security guard quickly intervened and pushed the assailant away, but after that he was reportedly allowed to roam free. Schunk, rattled, resumed her meet and greet, but the next day she declared that she’ll never return to TwitchCon.</p><p>“Thank you guys again, sorry you all had to see that,” she <a href="https://x.com/emiru/status/1979602519967060414" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote on Twitter</a>. “This is definitely my last TwitchCon, and it saddens me to say as a 10-year off and on attendee of TwitchCon. I think other creators should seriously consider not attending in the future. I did not feel cared for or protected, even bringing my own security and staff. I can't imagine how creators without those options would feel. … [The assailant] was allowed to walk away from my meet and greet, and I didn't hear he was caught until hours after he attacked me, and it felt like this only happened because of my manager pressing for it, not because TwitchCon staff present thought it was a big deal.”&nbsp;</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Saw so many women saying they weren’t going to be attending TwitchCon this year because they don’t feel safe, and then this happens to Emiru on day one <a href="https://t.co/Yazc5VBPWF">pic.twitter.com/Yazc5VBPWF</a></p>— shenAndygans (@Sh3nAndygans) <a href="https://twitter.com/Sh3nAndygans/status/1979416324842369034?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 18, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>Prior to TwitchCon, a slew of high-profile streamers including Hasan “HasanAbi” Piker, Zack “Asmongold” Hoyt, Rachell “Valkyrae” Hoffstetter, and QTCinderella <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/who-has-backed-out-of-twitchcon-2025-every-streamer-not-attending-3263201/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dropped out in advance of the event</a>, citing <a href="https://aftermath.site/charlie-kirk-death-gamergate-ghost-of-yotei-probablymonsters-fired" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the current political climate</a>. The latter two also pointed to instances of violence against female streamers in public – Hoffstetter and Schunk were both <a href="https://aftermath.site/valkyrae-cinna-emiru-attacked-amouranth-robbed-twitch-kick" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">attacked on stream</a> at the Santa Monica Pier earlier this year – and <a href="https://www.the-independent.com/asia/japan/airi-sato-death-tokyo-b2715019.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the March 2025 murder</a> of Japanese content creator Airi Sato.&nbsp;</p><p>One streamer to whom Aftermath spoke, <a href="https://x.com/DenimsTV" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Denims</a>, was planning to attend the show, but changed her mind a few days prior.</p><p>“To be honest, I just don’t feel like TwitchCon is what it used to be, both in terms of more general vibes, but also in the effort that Twitch puts in,” Denims told Aftermath. “After my experience last year, where I <a href="https://aftermath.site/twitch-israel-palestine-frogan-ban-h3h3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got banned for participating in a panel</a> that was supposedly preapproved by Twitch, I had concerns about diligence on behalf of Twitch staff. Seeing the laxity that allowed Emiru to get assaulted in such a terrifying way only confirmed to me that Twitch doesn't allocate enough resources to TwitchCon, and that the organizers are stretched thin enough that they don’t seem to even know what’s happening at their event. This is unsurprising to anyone that has been to a TwitchCon before, but in the face of the current political climate in the United States, I think the negligence is unacceptable.”&nbsp;</p><p>In response to streamers’ concerns leading up to this year’s event, Twitch promised “<a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2025/10/08/what-we-re-doing-to-keep-you-safe-at-twitchcon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">robust security measures</a>” including “screening procedures at all entry points and rigorous access control protocols,” a variety of security personnel including armed police officers, and a command center focused on monitoring and protecting the venue. This varied from prior events, which featured metal detectors and guards, but not quite so many. The command center also appeared to be new, especially in terms of how it was monitoring the event – pulling footage from hundreds of IRL streamers (almost certainly more than were present in previous years).&nbsp;</p><p>This year’s measures did not successfully deter Schunk’s assailant, however. Following the assault, Twitch published another statement:</p><p>“In line with existing TwitchCon security protocols, law enforcement and event security were on site and responded to the incident,” the company <a href="https://x.com/twitch/status/1979464697364779065?s=46&amp;t=L-Xht24CY5-UBFgAlG58bg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote on Twitter</a> the day after the attack. “We immediately blocked this individual from returning to the TwitchCon premises, and they are banned indefinitely from Twitch, both online and in-person events. We are coordinating with the impacted creator’s team and, per our standard protocols, continue to cooperate with any law enforcement investigations. We have increased security at the Meet &amp; Greet attendee check-in point and will have additional security personnel surrounding participating streamers. … Twitch has zero tolerance for harassment or acts that inhibit the safety and security of our community.”</p><p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.usermag.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">User Mag</a>’s Taylor Lorenz, Twitch CEO Dan Clancy put things in slightly more personal terms, as <a href="https://aftermath.site/twitch-ceo-dan-clancy-profitable-layoffs-interview-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tends to be his way for better or worse</a>.</p><p>“We’re looking very closely at everything that happened there, and I care deeply about Emi,” <a href="https://x.com/TaylorLorenz/status/1979972799243649257" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clancy said</a>. “She’s a friend of mine, and so I want to see how we can support her. This is just something we have to keep working on. I think everyone identifies our tools in terms of trust and safety as the leaders in the industry about helping creators, but that means there's always more work to be done, because that's the world we live in now."</p><p>Aftermath reached out to Twitch for additional information, but did not receive a reply as of this publishing.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the course of the weekend, a handful of other streamers came forward with <a href="https://x.com/RickyVT_/status/1980034157989552238" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stories</a> <a href="https://x.com/nightroseVT/status/1980709926998515866" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and</a> <a href="https://x.com/feinmadeit/status/1980110299421356179?s=46&amp;t=L-Xht24CY5-UBFgAlG58bg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clips</a> <a href="https://x.com/jade_infinite/status/1979574029196640360?s=46&amp;t=L-Xht24CY5-UBFgAlG58bg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">of harassment</a> <a href="https://x.com/cuppycakiee/status/1980015232140657142?s=46&amp;t=L-Xht24CY5-UBFgAlG58bg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at and around TwitchCon</a>. In another case that caught the attention of the wider content creation community, a streamer named Emerome was <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/celebrity/articles/emerome-forced-leave-twitchcon-n3on-005507783.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">approached by N3on</a>, a notorious shit-stirring IRL streamer more frequently associated with Kick than Twitch, who invited her to a party entirely on the basis that she was “very beautiful” and then, when she sarcastically replied that she loves being objectified and walked away, started screaming that her friend was fat. It should be noted that N3on did not simply buy a ticket to TwitchCon and show up; Twitch featured him and <a href="https://www.twitchcon.com/archive/san-diego-2025/whos-coming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gave him his own meet and greet</a>.</p><p>On another occasion, Jack Doherty – who, like N3on, loves to shove cameras in people’s faces and provoke them until they lash out, but who was <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/kick/jack-doherty-banned-on-kick-after-crashing-his-mclaren-while-on-his-phone-2920078/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">banned from Kick</a> after crashing a McLaren while looking at his phone, then unbanned, and then <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/kick/jack-doherty-banned-from-kick-again-after-street-brawl-3035013/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">banned again</a> a few days later for getting into a street fight – <a href="https://x.com/idiotpeach/status/1979855973272735820" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">repeatedly shouted the f-slur at a PeachJars</a>, a popular Twitch streamer, after she suggested, correctly, that Doherty is a homophobe.&nbsp;</p><p>Clips like these have led many in the Twitch community to decry both TwitchCon security and Twitch as a company and platform. Content creators like Hoyt, Ethan Klein, and John “Tectone” Robertson, <a href="https://aftermath.site/otk-asmongold-mizkif-twitch-youtube-sponsors-controversy-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">absolutely</a> <a href="https://spitfirenews.com/p/ethan-klein-lawsuits-kaceytron-frogan-denims" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">part of the problem</a>, used these incidents as an opportunity to <a href="https://x.com/Tectone/status/1979916191184347263" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pretend like</a> <a href="https://x.com/Asmongold/status/1979963336558080140" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">they care about women</a> – as well as safety or anything else beyond whatever drama of the day gets them views and allows them to go after perceived enemies – while Twitch mainstays like <a href="https://x.com/cohhcarnage/status/1979866669032845718?s=46&amp;t=L-Xht24CY5-UBFgAlG58bg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ben “Cohh Carnage” Cassell</a> and <a href="https://x.com/DevinNash/status/1980034928042737902" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Devin Nash</a> have advocated for Twitch or a new platform like it to implement a strict games-only policy, to eliminate IRL streaming. There were also calls for Twitch to eliminate politics, even though the category is not really directly relevant to anything that happened at TwitchCon (Hoyt, again part of the problem, <a href="https://x.com/Asmongold/status/1980083165076000961" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">concurred with Cassell here</a>; hmmm, <a href="https://aftermath.site/hasan-piker-dog-collar-kaya-nontroversy-twitch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wonder why</a>).&nbsp;</p><p>But these are alluringly simple solutions to a host of complex problems, the kind that play well online but don’t really hold up under scrutiny. For one, the most viewed clips from TwitchCon are illustrative of two related but <em>different </em>problems: 1) Obvious security concerns around streamers’ physical safety, and 2) IRL streamers farming for salacious moments, a type of stream that doesn’t necessarily perform well on Twitch but does lead to engagement in the algorithmic short-form clip slurry that is YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter. The latter is a gray area. The former is a can of worms so full-to-bursting that I’d recommend taking cover.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Secure, But Not Always Safe</strong></h2><p>Many have made the claim that there was no security at TwitchCon – that, for example, if Schunk’s assailant had decided to bring a knife, it would have been game over for her. But to even enter the convention center, attendees had to pass through a metal detector and bag check, and security was posted up around entrances and exits, on the show floor, next to escalators, and near meet and greets.&nbsp;</p><p>User Mag’s Lorenz received a tour of TwitchCon’s security command center, images from which Aftermath has viewed. The setup included a series of monitors cycling through hundreds of attendees’ streams (with handles attached for identification purposes), as well as more traditional security footage – all of which was monitored by dozens of security staff. This probably-unintentional <em>Dark Knight</em> homage, Lorenz told Aftermath, allowed for “mass surveillance” of the event. Compared to other events she’s attended like Vidcon, which also plays host to creators with millions of followers, she found it to be a more sophisticated security apparatus.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite security discourse from big streamers, only some of whom were at TwitchCon, general Twitter sentiment around the show <a href="https://x.com/zachbussey/status/1980325875460763746" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">skewed more positive than negative</a>, according to resident Twitch newsman Zach Bussey.&nbsp;</p><p>Streamers to whom Aftermath spoke reported a relatively incident-free weekend.</p><p>“I had no [security] concerns [with attendees],” Tanya “Cypheroftyr” DePass, who previously <a href="https://kotaku.com/for-streamers-dealing-with-stalkers-twitchs-solutions-1832063386" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dealt with stalker-related issues on Twitch</a>, told Aftermath. “Someone I’ve had an issue with at PAX East was spotted but did not engage. I didn’t hear about Emiru until after it had happened.”</p><p>“I felt safe, but luckily I’m a man,” ConnorEatsPants, whose <em>Fortnite </em>Friday interview show has recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inuZ7mcNlq0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">attracted high-profile guests like Gavin Newsom</a> and The Rizzler, told Aftermath. “There’s always a few ‘weird’ people, but mostly just awkward folks. Past two years, I had issues with Twitch not clearing me for proper security assistance, which had led to some issues with me walking the floor and getting swarmed. Luckily this year I was cleared in advance, thankfully.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>My personal experience this weekend, I did feel secure, but I know that wasn't everyone's.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Twitch also maintained a special Purple Lounge exclusively for “premium partners” – aka, those with high view counts – that they could access without ever exposing themselves to the hopefully-washed masses.</p><p>"I could go from my [hotel] room to events without ever encountering any floor time,” politics streamer Michael “<a href="https://x.com/Mike_from_PA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MikeFromPA</a>” Beyer, who is no stranger to the kinds of <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-charlie-kirk-death-streamers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">politically motivated</a> death threats that made Twitch especially squeamish this year, told Aftermath. “So I could go through a utility elevator in the hotel, get into a black Suburban, be taken [to the convention center], and go to the Purple Lounge, which is behind two layers of security as well – former police, military, bodyguards, etc."</p><p>Beyer said that months before the event, Twitch told him it would not provide security details for individuals, but that there’d be “an opportunity to bring your own security if you feel you’d need it.” However, the company seemed to have changed its tune following Charlie Kirk’s death, as it did provide a security guard for entertainment and politics streamer <a href="https://x.com/carolinekwan?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Caroline Kwan</a>, who received death threats prior to the show over <a href="https://x.com/DramaAlert/status/1978279379995086865" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">her defense of Piker</a> during <a href="https://aftermath.site/hasan-piker-dog-collar-kaya-nontroversy-twitch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the ludicrous CollarGate scandal</a>, including one about how somebody wanted to “Charlie Kirk” her “so bad.” Big Twitch streamers have partner managers, not all of whom are cut from the same cloth, but Kwan says hers spearheaded the effort to make sure she was safe.</p><p>“I had a security person [thanks to my partner manager],” Kwan told Aftermath. “They were [Twitch owner] Amazon security; it was not a temporary TwitchCon security officer, like people they hired just for the weekend. And then after the Emiru situation, my partner manager reached out to me and was like 'If you don't want to do your meet and greet anymore, no problem.' ... She was very communicative.”</p><p>But Kwan recognizes that she’s in a unique position among TwitchCon attendees.</p><p>"My personal experience this weekend, I did feel secure, but I know that wasn't everyone's,” she said. “I talked to a lot of people, especially women, and the vibes were just that everyone was furious – female streamers saying that they weren’t hanging out in the [convention center] at all. People would be in the Purple Lounge or do their shows, and that was it."</p><figure><blockquote><p>Despite the 'no backpack' rule, I saw people admitted with backpacks, and I was given a hassle for my small bag.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Kwan also noted that big streamers like Schunk spend upwards of $10,000 per year on personal security. Smaller streamers can’t necessarily afford that.&nbsp;</p><p>Kwan also said she heard stories of backstage locations – where big names sought refuge – being inconsistently guarded, while other streamers spoke of needlessly strict security protocols at less crucial junctures. The latter caused some streamers accessibility issues – on top of the event’s preexisting and <a href="https://x.com/bbjesslive/status/1980375385067184438" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at this point notorious accessibility issues</a> – by, in one case, <a href="https://x.com/ezenaldarcen/status/1979764908117135762" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">taking a bag away from a person with diabetes and multiple sclerosis</a> and forcing them to carry blood-sugar-regulating snacks in their hands. In other cases, creators who’ve striven to keep their IRL identities secret for privacy purposes and chronically ill people were <a href="https://x.com/arunareaver/status/1979981569562734866?s=46&amp;t=L-Xht24CY5-UBFgAlG58bg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">forced to remove masks and show their faces in public</a>.</p><p>DePass was irked by security she described as “inconsistent joke theater.”</p><p>"Despite the 'no backpack' rule, I saw people admitted with backpacks, and I was given a hassle for my small bag,” she said. “My [<em>Magic The Gathering</em>] mat was unrolled by a security officer on entry on Sunday despite it being design-side out. His explanation? Sometimes people have lewd or inappropriate designs on these. Like, pornography. My mat had a Chocobo, which he could see without having to touch it or unroll it."</p><p>Therein lies the problem with calls for more security at the convention. Twitch hired numerous security guards who ostensibly did their jobs, but in some streamers’ experiences were neither consistent nor useful. They accosted and irritated attendees; they did not immediately pursue Schunk’s assailant, as they should have. In the same way that <a href="https://www.cjcj.org/reports-publications/report/more-law-enforcement-spending-accompanies-worse-not-improved-crime-solving" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">overfunding police does not solve crime</a>, throwing more dudes in uniforms at a convention full of famous people and their parasocial fans does not guarantee safety. Twitch surely knew its security would be under scrutiny due to issues raised before the event. But a performance intended to satisfy an audience that equates scale and spectacle with quality is very different from a targeted, effective operation that considers the unique needs of a one-of-a-kind event.</p><h2>IRL Ire</h2><p>Which brings us to the IRL streamer issue. These opportunists did not generally pose a physical threat, but some bothered attendees and caused them – most of them women – to feel unsafe. Emerome, for example, <a href="https://x.com/emerome/status/1979934255363874862" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said she began receiving death threats</a> online after the clip of her shrugging off N3on went viral, and as a result she decided to skip the remainder of the con. Many IRL streamers attended an outdoor block party Twitch hosted and roamed streets near the convention center, ravenous for content. This contributed to a general sense of anxiety and unrest.&nbsp;</p><p>"[The block party] was chum for these IRL streamer sharks to go in and try to farm these moments,” said Kwan. “When [my team and I] looked outside [from the restaurant we were eating at], it was just all these cameras and lights, and you could see obnoxious streamers on the hunt. ... A lot of people who went to [the block party] were like 'You know what? It was just not fun. I felt like everywhere I went, there were just cameras being shoved in my face.'"</p><p>Twitch could not have prevented <em>all </em>of this; the outdoors and parties hosted by other orgs, of which there were many, are not the company’s purview. But at least on convention grounds, it did possess the means to do so. The problem is that Twitch had security personnel monitoring hundreds of streams for more traditional security concerns (physical safety, etc), but it evidently didn’t consider the IRL streamers <em>themselves</em> to be a potentially serious security issue. Guards did not intervene when people like N3on and Doherty made people uncomfortable (though Doherty’s Twitch account was suspended sometime in the past few days).</p><figure><blockquote><p>It was just not fun. I felt like everywhere I went, there were just cameras being shoved in my face.</p></blockquote></figure><p>The question then becomes: Is that something Twitch <em>wants </em>to curtail in the future? TwitchCon has become a hotbed for content creation, and preventing online conflict and misogyny from spilling over into real life might require a cultural intervention as much, if not more than, a security one, the kind that would necessarily involve giving the boot to big-name creators with misogynistic tendencies.&nbsp;</p><p>"The truth is, TwitchCon was probably the most surveilled, security rich, and filmed event in the [San Diego] convention center all year," Bret "Cinemarxism" Hamilton <a href="https://x.com/cinemarxismbret/status/1980383032621330722" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said on Twitter</a>. "Surveillance and buff dudes just don’t prevent cultural issues like misogyny from causing harm to vulnerable people. Could more be done? Of course. I wish harassment and misogyny [were] taken 100x more seriously by the platform, but the problems that actually cause these people to behave this way are so deep and wider in scope than the platform of Twitch. As evidenced by this weekend, cops, surveillance and other forms of security theater can’t and don’t actually keep us safe. Only we keep us safe, and a lot of us are not doing nearly enough to counter misogyny and online harassment."</p><p>"A lot of male streamers participate in [the culture of misogyny] without maybe understanding that this is all part of a larger problem,” said Kwan. “They go 'Well, I would never assault a woman or say that was OK. And in fact, I'm condemning what happened to Emiru, and if I were there, I would have protected her.' ... When we call women whores, when we say these really misogynistic things and normalize it, and then we have these audiences comprised of very impressionable, vulnerable young men who are learning from this, not every one of them is going to do something like the guy did to Emiru, but it's all part of a broader systemic issue."</p><figure><blockquote><p>Surveillance and buff dudes just don’t prevent cultural issues like misogyny from causing harm to vulnerable people.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Some have suggested simply banning all IRL streamers from TwitchCon, but that would effectively mean throwing the baby out with the bathwater.</p><p>“I’ve been on Twitch as a viewer for 15+ years," Jakenbake, an OG IRL streamer who made his name by exploring Japan with his viewers, <a href="https://x.com/jakenbakelive/status/1980309672478531733" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said on Twitter</a>. "I’ve seen the growth, the ups and downs, streamers come, streamers go, and an ever evolving community. I’ve witnessed the diversification of content into non-gaming 'IRL' since the inception. Seeing all of the understandable frustration with TwitchCon and IRL streamers this year definitely hurts as it lumps in everyone in an already hard to navigate category. ... I understand the frustrations completely because I have them too. [Of course] this isn’t everyone, and there’s tons of amazing creators doing things properly."&nbsp;</p><h2>Clip That</h2><p>This is where calls to eliminate IRL streamers entirely – either from the convention or Twitch as a platform – begin to ring hollow. Painting with too broad a brush blots out those who just want to bring viewers along for a ride. The medium is not intrinsically the problem, nor in this case is Twitch.&nbsp;</p><p>“Jack Doherty had 300 viewers [on Twitch] during [the livestream that produced] the clip where PeachJars and him got into it,” said Kwan. “Do you think he’s farming that stuff because he’s doing so specifically for a livestream? No. That’s this whole meta of clip farming. That’s the kind of stuff that pops on other platforms: that short-form content.”</p><p>What we’re experiencing is the logical endpoint of other, much more algorithmic platforms like YouTube, TikTok, and Twitter prioritizing dramatic, controversial, and generally negative clips – the kind that generate engagement by making people mad. Platforms have been doing this for a few years now, but we’ve reached the apotheosis of the form. Creators, who’ve optimized their content to appeal to algorithms, have transformed themselves into vessels for the sort of smirking sociopathy that reliably reaps sweet, sweet views. They do it naturally and shamelessly. The machine is so well oiled that, at this point, slamming the brakes would be much harder than just letting it continue to plunge off a cliff.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>That’s this whole meta of clip farming. That’s the kind of stuff that pops on other platforms: that short-form content.</p></blockquote></figure><p>IRL streamers are far from the only ones leaning into this meta. Most recently, CollarGate was rooted in a similar sort of amoral cynicism and, again, was ginned up entirely via a series of out-of-context clips. Countless other online controversies and nontroversies have taken on a similar shape. TwitchCon 2025 was this terrible, multifaceted fly-eye lens applied to the outside world, as opposed to the online one. What happens when people look at IRL existence as nothing more than a staging ground for an endless feed of disingenuous clips? TwitchCon was a glimpse of the grim future that awaits us, or perhaps just another angle on the present we’re already inhabiting.</p><p>This is why calls to return Twitch to the good old days or make a new platform in 2011-era Twitch’s image are destined to fail: Whatever emerges from such an effort will still be subject to the prevailing winds of the modern internet. No platform is an island, as TwitchCon demonstrated by attracting so many creators who were primarily hoping to farm views on non-Twitch platforms. Similarly, there’d be nothing to stop someone from clipping a streamer saying something dumb or controversial on a hypothetical pure gaming platform and turning them into a lolcow. The root issue is not the kinds of content Twitch allows; it’s the behavior patterns incentivized by the platform ecosystem at large.&nbsp;</p><p>Streamers who are calling for a return to Twitch’s halcyon “bleed purple” days are also falling into the same trap as conservatives: They’re harking back to a time that never actually existed. Yes, Twitch at one point required streamers to play games, but creators and fans have always argued about subjects and people they deem inappropriate for Twitch, even when those at the heart of bitter debates were operating well within the rules. Remember “<a href="https://kotaku.com/twitch-boobie-streamer-says-she-s-done-showing-cleavag-1764285119" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">boobie streamers</a>”?&nbsp;</p><p>"Kaceytron did nothing but play <em>League of Legends</em>, but because she was a woman doing it – and because she was wearing normal clothes that women wear with maybe a plunging neckline, but certainly nothing that you wouldn't see out on the streets walking around – she was bombarded with nonstop threats,” said Beyer. “Even if we strip away IRL streaming and we strip away non-gaming streaming, there's still going to be this culture of misogyny that is targeting creators. ... It seems like a bad idea overall to try to restrict people's content that's not in any way related to harassing people because of some sort of faux-nostalgia for a time that never existed where women were safe on the platform."</p><figure><blockquote><p>In terms of what Twitch can do better, I’d say to listen to the girls.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Twitch, meanwhile, is a relatively small platform – a fraction of the size of YouTube or TikTok with a vastly smaller staff (cut to the bone by <a href="https://aftermath.site/latest-twitch-layoffs-spread-teams-even-thinner-no-idea-how-folks-are-going-to-make-it-work" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">layoffs</a>) to match. As a result, a handful of bigger creators both on and off platform have proven reliably capable of hijacking and controlling conversations around it. Twitch’s major misstep, in Beyer’s eyes, has been catering to those users instead of implicitly telling them to change the channel like YouTube.</p><p>"Nobody is talking about enforcing YouTube terms of service, but if you search 'Twitch TOS' on YouTube, there's a million YouTube videos about it,” said Beyer. “It's like, well, the reason why that's happening is because Twitch is catering to these people. If Twitch just said [to streamers constantly complaining about women] ... 'As long as [women’s&nbsp; streams are] not pornographic, as long as it's not illegal, fuck off,' then we might actually have the platform grow.”</p><p>ConnorEatsPants thinks Twitch would do well to listen more attentively to the people impacted by recent incidents – not its loudest rage baiters.</p><p>"In terms of what Twitch can do better, I’d say to listen to the girls," he said. "They’ve been expressing stuff like this since I began attending [TwitchCon] years and years ago. Emi’s had these issues everywhere she goes, and the last place she should have to worry about it is TwitchCon."</p><h2><strong>Show Must (?) Go On</strong></h2><p>Once upon a time, an event like TwitchCon made perfect sense; streamers have always sold themselves as more authentic and accessible than traditional celebrities. Why wouldn’t they want to chill with their fans? But now, top streamers are nearly as famous as the aforementioned celebrities, and parasociality means there’s no world in which all their fans will just be normal about it.&nbsp;</p><p>What does safety at scale – both in terms of actual physical safety and peace of mind – look like when Twitch can’t tightly control everything and everyone, as one would at a more traditional celebrity appearance or meet and greet? The whole appeal of TwitchCon is the idea that a regular person could run into their favorite streamer milling about on the same plane of reality as them. If content creators are going to take advantage of that because other platforms incentivize it, does Twitch have a responsibility to rein them in on its own turf?&nbsp;</p><p>There are tweaks that make sense from a common sense standpoint – some kind of physical barrier at meet and greets, a stricter screening process for IRL streamers – but how much more could Twitch be able or willing to change when the big debut of its latest, greatest security theater was a flop? Is there a point at which TwitchCon becomes such a reputational risk that the company just pulls the plug on the event entirely?&nbsp;</p><p>With a growing number of popular streamers saying they won’t attend TwitchCon next year – even if they’re basing that decision on a lone, regrettably timed incident rather than more pervasive issues – something’s got to give.</p><p>"I don't know how Twitch convinces people to come back, because they announced in the lead up to this TwitchCon that they were going to be taking extra security measures,” said Kwan. “And then day one, [Schunk’s assault] happens, and they produced a poor response to it. Very reactive, not proactive. And if big streamers don't come, then they don't sell tickets."</p><p>“Because these little shitbag IRL clip farmers,” she added, “they’re not bringing in the viewership [for Twitch]. Not at all.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/twitch-twitchcon-2025-security-emiru-assault-irl-streamers]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The <a href="https://defector.com/why-your-team-sucks-2025-baltimore-ravens">Baltimore Ravens</a> haven’t had a great season so far in the NFL. Their current record is an abysmal 1-5, tied for the team’s worst in 30 years. And a new report claims the team’s coach, John Harbaugh, is understandably not happy about this and has removed many fun items from the locker room, including the team’s video games.</p> <p><a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/2025/10/20/whats-wrong-with-the-baltimore-ravens/">On October 20, <em>The Baltimore Sun</em></a> reported that after going 1-3 and a player posting a photo of them playing games to social media, team officials and Harbaugh removed several “recreational staples” from the Ravens’ locker room. These included a basketball hoop, a ping pong table, a few corn hole boards, and some “video game consoles.”</p>

 <p>The report doesn’t specify which consoles, but it does mention that the team often played “intense rounds” of<em> Super Smash Bros</em>, so I’d assume some Switch or Switch 2 systems were removed. The outlet also says that these <em>Super Smash</em> sessions drew “small crowds of teammates late in the day.”</p> <p>Ravens players told <em>The Baltimore Sun</em> that the football team’s coaching staff wanted to “remove distractions” and help players focus more on playing, practicing, and, I assume, eventually winning. This isn’t the first time the team has done this, either. In past seasons when the team struggled to win, so-called “locker room freedoms” and benefits were scaled back or removed entirely. For players who need a break from having to focus and work all day, that can be tough. After all the fun toys and consoles were removed, the team lost two more games.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-server-slam-embark-studios-ferro-2000638324</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders%E2%80%99-dev-addresses-graphics-downgrade-enemy-difficulty-and-more-ahead-of-release.1332211/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>In <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/server-slam-thank-you/">a blog post</a> thanking everyone who participated in last weekend’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/ark-raiders-embark-studios-server-slam-2000637325">super fun Server Slam</a>, <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ developer Embark Studios commented on a few topics of note, three of which address some changes the team is making in light of the experiences folks shared online.</p> <p><b>Read More: </b><a href="https://kotaku.com/ark-raiders-embark-studios-server-slam-2000637325"><i>Arc Raiders </i>Is So Good I’m Worried It Will Completely Take Over My Life</a></p> <p>Those who played during the Server Slam and previous technical tests have raised a number of questions and concerns, mostly over the fine edges of what is shaping up to be one of the best and most approachable extraction shooter experiences yet. So let’s get into some of what Embark is looking to fix, and some fun data points from the test over the weekend.</p>

 <h2>Flying Arc are getting a gentle nerf</h2> <p>Let’s jump straight into the most consequential change Embark is looking to make for launch: The flying Arc drones are too damn perceptive. While many people, including myself, felt that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oarm5m/please_dont_nerf_the_arc/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;embed_host_url=https://kotaku.com/ark-raiders-embark-studios-server-slam-2000637325">dealing with our robot overlords</a> above Speranza was appropriately challenging, those damn drones were quick to find and harass enemy players. Embark is changing that. In the post the studio said:</p>

 <p>It turns out their <b>awareness was a bit too high</b>, allowing them to essentially see through trees and bushes. This made their vision unintentionally over-powered, but we’ve adjusted what they can see now, so expect a fairer fight at launch.</p> <p>As a multiplayer game, I’ve no doubt this isn’t the end of difficulty tweaks for <i>Arc Raiders</i>. But preserving the tension and difficulty of the game is important. I mean, Leapers need to be able to scare the shit out of us, as one does to some hapless players in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oa6sr6/mistakes_were_made/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">this absolutely hilarious clip</a>.</p>

    <p>That said, diminishing just how quickly a drone can catch sight of you sounds like a reasonable adjustment.</p>

   <h2>Fairness adjustments</h2> <p>Embark is also making it a little tougher to get into the Dam Control Tower on the Dam Battlegrounds map. Seeing so many players easily access it during the Server Slam “was fun to watch,” the post says, “but [it’s] a bit too accessible for a key loot location. That’s been fixed to keep the challenge sharp.” That <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1odcjy5/good_or_bad_change/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">sounds like a wise change</a>.</p>

 <p>On a similar topic, it will be interesting to observe how the devs respond to the various ways players end up using in-game gadgets. There’s a fine line between an OP tactic and, well, griefing. While it doesn’t sound like there were too many abusive uses of gear during the Server Slam, one technique comes to mind as a possible indicator of things that might become controversial: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1obv44e/barricading_the_tower_zipline/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Placing a barricade in front of a zipline</a>.</p>

    <p>There are plenty of vertical and horizontal ziplines all over the map, and if you place a barricade in front of one, it blocks an approaching player with sometimes hilarious results; watch the video above to see a downed player get stuck at the top of the barricade. I’ve seen other players just fall to their deaths with this. Is it fair? Is it ripe for toxic abuse? The devs will no doubt have a lot of interesting decisions to make in the future.</p> <h2>Addressing the “graphical downgrade”</h2> <p>Though it may have been the first time for some, the Server Slam wasn’t the first chance folks had gotten to play <i>Arc Raiders</i>. There have been two previous technical tests and during those, it seems the game had some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oagvwj/dear_embark_please_explain_or_undo_this_graphical/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">more visual spectacle</a>, a discrepancy some players noted.</p>   <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1ocnp9m/devs_respond_to_graphics_downgrade_just_make_it/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Embark has replied</a> to this concern, stating that it had “done optimization to ensure higher and more stable framerates on low and mid spec hardware.” As someone with a temperamental PC, I really appreciated how smooth the game ran. But the game does <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1ociyyf/dear_embark_studios_please_dont_forget_players/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">look notably fancier in previous builds</a>. Embark says it will try to find the “right balance” to this discrepancy. And players have another concern regarding the graphics: Foliage.</p>

 <p>On lower graphical settings, the dense bushes that are perfect for hiding just vanish. It brings up a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1odehgm/petition_to_remove_low_foliagegraphics_settings/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">serious concern about fairness</a>. If I can just turn my graphics settings to low, then I can see anyone hiding in the bushes. It’s an odd situation in which having a lower-end machine could mean an advantage over someone cranking their RTX 5090.</p> <h2>800k ducks and everyone’s favorite single-shot menace of a rifle</h2> <p>Embark shared a number of fun stats from the Server Slam, including which Arc was deadliest (obviously it was the Rocketeer. Somehow, though, ya’ll took down 77 Queens. I only faced it once, and that was because some genius in my party said “Let’s go take the Harvester!” and I couldn’t muster an “Are you nuts?” in response.</p>

 <p>That “77” number is put into perspective when you realize that collectively, we destroyed 58 million other machines. Yeah.</p>  <p>Also, the Ferro, the game’s single-shot gun that melts shields, was the most-crafted weapon and it sounds like rubber ducks were among the most commonly found treasures in the Rust Belt.</p>   <p>Honestly, I can’t wait for <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ release. One more week, ya’ll. Drink some water and spend time with your loved ones while you still can.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>A <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/gaming-copilot-installing-automatically-on-windows-11-pcs-now-trains-microsofts-models-on-users-pc-gameplay.1332163/">user on ResetEra spotted</a> that as part of their network traffic, Microsoft's new <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-launches-copilot-for-gaming-beta-on-mobile-devices/">Gaming Copilot AI</a>, which is automatically installed on Windows 11 PCs, was sending screenshots and captures of everything they were playing back to Microsoft, so Microsoft could use that data to train its AI models further. The setting is on by default, which means that unless you turn it off, Microsoft is using your gaming time to train its AI.</p>



<p>Wccftech can confirm that when you navigate to Game Bar, and then to Settings, and Privacy Settings, the option for Gaming Copilot to pull "<em>Model training on text</em>" is defaulted to being activated. I found the setting activated on my own laptop, before turning it off.</p>



<p>There's also options for Gaming Copilot to train using any vocal conversations you have while playing games, though that was not defaulted to being 'on,' when we looked at our settings. It'll also capture personalization and memory data, and of course, keep track of any conversations you have with Gaming Copilot, if you were actually using the service.</p>



<p>You can turn all of these settings off and/or ensure they're off by going into Game Bar, then to Gaming Copilot, then the Settings gear, which should be in the bottom left corner, and then lastly Privacy settings. There, you'll be able to turn off, or at least knowingly opt in to letting Gaming Copilot train on your gameplay, instead of it being on by default.</p>



<p>In the past month or so, Microsoft has done nothing, it seems, but be a public disappointment for players. The price of the Xbox Series consoles <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-s-prices-will-reportedly-go-up-again-in-us-microsoft/">went up in the US for the second time this year</a>, followed by <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-development-kits-price-hike-microsoft/">a price hike for Xbox development kits</a>, meaning even game devs have to pay more for Xbox hardware. The price of <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-is-rumored-to-drop-pc-game-pass-get-cheaper-ad-supported-tier/">Xbox Game Pass went up 50%</a>, while at the same time, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-removed-10-discount-on-call-of-duty-add-ons-cod-points-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-subscribers/">discounts</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-rewards-points-xbox-game-pass/">reward programs</a> for Xbox software and services were shut down. And in the midst of all of that, we can probably expect a new <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-reportedly-preparing-free-ad-supported-version-xbox-cloud-gaming/">version of Cloud Gaming with ads</a>. </p>



<p>Now, the latest is that Microsoft is training its AI with your gameplay, almost definitely without you strictly knowing about it.</p>



<p>None of it exactly endears Xbox and Microsoft to players, but it does at least seem par for the course for a company that <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-layoffs-funding-increased-spending-ai-infrastructure/">laid off 9,000+ people to bet more on AI.</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ghost-yotei-september-2025-sales-borderlands-4-final-fantasy-tactics-2000638319</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ghost-of-yotei-seems-to-have-sold-just-fine-despite-reactionary-boycott.1332190/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Ghost of Yotei</em> was the fourth best-selling game in the U.S. for September with just three days out on the market, according to the latest figures from Circana. Sony’s latest open-world blockbuster appears to be doing just fine despite an attempted boycott by online grifters and their followers.</p> <p>“With one week in market, the US sales performance of<em> Ghost of Yotei</em> was basically flat to that of <em>Ghost of Tsushima,” </em>the research firm’s Mat Piscatella wrote on Bluesky. “It did great. <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> launched in July 2020 (if you’ll recall, stuff was happening at the time that significantly boosted gaming), and the PS4 installed base at the time was significantly higher than the PS5 is today. Like, anyone with ‘concern’ about this title should be looked at with a side eye.”</p>

 <p><em>Ghost of Yotei</em> was behind <em>Borderlands 4</em>, <em>NBA 2K26</em>, and <em>EA Sports FC 26</em>, which isn’t surprising considering those are multiplatform best-sellers and the samurai revenge tale remains exclusive to PS5 right now. Sales were still enough to make <em>Yotei</em> the 18th best-seller of the year so far by revenue and the second best-selling game on PlayStation during the period, just behind <em>NBA 2K26</em> but ahead of <em>Borderlands 4</em> which had two additional weeks on the market.</p>   <p><em>Ghost of Yotei</em> has been on the receiving end of a <a href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-yotei-charlie-kirk-joke-playstation-sony-2000625478">slow-burn reactionary backlash</a> from online culture warriors ever since it revealed its protagonist was a woman named Atsu. She’s played by Erika Ishii who was attacked by the <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-antiwoke-ubisoft-rpg-1851770511">usual suspects</a> for being queer and for posting about about defunding the police during the 2020 George Floyd protests. The flame war intensified after a Sucker Punch developer posted a joke about the Charlie Kirk assassination, with some calling for a boycott of <em>Yotei</em> even after the developer <a href="https://kotaku.com/sucker-punch-charlie-kirk-ghost-yotei-sony-2000627290">was fired for the remark</a>.&nbsp;Boycott or no, it seems to have had little meaningful impact on <em>Yotei</em>‘s trajectory, at least at launch.</p>

 <h2>Is<em> Borderlands 4</em> still a sales juggernaut?</h2> <p>The September sales figures have some other interesting nuggets to chew on. <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-the-kotaku-review-bugs-pc-performance-ending-gearbox-ps5-2000627149"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> posted some impressive Ws but with a few major caveats. It was the best-selling game in the U.S. for the month and instantly hit number three for the entire year, with 30 percent higher dollar sales at launch than <em>Borderlands 3</em>. But <em>Borderlands 3</em> was $60 instead of $70, didn’t have a Super Deluxe Edition selling for $130, and wasn’t initially available on Steam, where <em>Borderlands 4</em> appears to have sold a good portion of its copies.</p>

 <p>2K Games hasn’t released any official sales figures yet. <em>Borderlands 3</em> sold <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/borderlands3/comments/1kns4wo/borderlands_3_is_2ks_fastest_selling_title_with/">over 22 million copies and before that, <em>Borderlands 2</em> hit 30 million</a>. My guess is that<em> Borderlands 4</em>, a return to form hampered somewhat by PC issues at launch, ends up tracking somewhere in-between.</p>

 <p>In other news, the PS5 has <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m3ry7dpojc2x">already outsold</a> the entire PS3 generation in under five years. It has a couple of years left to beat the PS4 globally. I don’t think anyone’s ever beating the PS2. Not even the Nintendo Switch.</p> <p>But my favorite sales data point of all from last month is <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-review-ivalice-chronicles-2000628040"><em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</em></a>. It came in ninth overall, and second on Switch, which is extra impressive when you remember it’s selling for only $50. Square Enix hinted at <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-ivalice-remaster-cloud-wiegraf-cid-sequel-2000622717">a possible sequel</a> if it does well enough, or at least more strategy RPGs. I’m buying everyone I know a copy for Christmas.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Companions in the original <em>Outer Worlds</em> were kind of stiff. You could build up your relationships with them. They’d tell you when they were unhappy. But none of it ever led anywhere. They amounted to a fire-suppressing peanut gallery that helped you learn about and reflect on the world around you but little more. <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> will try to fix that. You still can’t romance companions in the sequel but at least they’ll try to kill you this time if you really piss them off.</p> <p>You’ll have six optional companions in Obsidian’s upcoming sci-fi RPG, many associated with particular in-game factions. Niles is an engineer from the Earth Directorate. Valerie is a robot from the same faction. Aza is a cultist from the Glorious Dawn. Inez is a field medic from Auntie’s Choice. Marisol is an assassin from the Order of the Ascendant. Finally there’s Tristan from the Protectorate who has a giant hammer. Hurt their friends or break their rules and they’ll turn on you.</p>

 <p>“One of the things that was really important is we wanted these characters to feel like they’re their own people,” design director Matt Singh said on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VLPpTh_v8&amp;t=827s">latest episode</a> of the Xbox Expansion Pass show (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/screw-up-too-hard-in-the-outer-worlds-2-and-your-companions-may-fight-you-to-the-death-because-obsidian-wanted-the-rpgs-cast-to-feel-like-theyre-their-own-people/"><em>Gamesradar</em></a>). “They have their own goals, their own motivations, and if the player’s aligning with them, that’s great. They’re going to be there for you. They’ll fight alongside you. But if you go against their interests, they’re going to have something to say about it. That might break out into a conflict, that might mean they leave you or you have to fight them to the death. But if you do build that relationship with them, they’ll be there for you in the end.”</p>

 <p>This sounds neat and builds off one of the most memorable moments from the original <em>Mass Effect</em> in which two of your squadmates clash, resulting in an unreconcilable showdown. Over a decade later I still remember what choice I made during that part of the game and why (fuck you, Ashley). I don’t expect <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> to rise to the same level since these confrontations don’t sound like pivotal scripted moments so much as procedural consequences.</p>

 <p>Singh also suggests you can sort of skate by the friction if you have a good enough relationship with the NPC. Something like, “Uh, sorry I wiped out your clan, remember that time I finished your second loyalty mission though?” I hope that’s not the case. I hope we have some real friends-to-enemies journeys out there in Halcyon this time around. One of my biggest complaints with party-based RPGs is that the people you’re with never seem to quite have a mind of their own outside of sassy retorts and disappointed scowls. It sounds like <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> is trying to evolve the formula beyond that.</p> <p><b>“</b>We still wanted to make sure that the player has choice<span>—</span>meaningful choice—here,” Singh <a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/interview/18764-the-outer-worlds-2-interview-talking-role-playing-second-chances-with-obsidians-brandon-adler-matthew-singh">told <em>RPGSite</em> in another interview</a>. “Companions are completely optional. If you don’t want to engage with them, you don’t have to. But you can take them along and see how that changes your story. Same thing with factions, right? The factions are there. They have their goals. They have their motivations. You can try to side with them. You can try to bring them together. Or you can say, ‘F it. I’m going my way. I don’t care about you. We’re going to do it the way that I would like.’ We’re all trying to figure out how to give the player as much player agency as possible and respond to it in interesting ways.”</p>
