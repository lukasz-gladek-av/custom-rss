That was the case until the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-major-update-new-enemy-missions-difficulty-1851602325&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-major-update-new-enemy-missions-difficulty-1851602325">Escalation of Freedom update</a></span> that released on August 6 which, per the title, ramps things up a bit with new enemies and<strong> a new difficulty.</strong></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196395" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Co-Op Bug Blasting And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="80" data-playlist="196395,195326,196181" data-current="196395"><div><p>The Week In Games: Co-Op Bug Blasting And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21945.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Helldivers 2</em>’s latest update brings difficulty 10 missions to the game, which are aptly labeled as “Super Helldives.” However, if you’re a more casual player, or are just getting into the game right now, you may notice that the highest difficulty isn’t immediately accessible. That’s because in <em>Helldivers 2</em>, <strong>you need to earn higher difficulties by taking on operations at the highest tier afforded to you.</strong></p><p>Basically, you need to <strong>work your way up to the highest difficulty by completing a level 9 Helldive operation. </strong>In order to get there, you have to complete an operation on every tier below it.</p><p>To be clear, operations are a bit more distinct than just stray missions that you drop into. Operations are consolidated bunches of 2-3 missions depending on the difficulty you select. During operations, you are allowed to pick between any of the 2-3 options and tackle them in whatever order you want. Finishing them all gives greater rewards as well as access to the next-highest difficulty. <strong>Upon completion of a level 5 operation for example, you will unlock the ability to do level 6 dives and operations, and so on and so forth.</strong></p><p>Ultimately, these operations largely rotate through the same series of objectives, but they are made more ridiculous by the steadily rising difficulty levels. The difficulty level directly corresponds to the amount and type of enemies you face and how ferocious they are. The difference in two tiers of difficulty may be the spawn rate of Bile Titans as well as massive, heavily armored creatures like the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-kill-beat-impalers-guide-update-1851614495&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-kill-beat-impalers-guide-update-1851614495">Impalers</a></span>, which are new as of this current update.</p><p>Experienced players are really going to want to unlock this new difficulty level because it contains one of <em>Helldivers 2</em>’s most exciting new additions. As part of the Escalation of Freedom update, level 10 missions now feature <em>huge </em>Automaton fortresses as well as Terminid strongholds that function like a large-scale version of the game’s existing outposts. There will be more enemies than ever, but damn will it be exciting to lay siege to one of those huge camps on a mission.</p><p><em>Helldivers 2 </em>is no joke on even the most middling of difficulties, especially if you aren’t kitted out with the right weapons, stratagems, and armor. That means that level 10 missions are going to be brutal as hell, and should only be reserved for the most experienced players. Otherwise, you’re just cruising for a bruising or, y’know, evisceration at the hands of bloodthirsty bugs and robots. So slap on that heavy armor, throw down some heavy artillery, and stick it to those robots and bugs in the name of Super Earth.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/trials-of-mana-original-remake-best-version-1851615276<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When it comes to Square Enix’s experimental <em>Mana </em>series, you’ll find no shortage of arguments over which entry is the best of the bunch. However, if there is one game that managed to achieve a cult following among <em>Mana </em>fans, it’s <em>Trials of Mana</em>. Now, almost 30 years later, there are two distinctly different ways to play the game. But which one is right for you?<br></p><p>Originally released on the Super Famicom in 1995, <em>Trials of Mana </em>(AKA: <em>Seiken Densetsu 3</em>) is a dazzling action-RPG that stretches the capabilities of its 16-bit hardware to its limits. Boasting six playable characters, an ambitious branching storyline with three different final bosses, and a multitude of character classes, few RPGs of the 90s offered as much replay value as this. It’s hard to live up to a game as beloved as <em>Secret of Mana</em>, but its direct sequel, <em>Trials of Mana</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>delivered just about everything a <em>Mana </em>fan in the 90s would want.</p><p>… Or, at least, it <em>would </em>have, had it received a worldwide release. <em>Trials of Mana </em>unfortunately never debuted on the Super Nintendo in the West, presumably due to the sheer cost of localizing its ambitious script. The game instead owes its legacy in the West to a fan translation that was released in 2000. Truthfully, this bolstered the game’s reputation among SNES enthusiasts. Unlocalized games tend to develop especially devoted followings, especially when they come from prolific studios such as Squaresoft.</p><p>That all changed back in 2019, when Square Enix announced the wombo-combo of both <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/trials-of-mana-looks-much-better-than-the-secret-of-man-1835455806&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/trials-of-mana-looks-much-better-than-the-secret-of-man-1835455806">a full-scale remake</a></span> of <em>Trials of Mana </em>alongside a freshly localized version of the Super Famicom title via <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/collection-of-mana&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/collection-of-mana"><em>Collection of Mana</em></a></span> for Nintendo Switch. Seeing an SNES game get localized nearly 25 years later is already an anomaly, but this presents an especially unique conundrum. Two distinct versions of the same game were officially released within a year of each other, each with notable pros and cons. Is the remake of <em>Trials of Mana </em>preferable to the original, especially following <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/secret-of-mana-square-snes-rpg-remake-best-1851611091&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/secret-of-mana-square-snes-rpg-remake-best-1851611091">the controversial <em>Secret of Mana </em>remake</a></span>?</p><p><strong>The good news is that there’s no “wrong” way to play <em>Trials of Mana</em></strong>. However, there are some profound differences between each version of this game that even casual RPG fans shouldn’t gloss over. To help you out, here’s a breakdown of the pros and cons of each way to play <em>Trials of Mana</em>, followed by my personal recommendation of which game you should play.</p><h2 id="h11014"><a id="1995"></a><strong>Trials of Mana (1995)</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="9951bbc288176af3812fd8c01488b86c" data-recommend-id="image://9951bbc288176af3812fd8c01488b86c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The original Trials of Mana in 16bit." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The original Trials of Mana in 16bit." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9951bbc288176af3812fd8c01488b86c" data-recommend-id="image://9951bbc288176af3812fd8c01488b86c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The original Trials of Mana in 16bit." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>Platforms</strong>: Super Famicom (Japan Only), <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/collection-of-mana-switch/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/collection-of-mana-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nintendo Switch (via Collection of Mana)</a></span><br></p><p><strong>Pros</strong>: Let’s get the obvious out of the way: <em>Trials of Mana </em>is an exceptionally pretty game. By 1995, Squaresoft had mastered the art of aesthetically pleasing 16-bit games (see <em>Chrono Trigger</em>, <em>Final Fantasy 6</em>, etc.), and <em>Trials of Mana</em> nearly competes with PS1 games visually. It foregoes the bright aesthetic of <em>Secret of Mana </em>for more detailed and dark landscapes, but the character sprites and animations maintain the series’ trademark feel.</p><p>Combat in <em>Trials of Mana</em> contains some notable refinements when compared to <em>Secret of Mana</em>. Attacks now connect with satisfying striking sounds, which conveys their impact. Charged attacks are replaced by more powerful strikes, executed by filling a meter after using normal attacks. Magic spamming is also less prolific here, effectively preventing a single spellcaster from carrying your team to victory.</p><p>Speaking of party variety, the 16-bit version of <em>Trials of Mana </em>also provides one of the best co-op experiences in the <em>Mana </em>series. Thanks to the roster of six playable characters, it’s easy for two buddies to each pick melee fighters that are more fun to play as and contribute equal damage. There unfortunately isn’t native support for three player co-op, which is technically a downgrade from <em>Secret of Mana</em>. However, this opens up the option of building a third party member that can play a dedicated support role, which is also conducive to co-op play.</p><p>Finally, while this will only matter to retro enthusiasts, the original version of <em>Trials of Mana </em>is dripping with vintage Squaresoft nostalgia. You can choose to give your characters funny names, the menus feature ornate designs, and you can choose the design of the textboxes that appear during dialogue. This doesn’t <em>objectively </em>matter, but 16-bit <em>Trials of Mana </em>just has that <em>soul</em> that’s unique to “golden age” SNES RPGs. It’s hard to pin down, but you know it when you see it.</p><figure id="" data-id="5a01ff7613d6fb3b9e03b196dac49b0a" data-recommend-id="image://5a01ff7613d6fb3b9e03b196dac49b0a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A battle in the 16-bit port of Trials of Mana." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A battle in the 16-bit port of Trials of Mana." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5a01ff7613d6fb3b9e03b196dac49b0a" data-recommend-id="image://5a01ff7613d6fb3b9e03b196dac49b0a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A battle in the 16-bit port of Trials of Mana." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>Cons</strong>: While the updated combat system does support multiplayer pretty well, it’s not without issues. Despite the updated design, battles still feel basic in practice. It’s hard to dodge attacks since you move more slowly in combat, and you’ll predominately just attack whenever you can, while sprinkling in specials as you can use them. Rinse and repeat until the credits.<br></p><p>And yes, as another departure from <em>Secret of Mana</em>, you do “enter” combat in <em>Trials of Mana </em>a la <em>Chrono Trigger</em>. And because of this, <em>any </em>group of enemies will impede your progress, even if you intend to skip them. Once your weapon is drawn, you have to either fight to the finish or take the time to manually “run” from the battle. Either way, this takes a decent chunk of time.</p><p>The story progression here follows a decidedly more old-school approach, even in ways that were becoming out of date by 1995. The critical path you should follow isn’t always clear, leading to some potential backtracking and confusion at times. Meanwhile, while you’re in towns, story objectives are typically locked behind talking to certain NPCs without any indication of who is necessarily important. Retro games often expect players to talk to everyone for clues and sidequests, but <em>Trials of Mana </em>is more rigid about this.</p><p><em>Trials of Mana </em>is also, frankly, a bit buried by its own ambition. Characters can invest in one of six stats whenever they level up, but there’s no in-game description of what stats do or what each character should invest in. Making matters worse, stats like Agility and Luck are glitched, so they don’t affect your hit rate and critical hit rate the way they’re supposed to. Realistically, you’ll want to look at some guides before you build your party if you decide to play this version.</p><h2 id="h11015"><a id="2020"></a><strong>Trials of Mana (2020)</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="29e943378d21c85132d938aea39b3521" data-recommend-id="image://29e943378d21c85132d938aea39b3521" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Exploring in the Trials of Mana remake." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Exploring in the Trials of Mana remake." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="29e943378d21c85132d938aea39b3521" data-recommend-id="image://29e943378d21c85132d938aea39b3521" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Exploring in the Trials of Mana remake." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>Platforms</strong>: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/trials-of-mana/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/trials-of-mana/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation 4</a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/trials-of-mana-switch/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/trials-of-mana-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nintendo Switch</a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/924980/Trials_of_Mana/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/924980/Trials_of_Mana/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PC</a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/trials-of-mana/id1552176109&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/trials-of-mana/id1552176109" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS</a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.square_enix.android_googleplay.tom&amp;hl=en_US&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.square_enix.android_googleplay.tom&amp;hl=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Android</a></span><br></p><p><strong>Pros</strong>: Unlike the treatment <em>Secret of Mana </em>saw, <em>Trials of Mana</em> received a much more ambitious makeover in 2020. The world is now reimagined in full 3D, and there’s a greater emphasis on exploration and uncovering secret treasure chests. That said, the remake of <em>Trials of Mana </em>remains remarkably faithful to its source material. The dialogue and story beats are virtually identical to its 16-bit counterpart, and town layouts are almost exactly the same despite the jump to the third dimension. The result feels fresh and familiar in equal measure, which is a welcome change following the <em>Secret of Mana </em>remake.</p><p>Arguably the biggest change to <em>Trials of Mana </em>is the combat. The quasi-turn-based battle system of the classic <em>Mana </em>games is now replaced with real time combat that feels closer to the <em>Tales Of </em>in practice. Characters can execute basic combos by mixing light and heavy attacks, and you now need to manually dodge telegraphed AoE attacks by using the dedicated Evade button.</p><p>Despite this huge change, battles in the <em>Trials of Mana </em>remake retain the pace of the original game. The action moves at a slower pace, which disincentivizes button mashing in favor of carefully timed attacks. You’ll still charge powerful attacks via a meter as battles progress, though they now feature elaborate attack animations. Also, magic spells are still issued via ring menu commands that pause the action, which allows you to engage enemies more methodically if you prefer.</p><p>Also, there is an absolute ton of quality-of-life improvements here. The leveling system has been revamped, giving players clearer indications of how their stats affect their characters. Cutscenes can be skipped, and objectives to advance the story have been made so obvious that you absolutely cannot miss them. There’s even an all new post-game quest, alongside a New Game Plus mode and extra difficulty options as of the game’s 1.1 update.</p><p>It’s clear <em>Trials of Mana </em>had an actual budget to work with this time around, and the developers stretched it for all it’s worth.</p><figure id="" data-id="50c7943feb44cb2e89ef3c65e7b86807" data-recommend-id="image://50c7943feb44cb2e89ef3c65e7b86807" data-format="jpg" data-width="1768" data-height="1026" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Combat in the Trials of Mana remake." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Combat in the Trials of Mana remake." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="50c7943feb44cb2e89ef3c65e7b86807" data-recommend-id="image://50c7943feb44cb2e89ef3c65e7b86807" data-format="jpg" data-width="1768" data-height="1026" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Combat in the Trials of Mana remake." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>Cons: </strong>I know I just praised the game’s budget, but it’s still, undoubtedly, a budget game. <em>Trials of Mana </em>was one of the most visually striking games on the Super Nintendo, but the remake is best described as a “B-Tier” RPG. To be clear, <em>I do not blame the developers for this at all</em>. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/game-industry-layoffs-how-many-2024-unity-twitch-1851155818&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/game-industry-layoffs-how-many-2024-unity-twitch-1851155818">Game development has become so prohibitively expensive</a></span> that <em>Trials of Mana</em>’s sheer existence is a small miracle in and of itself. Regardless, the remake is not striking in the way that its original version is.<br></p><p>On a similar note, the <em>Trials of Mana </em>remake only supports one player. Again, it’s hard to fault the developers here. The expanded combat system would have needed to be completely reworked to support multiplayer, and couch co-op doesn’t have the demand that it did back in the 90s. Still, co-op play was a defining feature of the classic <em>Mana </em>games, so it’s a bummer to see the series lose that identity. Fortunately, as per my own words on <em>PC Gamer</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/visions-of-mana-wont-have-multiplayer-but-producer-masaru-oyamada-wants-to-implement-features-like-that-in-the-future/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/visions-of-mana-wont-have-multiplayer-but-producer-masaru-oyamada-wants-to-implement-features-like-that-in-the-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">co-op play is something that series producer Masaru Oyamada is open to in the future</a></span>.</p><p>Getting into more nitpicky territory, the voice acting in <em>Trials of Mana</em>—while generally better than the performances in the <em>Secret of Mana </em>remake—sounds a bit awkward. Characters deliver their lines with inflections that don’t flow well from sentence to sentence, or their intensity doesn’t match what’s happening on screen. This likely stems from the game’s winding, interconnected script which is difficult to simply organize, let alone perform. In other words, I’d chalk this up to struggles with voice direction.</p><figure id="" data-id="3c73f07980f55f998bf88f1a5f74bf9e" data-recommend-id="image://3c73f07980f55f998bf88f1a5f74bf9e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="It's a big ol' turtle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="It's a big ol' turtle." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3c73f07980f55f998bf88f1a5f74bf9e" data-recommend-id="image://3c73f07980f55f998bf88f1a5f74bf9e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="It's a big ol' turtle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h11016"><a id="best"></a><strong>So which version of <em>Trials of Mana </em>is best?</strong></h2><p>This is a weirdly complex question to answer. By most objective measures, <strong>the <em>Trials of Mana </em>remake is the better overall experience and one of the best ways to get into the Mana series</strong>. Not only does it soften many of the original game’s rough edges, but it’s modernized to the point that it can appeal to those with no nostalgia for 16-bit RPGs. According to <em>Mana </em>series producer Masaru Oyamada when I spoke to him, 2024’s <em>Visions of Mana </em>builds off the foundation the <em>Trials of Mana </em>remake established. So in a way, <em>Trials of Mana </em>can be considered a rebirth of the <em>Mana </em>series as we know it.</p><p>Yet despite this, <strong>the 16-bit version of <em>Trials of Mana </em>remains the more impressive version of the game</strong>. By the standards of mid ‘90s RPGs, it’s truly incredible to see how high <em>Trials of Mana </em>aimed with its scope and replay value. And even without that context, the 2D artstyle still looks absolutely gorgeous, especially when you get to those screen-filling boss encounters.</p><p>If you play the remake of <em>Trials of Mana</em>, you likely won’t understand why this title built such a passionate fanbase. But if you’re at all familiar with SNES games, you can understand why the original version of <em>Trials of Mana</em> is so special within just a couple hours of playing.</p><p>Aside from that, the 16-bit version of <em>Trials of Mana </em>still has one major draw that the remake doesn’t have: co-op play<em>. </em><strong>If you’re down for a retro couch co-op experience, the original version of </strong><em><strong>Trials of Mana </strong></em><strong>is still a great time</strong>. If you have fond memories of playing <em>Secret of Mana </em>with friends, then <em>Trials of Mana </em>will still be a treat, even with its rough edges. Or play both! It’s really fun to see just how similar the 2D and 3D environments wind up looking despite the different art styles.</p><p>Having said all of that, if you aren’t keenly interested in the history of the <em>Mana </em>series or SNES games, you can easily play the <em>Trials of Mana </em>remake and call it a day. It’s a fun action-RPG that’s easy to love, and you can typically find it on sale for under $29.99 USD. If you’re curious enough about the game to have read this far, then definitely consider giving it a shot.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-reach-2-million-as-devs-promise-first-major-update-soon<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Playstack and developer LocalThunk have announced that&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>sales have crossed another big milestone, and there's more good news for fans of the poker roguelike as well.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/BalatroGame/status/1821184859974344853" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a message on X</a> (formerly known as Twitter), Playstack and LocalThunk say that&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>has hit 2 million sales. Given that the studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-one-million">marked its million-sale milestone</a> back in March, another million certainly won't hurt for the two studios, although it's clear (albeit understandable) that sales have somewhat slowed down since&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>'s release.</p>
<p>As well as announcing the new sales milestone, LocalThunk and Playstack have also revealed that the first major&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>update is due to arrive next year, and it'll bring "new ideas and strategies to the game". It'll also be totally free "as a token of huge appreciation to the game’s brilliant and passionate community".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/balatro-sales-2-million-shop.jpg?itok=yMz2n5a5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/balatro-sales-2-million-shop.jpg?itok=otiRjYD- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>is getting a major free update next year.</figcaption></figure><p>That's not all, either. The two studios are also teasing more "surprises" for&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>in the coming weeks, so it sounds like it won't be long before we hear more about what's coming to the poker roguelike.</p>
<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>, it's one of the biggest indie smash hits of the last few months. The game combines poker gameplay with roguelike mechanics, introducing the possibility to swap out cards for synergies and build bespoke decks to take on its many challenges.</p>
<p>The game features a campaign mode that offers eight different difficulty levels to suit players of all abilities, as well as challenge runs and different seeds to keep you on your toes. Together with the upcoming free update, it's not likely you'll run out of stuff to do in&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>anytime soon.</p>

<p><em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>has proven a bona fide sensation; it took just a couple of weeks for the game to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-half-million">cross the half a million mark</a> in sales, and it's arguably just grown in popularity and cultural cachet since then.</p>
<p>It's also one of two major recent hits for publisher Playstack. Earlier today, the publisher <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/abiotic-factor-sales-600k">announced</a> that sales of its survival-crafter&nbsp;<em>Abiotic Factor</em>&nbsp;have crossed the 600,000 mark, so it looks like Playstack's star is in its ascendancy.</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379780/Balatro/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC via Steam</a>. There's no word of a console version being on the horizon, but perhaps that's the news LocalThunk and Playstack are cooking up for later this summer. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>
Exactly one year (and four days) after <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>'s version 1.0 release, developer Larian is celebrating the highly acclaimed RPG's first anniversary by releasing a whole bunch of revealing players stats. Which, among other things, confirm that 30 percent of the 30 percent of players who opted to sex Halsin sexed Halsin in bear form.
</p>
<p>
Larian's <a href="https://x.com/baldursgate3/status/1821186927779004770">newly unveiled birthday stats</a> get pretty granular, and I'll be glossing over the spoiler-y ones here (as well as the ones that mean absolutely nothing to me because I'm still prancing round the crash site right at the start desperately wishing I had more time to play). Instead, let us discuss the more universal revelations, such as the news 75m companion kisses have been shared in Baldur's Gate 3 over the last year, with 27m of those landing on the lips of Shadowheart, while 15m were planted on Astarion's puckered mouth-hole. And right at the bottom of the smoochy charts? Poor old Minthara with just 169,937 kisses. Which, let's be honest, is probably still way above average for most people.
</p>
<p>
And while we're on the subject of romance, it should be noted that around 197K players opted to bang Halsin in his now <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-the-baldurs-gate-3-bear-sex-scene-came-to-be-and-why-its-a-watershed-moment-in-game-history">legendary bear form</a> (out of the 658K players total that danced down O-street with the hunky Wood Elf Druid), while approximately 407K people were up for mind flayer tentacle sex when the opportunity arose. Absolutely no kink-shaming here.

<p>
In slightly less erotic matters, the Paladin has proven to be the most common class pick for Baldur's Gate 3 players, being almost twice as popular as last-place pick, the Cleric. As for the most popular race pick, that'll be elf, which has been chosen nearly five times as much as the halfling, down at the bottom. Elsewhere, Scratch the dog was petted over 120m times, officially making him the goodest boy, while 141,660 players attempted to pet His Majesty - and are now, presumably, scraping their faces off the floor. Curiously, exactly the same number of players managed to complete Baldur's Gate 3's hardcore Honour Mode, so read into that what you will.

For the more spoiler-y stats, you'll be wanting to head over to Larian's <a href="https://x.com/baldursgate3/status/1821186927779004770">illuminating series of posts</a> on social media - but I think it'd be remiss of me not to at least leave you with the news that 1.9m players got themselves turned into cheese. A feta worse than death, indeed.
</p>
<p>
Larian does, of course, still have a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3s-seventh-patch-amends-split-screen-adds-mod-support-wont-be-final-update">few things up its sleeve</a> before it's ready to wave goodbye to Baldur's Gate 3 for good, with incoming features including mod support (currently in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3s-patch-7-closed-beta-delayed-due-to-dice-rolling-issue">closed beta</a>), crossplay, a photo mode, gameplay tweaks, and quality-of-life improvements.
</p>
<p>
As Larian boss Swen Vincke recently confirmed, a Baldur's Gate 4 was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-developer-initially-started-work-on-a-follow-up-as-it-was-the-obvious-thing">briefly toyed with</a> before the studio opted to tackle something new instead. And while Larian is yet to formally reveal its next project, it <em>has</em> confirmed two games are currently in the works - both based on its own IPs and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-studio-confirms-two-new-projects-will-be-our-best-work-ever">described by Vincke</a> as "our best work ever."

Not anymore. </p><p>An announcement over on the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.fortnite.com/news/change-to-item-exclusivity-in-future-fortnite-battle-passes&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/change-to-item-exclusivity-in-future-fortnite-battle-passes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Fortnite</em> website</a></span> outlines changes moving forward that will bring some battle pass rewards to the Item Shop with at least an 18 month delay. Here’s how Epic describes the shift:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> Items in future Fortnite Battle Passes might be offered for purchase in the Fortnite Shop <strong>after 18 or more months from the Battle Pass’ expiration</strong>. A Battle Pass item may include a different number of its alt Styles each time it comes to the Shop.</p><p>This change lets us continue investing in new and exciting Battle Pass rewards while enabling players down the road to also enjoy the content, including Outfits based on popular licensed characters.﻿</p></blockquote><p>The “might” there means that Epic isn’t guaranteeing that <em>every</em> item will eventually be resold, preserving the current incentive to unlock it from the battle pass. This change also only applies to rewards moving forward. So old skins from <em>John Wick</em>, <em>Spider-Man</em>, and more will remain locked for anyone who didn’t already earn them and doesn’t have a time machine. The total number of alt styles available on skins if and when they’re resold will also vary, except for Lego versions which will always be included by default. </p><p>This is essentially Epic giving players 18 month advance warning that anything they unlock in a battle pass moving forward might show up on an opponent who is just able to buy it from the store. That will no doubt ruffle some feathers who feel a sense of “you had to be there” is an important element of <em>Fortnite</em>’s social contract. Other players will probably wish this change was retroactive so they had a shot at buying past costumes they missed out on. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Spectre Divide Closed Beta Starts August 13]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/spectre-divide-closed-beta-date/</link>

<p>Spectre Divide was revealed in full mere days ago, with the community responding positively to this innovative and ambitious first-person shooter. It looks as though it’s poised to rival the likes of VALORANT, and it has been developed hand-in-hand with Michael ‘shroud’ Grzesiek, a former competitive gamer and one of the biggest streamers in the world.</p>



<p>Players eager to get their hands on the game won’t have to wait long – the closed beta will start on August 13 and run for a week until August 21.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-into-the-spectre-divide-closed-beta">How to Get Into The Spectre Divide Closed Beta</h2>



<p>Per Mountaintop’s instructions, there are two ways to get access to the Spectre Divide closed beta.</p>



<p>First, you can watch streams on Twitch and earn invitations via Drops. If you’d rather be a little more direct, you can request access to the closed beta through Steam. That’s as simple as navigating to the game’s page and clicking ‘Request Access’. If you’re successful, you’ll be granted a spot in the closed beta in no time at all.</p>



<p>Spectre Divide aims to be disruptive, and the team at Mountaintop has devised a unique ‘duality’ mechanic that’ll help the game to stand out from the competition. With this mechanic, players can assume control of two bodies in the same game, allowing them to be more strategic than ever before.</p>



<p>When it’s released in full, Spectre Divide will feature ranked play, weekly competitions, and hopefully, a solid esports ecosystem. If it’s managed properly, it could be a true rival to the likes of VALORANT and Counter-Strike 2.</p>

Despite some serious drop-off to its player base, the community is still going strong, with an average of around 40K divers diving at any given moment. The developer, Arrowhead Studios, even had to slow down adding new content to the game with their Warbonds, because players were still taking their time unlocking everything in previous ones. Helldivers 2 has committed to keeping players engaged with their game, and so far it seems to be paying off.</p><p>Now, it’s time for their first big expansion. Escalation of Freedom which adds difficulty level 10, a new swamp map type, new enemies from both the Terminids and Automatons, and new mission types. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Shaking things up is always necessary for any live-service game to keep up momentum, but what if looking to the game’s future meant looking to the franchise’s past? The original Helldivers was evolving and adding to it’s formula for years after its release in 2015, and while Helldivers 2 reworked and left out a few of the features from the first game to streamline gameplay and make sure their game was solid (which was obviously the right move), they now have an opportunity to slowly reinstate some of the ideas they had all those years ago to make Helldivers 2 even better.</p><h2>Vehicles</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/01/23/helldivers2thumb-1706027339276.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>First and foremost, Arrowhead should bring back vehicles. Motorcycles, APCs, tanks, and exosuits eventually made it to the original twin-stick shooter, and with the Patriot and Emancipator Exosuits already having made their way to the sequel, it wouldn’t be surprising if more mobility options follow.</p><p>The larger size of Helldivers 2 maps compared to Helldivers 1 lend themselves even more to ways to get around them expeditiously. From the <a href="https://helldivers.wiki.gg/wiki/Helldivers_1:MC-109_Hammer_Motorcycle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>MC-109 Hammer Motorcycle</u></a> for the lone wolves, to the <a href="https://helldivers.wiki.gg/wiki/Helldivers_1:TD-110_Bastion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>TD-110 Bastion</u></a> and <a href="https://helldivers.wiki.gg/wiki/Helldivers_1:M5_APC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>M5 APC</u></a> with their heavy firepower, there are tons of exciting ways Arrowhead could retrofit these vehicles from Helldivers 1 to fit within the gameplay context of the sequel.</p><p>Not only would vehicles bring new ways for players to traverse maps more quickly, take down larger enemies more efficiently, and strategize in new and interesting ways, but the opportunity for hilarity cannot be understated. </p><p>Social media (or at least my social media) has been full of people recording ridiculous moments of friendly fire, Stratagems gone wrong, or watching as their fellow Helldivers jump off cliffs just to showcase the amazing ragdoll effects the game has. It’s that physics engine that would make for even more laugh-out-loud moments with the addition of vehicles, as you accidentally run your friends over, tumble away as you attempt to exit a moving vehicle, or watch, powerless, as your teammate drives headfirst into a Charger, launching you both into the air. They could even go a step further and introduce something like a rideable rocket that requires your sacrifice, but allows for a truly targeted strike. Who knows! The possibilities are endless.</p><h2>Different Stratagems</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/02/15/vlcsnap-2024-02-15-02h21m50s298-1707992541308.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>But a rideable rocket would be less of a vehicle and more of a stratagem. Well, they’re all Stratagems, but you know what I mean. Stratagems for heavy weapons and tactical deployments are some of the game’s most interesting mechanics, and honestly the thing Arrowhead seems most keen to add more of over time. We’ve already gotten the two Exosuits, and the Airbust and Commando rocket launchers since launch. But there are still a bunch more from the first game and even some gameplay mechanics that have yet to be introduced in Helldivers 2.</p><p>For instance, the <a href="https://helldivers.wiki.gg/wiki/Helldivers_1:TOX-13_Avenger" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>TOX-13 Avenger</u></a> was a support weapon stratagem in Helldivers 1 that spat toxic sludge like a flamethrower, giving the Terminids a taste of their own medicine. There was also the <a href="https://helldivers.wiki.gg/wiki/Helldivers_1:M-25_Rumbler" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>M-25 Rumbler</u></a> mortar, which would give players control over their mortar strikes, and more emplacement turrets like the <a href="https://helldivers.wiki.gg/wiki/Helldivers_1:AT-47_Anti-Tank_Emplacement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>AT-47 Anti-Tank Emplacement</u></a> and <a href="https://helldivers.wiki.gg/wiki/Helldivers_1:A/RX-34_Railcannon_Turret" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>A/RX-34 Railcannon Turret</u></a>. There were drones that <a href="https://helldivers.wiki.gg/wiki/Helldivers_1:AD-289_Angel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>healed teammates</u></a> and <a href="https://helldivers.wiki.gg/wiki/Helldivers_1:Humblebee_UAV_drone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>boosted UAV signals</u></a>, <a href="https://helldivers.wiki.gg/wiki/Helldivers_1:Distractor_Beacon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>distractor beacons</u></a>, and even <a href="https://helldivers.wiki.gg/wiki/Helldivers_1:Close_Air_Support" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>an Eagle Airstrike variant</u></a> that uses air-to-air missiles. Honestly, every one of these feels interesting and worthwhile for certain situations that would apply to Helldivers 2, and I hope that each of them make their way to the game eventually. Especially that last one, so I finally have a better way to deal with Shriekers and Gunships.</p><h2>More Weapon Types</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/23/helldivers-2-escalation-of-freedom-1721742365253.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>While there are already a good, healthy number of weapons available to Helldivers in the second game, there are still a few from the first that could shake things up for the meta if implemented. For instance — HELLDIVERS 1 HAD A SWORD. It was called the <a href="https://helldivers.wiki.gg/wiki/Helldivers_1:Saber" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Saber</u></a>, and it was everything you could ever dream of. Please give us a sword, Arrowhead. But beyond that, there was also a <a href="https://helldivers.wiki.gg/wiki/Helldivers_1:FLAM-24_Pyro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>flamethrower pistol</u></a>, a <a href="https://helldivers.wiki.gg/wiki/Helldivers_1:DBS-2_Double_Freedom" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>double barrel, double trigger shotgun</u></a>, and even a <a href="https://helldivers.wiki.gg/wiki/Helldivers_1:LAS-12_Tanto" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>laser-powered submachine gun</u></a>. But my favorite has to be the hilarious and useless M2016 'Constitution' that’s just a copy of the classic M1903 service rifle from WW1 with a bayonet for melee attacks. There are a ton of fun ideas for weapons and I think we’re starting to see them get weird with it since the recent introduction of <a href="https://helldivers.wiki.gg/wiki/K-2_Throwing_Knife" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Throwing Knives</u></a>.</p><p>Another, smaller element that Helldivers 2 could improve upon with input from the first game is the idea of Loadouts. Having to manually equip everything from armor to guns to Stratagems and boosters for every mission is tedious, and a Loadout system would be huge. It’s a wonder why that wasn’t one of the features that made its way over immediately from the first game. Whatever the case, I hope they’re able to implement that one really soon.</p><h2>AND MORE ENEMIES</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/23/helldivers2escalationoffreedomtrailer-ign-blogroll1-1721744259706.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>In terms of new enemies, that’s the one place where everyone is looking to the first game for answers. The Illuminate were the third faction of Helldivers 1, and were another robotic life form like the Automatons, but more sleek and sophisticated rather than Terminator-esque. They rode around in circular, floating vehicles and used energy- and electricity-based weaponry, as well as energy shields. They were difficult, and required players to change strategy (and Stratagems) in order to take them down. It’s this kind of diversity that will keep players coming back as new and intriguing things are introduced. The Illuminate, however, I could see being a further-off plan, one for an even larger expansion. Maybe a big “year two” type deal.</p><p>In the meantime, there are ways to breathe new life into the Terminids and Automatons. In the upcoming Escalation of Freedom expansion, both the Terminids and Automatons will see new members join their respective factions, with the Impaler Terminid making its return from Helldivers 1. From what we’ve seen in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8don2Z3pvAo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>the trailer</u></a>, they’ve reworked the Impaler to better fit the context of a third person shooter, with tentacles that cut off escape routes and force you to stand your ground. So it’s already begun! More and more ideas from the first game get to make their way to the second. You love to see it.</p><p>Ultimately, there’s also a lot in terms of inspiration that Arrowhead could take from games that share more modern elements with Helldivers 2 now that it has changed its formula in a few important ways from the original. Having larger enemies with weak points, or multi-stage boss encounters that evolve as the fight goes on is something that both of these kinds of games do incredibly well. </p><p>Plus, Helldivers II has already shown some interest in this kind of design, with Chargers and their breakable armor, the Bile Spewers and their burstable backsides, among others. Doubling down on this design language would open up enemy encounters and encourage new, thoughtful strategies to emerge amongst players. It’s exciting to think about what Helldivers II could build on top of the already stellar foundation of their enemy design.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>With Helldivers 1 and 2, Arrowhead has showcased its incredible talents and creativity as a developer, and there are so many elements from the first game they can reinterpret for its successor. Their track record for making the right decisions about pricing, microtransactions, server issues, and patches has been rock solid so far, on top of designing a truly engaging video game. With the success they’ve now seen, I hope they are able continue making thoughtful and creative decisions that build the game into something even more engaging. I can’t wait to see what they come up with. And if I missed anything, let us know what you would like to see Helldivers II add in the comments down below.</p><p>For everything else about Helldivers 2, check out our <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/helldivers-2">guide</a> for all the <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/helldivers-2/Tips_and_Tricks_for_Getting_Started">best Tips and Tricks</a> to get started.</p><p><em>Tyler Robertson is a social media coordinator and producer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The First Berserker: Khazan's first gameplay footage is here, and it's looking quite promising. Boasting a cel-shaded anime artstyle and a frosty aesthetic, Khazan looks straight out of the pages of a combat-filled manga like Berserk. How fitting.</p><p dir="ltr">The latest entry in the Dungeon &amp; Fighter series--which includes the online fighting game DNF Duel and the MMORPG Dungeon Fighter Online--The First Berserker: Khazan is a hack-and-slash action-RPG with similarities to the Souls series and classics like the original God of War games. The trailer shows a wounded Khazan being fully healed by a strange sword called the "Blade Phantom." After that, he explores a snowy mountainscape, using his axe and sword to deal with a number of enemies, finally ending with an impressive boss fight with a Yeti-like monster.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The First Berserker: Khazan | Official First 15 Minutes Of Gameplay Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">While it's not clear if Khazan is fully a "Soulslike," it exhibits a lot of elements that have become synonymous with the series, including maze-like environments, powerful falling attacks, charge attacks, a sprint option, and even a parry. The game's stylized visuals stand out the most in this trailer, as we haven't seen many notable action-RPGs in that style in recent years. The First Berserker: Khazan will come out sometime in 2025, and it will release for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

The update will “bring new ideas and strategies to the game” and will be released for all platforms (it’s available on Steam, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox), LocalThunk says.</p><p><em>Balatro</em> launched <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24082252/balatro-review-poker-roguelike-videogame">earlier this year</a>, and it’s since become a smash hit thanks to its compelling gameplay loop that will have you saying “just one more run” until it’s far past your bedtime. While the game involves poker hands, you don’t gamble chips or money — instead, the goal is to strategically build high-scoring hands through things like discarding cards, modifying your cards, and collecting powerful jokers that have various ways of influencing the game. (LocalThunk says he is so opposed to <em>Balatro</em> becoming a true gambling game that, in his will, he stipulated that the franchise could <a href="https://x.com/LocalThunk/status/1820752209765961746">never be sold</a> to a gambling company or casino.)</p><p>The game has now sold 2 million units, LocalThunk says, and it regularly sits in the upper ranks <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fcharts%2Fsteamdecktopplayed">of top-played games on Steam Deck</a>. I’ve played <em>Balatro</em> most on Switch, but I bought a second copy on Steam so that I could play on Steam Deck, too.</p><p>In addition to the upcoming major update, LocalThunk says there are “a few more announcements in the works that will be revealed over the next couple of months.” The game is also in development <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/15/24102437/balatro-iphone-android-mobile">for iPhone and Android</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>UK arts and entertainment union Equity have unveiled a raft of "best practice guidelines" for video game developers hiring voice actors, including some suggested minimum rates that are designed to address "systemic low pay" for performers. Other measures are designed to improve voice actor working conditions, and stop companies using their voices and likeness as fuel for generative AI tools without their consent. It's both a praiseworthy endeavour and an interesting breakdown of the voice-actor's trade.</p><!--more-->
<p>"The videogames industry is a dynamic place to work but unethical practices undermine the profession," Equity <a href="https://www.equity.org.uk/advice-and-support/sector-specific-advice/videogames">explain on their official site</a>. "Pay for UK performers has stagnated despite games being a multibillion-dollar industry with almost £200 million in tax breaks. Performers don't have the protections they need in the unregulated world of AI, the misuse of NDAs is common and health and safety is often lacking."</p>
<p>The best practice guidelines span fair pay, the need for voice actor consent when creating digital replicas or "training" AI software, provisions for safer workplaces (including guidance about intimacy coordinators and vocal chord stress), and stipulations about "clear, legal, enforceable, fair, proportionate and targeted" non-disclosure agreements.</p>
<p>As regards NDAs, Equity <a href="https://www.equity.org.uk/advice-and-support/casting-and-auditions/information-on-non-disclosure-agreements">argues</a> that: "At the moment, many of the NDA agreements we see reflect poorly upon the industry, often intimidating and isolating Performers from those that support them. Performers are forced to sign documents which they have no hope of understanding or amending.</p>
<p>"The result is that Performers often assume that they will be sued if they tell anyone anything about the production, even where they have been victims of or witnesses to a criminal offence," the page continues. "This is all the more shocking five years since the Harvey Weinstein scandal highlighted the appalling misuse of NDAs, shook the film industry, and ignited the #MeToo movement. By now, we would have expected Engagers to be following best practice and not repeat past mistakes."</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.equity.org.uk/advice-and-support/sector-specific-advice/videogames/videogames-recommended-rate-card#voiceover-rates">suggested minimum rates</a>, meanwhile, offer some snippets of info about how specific types of voice-acting and motion capture are valued within video game projects. For example, they distinguish between voice lines that form part of the main plot and "atmospheric" or "world-building" voices - "no more than 300 scripted/recorded lines that do not further the story".</p>
<p>There are also "Walla voices", defined as "unscripted voices not assigned to a specific character, that do not further the story". Examples of walla voicework include crowd chatter and creature noises  - the term apparently dates back to the early days of radio broadcasting, when certain shows found that having groups repeat "walla walla" produced an effective impression of organic background hubbub. </p>
<p>I like hearing about production niceties such as these. Now that I've learned the term, I find myself surprisingly laden with memories of walla voicework. There's a backing track of anomalous battlefield mitherings you hear during loading breaks for Total War: Warhammer 3, for example. I had that stuck in my head for a while, albeit partly because my review PC at the time was a sclerotic antique, and it sometimes took five minutes to load a battle.</p>
<p>As Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-actors-union-equity-introduces-minimum-rates-to-address-systemic-low-pay-for-video-game-performers">reminds us</a>, Equity's best practice guidelines come amid strike action from US actor's union SAG-AFTRA. In July, SAG-AFTRA spokespeople commented that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ai-protections-remain-the-sticking-point-for-todays-sag-aftra-game-actor-strike">"AI protections remain the sticking point" for the strike</a>, following <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/actors-union-sag-aftra-strike-deal-to-allow-ai-voice-replicas-and-video-game-stars-are-understandably-pissed">disagreements between the union and members about deals with individual companies who use the tech</a>. "Eighteen months of negotiations have shown us that our employers are not interested in fair, reasonable AI protections, but rather flagrant exploitation," Interactive Media Agreement Negotiating Committee chair Sarah Elmaleh commented at the time.</p>
<p>"Atmospheric" and "walla" voice-acting, Equity observe in their new guidelines, are "one of the segments of our industry most threatened by AI", presumably because the uncanniness of AI-generated speech is harder to detect when it's buried in a crowd. While not participating in the SAG-AFTRA strike for legal reasons, Equity have plenty of advice and requests for developers who are thinking about making use of generative AI.</p><p>Amongst other things, they suggest that companies confirm in advance whether "the data recorded within the stipulated performance sessions will be used for the stated project only and not re-used in future titles" and that "a pre-purchase / integration fee should be paid when a developer, studio or publisher wishes to hold performance data in their 'library' for potential re-use on future projects".</p>
<p>If you found all this intriguing, I encourage you to read the full text over on Equity's site - this is just a scraping of its surfaces. You might also be intrigued by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/judas-and-bioshock-dev-ken-levine-thinks-video-game-voice-acting-has-a-problem-with-turn-based-dialogue">Ken Levine's thoughts on "turn-based dialogue"</a>. If you'd like to read more about the broad implications of generative AI technology, Mike Cook <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/electric-nightmares">did a whole essay series on it earlier this year</a>.</p>

<p>Warner Bros Discovery appears to be trying to get out of the games business. According to a new report from <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2ea08a79-b569-4349-8ee8-993ba5599179" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Financial Times</a> (subscription needed), Warner Bros. is looking at the possibility of selling off at least a part of its games division.</p>



<p>The report comes just two weeks after Warner Bros. Games <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-games-acquires-multiversus-developer-player-first-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acquired MultiVersus developer Player First Games</a>.</p>



<p>The report claims that by selling off games would help the company avoid possible lawsuits from various debt investors. Nothing has been finalized, however.</p>







<p>Warner Bros. Games currently owns major IPs like Harry Potter and Mortal Kombat. They are also the publisher being Suicide  Squad: Kill the Justice League, the live-service game that was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-reportedly-says-suicide-squad-fell-short-of-expectations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">met with a poor response</a> from players and critics alike. It was also a game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/suicide-squad-cost-warner-bros-200-million-in-revenue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that cost the company</a> $200 million in revenue.</p>



<p>This isn’t the first time Warner Bros. Games was a potential sale candidate. Back in 2020, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/microsoft-expresses-interest-in-acquiring-warner-game-unit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it was reported</a> that Microsoft was interested in buying the division in order to get games like Mortal Kombat, Suicide Squad, and others under its umbrella.</p>



<p>It’s unclear, should a sale happen, if Microsoft would once again be interested due to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-new-round-of-layoffs/">the current situation of the</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-new-round-of-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> </a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-new-round-of-layoffs/">company</a> after its acquisition of Activision Blizzard.</p>



<p>Warner Bros. Discovery has not responded to multiple requests for comment prior to publishing.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Return to Moria&nbsp;</em>arrives on Steam and Xbox on August 27th, and it's arriving alongside a major update for the game that will add a number of oft-requested features including crossplay, new gear, and a pause button for those playing in single-player.</p>
<p>Titled The Golden Update, the upcoming patch will&nbsp;be made available to all players when the Steam and Xbox releases hit, and it's even got a feature that was only available to beta branch players on the Epic Games Store previously.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria-fight.jpg?itok=2JAm5cQz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria-fight.jpg?itok=b9YO6Fuq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria&nbsp;</em>is coming soon to Steam and Xbox Series X|S.</figcaption></figure><p>First up, Sandbox Mode, which allows you to explore a procedurally-generated Moria at your own leisure. The devs say each playthrough can "vary significantly in layout and difficulty". Free Range does warn that this mode is mainly intended for those who are already familiar with&nbsp;<em>Return to Moria</em>, though, because it offers minimal tutorializing.</p>
<p>Additionally, up to eight players can now enjoy&nbsp;<em>Return to Moria&nbsp;</em>together no matter which platform they're playing on, so if you're playing <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lord-of-rings-return-to-moria-release-date">on the Epic Games Store or the PS5</a>, you'll soon be able to play alongside your Steam and Xbox buddies.</p>
<p>You'll also find recipes for new armor and weapons, and although they're only discoverable in Sandbox Mode, you'll be able to bring them across to the Campaign if you want to.</p>
<p>If you're interested in the Golden Update, you can check out everything that's new <a href="https://www.returntomoria.com/news-updates/aug27-golden-update" rel="noopener" target="_blank">right here via the official website</a>.

            <p>
Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-trailer-takes-you-on-a-tour-of-its-hyrule">Nintendo released a fresh trailer for The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>, that's due out next month.
</p>
<p>
The game stars the titular princess in the leading role for the first time and includes a new Echo mechanic, where Zelda can essentially copy and paste elements from the world to explore and solve puzzles.
</p>
<p>
The new trailer focused on giving a tour of Hyrule, showing off its various regions, and the new power Bind that allows Zelda to attach herself to (and move with) objects and enemies. 
</p>
<p>
But there are some extra details in the trailer you may have missed. Check out the new trailer below first.

<h3>Horse riding</h3>
<p>
Ok, it's not exactly a missable detail that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">Echoes of Wisdom</a> will include horse riding. But it is significant, in part because it's usually associated with the more expansive 3D Zelda games (though it was included in Four Swords Adventures). Zelda will be able to summon a horse once she (appropriately) learns the Echo for a carrot, but in the trailer we see both a brown and white horse suggesting there's no set Epona equivalent but multiple horses available. Horses can run and jump through the world, and she appears to arrive at what could be Lon Lon Ranch. The inclusion of horses, ultimately, hints towards the size of this world that seems larger than any other top-down Zelda before.</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<h3>Region names</h3>
<p>
When Echoes of Wisdom was first revealed earlier this year, fans speculated the map appeared similar to that of A Link to the Past. Yet now we have confirmed region names, which are taken from more recent Zelda games. There's the Gerudo Desert for instance, which causes the princess to break out in a sweat, and its Gerudo tribe women look like chibi versions of their <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Breath of the Wild</a> counterparts. The Faron Wetlands (Twilight Princess, Breath of the Wild) is where we meet the Deku, while the game's mountainous region is called Eldin Volcano - this parallels Skyward Sword when usually Death Mountain is the iconic volcano. Lastly, the Zora reside in Jabul Waters, perhaps relating back to Ocarina of Time's giant fish Jabu Jabu.</p>

<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/The-Legend-of-Zelda_-Echoes-of-Wisdom-%E2%80%93-Traversing-Hyrule-Trailer-%E2%80%93-Nintendo-Switch-0-36-screenshot.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>Adventuring is sweaty work | <span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<h3>Water regions</h3>
<p>
Speaking of water, we've seen already the game will include both sea and river Zora who appear to be feuding. Jabul Waters features pillars with the Water Medallion design from Ocarina of Time, while the River Zora village curiously includes musical instruments like a lute, maracas, and a horn. Could this hint at Majora's Mask's band The Indigo-Go's?</p>

<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/The-Legend-of-Zelda_-Echoes-of-Wisdom-%E2%80%93-Traversing-Hyrule-Trailer-%E2%80%93-Nintendo-Switch-1-5-screenshot.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>Spot the instruments! | <span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<h3>Links to Breath of the Wild</h3>
<p>
Echoes of Wisdom certainly appears to be marrying the adorable top-down visuals of the Link's Awakening remake with the creativity and experimental vibe of the more recent Zelda games. Bind, in particular, feels analogous to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">Tears of the Kingdom</a>'s Ultrahand. More specifically, the UI and text font are the same and this new trailer provides a look at Zelda's Adventure Log. It's here players will prioritise quests, split between Side Quests and Main Quests. Interestingly, Zelda has multiple Main Quests available, suggesting a more open player-led structure more akin to the Switch Zelda games.</p>

<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/The-Legend-of-Zelda_-Echoes-of-Wisdom-%E2%80%93-Traversing-Hyrule-Trailer-%E2%80%93-Nintendo-Switch-2-5-screenshot.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>This feels very similar to Breath of the Wild | <span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>

<h3>Japanese artwork</h3>
<p>
Outside of the trailer, Nintendo has released official artwork for Echoes of Wisdom. However, the Japanese version (as on the game's <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/switch/bdgea/index.html">Japanese website</a>) is zoomed out slightly further and includes some extra details. The top left corner includes a small man on a paraglider - could he be a new postman perhaps? There's also a snake enemy in the bottom right, as well as what looks like a Wanted poster for Zelda. The previous trailer showed Zelda meeting new companion Tri in a jail cell before embarking on her adventure while cloaked, so it seems she could spend part of her adventure on the run.</p>
 <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>The Japanese version of The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom key art includes a seemingly important key character that Nintendo hasn't talked about yet. </p><p>If you look in the upper left hand corner, you'll see him paragliding! <a href="https://t.co/mi7UeroeS3">pic.twitter.com/mi7UeroeS3</a></p></div>— Stealth (@Stealth40k) <a href="https://twitter.com/Stealth40k/status/1820811363553264013?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 6, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<h3>Other bits</h3>
<p>
A few other small details from the trailer include a tiny cat and parrot in a hat in Gerudo town; a Goron leader named Darston, following the usual naming convention of the series (Darunia and Daruk, for example); and a map screen divided into sections, though it's unclear if map pieces will be acquired or if it will simply be unveiled by exploring.</p>


<p>
The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is set for release on 26th September and is shaping up to be a particularly unique entry in the long-running Nintendo series.

<p>A new NFL video game is set to launch next month, and  no it’s not the long-awaited NFL 2K game. New Star Games has announced NFL Retro Bowl 25 is coming in September.</p>



<p>Exclusively launching for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/retro-bowl/id6446029554?ign-itscg=30200ADM&amp;ign-itsct=newstar_arcade" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Apple Arcade</a> on September 5, NFL Retro Bowl 25 will feature all 32 NFL teams along with players from each team. That means players like Buffalo Bills star quarterback Josh Allen, three-time Super Bowl winner Patrick Mahomes, two-time MVP Lamar Jackson, and more will all be available in pixelated glory.</p>



<p>“The upcoming release of NFL Retro Bowl ’25 allows NFL fans to create their own dynasty by choosing their favorite official NFL teams and players to take all the way to the house as they manage their rosters and game strategies with a fun and simple roster management system,” the game’s description reads. </p>







<p>“With authentic rosters and NFL players stylized in the game’s glorious retro style, all NFL players in-game feature unique, fully realized retro art, tuned attributes, career stats, and realistic contracts.”</p>



<p>As far as other potential platforms, there was no mention of when, or if, NFL Retro Bowl 25 could be available elsewhere. The current version of Retro Bowl that features generic teams is available on iOS, Android, Web, and Nintendo Switch.</p>
