            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Solo game dev Cara Cadaver has revealed that her indie horror game&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>has been banned from Steam, and having played the game myself, I can tell you the reason is...a little strange.</p>

<p>Speaking on <a href="https://x.com/dirtlord77/status/1949867514797707531" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">social media</a>, Cadaver says that <i>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</i>was banned from Steam for "sexual content with depictions of real people". As she points out, the game wasn't banned for "its use of gore in storytelling, or the violent themes".</p>

<p>The twist? As Cadaver says in her post, the sexual content for which the game was taken off Steam is "all implied". There's no explicit depiction of any kind of sexual act within the game; there are plenty of shocking and disturbing images, and the narrative is pretty unsettling, but that's about it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vile-exhumed-steam-banned-emails.jpg?itok=uotDK6lT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vile-exhumed-steam-banned-emails.jpg?itok=5CF3h4y2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>isn't coming to Steam anytime soon, it seems.</figcaption></figure><p>Cadaver says she doesn't want to censor&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>or make changes to it; she says she "will not retell a story about these topics in a way to make people who don't understand it more comfortable".</p>

<p>Together with publisher DreadXP, Cadaver says she's currently looking into alternate ways to release&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed</em>, and you can expect to hear "specific details" next week. Make sure to check out Cadaver's X (formerly Twitter) <a href="https://x.com/dirtlord77" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">account</a> or <a href="https://x.com/dreadxpgames" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">that of DreadXP</a> for further info.</p>

<p>For context, Steam delisted a bunch of adult games from its platform earlier this month, citing concern from payment processors regarding the explicit content present in those games. Indie platform Itch.io <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/itch-io-deindexes-adult-pages" rel="nofollow">quickly followed suit</a>&nbsp;(although the original version of&nbsp;<em>Vile&nbsp;</em><a href="https://final-girl-games.itch.io/vile" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">remains intact</a> on that site, ironically).</p>

<p>It all stems from a <a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/open-letter-to-payment-processors" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">campaign</a> started by activist group Collective Shout regarding a game by the name of&nbsp;<em>No Mercy</em>, an explicit title the group says "fl[ies] in the face of efforts to address violence against women".</p>




<p>The decision to remove Cadaver's game from Steam is, frankly, bizarre. If the point, as Collective Shout sees it, is to "address violence against women", then removing a game that directly tackles this theme in a frank and open way seems like a big mistake to me.</p>

<p>Of course, it's entirely likely that Steam simply panicked and pulled the plug on any game that might stand even the slightest chance of upsetting its payment processors, even if that game is about as far from "fl[ying] in the face of efforts to address violence against women" as it's possible to be.</p>

<p>Hopefully, Cadaver and DreadXP can find a way to release&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>somewhere else. In the meantime, you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/vile-exhumed-review-dirty-computer" rel="nofollow">read my review</a> to find out why it's not only an important game from a message standpoint, but also a great experience in its own right.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has announced new <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> Secret Lair Chaos Vault drops. This otherwise random subset of Secret Lair drops all appear to be sci-fi themed, thematically connecting them to the newest set, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/ranking-all-new-commanders-in-mtg-edge-of-eternities" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Edge of Eternities</em></a>.</p>



<p>On the official <a href="https://secretlair.wizards.com/us/en/chaosvault#filter-product-1246458|sort-availability_wotc,featured" rel="nofollow">Secret Lair website</a>, there are eight new Chaos Vault drops. Four of those drops contain five cards taken from the <em>Edge of Eternities</em> set. The other four, called Commander Reinforcements, include an <em>Edge of Eternities</em> Commander deck.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-secret-lair-chaos-vault-alien-auroras-promo-image.jpg?itok=A4moVVNN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-secret-lair-chaos-vault-alien-auroras-promo-image.jpg?itok=KpsIRvFe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The first two drops are titled <em>Alien Auroras</em>. This drop features, in both foil and non-foil, five cards with evocative artwork by Ian Permana. The drop contains the following cards:</p>

<ul><li><em>Reprocess</em></li>
	<li><em>Aggressive Mining</em></li>
	<li><em>Sylvan Safekeeper</em></li>
	<li><em>Crucible of Worlds</em></li>
	<li><em>Zuran Orb</em></li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-secret-lair-chaos-vault-featuring-deathburger-promo-art.jpg?itok=iin6Yq-W 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-secret-lair-chaos-vault-featuring-deathburger-promo-art.jpg?itok=lBiLxBb4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>For those who appreciate the elegance of machinery over flesh, the second drop, <em>Featuring: Deathburger</em> may be for you. As the name implies, this foil and non-foil drop features Josan Gonzales aka Deathburger's, provocative cyberpunk artwork. The cards he has reinterpreted are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><em>Ethersworn Canonist</em></li>
	<li><em>Goblin Engineer</em></li>
	<li><em>Dance of the Manse&nbsp;</em></li>
	<li><em>Arcbound Ravager</em></li>
	<li><em>Foundry Inspector</em></li>
</ul><p>The second half of the <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Secret Lair Chaos Vault drops are mostly for those with deep pockets and a love for Commander. The <em>Commander Reinforcements: World Shaper</em> drop contains everything from the Alien Auroras drop as well as the World Shaper Commander Deck.</p>

<p>Similarly, <em>Commander Reinforcements: Counter Intelligence</em> includes everything from the <em>Featuring: Deathbringer&nbsp;</em>drop and the Counter Intelligence Commander deck.</p>

<p>The <em>Alien Auroras</em> and <em>Featuring: Deathburger</em> drops are being sold at MSRPs of $29.99 (non-foil) and $59.99 (foil), respectively. The <em>Commander Reinforcements</em> drops are being sold at MSRPs of $74.98 (non-foil) and $104.98 (foil). These drops will only be available while supplies last. If you are interested in any of these drops, and have the cash to spare, it is better to secure yours now.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Microsoft is starting to comply with the UK’s Online Safety Act by prompting Xbox players to verify their age today. The prompts will be shown to Xbox players who indicate they’re over the age of 18 and will be shown when you sign into an Xbox account in the UK. Microsoft says it’s also exploring bringing similar age verification tools to other countries in the future.</p><p>To power the age verification in the UK, Microsoft is partnering with Yoti, which is one of the services that hasn’t fallen victim to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/714402/uk-age-verification-bypass-death-stranding-reddit-discord"><em>Death Stranding</em> photo mode bypass</a>. While the age verification checks are optional right now, they will become a requirement to access a variety of Xbox services in early 2026, when additional parts of the UK’s Online Safety Act <a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/illegal-and-harmful-content/important-dates-for-online-safety-compliance">come into force</a>.</p><p>“Starting early next year, age verification will be required for these players in the UK to retain full access to social features on Xbox, such as voice or text communication and game invites,”<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/28/xbox-age-verification-uk/"> explains Kim Kunes</a>, vice president of gaming trust and safety at Xbox. If you don’t verify your age between now and early next year, social features “will become limited to friends only” until the age verification process has been completed.</p><p>“Whether a player verifies their age will not affect any previous purchases, entitlements, gameplay history, achievements, or the ability to play and purchase games, however we encourage players to verify their age via this one-time process now to avoid uninterrupted use of social features on Xbox in the future,” Kunes says.</p><p>While this is limited to Xbox players in the UK right now, Kunes says, “We expect to roll out age verification processes to more regions in the future.” Microsoft isn’t revealing which other regions will get similar age verification requirements, but Kunes does note that “these methods may look different across regions and experiences.”</p><p>If you’re in the UK, then you can verify your age for your Xbox account <a href="https://aka.ms/XboxUKAgeVerification">online through Microsoft</a>, where you can use a selfie, a scan of your passport or driver’s license, a credit card check, or a mobile number.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/714458/microsoft-xbox-age-verification-uk-social-features]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/itch-post-new-list-of-banned-nsfw-content-that-would-rule-out-certain-kojima-games-plus-goty-2024-mouthwashing.1255353/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Last week, Itch.io <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/itchio-apologise-for-frustration-and-confusion-after-delisting-thousands-of-nsfw-projects">delisted thousands of games featuring various kinds of "NSFW" material</a>, rendering them invisible to anybody searching or browsing the site. Other developers reported that their games had been taken offline entirely. Among the games delisted was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mouthwashing">Mouthwashing</a>, Rock Paper Shotgun's game of the year 2024. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
In a statement, Itch.io explained that they had delisted or removed NSFW games in response to pressure from payment processors and a campaign from Australian activist organisation Collective Shout, who broadly want games that glorify sexual violence and the sexualisation of girls removed from sale, but who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/anti-porn-group-who-tried-to-ban-gta-5-claim-credit-for-steams-sex-game-crackdown">also have connections</a> to certain right-wing Christian groups that aim to abolish legal sex work and punish queer sexual expression.</p>
<p>Collective Shout had previously succeeded in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-change-steams-rules-to-let-banks-and-credit-card-firms-prohibit-certain-kinds-of-adult-only-content">forcing Valve to change their Steam policies</a> to give banks and payment processors control over the definition of "adult" content on Steam. A number of Steam games have been delisted or removed from sale as a consequence, though nothing like the deluge of de-indexification we've seen on Itch.io.</p>
<p>Many of Itch.io's delistings may be temporary. The platform holders may re-index them following "a comprehensive audit of content to ensure we can meet the requirements of our payment processors". Once the audit is done, they'll implement "new compliance measures" whereby NSFW game creators "must confirm that their content is allowable under the policies of the respective payment processors linked to their account".
</p>
<p>
Ahead of announcing any new regulations, Itch.io have <a href="https://itch.io/docs/creators/faq#is-adult-content-allowed">silently updated their developer terms and conditions</a> with "a non-exhaustive list of prohibited themes present in card processing networks". Devs will need to comply with that list in order to publish their work on Itch.io. It's rather open-ended, even without the caveat that it is "non-exhaustive". Here you go:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Non-consensual content (real or implied)</li>
<li>Underage or "barely legal" themes</li>
<li>Incest or pseudo-incest content</li>
<li>Bestiality or animal-related</li>
<li>Rape, coercion, or force-related</li>
<li>Sex trafficking implications</li>
<li>Revenge porn / voyeur / hidden cam</li>
<li>Fetish involving bodily waste or extreme harm (e.g., "scat," "vomit")</li>
</ul>
<p>
To continue my thoughts on Collective Shout's arguments from last week, I don't think games that glorify rape and actively contribute to a culture of would-be or actual rapists deserve exposure on storefronts like Itch.io or Steam. Still, there's nothing in this list to distinguish such a game from a game that tells a story about rape without endorsing it, or from a BDSM fantasy that stresses the importance of consent in real-life sex. "Sexual trafficking implications" is similarly ambiguous as to whether a game is allowed to feature trafficking as a plot theme without advocating for it.</p>
<p>Still, I can say with some confidence that Mouthwashing infringes on some of these prohibitions. So, I would argue, do <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a>: Ground Zeroes, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a>, Sonic The Hedgehog 2006, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crush-house">The Crush House</a>, Mortal Kombat, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy VII</a>, and Viva Pinata. Itch claim that they are reviewing games case by case, but still, if your work is remotely NSFW, perhaps it would be safest to avoid releasing games on Itch.io for the time being.
</p>
<p>Collective Shout have now confirmed that they "called on Itch.io to remove rape and incest games that we argued normalised violence and abuse of women". They have also, interestingly, distanced themselves from many of the Itch delistings, arguing that they didn't demand that the platform remove "all" NSFW content, and that they are now receiving additional abuse and threats online as a consequence.</p>
<p>"We called on Itch.io to remove rape and incest games that we argued normalised violence and abuse of women," Collective Shout <a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/steam_campaign_history">write</a>. "Itch.io made the decision to remove all NSFW content. Our objections were to content that involved sexualised violence and torture of women." They also cite an article in The Australian from 26th July in which founder Melinda Tankard Reist claims (in the paper's paraphrase) that Itch have gone "far beyond her request to ban sexually violent games".</p>
<p>As with the Steam delistings, Collective Shout's case might be stronger if they published full details of the individual games they've asked Itch.io to delist, and why they consider them harmful - particularly given their track record for mischaracterising other games they've tried to have removed from sale, like GTA 5 and Detroit: Beyond Human. It might also help if they voiced their support for the many queer creators who've been swept up by Itch.io's mass-delisting, in keeping with their <a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/festival_campaign">previous condemnations of homophobia</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/itch-post-new-list-of-banned-nsfw-content-that-would-rule-out-certain-kojima-games-plus-goty-2024-mouthwashing]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The most devastating part about Tales of the Shire: A The Lord of the Rings Game is just how short it falls of fulfilling such an insanely promising premise. I mean, which Tolkien nerd among us hasn’t daydreamed about living a relaxing life as a halfling? But instead of the warmth and comfort of the Shire, I spent 25 hours feeling like I was marching through the Dead Marshes in this cozy misadventure. It’s regrettably dull from start to finish, and runs so badly I wasn’t even allowed to be bored out of my mind in peace. The barebones life sim mechanics offer some of the most shallow versions of classic activities like fishing and farming that we’ve seen done much better in dozens of other games, and building social links with the inhabitants of Bywater is monotonous, repetitive, and never worth the effort. There’s at least some humorous writing and fun moments here and there, and the cooking minigame that serves as the main progression activity thankfully has slightly more depth than the other chores you do, but the few bright spots that exist are drowned out by one of the most disappointing cozy games I played since the Second Age. I went into Tales of the Shire thinking I’d be as happy as Denethor seeing Boromir, but I got Faramir instead.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Tales of the Shire: A The Lord of the Rings Game Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Though it rarely succeeds in the attempt, Tales of the Shire mostly follows the blueprint of games like Animal Crossing and Disney Dreamlight Valley, with stress-free slice of life activities in a quiet village as the main draw. You’ll try your hand at lesser versions of the usual fishing, gardening, and cooking minigames as you improve your relationships with your fellow townsfolk – all wrapped in a Tolkien skin that plays with the characters and locations found in The Lord of the Rings. The minimalistic story puts you in the hairy feet of a hobbit who’s recently moved to Bywater and begins to establish themself in the community, all while fixing up the rundown hobbit hole you’re given. You’ll meet some recognizable characters like Gandalf and Rosie Cotton and run samey errands for your neighbors in an attempt to get Bywater officially recognized as a village. As is often the case with games like this, it’s not much of a story, but has some likeable characters and amusing moments here and there as the goofy cast of hobbits bicker and squabble over trivial things that only a hobbit would bother caring about. Unfortunately, a complete absence of voice acting inhibits this high point; it just never quite felt right for such colorful and well-known characters to be completely silent throughout the story’s roughly 15-hour runtime.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Tales lacks those hidden layers of depth to get completely lost in.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the great things about the life sim genre is that, although they can appear fairly superficial at first, the longer you play, the more you discover hidden layers of depth to get completely lost in. Unfortunately, Tales lacks this essential component. At the point where I’d usually expect to enter an impossible-to-put-down chain of easygoing activities as I build out a quiet, virtual life for myself, it instead had me scratching my head as to what the point of all the monotonous busywork they’d saddled me with even was. That’s mainly because, despite featuring lots of cooking, Tales has very little meat on the bones for the vast majority of its mechanics, like how the best way to make money is to slowly walk back and forth across the very small map, picking up the same very small handful of foragable goods, then selling them so you can buy a single cut of bacon to use in cooking. The only time anything changes is when the seasons shift every dozen or so in-game days and you get a few new ingredients to find and crops to plant, but there’s a whole heck of a lot of tiresome grinding in between those shifts, which ultimately only alter the ingredients you’re collecting and the look of the village anyway.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">TieGuyTravis' Favorite Cozy Games</h3><p>If you're looking for a game that pairs well with a warm blanket and a hot cup of tea, look no further than these TieGuyTravis-approved recommendations.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Nearly every activity you’re expected to grind, from fishing to gardening, suffers from this same infuriating lack of depth. For example, you can only fish in a few spots around the map, and doing so yields the same very small handful of fish with little to augment or evolve your angling over time. When I unlocked my first fishing rod upgrade after completing numerous fishing-based quests, I was hopeful this would expand the number of fishing holes accessible to me or let me catch a whole new roster of sea creatures, but only moments later those hopes were dashed as I returned to the same places and caught the exact same fish I’d been reeling in for hours. And since you’re given tons of humdrum quests that require quite a lot of fishing to complete, you’re subjected to a whole lot of tedious repetition with very little in the way of payoff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Really the only exception is the cooking minigame, which serves as the main activity that all the others seem built to support and is much more substantial as a result. Fishing, foraging, gardening, taking care of chickens, and buying ingredients are all just a means to an end for your ever-hungry hobbit, and all of the components you gather are brought back to your home to combine into a dish you’ll then use to curry favor with other hobbits. You’re able to invite a few of your neighbors to share a meal with you once per in-game day, and after learning their preferences and cravings, you’ll have to mix together the right combination of flavors to maximize how much your cooking causes them to like you. Doing so levels up your social links, which awards ingredients and new recipes that open up new possibilities, and even occasionally result in a short conversation between you and whichever hobbit you’ve charmed – a decent payoff to your investment in a game that doesn’t respect your time in most other areas. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>You’re subjected to a lot of tedious repetition with very little payoff.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">To be clear, Tales still doesn’t really nail this minigame either, as the actual game part isn’t very good and is overly simplistic, especially in the first dozen or so hours before you unlock additional cooking tools that add a tad more nuance to the process. For example, unlocking the sauce pan allows you to stir different seasonings into your dishes that augment the flavor profile. Plus, you’re required to take on a ton of very boring chores just to get the ingredients you need, and then there’s a good chance you’ll just be waiting around for the next day to come before you can invite new people, since there are so few things to do aside from the time-gated meals. But cooking and the social elements it triggers are at least a relative highlight in a life sim that is so consistently underwhelming, and it does evolve over time in a way that the other activities don’t.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond the grind of gathering ingredients, cooking meals, and feeding them to the residents of Bywater, you’ll also improve and decorate your little slice of the Shire. The home you’re given is pretty rundown at the outset, but is expanded and fixed up as you complete activities, the most important of which is the ability to raise chickens that generate eggs and gain access to more farm space. Unfortunately, although it’s nice to have more room and other small improvements like an actual working front door that takes way too long to unlock, there’s not a lot of interesting things to do with the additional space you’re given indoors. You gradually unlock decorations by completing quests, but there isn’t a ton of variety to them, zero functionality to adding things like new shelves and whatnot, and the entire layout of your home is static, so you have to just work around an existing floorplan that doesn’t offer much room for expression. This means that yet another component that’s usually a major draw in life sim games feels like only the minimum amount of effort was put into it. The good news is that the home you’re given definitely nails the Shire aesthetic when it’s fully upgraded, and even if there’s not many exciting options for personalization, it at least gets the job done when it comes to fulfilling part of the hobbit fantasy.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Even if Tales of the Shire were a more interesting game than it is, it would still be pretty hard to play purely by how unacceptably bad it runs. With constant framerate hitches, pop-in, aliasing, hard crashes, and other wonky stuff that suddenly broke, I never went more than a few minutes without something going terribly wrong. The worst of it was the consistent and repeated crashes throughout my play time that forced me back to my desktop, resulting in half an hour of lost progress as I had to start the entire day over. This often happened right after I completed sharing a meal with my halfling homeys, which requires quite a bit of prep work and planning, making it just about the worst time for a crash to happen. At one point I repeated a single day five times (totaling several hours of game time), with a crash happening at the end of the day each time, to the point where I wondered if I’d permanently broken something and wouldn’t be able to progress any further. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The rest of the issues, like how inconsistent the framerate is and how objects pop up right in front of your face, are more confusing than anything else – I mean, this does not seem like a particularly demanding game and I played on a high-end PC. It’s such a bummer, specifically because the painterly art style and iconic setting of the Shire has so much potential, and almost none of that comes through when you’re seeing shrubbery pop up right in front of you as you walk around town. Then there’s the one-off bugs, like one time where my fishing line stayed in the water when I was done fishing, and it wouldn’t let me put away my rod, so I walked around Bywater with a hilariously long fishing line stretching across the entire map. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I also tried out a little bit of the Switch version and, well, let’s just say that I’d have to write a whole separate review to talk about how especially awful of an experience that was. It’s worth mentioning that near the tailend of my time with Tales of the Shire, there was an update that did improve some of the framerate issues slightly, so there’s at least hope that it will run better in the future after some patching up. But even after the most recent update, it still doesn’t run great.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Tales of the Shire: A The Lord of the Rings Game is the Grima Wormtongue of games: it whispered many wonderful promises into my ear, but by the end I was left a wretched shadow of my former self. I had a lot of hope that this could be the perfect mix of a genre I love and the Tolkien world I’ve spent much of my life nerding out about, but those hopes were cast into the fires from whence they came. With life sim mechanics that are shallow as they come, terrible technical performance, and almost nothing original to say, Tales of the Shire disappoints every step of the way. There’s hints of a better game to be found in its slightly more robust cooking mechanics, as well as the occasionally amusing writing and dialogue that prove this setting was indeed ripe for a life sim if executed better – but like a Silmaril, those dreams have vanished deep in the depths of Angband.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/tales-of-the-shire-a-the-lord-of-the-rings-game-review]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The people yearn to hike and porter, according to newly released Death Stranding 2 statistics. Director Hideo Kojima has reported that just under 80% percent of players (called "someones" by Kojima) who finished the game continued past the credits. He did not report how many players this represents, but did share a variety of other statistics concerning player behavior.</p><p dir="ltr">Kojima tweeted these details out as part of a post celebrating the game's one-month anniversary. It might not surprise you that the assault rifle was Death Stranding 2's most equipped weapon or the ladder its most equipped tool. But the statistics do include some of Death Stranding 2's sillier features. Out of all the animals players could rescue, they saved kangaroos the most (followed by emus and wombats). Via signage, players placed the "speed up" sign the most often. The post doesn't list any player count statistics, but Death Stranding 2 is popular. The game topped <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/death-stranding-2-and-rematch-top-the-ps5-charts-in-june-2025/2900-6742/">the PS5 charts in June</a>. The statistics also emphasize the game's <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-on-the-beach-community-build/1100-6533237/">asynchronous multiplayer</a>, where players build structures and place tips to help each other.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1949010026699350142" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Death Stranding 2.<br>It’s been a month since release.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-is-suing-tencent-for-alleged-%E2%80%9Cslavish-clone%E2%80%9D-of-its-horizon-series-light-of-motiram.1255317/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Sony has launched a lawsuit for copyright and trademark infringement against Tencent over what it calls a "<em>slavish clone</em>" of its Horizon game series, Light of Motiram.</p>



<p>Light of Motiram was first announced in <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-clone-light-of-motiram-announced-for-pc/">November 2024</a>, and it was immediately obvious to anyone even remotely familiar with the Horizon series that Motiram was at the very least drawing inspiration from Horizon, and that's being extremely generous with the comparisons. Being more appropriate and less generous, Motiram looked like a flat-out copy-paste job with a few changes in details and a new name.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, Tencent debuted a <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-clone-light-of-motiram-shown-in-new-gameplay-trailer/">gameplay trailer for Light of Motiram</a>, which did very little to show that Motiram was its own unique game compared to Horizon. Now, a report from <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/sony-sues-tencent-allegedly-ripping-off-horizon-video-games-2025-07-28/">Reuters</a> reveals that Sony was paying attention to Light of Motiram, and to how media pegged it as a Horizon copy. According to Reuters report, Sony's complaint includes how the media described it as a "<em>knock-off</em>," even including the phrase "<em>Horizon Zero Originality</em>."</p>



<p>We, as outsiders looking at Light of Motiram, might have seen it as a copycat of Horizon, but that's ultimately a public opinion. Proving it in court is a different matter entirely, as Nintendo is finding out with its attempt at suing <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-reportedly-doing-everything-to-make-lawsuit-against-palworld-stick/">Palworld makers PocketPair</a>. Needless to say, it'll be interesting to see how the case goes, and the kind of precedent it sets for the future of the industry.</p>

Veterans will know this is a feature that gives players special rewards. This can be in an item drop or an event, but it’s also how Game Freak sometimes delivers special Pokémon to players.<em> Legends: Z-A</em> will give early adopters a Ralts holding a Gardevoirite so it can Mega Evolve when it reaches its final form. The Publisher Information description explains how the player can acquire this gift, and notes that they will have to get about an hour-and-a-half into the game to access something called the “Link Play” menu.<em> Legends: Arceus</em> didn’t have this menu, even when it let players trade critters, and the term “link” has a specific connotation in the <em>Pokémon </em>franchise, as the original <em>Red</em> and <em>Green</em> games allowed you to play against other players with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Game_Link_Cable&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Game_Link_Cable" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Link Cable</a></span>.

If you scroll down a little further, you’ll see it specified that <em>Legends: Z-A </em>only supports one player. At least, that’s what it says on the North American store. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store-jp.nintendo.com/item/software/D70010000094233&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store-jp.nintendo.com/item/software/D70010000094233" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Japanese eShop</a></span> mentions that it will confirm online and local player numbers at a later time.

It’s entirely possible we hear more about the game then, and given that the competitive community will have its eyes locked on the show, that seems as good a time as any to announce multiplayer if it exists. For now, however, we’re left with more questions. <em>Legends: Z-A </em>launches on Switch and Switch 2 on October 16.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-link-play-multiplayer-switch-2-1851787158]]></content:encoded>

                <p>In classic Call of Duty fashion, the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/" data-ref-id="5000-681591">Black Ops 7</a> is getting a Monster Energy Drink promotional campaign. While the game is still a few months off, special Black Ops 7-themed cans are now appearing in stores.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1949559165476896948" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CharlieIntel</a>, Black Ops 7 cans are already available for purchase in convenience stores across the United States. In addition to Call of Duty colors and aesthetics, the cans also boast QR codes that will likely take purchasers to a website to input a special code hidden on the can.</p><p>Right now, the QR code simply takes you to the landing page for the old promo for Black Ops 6, suggesting that these cans are getting out into the wild a bit earlier than anticipated. Chances are good that you'll be able to snag some Double XP for the new game if you get your hands on one of these.</p><p>Black Ops 7 launches later this year, and it will mark the first-ever back-to-back releases for a Call of Duty sub-series. It's in co-development at Treyarch and Raven Software, and it'll star Milo Ventimiglia (This is Us, Gilmore Girls) as David Mason, Kiernan Shipka (Chilling Adventures of Sabrina) as Emma Kagan, and Michael Rooker (Guardians of the Galaxy) as Mike Harper.</p><p>Besides these details and a short teaser trailer that Microsoft showed off at Summer Game Fest, we don't know much about the game--but that'll change soon. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-reveal-set-for-gamescom-in-august/1100-6533147/" data-ref-id="1100-6533147">Black Ops 7 will have a full reveal at Gamescom</a> in mid-August. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-7-continues-franchises-obsession-with-weed/1100-6533294/" data-ref-id="1100-6533294">There may also be a big Call of Duty event in September</a>, although Microsoft has yet to confirm this.</p>

                <p>Due to pressure from payment processors and right-wing advocacy groups, the marketplaces Itch.io and Steam recently announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/itch-io-joins-steam-in-recent-push-to-ban-adult-games/1100-6533423/" data-ref-id="1100-6533423">they would be delisting or de-indexing games that were perceived as "Not Safe For Work."</a> While apparently intended to disrupt the production and marketing of adult-content games, this move has already had a much broader impact: The critically acclaimed horror game Mouthwashing has been de-indexed from Itch.io as part of this sweep. </p><p>Martin Halldin, who works on audio and music for Mouthwashing developer Wrong Organ, posted on Bluesky that the title had been de-indexed from Itch.io. Halldin wrote that the game is currently still accessible if you have the link--it hasn't been fully removed yet--but not showing up in search results can still have a devastating impact on indie titles.  </p><p>After its launch in 2024, Mouthwashing racked up extensive acclaim and a number of end-of-year accolades. Its Steam reviews are sitting at Overwhelmingly Positive with over 28,000 user reviews submitted--a remarkable total for a game created by a small and previously unknown team. It is a psychological horror game, and the developer itself even warns on the product page that Mouthwashing contains "extreme violence, gore, mutilation and worse on PSX-style characters." </p><p>Despite its obviously mature content and themes, Mouthwashing does not contain pornography and is not sexually explicit--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/itch-io-joins-steam-in-recent-push-to-ban-adult-games/1100-6533423/" data-ref-id="1100-6533423">which was ostensibly the main target of the campaign organized by advocacy group Collective Shout.</a> Despite the group's declared focus on preventing the depiction of "sexual abuse" in games, the campaign's impact has been to seemingly induce a much broader push to "de-risk" from <em>all </em>adult content, no matter its subject. As a result, horror games and other titles depicting subjects far afield from anything sexual have also been affected. <span><br></span></p><p>Developers and fans of affected games have been attempting <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sjklapecki.itch.io/post/3luohh5kf4s2d" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">to organize counter-pressure</a> to encourage payment processors to reverse their stance. Civil liberties NGOs like the ACLU have already joined the fight, too; the ACLU, for instance, <a href="https://action.aclu.org/petition/mastercard-sex-work-work-end-your-unjust-policy" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">is currently soliciting signatures for a petition against Mastercard</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Witchfire, a dark fantasy FPS roguelite, launched in Early Access on the Epic Games Store in 2023, and then made its way to Steam Early Access a year later. Since then, it's received a number of updates, and today's Webgrave update is the latest, bringing new gear, new spells, a new region to explore, and some progression changes. You can watch the update trailer below.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xxAzz-Iug2w"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xxAzz-Iug2w" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The new area is an abandoned, twisted village swarming with monstrous human-like creatures, like giant spider people with humanoid heads. "Velmorne was once a town like any other, until its residents were twisted by witchcraft," a press release reads. "Disfigured and unformed, they roam deserted corners and squares, and ambush any foolish enough to wander down its forgotten roads."</p><p>The update also adds Rosary Beads, which can customize the player's abilities, overhauls the workshop system and player stats to make them easier to understand, and adds a new difficulty level: Gnosis IV.</p><p>You can read the full patch notes for yourself <a href="https://www.theastronauts.com/2023/09/witchfire-patch-notes/">on the game's website</a>. Witchfire is the current project of developer The Astronauts, known for The Vanishing of Ethan Carter – <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/the_vanishing_of_ethan_carter/b/pc/archive/2014/10/02/the-vanishing-of-ethan-carter-game-informer-review.aspx">you can read our review of that game here</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/28/witchfires-webgrave-update-launches-today]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/team-fortress-2">Team Fortress 2</a>, that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> with wacky character intro videos so good I have to watch each of them at least once every six months, got its 2025 summer update late last week. There are a host of new community-made maps, items, and taunts, in addition to a fair few bug fixes from Valve themselves.</p>
<p>Cool to see, though one vocal group of players are keen to see the developers delve back in and make some changes to matchmaking, having penned an open letter to the Steamy company outlining hopes for the revised system that melds the very old old one with the slightly less old one the game's had since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/team-fortress-2-matchmaking-update">2016's Meet Your Match update</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>First of all, the summer update. You can read the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/440/view/526475421347217633">full notes here</a>, but the highlights as follows. There are 10 new community maps, dubbed (clears throat) Citadel, Aquarius, Fulgur, Cargo, Conifer, Boardwalk, Blowout, Mannhole, Demolition, and Pressure. You can add 23 new community-made items and 14 unusual effects to that, with the latter being split seven-seven between hats and taunts.</p>
<p>Closing out the additions are four new taunts: The Final Score, Bear Hug, Texan Trickshot, and Flying Colours. I can guess exactly what two of those'll look like if done by a Heavy, the others are a bit more mysterious. Among the bug fixes are tweaks to outdated in-game tips, the Heavy's model being updated to add a fittingly-named "bullets bodygroup for cosmetics", and "the Texas Half-Pants not fully using rimlight". That last one's probably fairly boring in practice, but it made me snigger.</p>
<p>So, that's the update - nice and beefy for a game that's slowly inching closer to its 20th birthday (sorry if that's made you feel old).</p>
<p>Now, onto the letter. A group of TF2 players dubbed BringBackQuickplay and YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxOVl9a1KCU">Megascatterbomb</a> have penned <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/1maoyoh/an_open_letter_to_valve_from_the_team_fortress_2/">an open letter</a> they say they're planning to send off to Valve, calling for the reintroduction of several features from TF2's pre-2016 quickplay matchmaking system. The central goal is a move away from skill-based matchmaking, back to a system that puts community-run servers at the forefront and allows team switching at will. As of writing, despite the letter being cited as from the entire Team Fortress 2 community, those behind it say its recommendations are based on a survey that got about 3.5k responses.</p>
<p>This also isn't the first time in recent history that Team Fortress 2 players have decided to crack open a word processor and write to Gabe Newell like he's their MP. Earlier this year, a group that looks to have included at least some of the same folks put together <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/1jbwptw/unmutef2ps_an_open_letter_to_valve_from_the_tf2/">another letter to Valve</a> (in the exact same font) about giving players who've not upgraded to a premium account back the ability to use comms tools like text and voice chat. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/team-fortress-2s-latest-strike-against-bots-is-silencing-new-players">That change</a> debuted in 2020 as part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/team-fortress-2-is-cracking-down-on-racist-bot-invasions">Valve's efforts to combat bots</a>, something Team Fortress players came together under <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-update-team-fortress-2-in-reaction-to-grassroots-savetf2-campaign">the #SaveTF2 moniker</a> to call for action on.</p>
<p>Basically, the game with the spy that goes boink hasn't been short on campaign groups over the past half decade. We'll have to see if this latest letter goes anywhere, or just remains a thing that's garnered some thumbs up from some Team Fortressers who frequent Reddit. </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/team-fortress-2s-summer-update-is-here-and-a-group-of-players-have-penned-an-open-letter-to-valve-about-matchmaking]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Having been announced under the codename Project Defiant, Sony has now revealed more about the FlexStrike wireless fight stick. The stick is still in development, but will be viewable at Evo 2025 in Las Vegas, building up to a release in 2026.</p>
<p><iframe title="FlexStrike Wireless Fight Stick - Features Trailer | PS5 &amp; PC" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TTGmg6uYXKc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The FlexStrike is compatible with both PS5 and PC, using either a wired connection or their ultra-low latency PlayStation Link USB dongle. The fight stick has mechanical switch buttons with toolless swappable restrictor gates – there are square, circle, and octagon restrictor gates that can be kept within storage compartments for the gates and the USB adapter. Additionally, the stick will come with a handy sling carry case, so you can take it wherever you need to get some fighting done. Digitally.</p>
<p>There’s some good quality of life features around all of this. That PlayStation Link dongle is an updated version of the one that shipped with the Pule Elite and Pule Explore headset and earbuds, now with USB-C – it’s not entirely clear if the original dongle will get a firmware update, but we’d expect it to. One dongle allows for simultaneous fight stick and audio use, and on PS5, one dongle will let two fight sticks connect for couch multiplayer.</p>
<p>The control inputs can be customised with a built-in lever mode switch for directional input tweaks, and a lock button to prevent accidental inputs and layout changes in a match.</p>

<p>While the FlexStrike has got many of the same game inputs as found on the DualSense controller, and has a touchpad, there will be software support to let it run at the same time as a DualSense controller, if you’d rather use the gamepad for menu navigation.</p>

			<p>One of PlayStation's announcements during its Summer Game Fest-timed State of Play was the introduction of a new wireless fight stick from the company, announced at the time under the name "<em><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-announces-project-defiant-a-wireless-fight-stick-for-ps5-and-pc/">Project Defiant</a></em>." Today, in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/28/new-details-on-playstations-first-wireless-fight-stick-flexstrike/">PlayStation Blog</a> post, the official name for the fight stick, FlexStrike, was revealed, along with a new trailer showcasing its features and the news that it'll be out sometime next year. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>"<em>Compatible with PS5 or PC via a wired connection or wirelessly with PlayStation Link, our innovative ultra-low latency wireless technology, FlexStrike wireless fight stick features mechanical switch buttons and toolless swappable restrictor gates,"</em> writes Edwin Foo, vice president of product development at Sony. "<em>These include square, circle, and octagon restrictor gates that fit into the fight stick’s built-in storage compartments alongside the included PS Link USB adapter."</em></p>



<p>You'll be able to use it wirelessly with a USB-A dongle in the front or back of your PS5 or PC, or use it with a wired USB-C connection. You can have a DualSense controller connected to your PS5 simultaneously with the FlexStrike, to help navigate menus better, and as the trailer shows off, its wireless connection is Sony's new PlayStation Link, which is how all its most recent wireless peripherals connect to PS5 and PS5 Pro consoles. </p>



<p>It'll be at EVO 2025, but if you're at the event, you won't be able to try it. PlayStation says it'll be there "<em>on display only</em>," so you can get a look at it and the carrying case it comes with when visiting the Arc System Works booth. More details on when players will actually be able to get their hands on it will probably arrive closer to its actual release date, sometime in 2026. </p>



<p>PlayStation has had a firm hand in the fighting game community for years, but this is the first time it is making its own fight stick for players to use. Whenever players do get their hands on it, especially the pros that might consider bringing it to EVO, it'll be interesting to see if it can usurp the fight sticks and gamepads they already prefer.</p>

Itch.io quietly updated its list of banned content over the weekend with the following section on adult games:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>The following is a non-exhaustive list of prohibited themes present in card processing networks. We are unable to support the sale of any works containing these topics:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Non-consensual content (real or implied)</li><li>Underage or “barely legal” themes</li><li>Incest or pseudo-incest content</li><li>Bestiality or animal-related</li><li>Rape, coercion, or force-related</li><li>Sex trafficking implications</li><li>Revenge porn / voyeur / hidden cam</li><li>Fetish involving bodily waste or extreme harm (e.g., “scat,” “vomit”)</li></ul></blockquote><p>Developers can appeal individual bans, but with thousands of listings removed and someone needing to actually play each individual title to adjudicate claims, that process seems all but unworkable in the short term. “It’s almost impossible to come up with an exhaustive list of unacceptable products to sell, so often we have to take content reviews one at a time,” Itchi.io writes on the site. “If an issue arises with your account that isn’t already covered by our policy, then we will contact you and share what options you may have.”<br></p><p>While Steam has also banned hundreds of games revolving around rape or incest in response to pressure from Visa, Mastercard, and other payment processors.

Itch.io made the decision to remove all NSFW content,” it wrote <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.collectiveshout.org/steam_campaign_history?fbclid=IwY2xjawL0QDxleHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFFZ3B4WlJTSDJscFhOalplAR6uwODqdp3uydYui8kfSDKbn0M9XVd7IahVz0CP_LKIt9CuXBnsmjIuE-qSRw_aem_xj1j_AxgE0x_j0VgHW7dKw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/steam_campaign_history?fbclid=IwY2xjawL0QDxleHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFFZ3B4WlJTSDJscFhOalplAR6uwODqdp3uydYui8kfSDKbn0M9XVd7IahVz0CP_LKIt9CuXBnsmjIuE-qSRw_aem_xj1j_AxgE0x_j0VgHW7dKw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in an update on July 28</a></span>. “Our objections were to content that involved sexualized violence and torture of women.”</p><p>One of the game’s pulled from Itch.io is a relationship sim called <em>Love’s Heart</em>. “A game that takes you inside a lesbian academy, where over the course of 10 main story chapters, you’ll help your kemonomimi roommate, Katsune, search for the Love’s Heart, a magical gem said to grant any wish,” reads the description. According to its creator, it includes the option for incestual relationships between characters but doesn’t not demand it. It remains available on Steam but was one of those games purged from Itch.io last week. </p><p>“This completely destroys me—so many games published with love on this platform, and now they won’t reach anyone new,” wrote<em> Love’s Heart</em> creator Capky Games <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://itch.io/blog/993219/all-nsfw-games-removed-from-search-listings&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://itch.io/blog/993219/all-nsfw-games-removed-from-search-listings" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in a blog post</a></span> last week. “I don’t have an audience elsewhere; I depend on itch.io to grow.

Hydreigon ex brings huge damage and is one of the best-looking Illustration Rares in the set. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Jellicent ex and Brave Bangle are sneaky meta picks, while three different Hilda cards keep decks running smoothly. Victini’s full-red Black White Rare print is a surprise hit, and Oshawott proves that pure charm can still win the day.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Hilda – 084/086 (Uncommon)</h2><div catalogid="f1e58ffb-fcf6-4d71-be7a-6a5a4eea33a3" id="225858"><div id="225858" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Hilda - SV: White Flare (WHT)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The cheapest and most accessible of the Hilda cards, the uncommon version still packs the same competitiveness: grabbing an Evolution and Energy from your deck. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The artwork is more casual with <a href="https://zdcs.link/91jNG8?object_uuid=70aba900-8341-40a7-818a-35c8191cfd23&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hilda’s</a> arm out mid-step, set against a quiet town backdrop, but it’s no less effective. If you ended up with two variations of Hilda — this one and the much pricier Ultra Rare or Special Illustration Rare — this is the one you’d want to stash in your deck box whilst keeping the other safe in your padded protective folder.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Oshawott – 105/086 (Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="f1e58ffb-fcf6-4d71-be7a-6a5a4eea33a3" id="225864"><div id="225864" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Oshawott - 105/086 - SV: White Flare (WHT)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QKgPZ3?object_uuid=70aba900-8341-40a7-818a-35c8191cfd23&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Oshawott</a> isn’t here to dominate; he’s here to be adorable. This card’s appeal comes from its breezy, sun-drenched artwork: the Sea Otter Pokémon snoozes in a hammock, waves and flowers drifting by. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tackle and Water Gun won’t win championships, but the card itself wins hearts. It’s proof that illustration alone can make a card one of the most sought-after pulls in a set.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Brave Bangle – 080/086 (Uncommon)</h2></div><div catalogid="f1e58ffb-fcf6-4d71-be7a-6a5a4eea33a3" id="225862"><div id="225862" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Brave Bangle - SV: White Flare (WHT)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Not all decent cards need to be one of high rarity that breaks the bank. <a href="https://zdcs.link/znxrVy?object_uuid=70aba900-8341-40a7-818a-35c8191cfd23&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brave Bangle</a> is a deceptively potent Tool that gives non-Rule Box Pokémon a 30-damage boost against ex threats. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a perfect tech card, especially in single-prizer builds. The flaming bangle in the art glows with intensity, capturing the courage of underdog strategies. It might be Uncommon, but it punches way above its weight.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Hilda – 164/086 (Ultra Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="f1e58ffb-fcf6-4d71-be7a-6a5a4eea33a3" id="225861"><div id="225861" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Hilda - 164/086 - SV: White Flare (WHT)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Functionally identical to her other versions, this Ultra Rare <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qbb7oG?object_uuid=70aba900-8341-40a7-818a-35c8191cfd23&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hilda</a> still pulls weight in competitive play. The difference lies in tone with her looking more relaxed, stylish, and grounded, as she’s walking the city streets. It’s a quieter card visually, but radiates confidence too. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sometimes, the best Supporter doesn’t need to shout; it just shows up and gets things done.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Hydreigon ex – 169/086 (Special Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="f1e58ffb-fcf6-4d71-be7a-6a5a4eea33a3" id="225863"><div id="225863" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Hydreigon ex - 169/086 - SV: White Flare (WHT)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp7Zro?object_uuid=70aba900-8341-40a7-818a-35c8191cfd23&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hydreigon ex</a> is a tanky, punishing Stage 2 with its devastating ability, Greedy Eater: knock out a Basic Pokémon, and you take an extra Prize card. Its 200-damage Dark Bite attack also traps opponents in place. But the real magic is in the card’s presentation. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The artwork gives off a stunning look of pure chaos featuring storm clouds, jagged cliffs, and Hydreigon descending like a triple-headed demon. It’s as intense visually as it is on the board.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Hilda – 171/086 (Special Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="f1e58ffb-fcf6-4d71-be7a-6a5a4eea33a3" id="225860"><div id="225860" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Hilda - 171/086 - SV: White Flare (WHT)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This Special Illustration Rare version of <a href="https://zdcs.link/9yDvAr?object_uuid=70aba900-8341-40a7-818a-35c8191cfd23&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hilda </a>comes with an inspiring aesthetic as well as being useful. The effect lets you search for an Evolution Pokémon and Energy, offering consistency for any deck. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The dynamic art, featuring Unova partners like Emboar and Zekrom bursting into action, injects the card with extra personality. Along with being a brilliant Supporter card, it feels like a window directly into the journey of this Unova champion.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Jellicent ex – 045/086 (Double Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="f1e58ffb-fcf6-4d71-be7a-6a5a4eea33a3" id="225859"><div id="225859" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Jellicent ex - SV: White Flare (WHT)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QL8PvP?object_uuid=70aba900-8341-40a7-818a-35c8191cfd23&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jellicent ex</a> offers disruptive gameplay with its Oceanic Curse ability, which locks your opponent out of Item and Tool cards while it’s active. Its attack, Power Press, can hit for 160 if you stack energy efficiently. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The art supports the theme perfectly, too, swirling tendrils and spectral lighting to give it an eerie, ‘underwater menace’-type look. Along with being a great tool for control players, Jellicent ex comes with a nice bit of visual storytelling via its pretty cardboard. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Reshiram ex – 166/086 (Special Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="f1e58ffb-fcf6-4d71-be7a-6a5a4eea33a3" id="225857"><div id="225857" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Reshiram ex - 166/086 - SV: White Flare (WHT)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Reshiram’s alternate art trades the sharp contrasts of the below Black White Rare for a warm, painterly scene full of fiery blossoms and flowing energy. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The mechanics are the same with this <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJgPyk?object_uuid=70aba900-8341-40a7-818a-35c8191cfd23&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Reshiram ex</a>: Slash for set-up, Blaze Burst for pay-off, but the aesthetic shift elevates it into a must-have collectable. Whilst threatening knockouts, this card radiates a presence that turns your playmat into a canvas.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Victini – 172/086 (Black White Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="f1e58ffb-fcf6-4d71-be7a-6a5a4eea33a3" id="225856"><div id="225856" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Victini - 172/086 - SV: White Flare (WHT)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">With just 80 HP, <a href="https://zdcs.link/9YWP1x?object_uuid=70aba900-8341-40a7-818a-35c8191cfd23&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Victini</a> isn’t built to last, but that’s part of its charm. Its V-Force attack can hit for 120 damage if your Bench is full, making it a perfect finisher in fast-paced Fire decks. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s propelled this Black White Rare card into fan-favourite status, however, is the all-red, high-gloss artwork. It’s clean, minimal, and surprisingly captivating. It’s proof that even a small Pokémon can steal the spotlight when the design hits just right.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Reshiram ex – 173/086 (Black White Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="f1e58ffb-fcf6-4d71-be7a-6a5a4eea33a3" id="225855"><div id="225855" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Reshiram ex - 173/086 - SV: White Flare (WHT)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Since being revealed in a dedicated <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivQ2RNeiX44&amp;ab_channel=TheOfficialPok%C3%A9monYouTubechannel" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Black White Rares trailer</u></a> in June, this <em>very </em>expensive <a href="https://zdcs.link/QqwNe0?object_uuid=70aba900-8341-40a7-818a-35c8191cfd23&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Reshiram ex</a> card has been deemed beauty for any collection, whilst still being playable in its own right. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Put another way, the Black White Rare version of Reshiram ex blends competitive strength with undeniable collector appeal. Blaze Burst scales beautifully with your opponent’s Prize count, turning into a 280+ damage nuke when timed right. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What makes this card a real standout, though, is its monochrome artwork. Reshiram appears like a celestial force carved from light and shadow, capturing the elegance and ferocity of the Gen-V Fire/Dragon legend in a design that looks equally at home in a tournament deck or on display.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ben Williams</strong> – IGN freelance contributor with over 10 years of experience covering gaming, tech, film, TV, and anime.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">We've been covering Mafia: The Old Country in an exclusive way all month long through our IGN First "cover story." We hope you've enjoyed the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mafia-the-old-country-9-minutes-of-exclusive-gameplay-ign-first">gameplay</a> and our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mafia-the-old-country-exclusive-hands-on-preview-ign-first">hands-on preview</a>. Today we have the pleasure of talking to Hangar 13 studio president Nick Baynes and game director Alex Cox about returning the Mafia series to its not-open-world roots, which games The Old Country takes design inspiration from, the plentiful amount of fruit found throughout the upcoming prequel, and more. The following is a transcript of the video interview above that has been lightly edited for clarity.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: Nick, I wanted to start here because I got to talk to you in person last week when I did get to play the game and something that jumped out at me just from our idle conversation was more than once, you mentioned your desire to see players complete this story. And so I'm curious, did your telemetry show you that wasn't the case with Mafia III?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hangar 13 Studio President Nick Baynes</strong>: Not so much. It's more, I suppose, anecdotal, the fact that the nature of the type of game that we are making, and if you look at the other Mafia games that were maybe a bit more focused and based much more around a story that had a very clear linear path through it. I think naturally a lot of people completed those and we have a lot of feedback from people who, you see all the reaction videos online of people completing those games when they play it. And I think that's a really powerful thing. And I think both as a player of games myself and as listening to the fans, people like finishing these stories and the way that we tell the stories, they're designed to be completed. I think we are really, really proud of the story we're telling and the whole narrative arc and the development of the characters through the story. So yeah, I guess where we're coming from, it's not necessarily a specifically data-driven thing. It's just we're telling stories and I think every storyteller wants someone to find out how their story ends.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: You've both talked about this decision that you've just alluded to again here of pulling back from going more of an open world route as Mafia III did to a more linear, narrative-focused story as with the first two games. Alex, I'd love to hear from you, what drove that decision?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mafia: The Old Country Game Director Alex Cox</strong>: Well, actually it was the response to Mafia Definitive Edition in a lot of ways. We got the response to that game. One of the responses was, "Hey, it is great to get to the end of the game because it's a little shorter than Mafia III was and see the ending." So that kind of triggered ... We got a response from the remake that that was the kind of Mafia game that a lot of players wanted to play, and it sort of led us down that road is when we were thinking about what was next for the franchise, what was the next kind of game we wanted to build? Obviously we were going through a big engine revision as well for this game too so we wanted to keep it quite focused on what we think Mafia does best, which is telling great stories. So yeah, that's how all of that kind of came together. It was really the response to ... Yeah, it was the response to remake.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: And I suppose from a design standpoint, it certainly changes your mindset a ton. And Nick, from more of a studio level perspective, it maybe shortens the timeline a bit too as opposed to doing more of a full open world thing. So I guess what I'm trying to say is there are probably a lot of benefits that come out of this that are not the original thing you're going for. You're making a creative decision, but it seems like there are a lot of happy side effects from it too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, the biggest side effect of it's not so much about how long it takes to make it. It's more about the fact that the things that you are doing, you're more focused on and you can devote more time to really pushing the quality and making sure that it's a real polished gem, that everything in the game has had the right amount of attention spent on it to make sure that everything the player encounters feels really, really high quality and that we get to deliver what we want to do. And I think sometimes just generally as developers, you want to focus on everything, but you have to make choices and prioritize, and naturally the more focused you're getting, the more you can actually polish everything. So that's very much a key thing about that whole kind of ... I use the expression polished gem as absolutely something we've referred to throughout development in terms of our focus and how we wanted to focus on this.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alex</strong>: I mean, that was the formula for Mafia I and Mafia II as well, and that was the design principle that we wanted to return to. Both of those games were ... I'm talking about the remake of Mafia II, but probably applies to the original game as well back in 2002. But when we are talking about a highly choreographed, high quality action adventure game with a linear story, with this beautiful wild backdrop or however you want to refer to it, that's the formula that we wanted to revisit. And I think as Nick mentioned there, the amount of time and attention that we're putting into the cinematic presentation, the action adventure gameplay is much higher than games that really focus on a broader sort of breadth of [gameplay].</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: The gaming community responded incredibly positively to the news that you guys were kind of going back to that more narrative linear focus from the first two games, and there was a really positive reception, certainly gamers are happy when they hear that the game is going to cost a little less than they might've initially expected. It's a $50 price point for you guys, and I know the price is ultimately set by your publisher at 2K, but I suppose the one maybe ... concern's probably too strong a word, but just maybe slight defensive worry that I think is natural from a lot of gamers is that, "Oh, well this must mean The Old Country is really short." Now, I know you guys probably don't want to sit here and give a number for how many hours this game is because then people just attach good or bad things to that. But I guess would you like to address any of those sort of defensive concerns about "getting your money's worth?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. So I think the first thing is, I mean, again, obviously we're not going to give an exact number and partly that it's obviously different for every single player. But generally speaking, if you think of Mafia I, Mafia II, that's roughly the same scope and scale as this game, and I think hopefully, I don't think anyone's going to be disappointed if they're going into it with that expectation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like you say, really as developers, we don't really think about the price point. We just focus on making the best game possible. But this game, I feel like it drips AAA quality. When you play the game, I don't think anyone's going to play this game and feel that, "Oh, this is a lower budget game." It looks incredible, it plays really well. There's all the depth you'd expect in terms of dialogue and the world that has been created around the players and the experience they go through. So I think really no one needs to be concerned about the quality of the game or anything like that, or it being super short. I mean, I saw someone online when we announced the price saying something like, "Oh, I bet it's like three hours." It's not three hours, but going into it expecting a Mafia I, Mafia II style experience, I think everyone's going to be super happy.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: I really get the sense, and again, you guys have kind of already almost said it here directly, that Mafia I really is kind of the touchstone or the North Star for this project because of that reception that you mentioned to the definitive edition. Can you speak to that of how the reception to the remake of the first game energized the team and drove the creativity for this one?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alex</strong>: Yeah, it's funny actually because when we came to do the remake, what we did is we actually channeled the design philosophy, the creative approach of Mafia II to the remake, to the original Mafia. So if you know what I mean, we structured it in the same way we presented the chapters in a very similar kind of way to Mafia II. So it was kind of like, what would the original Mafia have looked like if it was remade through the creative lens of Mafia II? And so this project has been in a similar kind of way, taking inspiration from both of those titles. It's structured, as you mentioned, you mentioned chapters, for example. It's got a very similar structure to those games. That's how we divide up our story. Our story is, again, in a similar way to those two titles, spread over several years of time.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"It's set in the same universe, it's something that's going to be immediately familiar to players that want more Mafia, but it's moving forward in all aspects."</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There's significant kind of changes through Enzo's journey. And in terms of what we wanted players to feel like is that while we've created a new Mafia game for a new generation of Mafia games, that it is very familiar on the pad, it's very familiar in terms of look and feel of the title. It's got narrative connections, it's set in the same universe, it's something that's going to be immediately familiar to players that want more Mafia, but it's moving forward in all aspects. It's visually cutting edge for games in 2025. We've moved gameplay forward in various ways from what we did in the past. And so yeah, it's like a restart for the franchise in many ways, but there's a lot of familiarity under the hood.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nick</strong>: I think also, just to add to that, and I don't always know how many people ... If people know too much about this, but there's real connective tissue here at Hangar 13 all the way back to the original Mafia. So we've got people here working on The Old Country that worked on Mafia I back in the early 2000s. We've got people who worked on Mafia II and all three all the way through including the definitive edition. So when we're talking about looking back to the first one, some of the team here actually worked on that first one. So we're not necessarily even looking at it to reference. I think each game is influenced by the last, what worked, what didn't work, how can we improve it?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The other thing as well is we always starting any game, but obviously in particular a Mafia game, we look at what makes a Mafia game? What is it the players want? What do we think makes a Mafia game? And looking at all that collectively, and building on our experience. But like I was saying, it's really cool, it's not just people that joined recently, like myself, I joined seven, eight years ago. So I can look at the old game, say, "This is where it comes from." Whereas some people here actually look back and they worked on it, they've lived it since the late 90s really, when they first started working on it. So that's the other thing as well. There's this big through line, not just in terms of some of the narrative connections and some of the game features, but also with the team themselves, which is really awesome, I think.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: Now, Alex, you were talking about, I want to hear from both of you on this. I'm going to do the Sophie's Choice thing because I'm just curious. You're not allowed to say Mafia: The Old Country but what's each of your favorite game in the series so far?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alex</strong>: Well, mine is [Mafia] II, but that's because that was the first game I worked on, so it's kind of imprinted itself on me. That was my first game. I worked in QA, I was originally a tester. My first game in development was on Mafia II...It was really hard back then with the limitations we had with obviously the graphical limitations and all that kind of stuff. But the first Mafia, when it first came out and I first saw it, it absolutely blew my mind. And then 20 years later, 18 years later, to get the chance of working on it myself with the definitive edition and seeing it reimagined, I just think that to me, it's got a really timeless classic story. I love the way it's structured. Yeah, I think that's my favorite.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nick</strong>: For me, it's [Mafia] 1, I think for two reasons. First reason is when it came out, it was just absolutely, I think, groundbreaking in terms of there's one or two games around that time which were pushing, bringing cinematic storytelling into games.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: So Alex, you hinted at this. You mentioned the engine a little while ago, and I wanted to kind of circle back on that because I've been playing Mafia since the beginning as well, and it's always been a beautiful game. And from what I've seen and had the privilege of playing now of Mafia: The Old Country, it's still very, very much is. You guys have moved from a proprietary engine to Unreal Engine 5, and I'm curious about the impetus behind that choice.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alex</strong>: Well, Unreal, I think as many, many players will be familiar with now, brings an awful lot to new games, gives us cutting-edge visuals in particular. And for the kind of game we were looking to make this time around, we really, really wanted to put a massive emphasis on portraying the beauty of Sicily, the fantastic landscapes, plus the MetaHuman tech and all of the stuff that's really allowed us to do really, really top quality cinematic presentation. The performances of the actors are really, really fantastic. Amazing quality facial, and that's key to this Mafia game as it was for all previous Mafia games in their time of release and achieving that kind of let's say visual cutting edge in particular, environment art and cinematics, was really front of mind when we decided to make the transition.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nick</strong>: And also going back to something we were saying earlier, it's about focus and focus on quality and focus on the content. When you're doing your own engine, that's a lot of time you have to spend and effort in making sure it's cutting edge and it still looks contemporary and you've got a lot of heavy lifting to do on that. And obviously as technology gets more and more ... As things get more and more advanced, that takes more and more time. And I think as a studio, we just really wanted to focus on the gameplay, the visuals, the storytelling, the cinematics, and to be able to put as much focus on that as opposed to actually creating the engine that it sits on, it really helps us and I think ultimately allows us to develop and deliver a better quality game.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"I think [the move to Unreal Engine 5] ultimately allows us to develop and deliver a better quality game."</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: Was there a particular landscape or scene that you guys prototyped in Unreal Engine 5 to make sure that it was going to represent the visual quality that you wanted of the series? Because what visually I remember most or what stuck with me after playing your game for three hours is the landscapes. I mean, the characters look great, don't get me wrong there, no complaints for any of that. But it's that Sicilian landscape. That's really what kind of stuck with me. So I'm just curious, was there a little test area that you made to make sure that everybody at the studio was happy with where it was going to go technologically?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alex</strong>: Yeah, it's funny actually because the first thing that we did right at the beginning of the project, and it was almost like the whole team moved to Unreal and we decided to come together around one exercise that we could all align behind. And that was creating the market square environment from Mafia II. Mafia II starts in Sicily, and actually our game is set in the same ... You see this town called San Celeste right at the beginning of Mafia II. We chose that for a whole wide variety of reasons. A, we already know what it looks like. B, we can see what it looks like when we've massively upgraded it like 15 years later. And also we know that at the pre-existing location from the franchise, we're going to channel the creative vision, we're going to channel the narrative universe. We're going to get all of the stuff in there by grounding ourself in that first place. So that's where we started, right in the center of San Celeste.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: Digging into the gameplay a little bit here, I've got a handful more questions for you guys. Stealth, we were talking before we recorded, I love stealth. And when I was playing Mafia: The Old Country, I took full advantage of the stealth opportunities that were presented to me. It seems like it is a fully supported combat play style choice, maybe not necessarily in every scenario. Sometimes you're going to have a one-on-one knife fight with somebody that's terrible and you're not going to stealth your way out of it. But what were the goals with implementing stealth into Mafia: The Old Country?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alex</strong>: Mafia's got these ... We call it a roller coaster experience. Sometimes you play a choreographed shootout, sometimes it's a car chase, sometimes it's a stealth section, sometimes you get to choose, and stealth has been kind of a big part of the play your way kind of style of Mafia since Mafia II. It was in Mafia II a little bit. Mafia III became pretty much play your way all the way through. For Mafia: The Old Country, it was always going to be part of the formula.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The thing that's I think most pertinent to this game is because we wanted to make combat generally more feel more dangerous, we wanted to bring in a more grounded kind of feeling to any kind of encounter with enemies, we wanted to make sure that stealth really captured that vibe of surviving in a dangerous environment. So there's a heightened value to sneaking around and taking out a guard. And also that vibe of, well, Enzo is trying to survive in 1900 Sicily. It's kind of a resource port environment, you're having to loot and scrabble around for resources in combat, for example. Again, favoring a more deliberate gameplay style if you're going to stealth around and kind of take out a few enemies.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: I was really surprised just in a fun way, that Enzo's knife seems to be very important in the sort of combat loop of the game. You guys basically have a kind of whole knife RPG system down to the point where in my head I couldn't help thinking about it of you almost have to reload your knife like a gun when the blade dulls. You got to take a minute to sharpen it. So can you guys talk about the design choices of the knife and how that's really seems to be kind of doubled down on?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, I think the first thing is that Enzo, I think we already described elsewhere that Enzo comes from the mines. He's certainly had a very impoverished childhood. He's used to scrabbling around and making use of anything that comes to hand and being resourceful. So when we added the knife, we didn't just want it to be, oh, it's a melee item you can use and it's maybe a different takedown. It actually needed to feel like a real almost extension of Enzo, it's something that's really ... He's much more familiar with knives and sharp objects than he is with guns, for example. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So then it was like, well, okay, well if you've got a knife, what else would you do with it? And you'd pick locks and you'd throw it, and you also would do takedowns. And then the question is, well, it can't be to overpowered. Well, they're going to get blunted, so you need to sharpen them. And I think really that whole thing was not just having a weapon for the sake of it. Say, oh, we've added a knife as a melee item. It was much more this is key to who Enzo is and how he goes through the world and how he's grown up. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alex</strong>: Yeah, I mean it came from the history of Sicilian criminals as well. That idea of a Sicilian criminal armed with a knife is sort of like part of the history of the Sicilian Mafia knife fighting, that is a kind of martial art in Sicily. And so there's a lot of grounding in the historical context of the story and the vision of ... Yeah, I mean particularly when it escalates into knife duals, Enzo versus bad guy on a kind of a sun-drenched hillside, like fighting to the death is a core angle that really sells the unique aspect of this game. What's the vision of title? It's grounded in that 1900 Sicily setting while still broadly speaking, playing like a Mafia title as players would expect.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: On a sort of similar note about authenticity, there is a good bit of Italian spoken this game, even when playing in English. I imagine the dialogue in this at least as much, possibly more than any other game, is probably gone over with a very, very fine tooth comb? Because I imagine you've not only got to make sure that any Italian language that's used is done in kind of an authentic way, but also, and you guys have done this before, so it's not like your first rodeo here. But I imagine you've got to make sure the voice cast isn't doing some sort of stereotype caricature of a typical mafia crime family too. So can you kind of speak to that sort of authenticity piece of it?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alex</strong>: When we look at the previous Mafia Games, Mafia I, II, and III, the performances, the kind of authenticity, the particular locale, Chicago, New York, New Orleans comes across from the performances, the actors and all of that stuff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, we knew in this case we were going to be making a game that was primarily English language first, English language is the native language, but had to be accented. So that was always going to be a challenge to avoid the problem you mentioned there where it doesn't sound strange, somebody putting on an odd accent, derivative or any kind of weirdness there. And so we were quite careful in the casting process. Several of the main cast are native Italian, so that helps, including Ricardo, who plays Enzo. He's a native Italian. And again, and everybody else could do a very plausible accent. Everybody spent some time with a voice coach as well to make sure that they were as close as possible doing an authentic Sicilian accented English. And then we've been consulting with a partner team, a developer in Sicily as well, who's been giving us a lot of advice about cultural matters, including performance and such.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: Just about done here. But I'm curious why a prequel this time versus either continuing forward in time after three, or maybe even going back to somewhere between two and three. So can you guys, I'm just curious the decision to put the timeline where it was in this one?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nick</strong>: There's a lot of reasons. I mean, one of them was we wanted to start up a whole new story arc for the Mafia series. And so what better ways than to go back to the very start of Mafia? What's really nice about this game, I think is for new players who are jumping on for the first time, they don't need to have played any other Mafia games. But for players who have played the other games, there are links and certain Easter eggs and character hints and that kind of stuff in there, which links it all together. And it just felt like a good place to start. The origin of organized crime, the origin of the franchise itself, whilst also setting things up for the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And also, I think one of the things we always look at with Mafia is we're letting players play the mob movie. And we've done the big American crime cities and it felt like a really unique, very, very appropriate place to go to. We thought it'd be a beautiful environment to make a game in, which as you said, it has been. And it's just a unique story, I guess. So I think that was just some of the things. It gives gameplay opportunities that if we'd gone to another city, it might have not given us the opportunities to what we've done in this game, and obviously in the future, who knows where we'll go next. But this felt like a really appropriate place to kind of kick things off in this next story arc.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: Love it. All right. I saved my most important question for last here. Now I only played three chapters, about three hours, but I think in that time I saw more just gorgeously rendered and beautifully lit fruit in your game than maybe I've seen in any entire single game ever. So are you guys confident in saying that you have the most fruit and best looking fruit in the history of video games? This is a key question here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nick</strong>: [laughs] Yes. I'm happy to go on the record and state that is correct.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alex</strong>: [laughs] 100%.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/mafia-the-old-country-devs-discuss-returning-the-series-to-its-roots-ign-first]]></content:encoded>
