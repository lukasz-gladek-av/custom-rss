			<p>According to <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-studios-visual-arts-layoffs-cuts-last-us-1851767734" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kotaku</a>, the San Diego-based PlayStation studio Visual Arts Services has been hit with more layoffs. This week, an unspecified number of employees were notified that their last day with the company would be Friday, March 7. The news was shared publicly by former Visual Arts Project Manager Abby LeMaster (who left three years ago for Riot Games). In a LinkedIn message, she <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/abbynlemaster_it-was-tough-waking-up-to-messages-that-many-activity-7302431179213807617-xwpO?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAArFoNcBzkxomfY-95d2ZvawwFRKUakif8M" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> that 'many' friends had just lost their jobs, lamenting that Sony had just let go of developers with a lot of experience. Here's a quote:</p>
<p><em>PlayStation Studios: Visual Arts was a playground, and it was also my first job in games. I started as an intern with an Information Systems degree, unsure of where I fit in, and met some of the most incredible people. It was a place where we got to experiment, learn, and contribute to projects that defined eras of gaming. The teams there were filled with artists, engineers, producers, and creatives who poured everything they had into their work. We chased excellence, and we built things we were proud of.</em></p>
<p><em>But also, more than anything, PSVA was about the people. The friendships I made there shaped me, and I carry those relationships with me to this day. The layoffs today hit hard. PSVA let go of developers with decades of subject matter expertise; talent that will be extraordinarily difficult to recoup. This industry can be unpredictable, but the skill, experience, and passion of the people I worked with at PSVA are undeniable.</em></p>
<p>Visual Arts had ambitious plans just a little over three years ago when studio head Michael Mumbauer <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-san-diego-studio-existing-franchises/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planned</a> to work on existing PlayStation franchises using the studio's own proprietary technology. Mumbauer wanted the studio to lead development on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-remake-in-the-works-days-gone-2-not-happening-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remake of The Last of Us</a>, but PlayStation Studios head Hermen Hulst deemed the budget required too high, and Naughty Dog was once again put at the helm of the remake, with Visual Arts reverting to its usual supporting capacity. The team then also helped Naughty Dog with The Last of Us Part II Remastered.</p>
<p>These new Visual Arts layoffs are only the latest to hit Sony teams. Last month, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/more-playstation-layoffs-reported-by-software-development-team-member/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> on new cuts at the Technology Group. Of course, Firewalk Studios, developer of Concord, was also <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-shuts-down-firewalk-studios-maker-of-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shut down</a>. Overall, it's a widespread disease that runs rampant throughout the whole gaming industry, between rising game development budgets and reduced growth prospects.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-studio-visual-arts-layoffs-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Another PlayStation studio has reportedly been hit by layoffs, with support studio Visual Arts apparently in the Sony firing line this time around.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-studios-visual-arts-layoffs-cuts-last-us-1851767734" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Kotaku</a>, Visual Arts was hit by layoffs earlier this week as part of "a further restructuring of Sony's US game development operations". Cuts reportedly included staff who worked on some of Sony's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/horizon-mmo-canceled-report" rel="nofollow">recently-canceled projects</a>, including&nbsp;<em>Days Gone&nbsp;</em>developer Bend Studio's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-live-service-games-canceled" rel="nofollow">canned live service game</a>.</p>

<p>However, Kotaku's source, whom the publication doesn't name, says the layoffs were more widespread than that, seemingly suggesting that cuts also included staff who weren't involved in the aforementioned projects.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/playstation-visual-arts-layoffs-days-gone.jpg?itok=HbgYrISj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/playstation-visual-arts-layoffs-days-gone.jpg?itok=_e2dW7V2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Recent PlayStation layoffs apparently include employees who worked on a now-canceled project by&nbsp;<em>Days Gone&nbsp;</em>dev Bend Studio.</figcaption></figure><p>As Kotaku points out, ex-Visual Arts associate project manager Abby LeMaster confirmed the layoffs herself <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/abbynlemaster_it-was-tough-waking-up-to-messages-that-many-activity-7302431179213807617-xwpO" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on LinkedIn</a>, saying that waking up to news of the layoffs was "tough" and that the talent let go by the studio would be "extraordinarily difficult to recoup".</p>

<p>While you might not know Visual Arts' name, it's a fairly important studio for Sony, providing development support for major studios like Naughty Dog.</p>

<p>These layoffs come after what has been a relatively difficult year for Sony. While the gaming giant enjoyed critical <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/astro-bot-sales-sony-financials" rel="nofollow">and commercial</a> success with the likes of throwback platformer&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot</em>, Sony also suffered an embarrassing failure in the form of hero shooter&nbsp;<em>Concord</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds" rel="nofollow">shut down just a couple of weeks after launching</a>.</p>

<p>In January, Sony announced it would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-leadership-shakeup" rel="nofollow">shake up its leadership structure</a>, appointing Hideaki Nishino the sole president and CEO of Sony's interactive division. The change means that while Hermen Hulst will remain the head of PlayStation Studios, he'll now report to Nishino, rather than the two sharing CEO duties.</p>

<p>Special Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 Remake editions can make an already seismic release greater. The remake we never thought would happen is happening, and Activision is making sure to capitalize on it by releasing several unique editions. </p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-remake-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 Remake</a> rumor is less a whisper and more a truth. While we’ve all been kept in the dark waiting and wondering, developer Iron Galaxy has been busy working on the remake. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-revealed-release-date-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 and Pro Skater 4</a> will be reimagined in 2025, and you can customize your experience with different editions.</p>



<p>That’s why I’m here to hold your hand as we idly coast along on our boards and check out the scenery. </p>

<p>As a lover of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doom-the-dark-ages-may/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DOOM</a>, I don’t see a world where I’m not picking up the Digital Deluxe Edition. It’s all digital content (as you’d expect) but it includes some incredible DOOM crossover goodies—along with Early Access.

            <p>After the success of Marvel Rivals, NetEase is publishing another shooter due for release this week: FragPunk. At least, it's releasing on PC, as its console launch has been delayed without a new release date.</p>
<p>The online shooter was first revealed at last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-microsofts-xbox-games-showcase-black-ops-6-direct-2024">Xbox Games Showcase in June</a>, showing off its unique card mechanic that alters gameplay and the environments with wacky effects.</p>
<p>FragPunk releases on PC tomorrow, 6th March, but a message from the official social media account states the Xbox and PlayStation releases need more time due to "unexpected technical challenges".</p>

<p>"Since the announcement of the game, your excitement has been truly inspiring, and we know how much you've been looking forward to launching into battle on both Xbox and PlayStation," the announcement reads.</p>
<p>"However, we want to be fully transparent with you: during the console compliance testing process, we encountered unexpected technical challenges in optimisation and adaptation.</p>
<p>"Rather than rushing the console release and providing a potentially poor user experience, we have made the difficult decision to delay the launch of the console versions to ensure that players receive a comparable experience to those on PC."</p>
<p>It's unknown when the console versions will now be released.</p>
<p>However, the developer will compensate players on Xbox and PlayStation by providing all rewards up front, including in-game currencies, cosmetics, experience, and more once the game is out.</p>
<p>Any console pre-orders will be cancelled, but those players will receive in-game currency worth $10 when these versions eventually launch.</p>
<p>"This delay was not an easy decision, but we are committed to delivering the best possible experience for our players, and this additional time will allow us to fully optimise and polish the console versions for launch," the statement continues.</p>

<p>The PC release of FragPunk will include 150+ Shard Cards, 13 playable heroes (called Lancers), and seven maps to battle on.</p>
<p>FragPunk promises an alternative to Valorant - like Riot's shooter it's a five-versus-five free-to-play shooter with teams taking turns to attack and defend.</p>
<p>I went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fragpunks-card-system-ensures-its-set-to-be-your-new-favourite-valorant-competitor">hands-on with FragPunk at last year's Gamescom</a> and was impressed by both the speed of gameplay and its intriguing card system that should help it stand out from other games of the genre.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">Grand Theft Auto 5</a> on PC has been updated with a new Enhanced version, bundling in a range of tune-ups such as ray-traced graphics and support for AMD FSR and NVIDIA DLSS, new features for GTA Online, and a heaping helping of swankmobiles for your fleet of GTA cars. Existing GTA 5 story mode and GTA Online progress will carry over, and it’s all free to people who own the old version of GTA 5, which is now known as the Legacy version on Steam. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
It’s a nice overhaul with a few downsides. One is that the game’s system requirements have also been Enhanced - you'll need double the RAM and double the graphics card memory, amongst other things. You can still play the Legacy version if you don’t have the specs for the upgrade, but Legacy and Enhanced owners aren’t allowed to play together, which threatens to drive a bit of a wedge through the community.</p>
<p>The Enhanced version also adds “kernel-based anti-cheat protections”, which may not amuse those of you who prefer it when games don’t snoop on every application you have running from the stinking bowels of your computer, or have <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/according-to-experts-on-kernel-level-anticheat-two-things-are-abundantly-clear-1-its-not-perfect-and-2-its-not-going-anywhere/">concerns</a> about the cheater-rumbler software throwing up false positives or exposing your system to ransomware. But the big forum complaint, right now, is that Rockstar appear to have done away with GTA 5’s in-game text chat - possibly because these Enhancements come via the previous "next gen" update for GTA 5 on PS5 and Xbox, which obviously have different kinds of chat functionality.
</p>
<p>
There are many threads about the absence of text chat on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3240220/discussions/0/592890771319858068/#c592890771319866010">Steam</a> and Reddit. Several people have posted what they claim are screenshots of conversations with Rockstar support. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/1j3mxmt/as_it_turns_out_the_lack_of_chat_in_the_enhanced/">One of these alleged support messages</a> acknowledges that “in-game text chat is not supported in GTA V Enhanced currently”, which suggests it’ll be addressed via patch; in the meantime, it advises people to make use of the game’s SMS features or platform level chat features. I’ve approached Rockstar myself for comment.
</p>
<p>
It might seem like picking the straws from a bale of spun gold, but in-game text chat is a feature many have come to rely on. Perhaps you have disabilities that make text chat more convenient, or perhaps you’d like to exchange salutations with randos without speaking aloud and potentially revealing your gender.</p>
<p>More frivolously, somebody’s posted <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/1j3zxwx/the_newbie_took_off_before_i_realized_that_ee_had/">a tragic communique</a> about innocently boarding a plane piloted by a brand new player, and realising they couldn’t communicate with each other. Hey, perhaps there's a Netflix miniseries in this. I'll send Vin Diesel a request for comment, too.
</p>
<p>
There are also a host of other complaints related to people struggling to migrate their progress between versions. While irritating, these seem more like the usual launch-day bugs.</p>
<p>Of course, the lion’s share of disgruntled responses to Rockstar’s social media posts about the update are from people pining for the next <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a> trailer. The game remains slated for console launch later this year so it's definitely high time we had a video.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bungie%E2%80%99s-marathon-pre-order-bonuses-have-been-found-on-steam.1125747/</guid>

<p>Bungie’s next game, Marathon, has reportedly had its pre-order bonuses uploaded to the backend on Steam.</p>



<p>That’s according to the SteamDB Discord server (and reported to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1j3pv6f/marathon_preorder_cosmetics_found_in_steamdb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours</a>), who noticed that that extra editions of Marathon and packages relating to pre-order bonuses were uploaded to Steam.</p>



<p>According to the information, such pre-order bonuses will include free Marathon skins that can be used in Destiny 2.</p>



<p>Such an update suggests that the game will be announced soon, and according to industry insider Jeff Grubb, he said in February that he believes <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-bungies-marathon-wasnt-at-state-of-play/">Bungie will reveal </a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-bungies-marathon-wasnt-at-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-bungies-marathon-wasnt-at-state-of-play/"> in April</a>.</p>



<p>“Marathon wasn’t here because they’re probably going to do their own thing. Bungie does their own thing usually for Destiny. They’re going to adopt that same ‘we’re going to talk to our audience’ strategy this year as well. I think April [is] when we probably hear from them about Marathon. And it would be its own thing separate from a State of Play,” he said.</p>



<p>Bungie’s Marathon was first revealed on May 24, 2023, with a teaser trailer revealing that the game would be a sci-fi PvP extraction shooter. </p>



<p>In June 2023, Insider Gaming exclusively reported <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-early-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon’s gameplay loop</a>, including an experimental feature that would see players have an in-game timer controlled by their oxygen supply. </p>



<p>Marathon is scheduled to release in 2025 for the Xbox Series S|X, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to seeing more of Bungie’s Marathon? Let us know in the comments or on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

Eagle-eyed Dungeons and Dragons fans have spotted a fresh reference to everyone's favourite <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> vampire, hidden away in the game's new Monster Manual. 
</p>
<p>
Astarion is featured in the 2025 edition of the Monster Manual - or at least, a quote from him is - as spotted by Baldur's Gate 3 fans on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BaldursGate3/comments/1j0wrn4/astarion_mentioned_in_the_new_monster_manual/">reddit</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/baldur-s-gate/the-baldurs-gate-3-arization-of-dungeons-and-dragons-continues-as-astarion-gets-2-official-mentions-in-the-new-source-books/">GamesRadar</a>). 
</p>
<p>
"Darling, you are simply delicious," Astarion says, atop the Monster Manual page detailing Vampire Spawn (medium or small Undead, Neutral Evil). And this isn't the first time Astarion has popped up in official D&amp;D lore either.
</p>
<p>
Astarion previously popped up in the official D&amp;D Player's Handbook (2024 edition) as seen in an eye-catching piece of artwork for the daylight spell. 
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/astarion-hed.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Wizards of the Coast</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Here, Astarion can be spotted tucked away in the bottom right corner, unafflicted by the spell's effects which have begun to burn up all his vampire spawn brethren. (Astarion canonically is immune to sunlight, thanks to the handy plot device of having his illithid tadpole in his brain).
</p>
<p>
Last year's handbook did not specifically confirm it was Astarion in the artwork, but <a href="https://www.enworld.org/threads/astarion-from-baldurs-gate-3-appears-in-the-2024-players-handbook.706670/">ENWorld</a> later got acknowledgement from the illustration's artist that it was an official appearance by the character, the rights to which are owned by D&amp;D maker Wizards of the Coast.
</p>
<p>
Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian has now wrapped up work on the game with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3s-patch-8-adds-long-awaited-split-screen-co-op-for-xbox-series-s">one final patch that added in Xbox Series S splitscreen support</a>. The studio has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-developer-opens-poland-studio-as-work-on-new-projects-ramps-up">now begun work on its next game</a>, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larians-next-game-wont-be-a-baldurs-gate-3-sequel-dlc-or-anything-with-dungeons-dragons">it won't be Baldur's Gate 4 or anything at all to do with D&amp;D</a>. Still, it's highly likely we will see a new entry in the series launch at some point - even if it is from another developer.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gamesir-super-nova-controller-review.1125723/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/05/gamesir-super-nova-controller-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>You wait for ages for a bus to come along, and then two arrive at once. It’s not something you’d expect in the controller world, but GameSir are absolutely smashing things out of the park right now. Not content with the already well-featured and excellent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/28/gamesir-cyclone-2-controller-review/">Cyclone 2</a> – which we were only just able to review – GameSir has just launched <em>another</em> multiformat controller, the Super Nova. In many ways they feel like opposing sides of the same leaf, giving gamers a choice of subtly different controller designs. Well, as long as they’re GameSir controllers.</p>
<p>The Super Nova looks and feels amazing. There’s a lot to be said for a controller that you hand to someone and they immediately respond with generous oohs and aahs. The Super Nova is that controller. The weight here is just right, with enough heft to feel premium and powerful without it feeling like you’re manhandling a brick. At 263g, it shaves a little bit from the Official Xbox Controller’s 287g, which makes it less of a chore through long stints, but has enough heft that you’re not wondering what you’ve spent your money on.</p>
<p>There’s also rubberised grips that wrap all the way around both arms so that your hands feel absolutely set in place when you’re playing – here it’s definitely a step up from the Cyclone 2 which has textured plastic instead. In terms of immediate feel, the Super Nova is the new GameSir king. You’ll be even more impressed when you discover that it’s less than £50.</p>


<p>Visually, the two are distinct, but fairly similar, especially in how they both feature RGB strips running around the controller. The difference with the Super Nova is that they’re not hidden away, whereas the Cyclone 2’s strips are within the body, shining through the translucent plastic. Personally, I think the Super Nova is the better looking of the two, the LED strip providing a hard line between the body and the arms of the gamepad, but it’ll very much come down to individual preference.</p>


<p>The included charging stand continues the Super Nova’s RGB lights, and one of the nicest touches is the way that they line up and cycle as a complete circuit when you put the controller on the base. The base gives you an extra USB-A socket too, which can play home to the 2.4Ghz dongle, keeping everything neat and tidy. There’s also Bluetooth built in and wired support, meaning the Super Nova works perfectly across PC, Nintendo Switch, mobile and Smart TV platforms.</p>
<p>There are some key differences between the Super Nova and the Cyclone 2, and primary amongst them are the buttons. The Super Nova says it uses ‘silent’ buttons, but they’re fairly traditional membrane buttons across the board, including the D-pad. It’s a step down from the microswitch-equipped Cyclone 2, but they are much quieter if that’s important to you. They do feel nice and solid, and work perfectly well, and the ABXY buttons are slightly larger, making them easy to locate in the heat of the moment.</p>

<p>You can also physically move them around, which is ideal if you want to swap to a Switch-centric face button layout, with the magnetic faceplate lifting off easily so that you can access the internal components. You can replace the analogue stick tops too, though there are no additional parts included in the box. I should note that you need to be in a settled environment when you take it apart, as I nearly lost my X button while popping everything out. You definitely don’t want to lose one of them!</p>
<p>As with the Cyclone 2, and the majority of the latest controller releases, the Super Nova uses Hall Effect analogue sticks and triggers. Not only are they more precise – the Super Nova’s two analogue sticks both achieved 100% accuracy on Gamepad Tester – but they will last for a very, very long time thanks to the wizardry of magnets. If you’re the kind of person who’s worn out multiple Xbox controllers and Switch Joy-Con, the Super Nova is an ideal replacement, and at this price it’s an easy choice.</p>
<p>If you play a lot of FPS – I’ve continued to be mildly average at Overwatch 2, but I’ve seen more Play of the Game awards than ever before – then the inclusion of trigger lockouts will be perfect for you. This is something I adore in controllers; shortening the length of time to activate the trigger means that your response time is quicker, and in a head-to-head shoot-off against someone without lockouts, you’re the one who’s going to win.&nbsp;The Super Nova’s lockouts are more traditional than those seen in the Cyclone 2, and as a result they feel sturdier, but at the cost of losing the microswitch element that GameSir including there.</p>

<p>You’ve also got two back paddles, and they’re well placed beneath your fingers but firm enough that you won’t activate them unintentionally. It’s easy to program these on the fly, or you can dig into this and other functions in the GameSir Connect software. Just like the Cyclone 2, I’d be slightly wary of hitting the update firmware button – there’s a known bug lurking around that soft locks your controllers, requiring a reset via the rest button on the back – but beyond that it’s a deep and extremely useable piece of software.</p>
<p>Around the back, you’ve also got a selector to move between Bluetooth connections and the 2.4 GHz dongle, and while it’s nice to have that physical action, it’s very closely inlaid into the rear of the controller, and a little tricky to activate. While the Bluetooth connection is relatively snappy, it can’t compete with the 1000Hz polling rate of the 2.4GHz dongle. It means that the Super Nova is wickedly fast, and when you add together the feel, the features and the responsiveness, you find a ‘pro’ controller in all but name.</p>
<p>At £50 – or even cheaper if you shop around – the Super Nova is incredible value for money. The clearest competition for the Super Nova is, of course, its sibling, the Cyclone 2, or indeed Gamesir’s wired offering the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/08/25/gamesir-g7-se-wired-controller-review/">G7 SE</a>. They’re all packed with Hall Effect sticks and triggers, and various other ‘pro’ features while undercutting the standard offerings from everyone else. As much as I like them, you can’t compare a Switch Pro Controller to the Super Nova, and if you’re looking for a Switch controller in particular, Gamesir’s latest is the one you should get.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/05/absolum-is-the-next-game-from-streets-of-rage-4-developer-guard-crush-games/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Guard Crush Games, Supamonks and Dotemu have announced Absolum, a brand new fantasy brawler that is due to be released later this year. The confirmed platforms are PC, PS5, PS4 and Switch. The announcement trailer opens up with guards clamping down on those who live in this game world, until they are interrupted by two rebels, one wielding a sword and magic while the other has an axe and a gun. The visuals look sublime.</p>
<p><iframe title="Absolum - Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YvI172bkKDk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Absolum will allow you to play as one of four rebel heroes, including the sword wielder and the gun toting dwarf. The other rebels are not showcased in this trailer, but are part of the artwork. The world is known as Talamh, and it will be a world that will be different each time you play with multiple paths and changing enemy encounters on each playthrough. Dotemu has announced that a full gameplay trailer will be released in the next few months, and it is likely we will see the other two characters come in to play. Talamh is under the control of Sun King Azra and his loyal princes, who terrorise the local population.&nbsp; High Enchantress Uchawi brings the rebels together to overthrow Azra and his loyalists.</p>
<p>The rebels of Absolum are Galandra, the sword wielder you see in the trailer, and she has necromatic powers which are destructive. Karl is the dwarf in the trailer, and he is also the last free dwarf in all of Talamh. His blunderbuss gives him access to explosive moves, and his strength is ideal for close quarter combat. Brome, who is not seen in the trailer, is a wizard, and the final character, also not in the trailer, is Cider who is described as a “nimble skirmisher.”</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/04/29/streets-of-rage-4-review/">Streets of Rage 4 Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Streets of Rage 4 review, I wrote, <em>“Streets of Rage 4 is a must for any beat ‘em up fans, especially those with fond memories of the original trilogy. The fighting is great, the visuals are great, and the soundtrack is great. Lizardcube and Guard Crush have managed to capture the essence of those classic games and upgrade it for the modern age.”</em></p>

			<p>Chinese tech conglomerate Tencent has increased its stake in FromSoftware's parent company Kadokawa, edging closer to Sony's shares in the company.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/tencent-acquires-additional-shares-in-fromsoftware-parent-company-kadokawa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GamesIndustry</a> today, Japanese publication Nikkei revealed that Tencent has increased its stake in the company by 1.11%, bringing it to 7.97%. The Chinese conglomerate confirmed the company had increased its share in FromSoftware's parent company as part of a <em>"capital business alliance"</em> between the two parties.</p>
<p>Despite increasing its share ratio, Tencent still isn't the largest shareholder in Kadokawa. Back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-becomes-largest-shareholder-of-fromsoftware-parent-kadokawa-corporation/">December</a>, Sony and Kadokawa confirmed that the two companies had entered a strategic capital and business alliance that made Sony the largest shareholder with around 10% of Kadokawa stock. The alliance will allow Kadokawa to realize the company's Global Media Mix strategy, which involves the global expansion of a wide range of entertainment, including anime and games.</p>
<p>FromSoftware is only one of the game development studios owned by Kadokawa, but it is definitely the most popular. The creator of the Souls series is now working on an Elden Ring spin-off called Elden Ring: Nightreign which combines mechanics from the main game with roguelike elements to provide a co-op experience that has ton of potential, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-hands-on-preview-looking-forward-to-the-night/">preview.</a></p>
<p><em>Even though the experience wasn't perfect, the Closed Network Test&nbsp;succeeded in making me excited about the unique take on the Souls gameplay formula featured in Elden Ring Nightreign. I am now really looking forward to trying out the game when it launches in&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">late May.</a> Hopefully, FromSoftware will be able to address some of the CNT version issues by then&nbsp;and fully realize the potential of the experience.</em></p>

            <p>Nintendo has won another lawsuit this week, this time against a pair of counterfeit sellers selling fake amiibo cards on Amazon.</p>
<p>In October 2023, Nintendo and Amazon filed a joint lawsuit against the counterfeiters for allegedly selling fake Nintendo goods, but the sellers failed to respond.</p>
<p>Now a Seattle district judge has issued a default judgement in the companies' favour, awarding over $7m in trademark infringement damages (thanks <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/533664/nintendo-7-million-counterfeit-amiibo-lawsuit-trademark-infringement">Polygon</a>).</p>
<p>Specifically, Nintendo sought $705,963 against one seller through several seller accounts, $6.2m against another seller with several accounts, and $47,652 against both for a shared account.</p>
<p>"The Court finds this damages request to be reasonable, in light of the nature of the deceptive scheme, the scope of the sales, the involvement of each Defendant, as well as the need for compensation, deterrence, and punishment," court documents read. "The Court therefore awards Nintendo damages in the amounts and allocations sought."</p>
<p>Amazon shut down the sellers' accounts ahead of filing the original complaint.</p>
<p>"Nintendo utilises both internal and external resources to combat counterfeit and infringing products," wrote lawyers in that original complaint. "Nintendo works with a third-party brand protection service vendor on the detection and removal of product listings violating Nintendo's IP rights that are identified and sold in Amazon's stores. Nintendo works regularly and collaboratively with Amazon to identify counterfeit Nintendo products and to strengthen automated detection and removal of the products from Amazon's stores."</p>
<p>The news follows an announcement from Nintendo yesterday it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-latest-legal-win-against-piracy-significant-for-the-entire-games-industry">successful in a lawsuit against French file-sharing company Dstorage</a>, which operates the website 1fichier.com. The decision was "significant" in the company's ongoing fight against pirated games, as well as for "the entire games industry".</p>
<p>Other lawsuit wins include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-emulator-yuzu-shuts-down-as-creator-agrees-to-pay-nintendo-24m">against Switch emulator Yuzu</a>, which shut down and paid Nintendo $2.4m, as well as against a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-streamer-who-said-he-could-broadcast-its-pirated-games-all-day">streamer who broadcast pirated games</a> last year.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most high-profile legal action from Nintendo, though, is its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-infringement-of-multiple-patents">ongoing patent infringement lawsuit against Palworld developer Pocketpair</a>. The Pokémon-with-guns game has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-surpasses-32m-players-a-year-after-release-but-nintendo-lawsuit-remains-unresolved">surpassed 32 million players</a> a year after its release, but the legal case currently remains unresolved.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fragpunk-new-hero-shooter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fragpunk</a> delivers Indiana Jones-sized Short Rounds with quick battles and ever-changing dynamics. It may be a Hero shooter—taking inspiration from Overwatch and Marvel Rivals—but it has its fresh twists. Shard Cards allow players to customize their playstyle on the fly, midgame with gameplay-altering abilities.</p>



<p>It looks cool, it enjoyed a smooth <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fragpunk-closed-beta-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">closed beta</a>, and its PC release is already locked in. But what about if you’re waiting for the Fragpunk console release?</p>

<p><strong>Fragpunk’s console release date has been delayed indefinitely until an unspecified date.</strong></p>



<p>The news has shocked players waiting to gear up for Fragpunk on PlayStation and Xbox. The March 6 release date is only happening for PC players now, and the developer has neglected to reveal so much as a vague release window to look forward to.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-has-fragpunk-s-console-release-date-been-delayed">Why Has Fragpunk’s Console Release Date Been Delayed?</h2>



<p><strong>Developer Bad Guitar Studio provided an update on March 4 to explain the delay was due to “console compliance testing” issues.</strong></p>



<p>The explanation came via a March 4 post on the team’s official <a href="https://x.com/PlayFragPunk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X social media page</a>.</p>



<p>“During the console compliance testing process, we encountered unexpected technical challenges in optimization and adaptation. Rather than rushing the console release and providing a potentially poor user experience, we have made the difficult decision to delay the launch of the console versions to ensure that players receive a comparable experience to those on PC.”</p>



<p>Unfortunately, no update or timeframe is provided for a Fragpunk console release. All that’s promised is the “Team is working closely with both the Xbox and PlayStation teams to get Fragpunk into your hands as soon as possible.”</p>



<div><article><p><span>A message from FragPunk team about the delay of the launch on console platforms:</span></p></article></div>



<p>Console players who jumped on board early will be compensated at least. Players can claim a ton of engagement rewards, refunds, in-game currency, and much more.</p>

<p>Are you a disappointed PlayStation or Xbox user who was looking forward to Fragpunk’s console release? Do you think the level of compensation is enough when PC players get a huge advantage? Let us know your thoughts below.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-boss-hits-back-at-fan-negativity-saying-if-you-take-developers-passion-for-granted-well-all-pay-the-price<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford has reacted to online negativity regarding the upcoming Borderlands 4, stating "if you take developer's passion for granted, we'll all pay the price".</p>
<p>Pitchford's words come as part of an exchange on social media with influencer Gothalion, who also serves as audience director for publisher Midwest Games, and kicked off after Gothalion claimed Pitchford had muted a fan for raising some "very valid concerns (mild takes really)" about the next entry in the Borderlands series.</p>
<p>"His critique came from a place of love," <a href="https://x.com/Gothalion/status/1896361473586384983">Gothalion wrote</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/dont-gaslight-me-borderlands-4-ceo-randy-pitchford-begs-fans-to-be-optimistic-about-the-upcoming-fps-otherwise-well-all-pay-the-price/">GamesRadar</a>). "As will mine. Please reconsider. Do better. Make a great Borderlands, and when your longest lasting biggest supporters give feedback and worries, especially respectfully, digest it gracefully."</p>

</figure>
<p>Pitchford, however, did not take warmly to Gothalion's comments, and said the aforementioned mild takes were not a critique, but "shitty negativity that was demotivating" for the Borderlands 4 team.</p>
<p>"Want the best Borderlands? Root for us and cheer us on. If you take developer's passion for granted, we'll all pay the price," <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1896371927259980287">Pitchford replied</a>, adding he appreciates criticism and has "never been in short supply" of it.</p>
<p>"Don't gaslight me on his post," the Gearbox exec closed. "It wasn't criticism. It was pessimism. It's toxic for people killing themselves for your entertainment, so fuck that noise."</p>
<p>This is, of course, not the first time Pitchford has been vocal in defence of his studio and media online. Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-randy-pitchford-defends-recent-flops-by-comparing-gearbox-to-the-beatles">the CEO compared his company to the Beatles</a>. "I wish everything [we do] could be a hit," he said, "but that is not how it works... The greatest musical act of all time, The Beatles, had a 25 percent hit rate."</p>

            <p>Sony has just released a new update for its PS3 console, which turns 19 this year.</p>
<p>The system software update 4.92 improves system performance, according to the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/support/hardware/ps3/system-software/">patch notes</a>, and also renews the Blu-ray player encryption key to allow for disc playback.</p>
<p>Updates of this sort are an annual occurrence, as the Advanced Access Content System (AACS) <a href="https://manuals.playstation.net/document/en/ps3/current/video/aacs.html#:~:text=AACS%20(Advanced%20Access%20Content%20System,months%20and%20must%20be%20renewed.">encryption key regularly expires</a> - it's a copyright-protection technology that requires a key to be set on both the disc and the console in order to play new films.</p>

<p>The key also exists on PS4 and PS5, but according to the console manuals, the encryption key is automatically renewed, but on PS3 it must be done in a system update.</p>

            <p>A long-running zombie MMORPG you can play in your internet browser is shutting down next week, after almost 20 years of plank-smashing and supermarket looting. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/urban-dead">Urban Dead</a> is closing down because a new UK law threatens hefty fines for online services (including games) that don't follow age restriction rules and other guidelines. It looks like making the game compliant with that law would be too much work for the solo web developer who's been keeping the apocalyptic servers going for this long. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Sad to have to announce that Urban Dead will be closing down on Friday 14 March 2025, due to an upcoming change in UK website legislation," said developer Kevan Davis in a <a href="https://www.urbandead.com/shutdown.html">post on the game's website</a> spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/mmo/cult-text-based-zombie-mmo-urban-dead-is-shutting-down-after-a-full-19-years-8-months-and-11-days-because-of-new-uk-legislation/">Gamesradar</a>.</p>
<p>"The Online Safety Act comes into force later this month, applying to all social and gaming websites where users interact, and especially those without strong age restrictions. With the possibility of heavy corporate-sized fines even for solo web projects like this one, I've reluctantly concluded that it doesn't look feasible for Urban Dead to be able to continue operating."</p>
<p>The Online Safety Act was passed into law in 2023 and comes into effect this year. The UK government says the act will make social media and search companies "more responsible for their users’ safety on their platforms."</p>
<p>"The strongest protections in the Act have been designed for children," an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/online-safety-act-explainer/online-safety-act-explainer">explainer says</a>. "Platforms will be required to prevent children from accessing harmful and age-inappropriate content."</p>
<p>But the law has been criticised as a censor's charter by human rights groups <a href="https://www.openrightsgroup.org/press-releases/online-safety-bill-a-threat-to-human-rights-warn-campaigners/">such as Open Rights</a>, and big companies like Apple have complained that it has <a href="https://www.24zero.net/apple-calls-uks-online-safety-bill-a-serious-threat-to-end-to-end-encryption/">repercussions for end-to-end encryption</a>. This is a bit messy, since Apple is already in a spat with the UK government over <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8rkpv50x01o">a secret order</a> they were handed by the government to hand over the keys to their encryption - but, look, none of this has anything to do with zombies. Urban Dead just seems to be collateral damage in a bigger legal brawl between the UK government and corporate interests.</p>
<p>"So a full 19 years, 8 months and 11 days after its quarantine began, Urban Dead will be shut down. No grand finale. No final catastrophe. No helicopter evac. Make your peace or your final stand in whichever part of Malton you called home, and the game will be switched off at noon UTC on 14 March."</p>
<p>Malton is the name of the big city you explore in the game. It's basically loads of blocks full of gun shops, fire stations, hospitals, malls, pubs, and other potential sources of useful items to scavenge. You can board up the windows of any building to protect against the undead. It's the only MMO I know that lets players play as zombies. I briefly wrote about waking up as a zombie and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-urban-dead">enjoying the game's refresh battles</a> back in 2017. I haven't played for many many years, but my fond memories of the game include holding out in a boarded up mall with lots of other players (and a single "pet" zombie player who muffled and groaned in <a href="https://wiki.urbandead.com/index.php/Guides:The_Zombie_Lexicon">a whole language that you could actually translate</a> if you took the time to examine the moans). </p>

			<p>At a recent Assassin's Creed Shadows showcase event in Japan, Ubisoft Quebec Creative Director Jonathan Dumont discussed the estimated length of the upcoming open world game. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1xnfk2J98Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Genki Gamer</a>, he said that the studio expects the main story to last at least thirty to forty hours, while the whole game could last more than eighty hours when accounting for all the side content.</p>
<p>That's certainly a hefty amount, although a bit less than the gargantuan Assassin's Creed Valhalla, which required 61 hours just for the main story and could last up to nearly 150 hours for a full completionist run, <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/77729" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to the website HowLongToBeat</a>. Admittedly, Valhalla's quests and missions weren't always memorable, and gamers nowadays have loudly expressed their disdain for fetch quests and the like. Hopefully, the new installment can deliver higher quality content on average.</p>
<p>For Ubisoft, it would be an understatement to say that there's a lot riding on Assassin's Creed Shadows. The French publisher had to deal with multiple underwhelming commercial launches, including Skull and Bones, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, XDefiant, and Star Wars Outlaws, just to name a few. The shorter spin-off game Assassin's Creed Mirage did well enough, but now Ubisoft needs a big win. It's why they've <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-to-march-20-while-ubisoft-appoints-advisors-to-review-potential-company-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delayed Assassin's Creed Shadows twice</a> in a desperate attempt to improve the game and make sure it hits the intended mark.</p>
<p>Bringing players to the long-requested setting of 16th-century Japan, toward the end of the Sengoku era, the game features dual protagonists Fujibayashi Naoe and Yasuke, a shinobi and a samurai, respectively. Ubisoft Quebec has previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-lets-you-stick-with-one-protagonist-for-most-of-the-game-exploration-loop-is-sherlock-like/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a> that players could stick with their preferred protagonist for most of the game if they so choose, though there will be some things that one is much better at than the other, and at some point, the game might force you to switch.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-shows-off-the-improved-anvil-engine-shares-new-tech-info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new version of the Anvil engine</a> delivers interesting improvements to the stealth gameplay, too. For the first time in the franchise, hiding in the shadows will actually make the player character invisible to their enemies. This means that during nighttime, every shaded spot will become a dynamic hiding spot in which the players can advance themselves further, both indoors and outdoors. Players can even destroy lit lanterns with Shurikens, creating new shadowed spots. Moreover, the dynamic weather and seasons can affect stealth as well. When it's raining, the sound covers the player's footsteps. Rain also makes changes to enemy patrols, as some NPCs will seek shelter from the rain. Seasons have an even greater effect, as some bushes/vegetation won't be there in the winter months.</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows is set to debut on March 20 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

			<p>I’ve only ever known the Suikoden&nbsp;series as the JRPG where you can recruit like a hundred different characters. I always loved the idea of that whenever I heard it, but the closest I came to actually playing them was with being tempted by the recently released spiritual successor <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/23/eiyuden-chronicles-hundred-heroes-review/">Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes</a>. With Konami setting out to revive their entire gaming catalogue, though, it was only a matter of time before Suikoden was brought back into the spotlight. I’m thankful it was, and that this two-for-one HD remaster gave me the kick I needed to finally dive into a pair of unsurprising but thoroughly enjoyable old-school JRPGs.</p>
<p><iframe title="Suikoden I&amp;II HD Remaster Gate Rune and Dunan Unification Wars | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wTLkLvgGvXA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The amount of effort put into restoring and remastering these games for modern screens is immediately evident. These aren’t quite HD-2D works of art on the level of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/13/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-review/">Dragon Quest 3 Remake</a>,&nbsp;but they get pretty dang close. Plenty of environmental sprites has either been entirely redrawn or enhanced in 3D, with some realistic lighting or brightly glowing fires placed here and there in certain environments.</p>


<p>Despite characters being the focal point of this series, they don’t feel like they’ve gotten as much love in the process of remastering. Character sprites look nearly identical when compared to the original releases, retaining a pretty lanky &amp; blocky pixel aesthetic that ends up clashing just a bit with the much more modernised environments. Character portraits, meanwhile, are hit-or-miss. Those in Suikoden 1 have all been completely redrawn, and while some look pretty sharp many of them lack the same sharp style as the original portraits. Suikoden 2 portraits, meanwhile, are simply scaled up HD versions of the original portraits – but they’ve had a bit of their edge sanded off in the process, and a few even have bits of smudge and blur that come off looking pretty uncanny.</p>
<div id="attachment_457581"><p id="caption-attachment-457581">Suikoden 1 visual upgrade</p>
</div>
<p>The stories of these two games slot right into the classic fantasy formula. first game weaves a tale of an evil empire and a young hero poised to topple them with the help of his friends. The sequel, set a few years later, is a bit more open-ended as it follows childhood friends who get swept up in a series of fateful encounters and separations in the midst of a massive civil war. Both games, ultimately, steer you towards the same goal: recruit 108 allies to build an army big enough to conquer the big bad.</p>
<p>Most of the time, you’ll only be hanging out with up to six of your allies. Standard battles in the game are pretty traditional turn-based bouts where your crew of six occupy a set of rows based on their attack range, standing opposite enemies that have done the same. It’s pretty basic stuff, but these battles are broken up in a few refreshing ways. For these remasters new quality-of-life features let you toggle auto-battle or sped-up battles to help trudge through the slower sections of the game, but there’s also different battle types that you’ll be thrust into at times.</p>

		</div>

<p>Both games feature Duel battles where just two characters duke it out in a rock-paper-scissors combat format. It’s a really cool way to add some extra stakes to the more climactic encounters in the story. Then, there are War battles. In the first game, they’ kind of like scaled-up singular encounters from Advanced Wars. In the second game, though, War battles are massive turn-based tactical RPG bouts that really test your patience.</p>
<div id="attachment_457579"><p id="caption-attachment-457579">Suikoden 2 visual upgrade</p></div>
<p>In an otherwise basic set of JRPGs, I was constantly kept entertained and on my toes thanks to the features that make Suikoden&nbsp;such an iconic and unique series. Constantly encountering and recruiting hundreds of new allies was a thrill, and any time the slightly-basic story or combat started to overstay their welcome, an epic Duel battle or a massive War battle shook things up and got me right back into the thick of it.&nbsp;Suikoden I&amp;II HD Remaster&nbsp;doesn’t make these old-school titles feel like brand new games by any stretch, but it’s still a surprisingly polished and easily accessible way to dive into JRPG history.</p>

            <p>
Capcom has unveiled a bustling in-game event schedule for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, with the first oppurtunity to gain new gear available now.
</p>
<p>
Six events will go live over the next three weeks, each lasting for a week or two, with rewards ranging from new headgear to... more cheese? I guess <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-delectable-cuisine-causes-cheese-naan-sales-to-surge">Monster Hunter Wilds is really leaning into its cheese naan meme</a>.
</p>
<p>
The schedule begins now with Ku-Ku Gone Cuckoo, an event based in the Scarlet Forest which requires you gather special materials to obtain the Mimiphyta α headgear. This runs until 18th March.

<p>
The Stalking Supper event is also now active, which rewards you for gathering more Kunafa Cheese in Windward Plains to be used on your barbecue grill. This runs until 11th March.
</p>
<p>
Upcoming quests include Tongue-Tied, running from 11th-18th March, which involves gathering Armor Spheres, and then a trio of new events beginning on 18th March.
</p>
<p>
These include Ballet in the Rain, which involves gathering Glowing Orb - Swords, Sand-Scarred Soul, for gathering Glowing Orb - Armors, and Like A Fire Hidden By Sand, where Capcom says you can obtain "the Expedition Headgear α, a piece of equipment based on the emblem of the expedition!"
</p>
<p>
Capcom has a <a href="https://info.monsterhunter.com/wilds/event-quest/en-us/schedule?utc=0">full event schedule on the Monster Hunter Wilds website</a>.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-is-capcoms-fastest-selling-game-ever">Capcom announced that Monster Hunter Wilds was its fastest-selling game ever</a>, with 8m copies shipped so far. The game also got its first big patch, though Capcom warned of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-patch-notes-warn-of-network-error-when-firing-sos-flares">continuing Monster Hunter Wilds network error  surrounding the use of SOS flares</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-has-surpassed-6-million-players-says-gsc/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A few hours ago, Ukrainian developer GSC Game World <a href="https://x.com/stalker_thegame/status/1896969076884562078" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl has surpassed six million players, adding that such a scope is 'hard to comprehend' but the studio is 'incredibly thankful' to the community.</p>
<p>Of course, this doesn't mean six million users have purchased the game. That's because STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl has been available on Game Pass from day one, making it difficult to discriminate between real buyers and subscription users who found the game bundled in their library.</p>
<p>Still, it sounds like GSC Game World is happy enough so far. Moreover, while there has been no mention of a PlayStation 5 version, the console exclusivity <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-is-a-3-month-console-exclusive-microsoft-will-increase-revenue-share-for-xbox-games-too/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is believed to be timed</a>. Eventually, STALKER 2 should also launch on Sony's console, opening up to a whole new audience.</p>
<p>The developer still has a long road ahead when it comes to post-launch support, anyway. The game should be <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-is-getting-hardware-rt-cross-platform-mods-and-multiplayer-post-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">updated</a> to include hardware-enhanced ray tracing, official mod tools with cross-platform mod integration, and even a multiplayer mode, about which we know practically nothing so far. On top of those, there are also two upcoming expansions that were sold as part of the Season Pass, included with the Ultimate Edition.</p>
<p>The base game is well worth playing, if a bit too rough, as I explained <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-the-anomaly-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in my review</a>:</p>
<p><em>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is a worthy successor of the original in every regard, good and bad. The vision is the same: an uncompromising game that will often frustrate you, but also offers a unique experience that can hardly be found anywhere else. It's the classic example where the total is more than the mere sum of its parts. Bugs and balance issues are still very much an issue, but they shouldn't stand in your way of playing, especially if you're willing to wait a while for developers and modders to fix them. If you enjoy open world games and shooters and don't mind a challenge, there's no reason for you to pass up on this game.</em></p>

<p>I personally would not rely on the structural integrity of a layer of onigiri to support multiple clay bowls and glass bottles, but I am not a professional, nor do I have to please a clientele of demons, large spiders, and Kappas. I also personally wouldn't have written the phrase "immerse yourself in the mysterious atmosphere of Japan" in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3373830/The_Way_of_the_Tray_Japanese_Restaurant_Simulator/">Steam features</a>, since all you have to do there is add an '-ese folklore' to not sound like a 17th century powder-wigged buffoon trotting out his maid in Geisha makeup for tonight's dinner party entertainment. Here are some less irksomely worded features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Master the art of keeping your tray balanced: every mistake can cost you a tip. Learn to manage your time so you can serve all your guests on time and prevent them from leaving.</li>
<li>Serve unusual orders to yokai and learn all the secrets of local cuisine.</li>
<li>Develop your waiter skills to earn more tips and invest them in upgrades, and don’t forget to pay the rent.</li>
</ul>
<p>My own experience in food service includes frying up English breakfasts in a chippy cafe, temping for a catering company for weddings, and working in a Wetherspoons-grade pub kitchen (I believe the professional term is "microwave ape"). None of these were especially negative, mind. The chippy was in a popular holiday town, which led me to observe that some customers will treat any perceived imperfection as a direct assault on their perfect getaway, but I suppose the nature of limited leisure time makes solipsists of us all. As does paying six quid for a bacon roll. If I'd known you were going to be a Kappa I would have whacked extra cucumber in there, obviously.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/news/75Ec8tj1T1Y0mqJTLVE4fD/assassins-creed-shadows-deep-dive-into-the-hideout">new blogvert</a> for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>' hideout customisation appeared yesterday, just when you thought it was safe to play another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world game</a> following the merciless time vacuum that was<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth"> Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a>'s Dondoko Island.</p>
<p>The hideout is an acre of "fully customisable" land for Naoe and Yasuke to visit for a breather.  Once there, you can pop down buildings, shrubbery, animals, and decorations. The blog also specifies the placement of "mossy rocks". No other types though. Moss or piss off.</p>

<p>Here's some grid snapping action.</p>

<p>"Each building &amp; upgrade will also have a direct impact on gameplay," the blog says. The dojo trains combat allies. The forge upgrades weapons. A tea room lets you "increase ration efficiency", and so on. I assume that's something to do with health, although I'm now picturing a radical late nineties console advert in which a spiky-haired youth shouts downstairs at his parents that he can't go to grandma's house because he's "increasing ration efficiency, Mom!". Nothing says excitement like upgrade names that evoke board room minutes.</p>

<p>As you can see above, the grid snapping action also applies to animal companions, who you can pop down and visit to pet at your leisure. "We had all these endearing critters all over the world already," writes Dany of the senior design team, "and everyone's instant reaction is to drop everything they're doing and stare at them for a minute. It made sense for us to make them available inside of the Hideout."</p>
<p>This isn't entirely accurate to my experience with Assassin's Creed, since I actually spent a good chunk of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-odyssey">Odyssey</a> on a personal quest to find every bear in Greece and kick them in the face. Call me out for being an awful cynic here, but this also feels like a case of "give the player what they think they want" at the expense of those moments Dany describes. I'm not sure how often I'd stop and to stare at wildlife in the open world if I've already got a hideout carpeted in deer poo.</p>
<p>To further populate, upgrade, and decorate your hideout, the open world is scattered with resources for you to collect - or possibly pay for since it's Assassin's Creed, a pioneer in the groundbreaking "give us a tenner for this bag of wood" monetisation field.</p>
<p>This is purely speculation on my part, however. Ubisoft have already announced they're <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-as-ubisoft-try-to-recover-from-softer-than-expected-star-wars-outlaws-launch">dropping the season pass model</a>, although the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3159330/Assassins_Creed_Shadows/">Steam listing</a> does offer a pricier edition that includes some DLC, so this feels more like a token rebranding than the (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-lay-off-another-185-people-and-shutter-one-of-the-studios-behind-star-wars-outlaws-and-the-division-2">currently flailing</a>) company turning over a new mossy rock.</p>
<p>I'm aware that I'm emanating pessimism like a <a href="https://freshare.net/persimmon-seeds-predict-warm-winter-above-average-snow-fall-in-the-ozarks-freshare-net/">snow hater dissecting a spoon-shaped persimmon seed</a>, so I should say that I think this all sounds like a pleasant and serene way to spend time between the hustle and/or bustle of the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sengoku">Sengoku</a> period. A few customisation tools go a long way in helping you feel ownership over a space, and I'm a sucker for anything that lets me enjoy the vibe of pruning a bonsai without the anguish of having that bonsai die approximately fourteen seconds after I bring it home. Also, I like the sound of the ally conversations at the hideout:</p>
<p>"Having our allies in one place creates opportunities for character development," the blog says. "We gathered the writers (from 4 different studios all over the world) in a meeting and had them create interactions inspired by questions like, 'What would happen if these two characters suddenly became roommates?' I really love all the cool little moments they came up with. It makes the Hideout feel like the beating heart of the league".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>PlayStation has been hit with more layoffs from its Visual Arts studio, following the recent cancellations of multiple live-service games.</p>
<p>The layoffs come amid a restructuring of Sony's US studios, as an unknown number of staff from the San Diego-based Visual Arts studio will be let go this week.</p>
<p>Visual Arts supported first-party development (including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s The Last of Us remasters), and while these new cuts include staff who contributed to the recently cancelled live-service game from Bend Studio among others, <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-studios-visual-arts-layoffs-cuts-last-us-1851767734">Kotaku</a> has reported the layoffs are more widespread.</p>

<p>Eurogamer has contacted Sony for further details on these layoffs.</p>
<p>The news follows <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">several cancelled projects from Sony</a>, including a live-service game from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/days-gone">Days Gone</a> developer Bend and another from Bluepoint reportedly based within the God of War series.</p>
<p>Moreover, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">Sony cancelled live-service shooter Concord</a> back in September, admitting "our initial launch didn't land". A month later, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-shuts-down-concord-developer-firewalk-studios-game-will-remain-permanently-offline">shut down developer Firewalk Studios</a> as the game would remain permanently offline.</p>
<p>This time last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-laying-off-900-playstation-employees-london-studio-to-close-in-its-entirety">Sony laid off 900 staff</a> equating eight percent of its workforce. The reductions were predominantly due to the closure of its London Studio and reductions at Firesprite.</p>
<p>On the flipside, Sony still has its Horizon live-service game in development, which has now added former Bungie senior design lead <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisjamesproctor/">Chris Proctor</a> to its team as a design director. At Bungie, his focus was on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>'s weapons.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Back in the late 90s, after releasing some amazing games like Final Fantasy VI and Chrono Trigger, Squaresoft was the undisputed king of Japanese role-playing games. The publisher's dominance in the genre, however, did not stop other Japanese publishers known for releasing some absolute bangers in other genres from launching their own takes on the genre, like Konami, which released the first entry in the Suikoden series back in late 1995 in Japan. While the game directed by Yoshitaka Murayama wasn't particularly different from most traditional JRPGs, it set itself apart from the competition by tackling some pretty mature themes for the time, but the rise of polygonal 3D graphics, and a Western release date too close to that of Final Fantasy VII severely impacted the game's audience. No one at the time, however, could have predicted that the game would turn into a full-blown series, counting five main entries and a few spin-offs that would attract a loyal and enduring following, even after the series was clearly done.</p>
<p>While the series' creator Yoshitaka Murayama, who sadly passed away <a href="https://wccftech.com/suikoden-series-creator-eiyuden-chronicle-hundred-heroes-scenario-writer-yoshitaka-murayama-has-passed-away/">last year</a>, moved on to create <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/eiyuden-chronicle-hundred-heroes-review-the-last-bow/">another franchise</a> that serves as a spiritual successor to the Konami series, Konami has finally decided to bring back the series after a very long hiatus and offer modern audiences a chance to play both the original Suikoden and Suikoden II on modern platforms with Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster: Gate Rune And Dunan Unification Wars, a remaster collection that does its job quite well, but whose real value lies in the quality of the original games.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250221183259_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>For those who have already played the two games, let's get one thing out of the way: Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster: Gate Rune And Dunan Unification Wars is a competent remaster that, maybe, could have done something more. Both games have received a considerable visual uplit, as every location has been faithfully recreated over the original games with higher resolution art and sprites, which have been left untouched over the original aside from receiving an obvious resolution bump, and new animated elements that help bring the Scarlet Moon Empire and the City-States of Jowstone to life like never before. Character portraits have been completely redone in Suikoden I to bring them to a similar level of quality as those featured in Suikoden II, which have received some light touch-ups but no major overhaul. The soundtrack of both games was left untouched, which is not a bad thing at all, considering how amazing they both are to this day, and the only proper improvement in the audio department is ambient noises, which add a little bit of color to the entire game and help immersion, especially in the many dramatic sequences where music is absent.</p>
<p>In addition to the visual uplift and the small audio improvements, Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster: Gate Rune And Dunan Unification Wars features a few other enhancements, including a redone UI for both games, which is quite welcome, three difficulty options, and some other quality-of-life changes, including the ability to speed up battles, and a toggleable auto-battle option that allows players to either play multiple turns using the auto option or cancel it to input commands manually the following turn. While the difficulty options are welcome, and Hard difficulty can be a little challenging, especially at the beginning of the two games, where the player has limited resources and lacks access to the most powerful Stars of Destiny, the other two combat improvements leave something to be desired. Speeding up battles essentially speeds the entire game up, meaning that you will also have to listen to sped-up versions of the combat themes, which is so bad that I avoided using the option as much as I could, something that did not impact the experience too much since both Suikoden I and Suikoden II feature a snappy combat system that doesn't waste too much time playing out characters' actions. The new Auto Battle feature, on the other hand, is way more useful, but unfortunately, activating it forces a small black bar on the lower part of the screen that indicates Auto Battle is on, which is a little distracting and immersion-breaking. One final extremely welcome quality of life improvement exclusive to Suikoden II is the Turn Off EVen TImer option, which removes the time limit for certain events, such as Clive's sidequest.</p>
<p>The biggest improvement besides the improved visuals featured in Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster: Gate Rune And Dunan Unification Wars are the localization improvements. While the English localization was overall fine in the original game, though not stellar in any capacity, it was truly awful in Suikoden II, featuring some repeated dialogues, poor wording, and sentence structure that sometimes made it difficult to even understand what characters were saying. Both games have received a new English localization that flows much better in the first game, and that finally makes sense in the second game, making the story shine even more than it did back in the day, even with the horrible localization and all. Unfortunately, there are times when modern slang slips in that feels completely out of place, such as when Viktor calls Gremio a "drama queen" early in Suikoden I, but thankfully they aren't that frequent.</p>
<p>While the above is a solid selection of improvements, as I got reacquainted with the Gate Rune and Dunan Unification Wars, I couldn't help but feel that something more could have been done, aside from fixing the music speeding up in battle when increasing combat speed. For starters, an option to speed up field traversal would have been welcome, as would a random encounter toggle. While the two games don't have a high random encounter rate, the way they handle fighting weak enemies, who can be Let Go at the start of any turn without any penalty, it just would have made sense to give players the option to turn encounters off completely to speed up the already excellent pace of both games. With so many playable characters available, any option to improve character management would also have been welcome, especially in Suikoden I.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250303011312_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Even though something more could have been done to improve the two games, Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster: Gate Rune And Dunan Unification Wars is still a collection that every JRPG should be getting for a very simple reason: the high quality of both games. While the original Suikoden may feel a little too traditional, even with some of its unique quirks, Suikoden II is, simply put, one of the best Japanese role-playing games ever released, taking everything the original game did and bringing it up to eleven. In my opinion, it stands head-to-head with more popular JRPGs of the late 90s, like Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy VII, and Xenogears, and even surpasses them in some areas. It is a game that every fan of the genre should experience at least once.</p>
<p>At a glance, Suikoden I and its sequel don't look that different. Both are traditional top-down 2D JRPGs where players explore the Scarlet Moon Empire and the City-States of Jowston as the story dictates, alternating between towns and villages and dungeons as required. While both experiences are fairly linear, their traditional world maps sometimes allow players to branch out in search of new companions to recruit, the 108 of Destiny, who can join the main, mandatory story characters in battles, or provide significant help during Army Battles, which are played as some sort of rock-paper-scissor game in the first Suikoden and as a tactical turn-based RPG in the second, or new services at the Headquarters. The straightforward turn-based combat system is made more remarkable by the large parties of up to six members, the ability to use combinations attacks with certain characters called Unite Attacks, and its general fast speed. At some point during both games, certain characters will also be involved in duels, one-on-one fights that employ a rock-paper-scissor system and feature a sort of cinematic feel that looks great even with the dated and simple 3D backgrounds. Enriching both games are dungeons with a solid design featuring some puzzles, a decent wealth of mini-games that provide some variety, though the RNG dice game Chinchirorin remains as annoying as ever.</p>
<p>What truly makes Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster: Gate Rune And Dunan Unification Wars stand out even today with their relatively straightforward gameplay are their stories, which were, in many ways, groundbreaking for the time. Even with its relative simplicity, Suikoden I laid the thematic groundwork that would get further developed in its sequel, not shying away, as already mentioned, from dealing with some pretty dark and mature themes like the reality of war, often shown without any sort of filter, prejudice, and racism, duty, honor and sacrifice transcending every bond.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250302235643_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Suikoden II goes even deeper with these themes, featuring some chilling sequences that get etched into the player's memory and heart, all the while, much like its predecessor, balancing them out with considerably less dark sequences. What makes Suikoden II the best entry in the series and one of the best JRPGs of all time, elevating it past its already solid predecessor is its cast. The incredible main trio of protagonists - the main character, Nanami and Jowy -, the way their personal stories intertwine not only with the war between the City-States of Jowston and the Highland Kingdom but also with the overarching series' story of the 27 True Runes and the personal conflicts of other story-significant characters are a massive highlight of the experience, and how they get resolved, no matter the ending reached, are capable of moving pretty much anyone who has the chance of experiencing them first hand. All of this is massively improved by the incredible and diverse soundtrack, whose standout piece, the beautifully melancholic Reminiscence, is only the tip of the audio iceberg.</p>
<p>But if there is one character that is the true standout of the Suikoden II cast is one of the main villains, the infamous Mad Prince of the Highland Kingdom, Luca Blight. This psychopath, who can only be described as a demon in human skin, is rightly considered one of the best villains ever seen in JRPG, and for good reason, surpassing other known JRPG madmen like Kefka and Sephiroth by engaging in the most heinous of war crimes only because he had the authority and the power to do so, all while delivering some unforgettable speeches that truly send shivers down the spine. Going against the tendency of the time, which still holds true today, to make JRPG villains grey, the absolute evil that Luca Blight shows whenever he appears on screen, and even offscreen at times, is a refreshing breath of air nowadays, a testament of the genius and courage of Yoshitaka Murayama and the entire writing team.</p>
<p>As a remaster, Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster: Gate Rune And Dunan Unification Wars definitely succeeds at updating the two classic JRPGs while staying faithful to the original games' art direction, although a few more options and quality-of-life features wouldn't have hurt. Even if the remaster somehow failed to deliver a quality updgrade, however, Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster: Gate Rune And Dunan Unification Wars would have been a worthy purchase for any JRPG. The two classic games have stood the test of time incredibly well and still provide extremely compelling gameplay enriched by charming casts and thought-provoking stories that are still worthy of experiencing in 2025 as they were back in the late 90s.</p>

<p>“For the original games, the size of the dialogue box was quite small and there wasn’t a lot that we could fit in there," producer Yasuo Daikai <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/konami-interview-suikoden-hd-remaster">told IGN back in 2022</a>. "Japanese is a language that can say a lot in a very short amount of space, but for English and other languages, you need a lot of space to say the same thing usually. So in this game we have expanded the size of those dialogue boxes, and that has let us retool and work on the localization to get us more in tune with the Japanese script,"</p>

<p>I wasn't able to check all or even most of the dialogue, instead pausing occasionally to compare the remasters to footage of the Playstation originals. But most lines I did compare are different. It's a fine translation, but one that sometimes sacrifices idiosyncratic character for what feels like cautious legibility. Considering how difficult these games are to own legally, my ideal package would have been one that preserved the original scripts in some form.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the stilted becomes the colloquial in ways that feel sensible and deft. Viktor's "Prepare yourselves for a surprise" from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/suikoden">Suikoden</a> 1 is now "you might wanna sit down for this". Sometimes, the poetic becomes more commonplace. "Not that I see our reunion in the stars," Leknaat tells the hero in the original. "Not based on an astrology reading," she says now. Odessa's "Our tiny newborn hope must be kept alive" is now "that small flame of hope must be kept alive."</p>
<p>Other changes are more subjective, depending on how much you like Suikoden's goofiness, but seem clear examples of extra space being used. Instead of the hero having the option to tell Emperor Barbarossa "I don't wanna", he can now say "not if I can help it".</p>
<p>I've only played a little of Suikoden 2 at time of writing, but every line I compared in the introduction is slightly different. Again, these strike me as a translator using the extra space that Daikai mentioned to craft more precise lines. Jowy's "Me too. I thought about going back to Kyaro and I couldn't wait to get out of that uniform" is now "Me too, actually. No way I could stay in that uniform any longer knowing we're headed home to Kyaro." Luca Blight's "I wish I had joined the ambush. All I've had to fight lately is that old man. I'm getting rusty" is now "I wish I had joined the ambush. All I've had to fight lately is that stupid old man. I'm falling out of practise."</p>

<p>Since review embargo is up, I can tell you I'm having a lovely time revisiting two games that are precious to me beyond words (which is awkward because I have to write about them). There are also plenty of features in support of preservation: music, cutscene, and cinematic galleries with concept art backgrounds. There's no lack of love or care here. Suikoden I character designer Junko Kawano's new portraits are a real treat, especially. But - speaking purely in terms of preservation - there's something irreplaceable about a fourteen year old answering an emperor's request with "I don't wanna", and I'd have loved to see an original translation menu toggle.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ac-shadows-will-last-80-hours-with-side-content/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has been confirmed by the creative director of Assassin’s Creed Shadows that the game will last more than 80 hours if you’re pursuing all the side content available. The base campaign will last around 30 to 40 hours, depending on your playstyle, but that extra meat on the bones more than <strong>doubles </strong>what’s available.</p>



<p>This is a similar tactic employed in Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, which is the longest Assassin’s Creed game, thanks to the sheer amount of side activities and expansions. Those hoping for a slimmer experience akin to that found in 2023’s Assassin’s Creed Mirage are out of luck – but we kind of knew that.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-expansive">Expansive</h2>



<p>In an interview with Genki, Jonathan Dumont explained that Assassin’s Creed Shadows is nothing short of expansive.</p>



<p>If the campaign being 30 – 40 hours long wasn’t enough, the side content will bring up your total playtime to around 80 hours, depending on your style. If <strong>that </strong>wasn’t enough, the team at Ubisoft is also looking at adding New Game+ and ‘other modes’ based on post-launch feedback.</p>



<p>The full breakdown <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1896738405993865410" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">from Genki</a> on social media included several tidbits of information about the upcoming game, which launches later this month. The ‘vast, dynamic, breathing open world’ will be populated by recruitable characters, minigames, and dynamic world elements like a weather system and day-night cycle.</p>



<p>By all accounts, Assassin’s Creed Shadows seems like a solid title, but it’ll need to be something special to pull Ubisoft out of the rut it finds itself in. The game has proven to be a controversial one in the months leading up to its release, but Jonathan Dumont pointed out that the developers are more interested in ‘delivering an outstanding game.’</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-barber-mode/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kingdom-come-deliverance-2%E2%80%99s-barber-mode-update-detailed-in-livestream.1125612/</guid>

<p>Warhorse Studios recently hosted a livestream that touched on the future of Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. The game, which might be my GOTY, was released in February to an overwhelmingly positive reception, turning heads worldwide. Midway through March, the ‘Barber Mode’ will be added to the game in the first of a long list of major updates.</p>



<p>During the stream, the team at Warhorse Studios revealed some of the hairstyles and facial hair sets coming to Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 with the Barber Update, which doesn’t have a confirmed release date at present.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-changing-henry">Changing Henry</h2>



<p>Henry of Skalitz, the game’s protagonist, has aged since the first title, but he’s still a <strong>bit </strong>of a babyface. When the Barber Mode update arrives, that’ll change, as players will have the option to adorn the medieval adventurer in a beard and mullet if they so desire.</p>



<p>The full suite of beards, moustaches, goatees, and hairstyles was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/kingdomcome/comments/1izqgrp/kcd2_beardstyles_from_the_new_barber_update/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">captured by eagle-eyed users on Reddit</a>.</p>



<p>The team at Warhorse Studios also took time to dive into the ‘Hardcore Mode’ update that’s also on the horizon. Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 represents a realistic and challenging experience, but the Hardcore Mode will take things to the next level.</p>



<p>With this punishing setting enabled, players will lose most of their UI, enemies will be tougher, fast travel will be locked, and your position will never be shown on the map. It might be one of the most immersive ways to play the game, but it’s guaranteed to be stressful for even the most talented gamer.</p>



<p>The Barber Mode will be the first in a long line of releases coming to expand the world of Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. Last month, the team at Warhorse Studios revealed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-post-launch-roadmap/">three major DLCs</a> coming throughout the year.</p>



<p>Are you eager to change Henry’s look in KCD2 with the Barber Mode update? Let me know in the comments.</p>
