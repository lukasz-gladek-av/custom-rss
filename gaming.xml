            <p>Imagine Tetris but played in a bottomless ocean shaft, with linked tetronimoes serving to continue your journey down that shaft, providing you keep earning enough points to play them. This is <a href="https://fourquarters.itch.io/podvodsk">Podvodsk</a>, a free game jam experiment from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/loop-hero">Loop Hero</a> developers Four Quarters. </p>
<p>Not played Tetris? 1) you bloody liar, and 2) let me frame this differently, then. The idea here is that you're trying to construct a tapering underwater city out of random clumps of building blocks, dangled from the bottom of a miraculously unsinkable surface platform. Each building both costs points and also, earns points based on different scoring criteria, and every time you play a piece, the screen scrolls irreversibly downward.</p><!--more-->
<p>Residential blocks score points based on whether they're close to other types of building. Factory blocks like to be positioned up against the walls of the chasm, so they can mine for ore. Business centres prefer to be a few squares away from other building types - financial analysts do enjoy a bit of elbow room, especially when they're 300 fathoms under. Seaweed farms want to be close to seaweed, obviously, while scaffolding earns you nothing, but is cheap.</p>
<p>My favourite tiles are bunkers, which can be drilled into the rock, and score points based on the number of other, on-screen bunkers they're linked to. Getting a vertical streak of bunkers feels like the key to transforming a mere Aquarius Reef Base into a credible Rapture. Science centres, meanwhile, earn points every time the screen scrolls for as long as they're visible, so you'll want to park them as far down as possible. And city centres, finally, give you the next three buildings for free.</p>
<p>It might feel like there aren't enough building types, but the game squeezes some decent intricacy out of these variations, and the pixelart is quite tasty. The real limitation, perhaps, is that too much depends on luck of the draw. As such, Podvodsk is best played in Tactical Mode, which stores any building piece you don't play for one turn, and thus allows you to strategise a little - placing scaffolding at first to move your seaweed farm closer to a bountiful kelp forest.</p>
<p>The relationships between scoring criteria remind me of wooden token game <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/406660/seaside">Seaside</a>, except that Seaside sticks to the shore. If you're concerned about playing anything from a Russian developer, given the on-going invasion of Ukraine, it's worth noting that Four Quarters <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/russian-loop-hero-devs-tell-players-to-pirate-their-game-because-of-sanctions/">have publicly opposed the war</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/build-underwater-cities-out-of-tetris-pieces-in-podvodsk-a-game-jam-freebie-from-the-loop-hero-developers]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Ziff Davis-owned IGN Entertainment has laid off staff, including eight members of the IGN Creators Guild. Those cuts represent 12 percent of the bargaining unit. The layoffs are the latest shift in the turbulent gaming media landscape. Earlier this year, <em>Verge</em> parent company Vox Media <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659575/polygon-vox-media-sold-valnet-gamerant">sold <em>Polygon</em></a> to <em>GameRant</em> owner Valnet, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/664747/giant-bomb-independent-gaming-site-employee-owned"><em>Giant Bomb</em> went independent</a>, and <em>Game Informer</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/635915/game-informer-return-gunzilla-games">returned</a> after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/2/24212016/game-informer-shutting-down-layoffs-gamestop">being shut down by GameStop</a>. Last week, Ziff Davis also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/715220/ziff-davis-creators-guild-cnet-layoffs">laid off staff at CNET</a>.</p><p>Laid off IGN staffers include <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/lawoftd.bsky.social/post/3lvm53wqnck27">former senior features editor Matt Kim</a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/oswinstark.bsky.social/post/3lvm4tif6ms2f">video editor Chelsea Miller</a>, but no single department was primarily targeted by the cuts, Rebekah Valentine, IGN senior reporter and co-chair of the guild, tells <em>The Verge</em>. “It was largely single individuals from different departments.”</p><p>“The company has told us that the reason for this layoff stems from a Ziff Davis-mandate to cut costs despite several quarters in a row of year-over-year revenue increases, to which IGN Entertainment responded by coming for our members’ jobs,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ignunion.bsky.social/post/3lvm4rhup5k2a">the guild says</a>. “This is perplexing to us, as we are told again and again that IGN Entertainment has had a tremendously successful year thus far thanks to their hard work.”</p><p>An employee in the engineering department was also laid off, Hunter Paniagua, a representative of the Pacific Media Workers Guild, which represents the IGN Creators Guild, tells <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>Ziff Davis didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. Last year, across all of Ziff Davis, the company employed approximately 3,800 people, <a href="https://s205.q4cdn.com/689425761/files/doc_financials/2024/q4/5ea843d6-d06a-41b1-bac0-4bb45df94888.pdf">according to an SEC filing</a>.</p><p>Last year, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/21/24161718/ign-gamer-network-acquisition">IGN acquired</a> the website portfolio of Gamer Network, which includes publications like <em>Eurogamer,</em> <em>Gamesindustry.biz</em>, and <em>Rock Paper Shotgun</em>. Terms of that deal weren’t disclosed at the time.</p><p>“The company has not responded to the union’s questions about whether its budget for future acquisitions is being reconsidered as a cost-saving measure alongside these other apparently necessary personnel cuts,” the IGN Creators Guild says.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/718692/ign-entertainment-layoffs-creators-guild-ziff-davis]]></content:encoded>

These new Switch and Switch 2 versions will play just like the PS5, Xbox, and PC versions that launched last year, but will add support for motion controls for certain moves, such as Goku's Spirit Bomb ultimate attack. Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero will be available on Switch 2 and Switch in multiple versions, including a $60 physical standard edition and multiple digital editions that include tons of extra content, all of which are available to preorder now ahead of Sparking Zero's November 14 release date. Preordering any edition of the game on either of Nintendo's hybrid handhelds also unlocks several of the game's characters early.</p><h2>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero Preorder Bonus</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4542785-dbsparkingswitchpreorders.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542785" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4542785-dbsparkingswitchpreorders.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542785"></a><figcaption>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero Preorder Bonus</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4542785-dbsparkingswitchpreorders.jpg"></figure><p>If you preorder Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero on either Switch 2 or Switch, you'll get Goku's child form from the most recent Dragon Ball anime, Dragon Ball Daima, as a bonus playable character.

The original Switch version includes the full game data on the cart. It does not look like Bandai Namco is offering the option to upgrade from the Switch to Switch 2 edition. It's also uncertain how the game will perform on the original Switch, but Bandai Namco confirms that the more-powerful hardware of the Switch 2 will naturally offer better graphical power. </p></div>                      </div><h2>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero Digital Deluxe Edition (Switch 2 and Switch)</h2><h4>$90 | Releases November 14</h4><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4542903-deluxedbzero.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542903" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4542903-deluxedbzero.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542903"></a><figcaption>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero Digital Deluxe Edition</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4542903-deluxedbzero.jpg"></figure><p>Along with the physical standard edition, Sparking Zero will also get two digital-only Switch 2 and Switch versions that include additional content.

Developed by Arc System Works, the studio behind Guilty Gear, Dragon Ball FighterZ is a 2.5D tag-team fighting game with a roster of characters pulled from Dragon Ball Z, GT, and Super. However, it offers a more traditional fighting game compared to the three-dimensional action of Sparking Zero. You can pick it up for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dragon-Ball-Fighterz-PS5-PlayStation-5/dp/B07F2ZX3DN?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$25 at Amazon</a>.</p><p>For a story-focused single-player Dragon Ball experience, there's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dragon-Ball-Kakarot-Awakes-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B097FQM3QN?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Ball Kakarot</a>. The game retells the entire Dragon Ball Z story of Goku, but it adds an action-RPG flair with an enjoyable grind and skill customization as you explore the anime's iconic world. The game has also received several post-launch expansions that adapt other Dragon Ball storylines, including Dragon Ball Super and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dragon-Ball-Kakarot-Daima-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0DZQMPT6P?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Ball Daima</a>.

While it is an older game in the series, Xenoverse 2 has been supported constantly with new DLC over the years, and its roster is up to date with modern Dragon Ball media.</p><h2>More Dragon Ball Games on Switch</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dragon-Ball-Fighterz-PS5-PlayStation-5/dp/B07F2ZX3DN?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Ball FighterZ</a> -- $25</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dragon-Ball-Kakarot-Awakes-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B097FQM3QN?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Ball Kakarot</a> -- $32.45</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dragon-Ball-Kakarot-Daima-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0DZQMPT6P?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Ball Kakarot: Daima Edition</a> -- $50</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dragon-Ball-Xenoverse-2-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B01N1034HX?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2</a> -- $25 (<strike>$30</strike>)</li></ul><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-lorcana-tcg-reign-of-jafar-palace-heist-cooperative-game-is-steeply-discounted/1100-6531334/">Disney Lorcana TCG Palace Heist Solo And Co-Op Game Is Steeply Discounted</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-evo-2025-accessory-sale-ps5-dualsense-edge-controller-deals/1100-6531846/">PlayStation Evo 2025 Sale Features Rare Deals On DualSense Edge &amp; Pulse Headset</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-book-series-andrzej-sapkowski-box-set-deals-novel-reading-order/1100-6532972/">The Witcher 5-Novel Box Set On Sale For Just $33 At Amazon</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rds-game-traveler-deluxe-nintendo-switch-2-carrying-cases/1100-6532022/">Amazon Restocks The $40 Licensed Alternative To Switch 2 All-In-One Case</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-nintendo-switch-2-console-and-game-restocks/1100-6532451/">Nintendo Switch 2 At Amazon - Console Restocks, Every Accessory You Can Buy, And More</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/god-of-war-20th-anniversary-retrospective-box-set-gets-nice-discount/1100-6530148/">God Of War 20th Anniversary Retrospective Box Set Gets Nice Discount</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lord-of-the-rings-tolkien-illustrated-book-is-only-30-at-amazon-right-now/1100-6533080/">Lord Of The Rings Tolkien Illustrated Book Is Only $30 At Amazon Right Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/berserk-anime-blu-ray-best-amazon-deals/1100-6524954/">Berserk's Best Anime Adaptation Gets Limited-Time Price Cut At Amazon</a></li>   </ul> </div>

</span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>WWE has never felt more out of touch. In its Netflix documentary <em>WWE Unreal</em>, which was intended to give a hammed-up look inside the company, WWE’s head honcho Paul “Triple H” Levesque, talked about meeting and subverting fans’ expectations like he was a modern-day Machiavelli. The toothless series only really succeeded in demonstrating how disconnected the company is from reality, especially coming after the John Cena heel-turn disaster.</p><p>A heel turn in wrestling is when a good guy wrestler becomes a bad guy wrestler. Wrestlers do it all the time, signaling a paradigm shift in their gimmicks and their relationship with the audience. In all of Cena’s two decades with WWE he has never turned heel. WWE never turned Cena heel when his “Super Cena” persona, which had squash match victories against younger talent, turned him into a pseudo-bad-guy for fans who wanted to see another wrestler get a shot at the top of the mountain. Sure, he’s broken the fourth wall joking about turning heel, but for decades, wrestling’s Superman never wavered.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Bray Wyatt tells the story of how John Cena helped create The Fiend | WWE ON FOX" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ljMgmMvkKZs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The closest thing the WWE universe got to seeing a Cena heel turn was when the <a href="https://kotaku.com/wwe-bray-wyatt-died-the-fiend-wyatt-family-cause-death-1850774254" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">late-Bray Wyatt</a> had a cinematic match with him, where he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFnX1xj-sss&amp;pp=ygUUY2VuYSBicmF5IHd5YXR0IHd3ZSA%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">psychologically broke down Cena’s facade in a nightmare sequence</a>, jabbing at his insecurities as the company’s main guy. With Cena announcing his <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/john-cena-announces-wwe-retirement-in-2025-wrestlemania-41-will-be-his-last-wrestlemania" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">retirement tour from wrestling last year</a>, fans were resigned to the fact that the unwritten rule of wrestling—John Cena will never turn heel—would remain.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="John Cena Details Plans For His Heel Turn In 2012" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yabyTd2cTgQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Until, at the close of Elimination Chamber back in March, it finally happened.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="FULL SEGMENT: John Cena SELLS OUT and ruthlessly assaults Cody Rhodes: Elimination Chamber 2025" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mS8W6NY6QjQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Cena’s heel turn was a shocking moment in wrestling, and rife with diminishing returns. Despite big marquee matches against new company man Cody Rhodes, Cena running it back with longtime rivals Randy Orton and CM Punk, and an awkward little one-off with Cena super-fan R-Truth, heel Cena was abysmal. His matches, save for his match against CM Punk, ended in uninspired, cheating finishes without much wrestling work to compensate for their deflating endings. Adding to the stench of failure: <a href="https://www.cagesideseats.com/wwe/2025/6/27/24457179/cm-punk-saudi-arabia-apology-miz-tweet-blood-money-wwe-night-of-champions-cena" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cena vs CM Punk happened in Saudi Arabia</a>.</p><p>Cena’s gift of gab couldn’t save him from turning the ship around. Rather than give an inspired reason for turning evil, Cena did the thing most “just put the fries in the bag, bro” heels do: blame the fans.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="FULL SEGMENT: John Cena TRASHES the WWE Universe until Cody Rhodes fires back: Raw, March 17, 2025" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ExQYm6gintE?start=1004&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>His promos became repetitive, vapid, and whiny. They lacked the heat, positive or negative, to make him feel like a big deal. They ended up more like an awkward segment that fans were forced to watch out of nostalgia, or on the off-chance he’d somehow manage to surprise them. Like rubbernecking at a 21-car pile-up, a happy ending never came.&nbsp;</p><p>It was a stunt with added pressure because it was marketed alongside Cena’s retirement from wrestling. This farewell tour was further soured by appearances by Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, known for vanity projects and <a href="https://variety.com/2023/film/news/dwayne-johnson-dc-exit-black-adam-superman-failed-plan-1235478867/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">meddling in all things involving a creative, collaborative process</a>, and rapper <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/25165999-rock-talks-travis-scotts-involvement-john-cenas-heel-turn-possible-wwe-match" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Travis Scott’s pivotal involvement in Cena’s monumental heel turn</a>.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="FULL SEGMENT: The real John Cena returned in face-off with Cody Rhodes: SmackDown, Aug. 1, 2025" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1r2r37vaA0g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>WWE wound up reversing course for SummerSlam. Suddenly Cena turned face two days before his SummerSlam rematch with the new-blood face of the company, Cody Rhodes. In an impassioned dual promo-off, Cena turned off his dour, milquetoast, “the fans are fickle and no one cared about me succeeding” charisma vacuum shtick he’d been perpetuating throughout his disastrous heel run and returned to his high-energy, crowd-gesticulating self, saying he’d give Cody “the real John Cena” in his rematch. And that he did. They had arguably Cena’s best modern-day bout since his face-off against AJ Styles, with all the pageantry and physically impressive and emotionally resonant ring work in a long while.&nbsp;</p><p>But of course, as extra baggage to WWE’s shitty booking with Cena’s farewell tour, SummerSlam couldn’t just end with Cena waving goodbye to fans after. Following Cena’s loss and the torch passing to Rhodes, WWE fans were greeted with a bizarre shock return by Brock Lesnar, a wrestler rumored to have been on <a href="https://www.si.com/fannation/wrestling/wwe/daniel-cormier-claims-brock-lesnar-on-wwe-tko-banned-list" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the company’s banned list</a> after being listed in active litigation in disgraced former CEO <a href="https://kotaku.com/wwe-vince-mcmahon-stephanie-mcmahon-nick-khan-john-laur-1849079202" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vince McMahon</a>’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6105612/2025/02/01/brock-lesnar-wwe-lawsuit-vince-mcmahon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sex trafficking lawsuit</a> by former employee Janel Grant.&nbsp;</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/wwe-appoints-vince-mcmahons-daughter-as-interim-ceo-amid-probe-11655467082" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Wall Street Journal</a>, the lawsuit accused McMahon of <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/vince-mcmahon-accused-of-sex-trafficking-by-wwe-staffer-he-paid-to-keep-quiet-0b19b21c?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAhFLTjUtLvg_2Y0CuoIDeTcx701_qzkT_b92lYWtJ1Bv9KAhn5vAArDkAghb0Q%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68901ff3&amp;gaa_sig=w_Wg8RAUGXE0P_TGdbpJ5ke6NgtfxaKU4XWctlfDlAQtEyOeY5Pa7cHwfwIRpU_ulsvZh4cELFi--c9KdXz76w%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sex trafficking and pressuring Grant to have sex with other men at WWE</a>. During this media shitstorm, McMahon bowed out of the company in 2022 after an investigation of an <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/wwe-appoints-vince-mcmahons-daughter-as-interim-ceo-amid-probe-11655467082" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alleged affair and hush money payout with numerous WWE employees</a>, totalling at <a href="https://kotaku.com/vince-mcmahon-wwe-investigation-sex-affair-hush-money-1849157420" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$12 million</a>. Bizarrely, he returned to the company to oversee WWE’s transition into a Saudi Arabia-owned sports entertainment company, <a href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/wwe-ufc-deal-closes-tko-group-1235719908/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TKO</a>, alongside UFC, and subsequently <a href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/vince-mcmahon-wwe-board-members-return-1235480703/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fired some WWE board members</a>. Vince was then ousted (kind of) from the company once more, selling some of his shares in TKO.&nbsp;</p><p>All this added a special stink to the entire affair: Cena’s farewell tour, his heel turn, his sudden face turn all paled in comparison to bringing a man implicated in an active sex trafficking trial back into the fold of the company.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="'Thank You For This Honor': Wrestler Triple H Praises Trump After Being Named To Council On Sports" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D75Mftn9izQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>In a SummerSlam post-show segment, Levesque praised himself and the impressive work he and his writers do. He described how they juggle the ongoing WWE storylines and explained how their latest twist in the never-ending wrestling saga, and Cena's final act, came about. He characterized the decision as something Cena wanted to do before retiring. Instead of taking all the credit, Levesque said Lesnar’s return was fulfilling Cena’s wishlist of opponents to face before leaving, stating, “It’s him writing the last chapter in his book.”&nbsp;</p><p>“My reaction was exactly what I thought it was going to be; if there had been a roof on this place, it wouldn’t be there anymore. The dynamic in the room changes when The Beast is here. Seeing Brock Lesnar come back…anything you thought was happening sort of all goes out the window because the factor of Brock now just changes that dynamic so incredibly,” Levesque said while interrupted by fans chanting “We want Brock.”&nbsp;</p><p>“Incredible to have him back,” Levesque said.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="SummerSlam Sunday Post-Show: August 3, 2025" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NlSGvD1h_CM?start=3571&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>That Levesque and Cena had such a tone-deaf attitude isn’t surprising, given how willfully ignorant they’ve been about the elephant in the room—McMahon’s fall from grace and WWE’s cozying up to the president (and <a href="https://www.wwe.com/superstars/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WWE Hall of Famer</a>) Trump. Recently, <a href="https://www.fightful.com/wrestling/john-cena-i-love-vince-i-m-not-downplaying-allegations-any-kind-when-i-love-somebody-i-love-them/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cena reiterated his unwavering love for McMahon</a> despite his alleged crimes. Similarly, <a href="https://wrestletalk.com/news/triple-h-wwe-vince-mcmahon-allegations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Levesque has dodged questions about McMahon</a>—leaving <a href="https://www.fightful.com/wrestling/cody-rhodes-comments-vince-mcmahon-netflix-documentary-and-janel-grant-allegations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rhodes to vaguely fill in</a>. What Levesque (and WWE by extension) hasn’t been shy about is their support for Trump, calling him “<a href="https://www.cagesideseats.com/wwe/2025/8/2/24479499/triple-h-says-vince-mcmahon-sex-abuse-allegations-separate-wwe-creative-calls-donald-trump-genius" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the most intuitive people</a>” he’s ever met. Additionally, in a <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/roman-reignss-quest-to-be-wwes-next-great-crossover-star" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vanity Fair</a> interview, Roman Reigns, cousin of The Rock and another key wrestler in the company, expressed his support for Trump despite being a registered Democrat.</p><p>“I support our president. Trump is one of those guys where he’s got a vast history and a huge background,” Reigns told Vanity Fair (whatever that means). “He’s been in entertainment. He’s been in big business, politics. At this point, I’m supporting a bright future for our country. Positive and competent leadership. For us to be what we’re supposed to be—to be a world leader and carry that respect and do what a world power like us should be doing."</p><p>WWE has also noticeably stopped celebrating holidays like <a href="https://whatculture.com/wwe/wwe-just-ignored-black-history-month" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black History Month</a> and Pride Month, <a href="https://www.f4wonline.com/profiles/wwe-releases-2025-superstars-fired/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">while</a> laying off many wrestlers, including <a href="https://www.pride.com/wwe-sonya-devilles-contract-not-renewed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">many of its openly queer talent.</a> Meanwhile, their programming has increasingly aligned with UFC and resembles a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/gallery/president-trump-attends-ufc-316/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">glorified Republican National Convention</a> by adopting MAGA themes. For example, a white wrestler named Chad Gable adopts a luchador gimmick called “<a href="https://www.wwe.com/superstars/el-grande-americano" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grande Americano</a>”—a nod to <a href="https://www.bodyslam.net/2022/12/11/hulk-hogan-discusses-his-mr-america-gimmick/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hogan’s disguised “Mr. America” gimmick</a>. One of the most baffling aspects of this gimmick is the use of <a href="https://cultaholic.com/posts/wwe-criticised-for-allegedly-using-ai-to-create-el-grande-americano-raw-video-package" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI in his entrance video</a> ($8 billion company, by the way) and his claim to hail from “<a href="https://wrestletalk.com/news/wwe-el-grande-americano-character-change/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Gulf of America</a>.”&nbsp;</p><p>Right now, things are worse than they’ve ever been on the WWE side of the squared circle. And the latest development in Cena’s retirement tour booking is, unfortunately, yet another poor mark on an already tumultuous journey of trying to send off the company’s it-guy.</p><p>Although heel Cena vowed that he’d “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOeOYrhZkDU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ruin professional wrestling</a>,” it never actually happened in a conscious, kayfabe way. Regardless, WWE has undoubtedly tarnished this man’s legacy by making his farewell tour one of the worst series of booking spectacles in wrestling, and he deserves better.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ign-layoffs-ziff-davis"><h3>IGN Lays Off 8 Staff, 12% Of Union</h3></a><p>The layoffs follow wider cuts at Ziff Davis, buyouts, and layoffs and departures at acquired sites</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/gabe-newell-oceano-yacht-steam-valve"><h3>Gabe Newell Bought A Yacht Company</h3></a><p>Valve's head honcho is now in the big boat business</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-chris-plante-sandwich-post-games"><h3>You Have To Hear Chris Plante’s Sandwich Story</h3></a><p>"It’s somehow getting on us, but we’re so happy that we’re not gonna die"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/death-stranding-2-covid-lockdown-hideo-kojima"><h3>Death Stranding 2 Is A Joyful, Absurd Response To COVID</h3></a><p>Goofy, lighthearted, constantly mugging: Death Stranding 2: On The Beach is an exercise in spectacle, a rumination on lockdown, and one of the most human games Kojima has made in years</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/harry-potter-jk-rowling-cge-codenames-board-game"><h3>Board Game Company Fucks Around (Announcing A New Harry Potter Game), Finds Out (When Fans Revolt And Media Announce Boycotts)</h3></a><p>'It’s a product to sell to people who prioritise their nostalgia for children’s fantasy over the culture their trans friends and family live in'</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/john-cena-heel-turn-summerslam-wwe-wrestling]]></content:encoded>

Instead, Newell is acquiring Oceanco, the yacht-building company that’s creating his <a href="https://luxurylaunches.com/transport/gabe-newell-upcoming-superyacht-09012025.php">$400 million super ship</a>, as reported <a href="https://www.boatinternational.com/boat-pro/news/oceanco-yacht-builder-sold-to-gabe-newell">earlier by <em>Boat International</em></a>.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.oceancoyacht.com/new-chapter-gabe-newell/">a post about the change</a>, Oceanco says Newell’s interest in the brand comes from a “lifelong fascination with the sea” and “a deep respect for the people who live and work on it.” Oceanco is based in the Netherlands, and it has changed leadership a few times since its founding in 1987, with private investor Mohammed Al Barwani <a href="https://www.boatinternational.com/yacht-market-intelligence/brokerage-sales-news/superyacht-builder-oceanco-under-new-ownership--4673">helming the company</a> for the past 15 years before Newell came along.</p><p>Along with Newell’s 364-foot-long superyacht, Oceanco developed Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’ <a href="https://www.boatinternational.com/yachts/news/jeff-bezos-koru-yacht-best-pics">$500 million sailing yacht, Koru</a>, which stretches 417 feet long. It’s also behind <a href="https://www.superyachtfan.com/yacht/kaos/">the Kaos sailing superyacht</a> owned by Walmart heir Nancy Walton Laurie, as well as <a href="https://www.superyachtfan.com/yacht/bravo-eugenia/">the Bravo Eugenia</a>, owned by Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones.</p><p>Newell has a growing fleet of yachts as well, including the <a href="https://luxurylaunches.com/transport/gabe-newell-tranquility-superyacht-to-be-upgraded.php">Oceanco-built Draak</a> (formerly called the Tranquility) and <a href="https://luxurylaunches.com/transport/gabe-newell-rocinante-superyacht-10092024.php">the Rocinante superyacht</a>, built by German yacht-maker Lürssen.</p><p>As for what Newell plans to do now that he’s the head of a big superyacht builder, Oceanco puts it pretty simply: “His first decision? Leave the team alone. Seriously. Oceanco has vision and integrity, and a culture that actually works. Gabe doesn’t want to fix it, he wants to fuel it.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTE2"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Emma Roth</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/718639/gabe-newell-valve-superyacht-oceanco]]></content:encoded>

              <p>You didn’t have to watch the <em>Fatal Fury</em> finals bracket at Evo 2025 to see Kazuyuki “KojiKOG” Koji writhing around onstage in front of thousands. The moment instantly went viral online. It’s already been memed to South Town and back again. But there was more to KojiKOG’s Greek-tragedy-worthy theatrics than just performing for the camera.</p> <p>KojiKOG’s epic semifinals defeat was delivered at the hands of Goichi “GO1” Kishida, who eventually went on to win the entire tournament. The former was playing Billy while the latter rolled Kain, both considered S-tier fighters in the current meta since <em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</em> launched earlier this year. But KojiKOG was immediately up against the ropes, unable to break out of GO1’s combos. He quickly lost the first round but found a couple of openings in the second. Twice KojiKOG almost reversed fate, getting GO1 down to within a sliver of his health before ultimately failing to finish him off.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="FATAL FURY: CotW ⭐ GO1 (KAIN) vs KOJI KOG (BILLY) ⭐ EVO 2025 COTW Top 8" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dJDRnkm9Qck?start=289&amp;feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>The entire semifinal lasted less than five minutes, but KojiKOG howling in dismay at his defeat lasted nearly 60 seconds. While GO1 giggled, shrugged, and eventually tried to comfort his rival, people watching at home instantly began clipping the moment and sharing it around online. It was a perfect encapsulation not only of the stakes of that specific match but of the inner screaming we’ve all felt any time we’ve tried our best and still been found wanting.</p>

The two fighting game pros met in finals during an Evo 2015 side tournament for the 2D anime fighter <em>Aquapazza</em> as well.

This time, of course, there was a lot more money and bragging rights on the line. GO1’s wins last night eventually netted him an extra $10,000 in prize pool money. He’ll also be in pole position for the $2.5 million <em>Fatal Fury</em> prize pool at the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fighters/comments/1mfct3j/snk_announces_snk_world_championship_2025_%E3%83%BC_41/">SNK World Championship in November</a> (brought to you by Saudi Arabia’s human rights violation slush fund).</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">youtubeに動画をアップしました。</p> <p>10年ぶりに足を切断されてしまう小路KOG vs GO1 EVO2025<a href="https://t.co/sQTu3yb2xJ">https://t.co/sQTu3yb2xJ</a> <a href="https://t.co/DyPHT39YUu">pic.twitter.com/DyPHT39YUu</a></p> <p>— 小路ＫＯＧ (@kkkog) <a href="https://twitter.com/kkkog/status/1952342197220593705?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 4, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“KOG, who had his leg amputated after 10 years, vs GO1 EVO2025,” KojiKOG <a href="https://x.com/kkkog/status/1952342197220593705">posted on X</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Priorities Fourth Wing Edition releases on October 1.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Empyrean book series has reached epic levels of popularity. Rebecca Yarros has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-fourth-wing-books-are-dominating-amazons-kindle-best-sellers-list-in-2025-so-far">been dominating the romantasy genre</a> since Fourth Wing first came out and the trend has only continued with the release of the third installment, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/onyx-storm-release-date-and-where-to-buy">Onyx Storm</a>, earlier this year. And now that these books have reached new heights in popularity, the first ever board game collaboration is on its way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hasbro just recently announced that a Fourth Wing version of Priorities and it's set to release on October 1, 2025. If you're not familiar with <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/345056/priorities" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Priorities</a>, it's a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-parties-and-large-groups">party game</a> that has been around since 2020 that has players rank five cards based on whatever criteria they wish. The Fourth Wing version is exactly the same, but with moments, characters, and events from the books. You can preorder the new game at Amazon, Barnes &amp; Noble, or Target ahead of its release.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Preorder Priorites Fourth Wing Edition</h2><div catalogid="521a78c3-8198-4e25-a921-ab2ef5f6881b" id="226367"><div id="226367" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3> Priorities Fourth Wing Edition Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Like I mentioned above, the game is fairly simple. There's a huge stack of cards featuring things from the books and players pull five cards and rank them from best to worst. Since it's a Fourth Wing Edition of the game, there is one Wingleader and the rest of the players are part of the Iron Squad. If the squad is able to guess correctly how the Wingleader ranked a card then the team wins that card. If they don't, then the game wins it. Each card has a letter on the back, and If the players are able to spell out PRIORITIES before the game is able to, everyone wins. This is a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">cooperative game</a>, so everyone in the squad is in this together.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As someone who has read all of these books, I definitely wouldn't advise playing this game with a group who has <em>not</em> read them. It's meant for three or more players and you'll want to make sure everyone involved has read at least Fourth Wing before you start playing. Since all of the cards are based on characters and scenes from the books, it would be rather difficult for someone to just jump in and start guessing a Wingleader's priorities without knowing who Jack Barlowe is, for example. Where I think this type of game makes the most sense is for a book club, or a book party for when the next installment in the series arrives.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">When is the fourth novel in the Empyrean series coming out?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're thinking it would be fun to pick up this card game ahead of the next book's release, you likely still have plenty of time. Onyx Storm just recently came out back in February this year and the fourth book isn't coming out any time soon. The Goodreads page had listed a release date of January 2026 for the next title, but Rebecca Yarros took to Instagram to clarify that that is <a href="https://screenrant.com/fourth-wing-next-book-release-rumor-shut-down-rebecca-yarros/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in no way happening</a>. Yarros previously had fairly short gap between Fourth Wing and Iron Flame, but took a bit longer for Onyx Storm. With that in mind, we likely won't see the next book until 2027 or later.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The good news is, there is more Fourth Wing content on the way outside of books and board games. Prime Video currently has a <a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/tv-shows/fourth-wing-tv-show/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fourth Wing TV series in the works</a> that will bring Yarros' work to the screen. Unfortunately, we do not yet have a release date for that either.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Aug 4, 2025 4:59 pm</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-fourth-wing-board-game-was-just-announced-based-on-rebecca-yarros-empyrean-series]]></content:encoded>

Now, Larian Studios is sharing some of the rare choices and other stats that it has compiled from players' choices during the last two years.</p><p>Only 2.07% of all players managed to beat 20 opponents while drunk, and 1.82% of players earned 100 gold from performing music. Larian posted several <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/538860954058754131" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">infographics on the Steam page</a> for Baldur's Gate 3, including the fact that 3.87% of players beat Gortash in Wyrm's Rock without activating any traps. And half a million players have completed the game in Honor mode, compared to 1.1 million players who beat the game in Tactician mode. Out of the Honor mode players, only 4,647 players beat it with a level 1 character.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4542896-baldursgate3infographic.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542896" data-ratio="1" data-width="1080" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4542896-baldursgate3infographic.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542896"></a><figcaption>If it's a popularity contest, Shadowheart has already won.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4542896-baldursgate3infographic.jpg"></figure><p>When it came time to pick the most-respecced companions, the outcome wasn't a surprise. Shadowheart led the way with 4,890,005 players, who were apparently evenly split between using her as a Life Cleric or a Death Cleric. Wyll was the second-most respecced companion with 1,417,506 players, while Gale finished in third with 684,454 players.</p><p>For some truly obscure choices, only 350 players respecced Minsc into a Death Domain Cleric, and there were 598 players who adopted a child with Wyll. According to Larian, the studio is also going to expand the official toolkit for mods.

            <p>A group of QA workers at Call Of Duty studio Raven Software have officially signed off on their first union contract with parent company Microsoft and COD publisher Activision-Blizzard, in the run-up to the launch of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call Of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>. The contract is the result of years of negotiations, and offers some protection against the treatment of QA workers as disposable staff - hired to quash bugs shortly before release and laid off soon afterwards, with minimal odds of personal development or progression to other roles.</p><!--more-->
<p>According to a release from the Game Workers Alliance-CWA - who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/raven-software-qa-staff-win-their-fight-for-union-vote">won the right to unionise in 2022</a> against the backdrop of Microsoft's efforts to buy Activision-Blizzard - the contract includes stipulations for the "elimination of crunch time", though "containment" is perhaps the more appropriate term. Managers will have to supply seven days notice of mandatory overtime, and give employees flexibility over scheduling. There will be "no excessive overtime on back-to-back weeks", or "mandatory overtime of any duration for the majority of weeks in a quarter".</p>
<p>The contract also includes "a guaranteed 10-percent wage increase over two years with additional raises through merit and promotions, after going 18 months without wage increases and 45 months without promotions". It makes provision for more "defined" job descriptions and a more transparent promotion process, together with "expanded disability accommodations, and layoff protections including severance, recall rights, generous COBRA subsidies, and career transition services." As <a href="https://shannonliao.substack.com/p/3-years-later-they-won">separately reported</a> by Shannon Liao, the contract gives most of the QA team's 19, Wisconsin-based workers permission to permanently work from home.</p>
<p>"How do you progress within QA? How do you get promoted? How do you get a raise?" Autumn Prazuch, a Raven Software QA tester and bargaining member, told Liao. "For so long we haven't had those [answers], to be able to curate them with the company and come to an agreement... that I think is our crowning achievement, the thing that I'm most proud of."</p>
<p>Again, all this is the result of much hard wrangling with the big M, A and B. Last September, Nic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/from-blizzard-to-bethesda-game-unions-are-sweeping-the-industry-heres-how-the-cwa-helps-make-them-happen">interviewed CWA members</a> about different approaches to unionisation and how employers may try to thwart it.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-qa-staff-secure-union-contract-with-microsoft-to-stop-them-being-treated-like-cannon-fodder]]></content:encoded>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-people-behind-the-system-shock-remake-are-ready-to-1833549854">Nightdive Studios</a>, the team behind some of the best remastered video games released in the last decade, is currently selling a bunch of their games for less than usual on Steam.</p> <p>Starting today, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nightdivepublishersale2025">Nightdive has discounted most of its remasters and remakes on PC for a limited time</a>.

Heck, all three of the classic N64-era <em>Turok</em> games are on sale. Nightdive’s remastered versions of these popular shooters are easily the best way to play the trilogy, offering plenty of visual options and quality of life tweaks. I would also recommend grabbing <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/best-star-wars-game-dark-forces-fps-remaster-ps5-xbox-1851294048">Star Wars: Dark Forces Remastered</a>,</em> as it is an incredible way to revisit one of the best <em>Star Wars</em> games ever made.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Advancing through the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grounded-2/" data-ref-id="5000-681580">Grounded 2</a> campaign will eventually task you with hacking two O.R.C. transmitters. These transmitters can be tricky to reach, especially if you don't have the right gear to tackle their locations. In this guide, we'll show you how to reach the O.R.C. transmitters you need to hack in the Signals and Stashes mission.</p><p dir="ltr">The transmitters are located at the Trash Can and Picnic Table points of interest, and you'll find the guide for both below. Each location has O.R.C. enemies (the bugs with purple glowing receiver devices) you might need to fight off, so you'll want to be prepared with your weapon of choice and some bandages. You'll also get an additional side objective for each O.R.C. transmitter you hack, and we'll discuss those locations as well.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_to_reach_the_Picnic_Table_O_R_C__transmitter">How to reach the Picnic Table O.R.C. transmitter</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542861-picnictablemaplocation2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542861" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542861-picnictablemaplocation2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542861"></a><figcaption>Picnic Table POI location</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542861-picnictablemaplocation2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Picnic Table POI is located just north of the Snackbar, as shown in the image above. This is the area of the map with the red and white-checkered tablecloth.</p><p dir="ltr">Before venturing to the Picnic Table, you'll want to make sure you're geared up to combat the game's chill effect. You'll be navigating through a cooler, and you'll freeze without some sort of protection. It's best to have armor that helps protect against cold or at least a few pieces of spicy candy.</p><p dir="ltr">For the cold-resistant gear, you'll want at least the Mitey Muffs headpiece and the Fuzzy Mukluks. These are the earliest options available to you.</p><p dir="ltr">The Mitey Muffs require:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">5- Mite Fuzz</li><li dir="ltr">5 - Grub Hide</li></ul><p dir="ltr">The Fuzzy Mukluks require:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">3 - Bee Fuzz</li><li dir="ltr">2 - Bug Rubber</li><li dir="ltr">3 - Lingonberry Leather</li><li dir="ltr">2- Silk Rope</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542865-picnictablepath.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542865" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542865-picnictablepath.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542865"></a><figcaption>Follow up this side of the tablecloth</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542865-picnictablepath.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Once you're geared up for the cold, head to the Picnic Table location on the map. You'll want to walk or ride your buggy up the red and white-checkered tablecloth. You'll have a few enemies to fight along the way, including mites and spiders.</p><p dir="ltr">The very top of the tablecloth is blocked off, so eventually you'll need to go another way to reach the top of the table. You'll notice there's a gap you need to cross to continue along the path.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542864-picnictabletableclothtunnel.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542864" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542864-picnictabletableclothtunnel.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542864"></a><figcaption>Tablecloth tunnel</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542864-picnictabletableclothtunnel.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The safest way to cross over is to slip under the tunnel created by the cloth, and you'll fight a few spiders here as well. This will lead you to a wooden beam you can cross to reach the other side of the table. Several roach nymphs are scurrying around this new area, but you can ignore them. They won't fight unless you instigate it.</p><p dir="ltr">Your objective marker will point you to the entrance for a cooler. This is an outdoor cooler for drinks, and it's ice cold inside. You'll want to make sure you have your outdoor gear equipped or spicy candy ready.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542868-orcpicnictable.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542868" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542868-orcpicnictable.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542868"></a><figcaption>Transmitter on top of Picnic Table</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542868-orcpicnictable.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Navigate through the passageway inside the cooler, and you'll finally reach the top of the picnic table. Here you'll see the O.R.C. transmitter and need to interact with it to hack it. Of course, you'll need to fight off O.R.C. ladybugs and possibly spiders in order to reach it.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_to_defeat_the_O_R_C__soldiers_by_the_pines">How to defeat the O.R.C. soldiers by the pines</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542873-orcpinehilllocationonmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542873" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542873-orcpinehilllocationonmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542873"></a><figcaption>Red arrow marks the O.R.C. Pine Hill location</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542873-orcpinehilllocationonmap.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Hacking the Picnic Table transmitter will update your objective to "find and defeat the O.R.C soldiers by the Pines." This isn't too hard to complete. An objective marker should lead you into the Pines section of the map, where you'll find spiders and Lingonberries growing. However, this objective marker was not showing for me, so if this is also the case for you, the area is found near the Ranger Outpost: Pine Hill. Just head to the path on the left side of the outpost entrance.</p><p dir="ltr">This leads you to an area where you'll need to fight off Orb Weaver O.R.C. enemies and hack another transmitter. Spears and daggers can work well here. This isn't terribly difficult, but make sure you have bandages just in case.</p><p dir="ltr">It's also worth harvesting the Lingonberries while you're there. These are an important resource, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-find-and-use-lingonberries-and-blueberries-for-leather-in-grounded-2/1100-6533438/" data-ref-id="1100-6533438">Lingonberry leather</a> is needed in several crucial crafting recipes.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_to_reach_the_Garbage_Can_O_R_C__transmitter">How to reach the Garbage Can O.R.C. transmitter</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542875-garbagecanpoilocation.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542875" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542875-garbagecanpoilocation.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542875"></a><figcaption>Garbage Can O.R.C. transmitter location on map</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542875-garbagecanpoilocation.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">To reach the Garbage Can, you'll first need to get some gear to help you survive the area's toxic gas. I recommended a gas mask for the garbage can area. You can use the Gastro Goo smoothies, but these have such a limited time of effect. Either way, you'll need to kill a stinkbug to craft what you need. I'd also recommended collecting a few dandelion tufts. It's really easy to fall when navigating the top of the garbage can.</p><p dir="ltr">The gas mask requires:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">1 - Weevil Nose</li><li dir="ltr">4 - Gnat Fuzz</li><li dir="ltr">2 - Crude Rope</li><li dir="ltr">1 - Stinkbug Part</li></ul><p dir="ltr">The Gasto Goo smoothie requires:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">1 - Stinkbug Gas Sack</li><li dir="ltr">1 - Roach Chunk</li><li dir="ltr">1 - Aphid Honeydew</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Once you're prepared to survive the gas, head on over to the Garbage Can POI marked on the image above. This location is best navigated with the Red Soldier Ant buggy.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542877-garabagecanreachingthecan.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542877" data-ratio="0.56283783783784" data-width="1480" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542877-garabagecanreachingthecan.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542877"></a><figcaption>Climb the Garbage Can POI here</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542877-garabagecanreachingthecan.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">You'll want to circle around the can until you find the ledge near it. From here, you can jump onto a small branch growing into the side of the garbage can. Then, jump onto a banana. While standing on the banana, turn around and jump on the white, plastic spork. You'll continue to follow this narrow path around the can, working your way up by navigating limbs and ropes until you reach the top.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542878-garbagecannavigatingbranch.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542878" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542878-garbagecannavigatingbranch.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542878"></a><figcaption>Navigating the branches around Garbage Can POI</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542878-garbagecannavigatingbranch.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">You'll see the O.R.C. transmitter at the very top of the trash pile. You can potentially sneak up here without enemies spotting you, or you might get caught battling an O.R.C cockroach. Either way, you need to survive and interact with the device to hack it.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_to_defeat_the_O_R_C__soldiers_by_the_pond">How to defeat the O.R.C. soldiers by the pond</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542881-blueberrymaplocationmarked.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542881" data-ratio="0.56283783783784" data-width="1480" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542881-blueberrymaplocationmarked.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542881"></a><figcaption>Location for O.R.C soldiers by the pond</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542881-blueberrymaplocationmarked.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Hacking the Garbage Can transmitter will update your objective to "find and defeat the O.R.C soldiers by the pond." This isn't too hard to complete. The object marker leads you to a section of the map filled with berry bushes.</p><p dir="ltr">The berries are guarded by O.R.C. bees, so you want to be prepared to fight and kill them. Using a bow and arrow can be useful here for fighting at range. You'll also want some bandages. All you technically need to do is take out the O.R.C. bees, but it's worth sticking around to also harvest the blueberries.</p><p dir="ltr">Blueberries are an important resource, as blueberry leather is needed in several crucial crafting recipes.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Battlefield 6 - Official Multiplayer Gameplay Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Another producer, David Sirland, said the studio spent a lot of time thinking about the core pillars of Battlefield--destruction, classes, and vehicles--and designing Battlefield 6 in service to those.</p><p>Christofi said it was important to define what Battlefield's core tenets were and Sirland said it was also important to nail down what they are not.</p><p>"We needed to define that clearly, because that guides us for a long time, like 10-plus years, or whatever. It should be that stringent. Sure, you can amend it and change it, but everyone on the team should be able to feel that and be like, 'Okay, I know what we're doing,'" he said. "So, when I get a new idea, does it fit? Yes, cool. It's not like it tells exactly what to do, but it should tell you the lane to stay within. I think that is what's needed. Because I think that maybe, if anything, for 2042, that wasn't super clear, right, especially not over time. It was more of a reaction to something that didn’t work and we changed it as fast as possible."</p><p>In 2022, DICE general manager Rebecka Coutaz reacted to Battlefield 2042's poor launch, saying, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-2042-studio-gm-responds-to-poor-launch-everybody-was-disappointed/1100-6504812/" data-ref-id="1100-6504812">"Everybody was disappointed."</a> Following the game's release. DICE shuffled its top leaders, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-franchise-undergoes-major-shake-up/1100-6498521/" data-ref-id="1100-6498521">former GM Oskar Gabrielson leaving the studio and other major changes in a big shakeup.</a></p><p>EA also created a new label, Battlefield Studios, to oversee the development of the brand. DICE, Criterion, Ripple Effect, and Motive all work under Battlefield Studios. The former general manager of Call of Duty--Byron Beede--is now the general manager of Battlefield. The future of Battlefield is also being developed under the leadership of EA executive Vince Zampella, a former Call of Duty boss as well.</p><p>So far, EA appears to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-could-be-the-successor-to-battlefield-3-4-the-series-needs/1100-6533646/" data-ref-id="1100-6533646">saying and doing the right things with Battlefield 6</a> to help win fans back, but only time will tell if the game can stick the landing and find a place in an ultra-competitive marketplace. Beyond Battlefield 6's multiplayer and campaign, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-battle-royale-release-date-trailer-details/1100-6533631/" data-ref-id="1100-6533631">new battle royale experience is in the works as well.</a></p><p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-release-date-time/1100-6533515/" data-ref-id="1100-6533515">Battlefield 6 open beta</a> begins August 7 for a limited group of people before expanding more widely later in August. The full game, meanwhile, launches October 10 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gabe-newell-bought-a-yacht-company.1261881/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As you all know, it’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/moby-dick-marathon-mystic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Boat Day</a> on Aftermath, which gives rise to an obvious question: What’s Gabe Newell up to? The sea-loving founder of <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/valves-reported-profit-per-head-from-steam-commissions-is-out-there-and-at-usd3-5-million-per-employee-it-makes-apple-and-facebook-look-like-a-lemonade-stand/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the most insanely profitable companies ever</a> recently described himself as <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/gabe-newells-daily-routine-is-get-up-work-go-scuba-diving-says-hes-been-retired-for-a-long-time-but-works-7-days-a-week-the-things-i-get-to-do-every-day-are-super-awesome/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">effectively retired</a> despite still working all the time and noted that scuba diving is part of his daily routine. He also owns <a href="https://luxurylaunches.com/transport/gabe-newell-luxury-yachts.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an armada of yachts</a> worth roughly $1 billion. And so, to put as fine a point on it as humanly possible, he recently bought a yacht company.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.boatinternational.com/boat-pro/news/oceanco-yacht-builder-sold-to-gabe-newell" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Boat International</a>, a publication whose name I cannot help but laugh at, reports that Newell purchased <a href="https://www.oceancoyacht.com/new-chapter-gabe-newell/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Oceano</a>, one of the world’s leading builders of custom superyachts. In an accompanying press release, Oceano assured its ultra-wealthy clientele that despite a new captain taking the wheel, it’s going to keep building incredibly large boats.</p><p>“Gabe Newell is not entering this world as a financier or a strategist, but as a hands-on visionary who respects the sea, the craft, and above all, the people who make it possible,” Oceano <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/a-new-chapter-for-oceanco-new-shareholder-gabe-newell-302517592.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>. “He wants Oceanco to continue on what it already does best: placing people first. This is not about buying a yacht company. It's about plugging into a team and exploring what kind of future they can create when nothing holds them back.”</p><p>This is important, because rich people fucking love big boats. As the rich have gotten richer over the course of the past few decades, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/oct/09/superyachts-and-bragging-rights-why-the-super-rich-love-their-floating-homes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">yacht collecting has become a pastime</a> for those who believe themselves both inheritors of the Earth and also entirely bereft of responsibility to its environment or people. In part, it’s a simple matter of social status: What better way to flaunt your wealth to both your peers and the local peasants than a towering sea city from which you can descend at will, like God delivering an edict? What could feel better, if you’re a wealth-drunk sociopath whose brain is shrinking by the day, than hearing that your friend built an 80-meter yacht and replying “Well fuck you, mine is gonna be 85 meters”?&nbsp;</p><p>But of course, rich people wouldn’t be <em>spending </em>sums from their ill-gotten dragon hoards unless there was some kind of society-immiserating loophole for them to exploit. As <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-rich-people-buy-yachts-jets-taking-loans-against-them-2022-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider explains</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Borrowing against yachts or jets at the point of purchase — or shortly after — means customers can put up little to no cash to close the deals. Depending on the desirability of the asset, banks extend loans from half to nearly 100% of its value. Borrowers can either draw on another line of credit, pledge more collateral, or use cash to cover the rest of the purchase. For rich individuals whose assets are tied up in stock, real estate, and other assets subject to capital gains taxes, the move is a no-brainer. In California, for instance,&nbsp;capital gains taxes can total nearly 40%, whereas interest rates are near historic lows.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>In other words, rich people aren’t spending much on these <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/dec/11/megayachts-environment-carbon-emissions-ban" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">planet-sickening</a> bathtub toys, but money is changing hands nonetheless. The big boat business is booming, and Gabe Newell – a big boat connoisseur – has decided to gamble some of his untold billions on what is, in all likelihood, a pretty safe bet.&nbsp;</p><p>But hey, at least good guy Gabe is chill about AI, right? <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/ai/gabe-newell-says-young-people-need-to-use-ai-tools-to-get-off-to-the-races-rather-than-reading-articles-on-variety-to-try-to-understand-what-its-impact-is-going-to-be/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ah, well.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-the-kotaku-review-1850883627"><em>Starfield</em></a> and <em>Deus Ex</em> voice actor Elias Toufexis has a very simple message to anyone thinking of using AI-powered mods to add characters he has played to other games: Don’t do that, actually. It’s a topic the actor has spoken about before, and one he is extremely passionate about.</p> <p>In early July, a user on Twitter posted that people should download a mod that replaces the main character’s voice in<em> Cyberpunk 2077</em> with that of Adam Jensen, the protagonist of the two most recent&nbsp;<em>Deus Ex&nbsp;</em>games, using AI. They also suggested customizing the main character to look like the <em>Deus Ex</em> character. They claimed that if you took these steps, it would turn CD Projekt Red’s 2020 open-world RPG into a “pretty convincing” <em>Deus Ex</em> game. A month later, on August 2, this tweet came to the attention of Jensen’s voice actor, Toufexis, and he had a simple, clear reply to this idea: “<a href="https://x.com/EliasToufexis/status/1951794192512061695?">No. Do not fucking do that</a>.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">No. Do not fucking do that. <a href="https://t.co/vQolcAP3Tg">https://t.co/vQolcAP3Tg</a></p> <p>— Elias Toufexis (@EliasToufexis) <a href="https://twitter.com/EliasToufexis/status/1951794192512061695?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>When another Twitter user asked Toufexis, who voiced Sam Cole in 2023’s <em>Starfield</em>, why they shouldn’t use the AI mod to add Jensen to <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, the voice actor replied: <a href="https://x.com/EliasToufexis/status/1951804424252441040">“You going to pay me for using my voice?”</a></p>

 <p>The voice replacement mod for <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>&nbsp;mentioned in the original tweet was uploaded to the internet in October 2023. Its creator states that they mean no disrespect to Toufexis and claims that if the voice actor ever reached out to them and demanded it be removed, the modder would comply. “I would never want someone to feel like I’m robbing them of their right to own and dictate when or how their voice is to be used,” <a href="https://schaken-mods.com/forums/topic/153170-adam-jensen-as-v-ai-voice-over/#:~:text=I%20would%20never%20want%20someone%20to%20feel%20like%20I%27m%20robbing%20them%20of%20their%20right%20to%20own%20and%20dictate%20when%20or%20how%20their%20voice%20is%20to%20be%20used.">explained the modder</a>. It’s not clear if Toufexis has reached out to the modder yet.</p> <p>Adam Jensen appeared in <a href="https://kotaku.com/deus-ex-mankind-divided-the-kotaku-review-1785610152">2011’s<em> Deus Ex: Human Revolution</em> and its 2016 sequel, </a><em>Mankind Divided. </em>The brooding cyborg badass became famous for his raspy, deep voice and has remained a fan favorite. Toufexis loves talking about the character, so much so that <a href="https://kotaku.com/deus-ex-3-adam-jensen-actor-stop-talking-sequel-eidos-1851252201">he was told to stop by series developers Edios Montreal in 2020</a>. In 2024, a new, unannounced <em>Deus Ex</em> game was <a href="https://kotaku.com/embracer-group-deus-ex-cancelled-eidos-montreal-layoffs-1851205890">reportedly canceled</a> by Embracer Group.</p> <p>This is far from the first time Toufexis has spoken about AI generation tools being used to replace voice actors. <a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-sam-coe-voice-actor-romance-elias-toufexis-1850826699">In a 2023 interview with <em>Kotaku</em></a>, Jensen’s iconic voice actor called AI a “tool that steals from other people’s work.”</p>

 <p>“I honestly feel that AI cannot replace real actors in the long run,” said Toufexis. “But it can take away a whole slew of jobs that normally go to actors. Big roles like Sam [from <em>Starfield</em>] are probably safe. AI is just a tool that steals from other people’s work and tries to create reality. But it’s not reality, and I believe people will know the difference and want the real thing. But it may take some time. I look at it like NFTs or 3D TVs. There will be a little while where people fool around with the new tech, but eventually they’ll realize how fake it is.”</p> <p>He also explained that if he catches people using AI to recreate his voice for profit or promotion, he’ll ask them to stop. If they do, that will be the end of it. However, if they continue, he’ll go after them, telling <em>Kotaku</em> in 2023: “We have to protect actors from replacement. It’s a dangerous slope. If my voice can be replaced, that is almost literally leading to taking food out of my kids’ mouths. This is a huge part of my livelihood.”</p>

                <p>In the wake of the official <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remaster-surprise-launches-today-on-game-pass/1100-6530669/" data-ref-id="1100-6530669">Oblivion Remastered's release</a>, the developers behind Skylivion are making clear that their ambitious mod over 10 years in the making is far more than just a graphics update: It "reimagines Oblivion from the ground up."</p><p dir="ltr">Skyblivion looks to recreate the 2006 open-world RPG in the engine of 2011's Skyrim, albeit with new content and gameplay changes. The mod is still slated to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-skyblivion-mod-to-release-by-2025/1100-6510685/" data-ref-id="1100-6510685">release in 2025</a>, and in the latest development diary for the project, the TESRenewal mod team behind Skyblivion answers the question that has been top of mind since Oblivion Remastered released in April--what's the point of Skyblivion when the official remaster is already available?</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MH-BqXk2WA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3MH-BqXk2WA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"The answer is simple," the dev diary states. "Skyblivion is a full-scale remake that reimagines Oblivion from the ground up, bringing it in line with modern RPG standards. While the official remaster impressively upgrades textures and assets, Skyblivion introduces entirely newly designed areas, dungeons, cities, gameplay enhancements, and much more."</p><p dir="ltr">Far from just Oblivion running in a new engine, the devs state that "every fort, home, cave, and landscape has been thoughtfully redesigned."</p><p dir="ltr">"We've infused this sort of creative detail to breathe new life into a beloved classic--one that is nearly two decades old," the dev diary states.</p><p dir="ltr">The rest of the dev diary provides ample evidence to back up the team's "full-scale remake" claims, as it highlights how it remade the city of Anvil to feature a large harbor and is introducing a new Oblivion biome to make closing Oblivion gates "less repetitive and monotonous."</p><p dir="ltr">An overhaul to the original game's "unique" items also coming with Skyblivion. The devs note how in the original game, most unique items were unique in "name only" and were largely just modified versions of existing items recolored with a slight stat boost. In Skylivion, unique items will be "truly unique," with updated appearances and, in the case of many unique weapons, new attack animations to help players "diversify" their playstyle.</p><p dir="ltr">Previous <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ambitious-elder-scrolls-skyblivion-mod-shows-off-20-minutes-of-quest-gameplay/1100-6525882/" data-ref-id="1100-6525882">Skyblivion updates</a> outlined how it will include new quests, monsters, a reimagined lockpicking minigame, and even new music, as well as updates to the game's menus and UI.</p><p dir="ltr">Skyblivion doesn't have specific release date, but the dev diary states the team is "confident" it will meet its goal of releasing this year. The mod will be free to download for those who own both Skyrim: Special Edition and Oblivion: GOTY Deluxe on PC.</p><p dir="ltr">"We're excited to show off more soon and get Skyblivion into your hands, but we've still got work to do in finalizing key areas and giving Skyblivion proper quality and assurance to make sure we all get the game fans deserve," the video concludes.</p><p dir="ltr">In light of Oblivion Remastered's reveal, Skyblivion's project lead said the release of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ahead-of-official-oblivion-remastered-release-skyblivion-mod-dev-says-its-a-win-win/1100-6530951/" data-ref-id="1100-6530951">remaster was a "win-win" for the community</a>. Bethesda later gifted <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesda-gave-oblivion-remastered-keys-to-the-entire-skyblivion-remake-team/1100-6531035/" data-ref-id="1100-6531035">copies of Oblivion Remastered to the entire Skyblivion</a> mod team.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Battlefield 6 - Official Multiplayer Gameplay Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Portal was introduced in Battlefield 2042 as a means to allow players to create and customize their own gametypes with custom rules and settings. In Battlefield 6, it goes further and allows players to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-portal-map-creator-makes-it-easier-than-ever-to-design-and-play/1100-6533609/" data-ref-id="1100-6533609">make their own maps.</a></p><p>The nice thing about a server browser, fans say, is that it allows players the freedom to choose to play whatever they want, on any map they want, in a region near them with an ideal ping. While there may not be a server browser for official servers in Battlefield 6, it's likely fans will do the work themselves and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1metpxq/no_server_browser_for_official_servers_so_its/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">create copies of the official servers</a>. That may not be an ideal experience, however.</p><p>Battlefield 6 producer Alexia Christofi addressed the fan discussion about server browsers, asking people to send in feedback as to why an official server browser is so important to them. Responses <a href="https://x.com/Lex_mate/status/1951863732260286563" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">flooded in</a>, and Christofi highlighted the key takeaways.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/Lex_mate/status/1951898821539017159" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Feels like your most important things are:<br>- persistent servers<br>- a sense of community and a way to play together<br>- being able to choose specific maps/modes<br>- being able to filter by ping/server fullness <br>- support for low pop regions<br>More to share on this in future. But.. (1/3) <a href="https://t.co/PWqUIz7GHe" rel="nofollow ">https://t.co/PWqUIz7GHe</a></p>  — Alexia Christofi (@Lex_mate) <a href="https://twitter.com/Lex_mate/status/1951898821539017159?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 3, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Christofi went on to say that Battlefield 6's server browser, via Portal, does in fact "answer all these wants." Christofi acknowledged, "Yes, it's via Portal and shows only community experiences," but pointed out that players can earn full XP gains with these modes and they will be promoted "front and center" in Battlefield 6's main menu.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/Lex_mate/status/1951898828669395394" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Again, more to share on this in the future - but seeing all your replies I think what we have caters to the majority of use cases.

Would somebody just let him make some new music quickly, please, for crying out loud!</p>
<p>Tanaka, who you might know as the composer behind soundtracks for the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/super_mario_land">Super Mario Land</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/metroid">Metroid</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/kid_icarus">Kid Icarus</a> and the Game Boy version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/tetris">Tetris</a>, to name just a few things he's got on the old CV. He worked on the soundtracks for both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/mother_3">Mother</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/earthbound">EarthBound</a>. Oh, and he also played a key role in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poca-is-a-game-boy-camera-photobook-adventure-and-a-heartfelt-homage-to-hip-tanaka">creating and designing the Game Boy</a>. So, yeah, he's kind of a big deal.</p>
<p>Mr Tanaka, who was in-house with Nintendo working on music all through the 8- and 16-bit eras, left the company and ended up as President of Creatures Inc after his work on the <strong>Pokémon</strong> anime became a conflict of interest for Nintendo.</p>
<p>And so it's delightful to hear, and doubly so given that Chip's work has shifted away from music somewhat since the move from Nintendo, that he's all in on returning to it. Speaking to VGC, when asked if he'd be into making another videogame soundtrack, he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Actually, if somebody came up to me and said ‘hey, do you want to make music for a game?’ I’d say ‘yeah, sure, sounds like fun...There’s a studio called 17-Bit making a game called <strong>Awaysis</strong>, created by a guy called Jake (Kazdal), and I actually made a track for that game. I’m not the only person making music for that game, there’s a bunch of us, but I created a track for it, and I’m playing it tomorrow.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When then asked if he'd prefer to make single tracks or a full soundtrack, the musical maestro responded that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Actually, to correct that [previous answer], I didn’t just do one song for Awaysis, I’m doing 70-80% of the game...But I think, for me, I spent my 20s to around 40 or so just making game music, and since then I’ve spent about 20 years where I haven’t really made any, so it’s kind of (about) getting back into it right now."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tanaka also confirmed that he actually composed a track for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> saying, <em>“So if anybody comes up to me and says ‘hey, can you do this’, I’d be like ‘yes, I’d love to’.</em> Now, let's check out Mr Tanaka's contribution to Street Fighter 6, 'Glorious Match'!</p>

<hr>
<p><em>So, who's gonna give the man a job writing a new soundtrack? Let us know your thoughts!</em></p></section>

                <p>Pac-Man made the jump to 3D way back in 1999 with Pac-Man World, which earned solid reviews and went on to become something of a cult classic. It would later earn a remake, Pac-Man World Re-Pac, in 2022. A similar thing is now happening with the original game's sequel, Pac-Man World 2. The 3D platformer launched for PS2, GameCube, and Xbox in 2002, and more than two decades later, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FK7YV5RB,B0FK8D2W2C,B0FK7ZW7F3,B0FK7Z44K4&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pac-Man World 2 Re-Pac</a> is bringing it to a whole new audience with new features, enhanced graphics, and voice acting. Preorders are open ahead of its September 26 release on PS5, Xbox, Switch 2, Switch, and PC, with two options available: a $30 standard edition and a $40 Digital Deluxe Edition. Preordering the game early also gets you a few bonuses.</p><h2>Pac-Man World 2 Re-Pac Preorder Bonuses</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4542148-81qrqftm7pl._sl1500.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542148" data-ratio="0.56266666666667" data-width="1500" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4542148-81qrqftm7pl._sl1500.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542148"></a><figcaption>Pac-Man World 2 Re-Pac Preorder Bonuses</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4542148-81qrqftm7pl._sl1500.jpg"></figure><p>Preorder any version of Pac-Man World 2 Re-Pac, and you'll get four Team Ghost Costumes and four Team Ghost Figures.

            <p>
As Steam and Itch.io continued to grapple with recent pressure by payment processors to withdraw NSFW games from their platforms, Mastercard has moved to distance itself from the ensuing censorship controversy, insisting it has not "required restrictions of any" game. But Valve says otherwise, pointing to a Mastercard rule saying the company can refuse to process anything it believes 'reflects negatively' on its brand.
</p>
<p>
Last month, Valve <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-introduces-vague-new-rules-banning-certain-kinds-of-adult-content-to-appease-credit-card-companies">introduced vague new guidelines</a> preventing "certain types of adult content" from being distributed on Steam, later confirming it had begun "retiring" certain adult games that "may violate the rules and standards set forth by our payment processors and their related card networks and banks". Shortly after, indie-focused digital distribution platform Itch.io <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/itchio-deindexes-all-nsfw-games-blames-same-anti-porn-group-that-campaigned-against-steam">began 'deindexing' all NSFW games</a>, blaming the same anti-porn group - Australia-based Collective Shout - that had pressured Visa, Mastercard, and PayPal into targeting Steam. In both cases, Itch.io and Valve noted the support of payment processors was essential to the ongoing operation of their platforms.
</p>
<p>
Plenty has happened since then; Itch.io has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/itch-begins-re-indexing-free-adult-nsfw-content-as-it-seeks-alternative-payment-processors">begun reindexing free NSFW games</a> and confirmed it's looking to partner with a payment processor comfortable with adult material, while other parts of the games industry - including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-offers-13-free-nsfw-games-as-it-launches-anti-censorship-campaign-freedomtobuygames">rival storefront GOG with its FreedomToBuy campaign</a> - have spoken out against game censorship. But amid all this, Mastercard is now attempting to distance itself from recent events, denying it put pressure on Itch.io and Valve to remove games from their platforms. In a <a href="https://www.mastercard.com/us/en/news-and-trends/press/2025/august/clarifying-recent-headlines-on-gaming-content.html">statement shared on its website,</a> the credit card company insisted it had "not evaluated any game or required restrictions of any activity on game creator sites and platforms, contrary to media reports and allegations."
</p>
<p>
"Our payment network follows standards based on the rule of law," it continued. "Put simply, we allow all lawful purchases on our network. At the same time, we require merchants to have appropriate controls to ensure Mastercard cards cannot be used for unlawful purchases, including illegal adult content."

<p>
However, Valve claims otherwise, saying that while Mastercard didn't directly pressure it to remove adult content from Steam, the credit card company instead "communicated with payment processors and their acquiring banks", and these, in turn, contacted Valve.
</p>
<p>
"Mastercard did not communicate with Valve directly, despite our request to do so," the Steam operator wrote in a <a href="https://kotaku.com/mastercard-denies-pressuring-steam-to-censor-nsfw-games-2000614393">statement shared with Kotaku over the weekend</a>. "Mastercard communicated with payment processors and their acquiring banks. Payment processors communicated this with Valve, and we replied by outlining <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-backs-away-from-content-policing-says-it-will-allow-everything-on-steam">Steam's policy since 2018</a> of attempting to distribute games that are legal for distribution. Payment processors rejected this, and specifically cited Mastercard's Rule 5.12.7 and risk to the Mastercard brand."
</p>
<p>
Mastercard's <a href="https://www.mastercard.us/content/dam/public/mastercardcom/na/global-site/documents/mastercard-rules.pdf">Rule 5.12.7</a> prohibits transactions that are illegal or that "in the sole discretion of the Corporation, may damage the goodwill of the Corporation or reflect negatively on the Marks." The first part is easy to define - Mastercard says the sale of "products or services other than [those] in full compliance with law" violates its terms - but the second is more open-ended, giving the company potentially limitless freedom to define what is and isn't acceptable. It can then either fine, audit, or withdraw services for violations.
</p>
<p>
This latter clause prohibits "the sale of a product or service, including an image, which is patently offensive and lacks serious artistic value (such as, by way of example and not limitation, images of nonconsensual sexual behavior, sexual exploitation of a minor, nonconsensual mutilation of a person or body part, and bestiality)", but also "any other material that the Corporation deems unacceptable to sell in connection with a Mark."
</p>
<p>
As the events at Steam and Itch.io have continued to unfold, industry figures and representative bodies have spoken out against payment processor overreach. The International Game Developer Association <a href="https://igda.org/news-archive/press-release-statement-on-game-delistings/">recently showed its support</a> for games depicting "consensual adult content", pushing back against "financial institutions... influencing which stories can be told and sold in games, with minimal transparency or public accountability". But with adult content increasingly under fire - as more countries begin drafting legislation such as the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-online-safety-act-explainer">UK's controversial Online Safety Act</a> - the adult games industry may have a difficult road ahead.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Over the weekend at GenCon, Wizards of the Coast dropped new information on their upcoming <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> Forgotten Realms supplements. They outlined what players can expect when returning to the most iconic setting in the enduring fantasy TTRPG.</p>

<h2>The Dungeons &amp; Dragons Forgotten Realms Supplement Preview</h2>

<p>As archived in a post on <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/2032-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-new" rel="nofollow">D&amp;D Beyond</a>, Wizards of the Coast has announced that the new <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Forgotten Realms supplement will be broken up into two books: <em>Forgotten Realms: Heroes of Faerun</em> and <em>Forgotten Realms: Adventures in Faerun</em>. Both of these supplements are for <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-player-handbook-review-mixed-messaging-around-strong" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024</a>, also referred to as 5.5 Edition by the community.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dungeons-dragons-forgotten-realms-monster-artwork.jpg?itok=koCdasu7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dungeons-dragons-forgotten-realms-monster-artwork.jpg?itok=L06_98P8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><em>Forgotten Realms: Heroes of Faerun</em> focuses entirely on player options. The book will include information on regional factions like The Harpers and the Zhentarim, an overview of various locales for player backstories, and a bunch of new backgrounds feats, and subclasses like the Bladesinger Wizard and the Scion of the Three Rogue. The subclasses are notable since they appeared in <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/latest-dungeons-dragons-2024-unearthed-arcana-revisits-arcane-subclasses" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Unearthed Arcana</a> back in June.</p>

<p>Curiously, this new book includes a new mechanic called Circle Magic. The overview is brief, referring to it as "cooperative casting magic," but it does invite speculation.</p>

<p>The second <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Forgotten Realms book, Forgotten Realms: Adventures in Faerun, is all about DM materials. It will contain over 50 prewritten adventures for levels 1-15, five gazetteers on key areas of Faerun like Icewind Dale or Baldur's Gate, over 50 quickplay maps, new monster and villain statblocks, and new magic items and bastions.</p>

<p>Wizards of the Coast has also included some digital exclusives with these books. Three digital supplements are being sold at an MSRP of $14.99. <em>Astarion's Book of Hungers</em>, which will include vampiric rules, an updated Dhampir player option, and a prewritten adventure featuring the titular vampire from <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/baldurs-gate-3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></a>.</p>

The details on the third book are yet to be announced.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Forgotten Realms books are available for pre-order. Both <em>Heroes of Faerun</em> and <em>Adventures in Faerun</em> are available in physical (MSRP $49.99), digital (MSRP $29.99) and physical and digital (MSRP $ 59.99) bundles. In addition, there is an Ultimate Bundle that includes digital and physical copies of both books, the digital expansions, and digital dice and maps for D&amp;D Beyond (MSRP $159.99).</p>

<p>The books are expected to release November 11.</p>

<p><i>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4</i> features a handful of secret characters to unlock. Some are immediately available to buy in the Secret Shop, like Michelangelo and <a href="https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-bam-margera-how-to-unlock-easy-fast-tip-guide-1851785804">Bam Margera</a>. Others are only added to the shop once you’ve completed a hidden objective. One of the most difficult to unlock is the fan-favorite Officer Dick, who is lovingly portrayed by Jack Black for the second time.</p> <p>You’ll need to explore the deep corners of each level before this skater can be added to your roster. Using <a href="https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-photo-mode-option-tool-tony-hawks-pro-skater-1851786140">Photo Mode</a> to scour the map can help, but this guide will save you a lot more time.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000614521" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614521"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614521">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><b>To unlock Officer Dick, you’ll need to collect the hidden Panda plush in each level.</b> These can be harder to find than most Secret Tapes, since the latter has the benefit of being a giant floating item that’s highlighted to boot.</p> <p>Once you’ve collected them all, a familiar-looking skater named Constable Richard will be added to the Secret Shop for $5,000. Pay up the cash to unlock him and an alternate outfit with his iconic Officer Dick look.</p> <p>Let’s dive into where each plushie is located. We’re going in order from the first map of the third game to the last new map for the fourth game.</p> <h3><span id="foundry"></span>Foundry<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614522" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614522"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614522">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Head to the other side of the map from where you start. Build up some speed and jump off the half pipe here to catch a grind on the upper level. Hop off the edge and go to the leftmost corner to find the plush.</p> <h3><span id="canada"></span>Canada<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614523" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614523"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614523">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Turn around and go towards the giant tree surrounded by half pipes. On the other side of these and right next to the tree is the plush.</p> <h3><span id="rio"></span>Rio<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614524" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614524"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614524">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>You want to turn right as soon as you can and head to the closest corner of the map. There will be a small opening with a fountain, and the plush can be seen directly across from it in the bushes.</p> <h3><span id="suburbia"></span>Suburbia<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614525" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614525"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614525">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>This requires access to the haunted house that opens up after helping the Thin Man. Transfer over to the half-pipe-filled backyard and then reach the area behind the tree in the corner to get the plush.</p> <h3><span id="airport"></span>Airport<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614526" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614526"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614526">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Rush through the map until you get to the flight terminals. Go left to the C2 terminal that’s meant for Tokyo flights. Skate up the ramp in front and try to land behind the three monitors to easily access this plush.</p> <h3><span id="skater-island"></span>Skater Island<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614527" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614527"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614527">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Exit the building and head towards the overturned boat on your left. The plush will be found sitting on the other side of it.</p> <h3><span id="los-angeles"></span>Los Angeles<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614528" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614528"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614528">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Skate down the road to your right and then barrel through the fountain building’s glass windows. Transfer over the watery half pipe in front of you and venture into either hole to acquire this plush. If all you see are grates, you need to trigger the “They’re Grate” gap by grinding the rails nearby.</p> <h3><span id="tokyo"></span>Tokyo<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614529" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614529"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614529">©Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>The Panda is located in the hidden left area of the map, which you can access after grinding the top levels of the left side and collapsing the giant circle advertisement. Technically, the plush is directly beneath you in this new area. Jump off and venture towards either side to grind the edges of their half pipes. A separate path can be grinded close to the plush, but you’ll zoom past. I could only reach this one by awkwardly jumping towards it.</p> <h3><span id="cruise-ship"></span>Cruise Ship<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614530" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614530"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614530">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Turn right from the start and hop down to the lower level of the cruise ship. The plush is well-hidden up in the planters on the left side. Grind the rails above to reach them.</p> <h3><span id="college"></span>College<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614531" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614531"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614531">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>From the start, head left and grind up the barrier arm that leads up to the parking garage’s second level. Turn around and jump between the college-decorated wires, the purple rail on the right, and finally the roof of the white building ahead to collect this level’s plush.</p> <h3><span id="san-francisco"></span>San Francisco<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614533" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614533"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614533">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Turn left and keep skating until you reach the Pier 12 building. Make a big jump to reach its roof, where you can find the plush in front of a pink dog graffiti.</p> <h3><span id="movie-studio"></span>Movie Studio<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614534" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614534"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614534">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Start moving forward and transfer off the half pipes to the left. Jump into the green bowl with the spaceship prop above it, and then cross the tied rope in the corner. The plush is sitting a little to the right, so you might need to fling yourself to collect it.</p> <h3><span id="alcatraz"></span>Alcatraz<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614535" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614535"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614535">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>You’ll need to head to the rooftops for this one. Once you’re up there, skate up the ramp leading to a red pipe and grind it around the old water tower and down the wire leading to a silo. Jump off the wire and try to land on the small walkway to reach the plush.</p> <h3><span id="water-park"></span>Water Park<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614536" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614536"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614536">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Jump off to the right as soon as you can and skate around until you reach a wooden ramp and a gigantic red bucket. Just beneath the wooden ramp and to the right is a small platform with the plush.</p> <h3><span id="kona"></span>Kona<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614539" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614539"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614539">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>The starting position for this map changes, so I suggest finding the corner with the long, windy grey ramps. Follow the wooden fence perimeter until you see a blue dumpster next to a red half pipe. You can find the plush next to the former.</p> <h3><span id="shipyard"></span>Shipyard<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614540" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614540"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614540">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Go forward and then move between the buildings to the left. Enter the open warehouse on the left side to reach the rooftop. Jump to the adjacent roof and then jump to the grated walkway on the right. Hop over the small half pipe and then jump onto the walkway of the nearby rusted building. The plush is sitting on the other side.</p> <h3><span id="london"></span>London<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614541" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614541"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614541">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Go forward and approach where the blue van is for Stompy the Elephant. Turn left instead and descend into a small parking garage. The blue sports car is pointing directly toward some trash and the small plush.</p> <h3><span id="zoo"></span>Zoo<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614542" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614542"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614542">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Skate down the ramp and turn right. Keep on going until you reach the Lion’s area, which you’ll want to grind the top of. On the left side will be a small platform for the plush.</p> <h3><span id="pinball"></span>Pinball<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614543" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614543"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614543">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Go down the ramp and take either rail across. Slow down and climb on the brown bolted-on bar on the left side. Position yourself with lots of room, because you need to climb up this wall. This is done by executing a wallride and then immediately jumping to grind the edge at the top and then hopping off before your skater zooms off. The only thing up here is the final plush, which will unlock Constable Richard in the Secret Shop.</p> <hr> <p><i>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4</i> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, and Windows PCs.</p>
