			<p>At Gamescom 2024, Techland surprised everyone by announcing <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-showcased-at-gamescom-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dying Light: The Beast</a>, a standalone game in which Kyle Crane, the protagonist of the first game, returns.</p>
<p>Fans were waiting for the second Dying Light 2 DLC, which was originally slated for 2023 but got delayed. The studio has instead pivoted to focus on The Beast for reasons that were thoroughly explained in the below group interview I had with the team, which also featured Kyle Crane voice actor Roger Craig Smith in addition to Franchise Director Tymon Smetkala and Art Director Katarzyna Tarnacka.</p>
<p>Dying Light: The Beast doesn't have a release date yet, but it will be available on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series S|X. It's important to note that it will be free to owners of the Ultimate Edition of Dying Light 2 to compensate them for the lack of a second DLC. Moreover, it will support co-op just like the previous installment.</p>

<p><strong>I know the game started as the second Dying Light 2 DLC, right?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smektala:</strong> Yes, but also, actually, not really. We were working on the DLC, and last year, we experienced a leak for the narrative. So, a lot of very important elements of the story have been leaked out, and we were wondering how we could deal with this. We could ignore it, but then I think it would be ruined for a lot of players, actually, the most dedicated ones, because if you are a dedicated fan, you follow all the leaks, you learn about them, and it's kind of hard to unsee what you have already seen.</p>
<p>We came to this dilemma, and we started discussing this. We spent about a week internally talking about what we could do with this. Out of those conversations, the idea came that we could ask Roger Craig Smith to return as Kyle Crane.</p>
<p>That was the trigger, the moment where we actually stopped thinking about DLC and started thinking about it as a completely new product, the return of Kyle Crane, because many people from the studio world have worked on previous games with him. It got us really energetic and inspired, so we came up with new ideas on what we could do with the character, the story, and the world. I think the best way to describe it is that over those two weeks, the game exploded. It was like DLC, but then suddenly, it became something else and much, much, much bigger, and that's how Dying Light: The Beast was born.</p>
<p><strong>You had to change the narrative because of that leak.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smektala: </strong>Yeah, but it was not just that. Saying we had to change the narrative doesn't really explain the process. It was the beginning of the process. But then we said, hey, actually, we are making a new game. All of the ideas, all of the energy, all of the creativity that has happened because of this trigger, because of that change, we looked at it, and we said, hey, we have about 18 hours of gameplay, we have sets of new game mechanics, a new skill tree for the main character, we have a new main character - even if he's returning, he's new in a way - we have a great story that refers to the first game and the second game and tries to connect them together and answer some questions in both of them.</p>
<p>We have mechanics like vehicles, a new multilayered environment with lots of things to discover, and lots of secrets. At that point, it was a completely different project and game.</p>
<p><strong>Was the Castor Woods region the same when you still planned this to be the second Dying Light 2 DLC?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smektala: </strong>Kind of. It's a version of it. The name was the same, but the geometry and elements were different. Roughly, yes, we have built this on some elements of the previous map, but again, it's evolved, grown, and received a lot more love.</p>
<p><strong>Where is Castor Woods located compared to the two places seen in the previous games?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smektala: </strong>I think it's definitely closer to Villador. Generally, Dying Light: The Beast takes place after the events of Dying Light 2, but to be honest, we don't really focus that much on making sure that it's placed somewhere in the world. What we want to do is we don't want to recreate a very specific place.</p>
<p>Why? Because if you live in that place, if you know that place, you basically know the game, right? We are trying to build a fictional space that makes sense for our game and for our narrative, but it's just inspired by various things from a specific area. In this sense, Castor Woods is closer to Villador because both share a lot of European inspirations.</p>
<p><strong>You said that it's set after the second game, right? Can you say how long after?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smektala: </strong>Quite soon. I would say it happens right after the events of the Dying Light 2.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Dying Light 2: The Beast happens quite soon. I would say it happens right after the events of the Dying Light 2.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Are there any characters coming back from DL2?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smektala: </strong>I don't want to spoil it because this would spoil the story, but as I said, it answers questions from the first game and the second game. But I think the most important thing is that Kyle Crane returns in the form and voice embodied by Roger Craig Smith. This is a big deal for us because actually having Roger in the game and on the project really changed things for us. It's an absolutely amazing thing for us, and I think it's worth using the fact that we have the actor here, so you can maybe ask him something.</p>
<p><strong>Roger Craig Smith:</strong> He said it all. The most important thing is that Kyle Crane is back.</p>
<p><strong>What was it like to return after I don't know how many years from the first one?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smektala: </strong>Dying Light will celebrate its tenth anniversary next year, so as humans, we have been working on the game since 10 years ago. However, in terms of Kyle Crane as a character, I think the best way to frame it in the worldbuilding timeline is that it happens after the events of Dying Light 2, and Kyle Crane has been a subject of very brutal experiments for many, many years before that.</p>
<p><strong>How did the fact that your character was experimented on and imprisoned for so many years inform your performance and the narrative as a whole?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Roger Craig Smith:</strong>&nbsp; That's been the challenge, I think. It's easy for me as an actor to want to go back and do what I did 10 years ago and listen to the character and go, oh yeah, we can do that again. But because of what Kyle has endured and I'll use the word trauma, like, the idea that he's so affected by what was done to him for a very long period of time of brutal experimentation... He's still Kyle, but he's definitely a little bit more hellbent on revenge, and he's maybe not as lighthearted or jovial as he once was.</p>
<p>He's a little more focused on a mission if you will, so it was fun for me to try to build the connective tissue between the Kyle Crane that we liked getting to experience as players in the first Dying Light but also doing something just a little bit different - well, kind of vastly different really because of what he's endured. It was a fun challenge to try to sneak little bits of old Kyle in with this new sort of affected version of Kyle, but I love that. If there's a chance to do anything nuanced, it's fun for an actor.</p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smektala: </strong>Yeah, it's an actor's challenge, right? You have to find a new way to interpret the character.</p>
<p><strong>Roger Craig Smith:</strong> It's fun to kind of like tweak it and do that sort of thing. Otherwise, you're just doing something you've done before, but this is not your Grandpa's Kyle. This is a different Kyle, which is why, to their point, Dying Light: The Beast is not a DL2 DLC. It's a standalone thing because even Kyle is a different version of Kyle than what we've experienced in the past.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Because of what Kyle has endured, the idea that he's so affected by what was done to him for a very long period of time of brutal experimentation... He's still Kyle, but he's definitely a little bit more hellbent on revenge, and he's maybe not as lighthearted or jovial as he once was.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Are you also doing motion capture for Kyle or just voiceover?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Roger Craig Smith:</strong> It's straight voice acting.</p>
<p><strong>I also wanted to ask, Dying Light 2 was way more of an RPG than the first one. What about Dying Light: The Beast? Is it more like the first one or is it still an RPG?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smektala: </strong>I actually think it's something else. I think with every Dying Light game, we're trying to look at the zombie apocalypse and do it in a slightly different way, find a different balance for quite a different take on the narrative and on the world, but also find a different balance and use different elements for building the gameplay. I think what we are trying to do with this one is give it a more survival feel. You should really feel that you struggle against zombies in this world to survive the next day.</p>
<p>In that regard, I think it's closer to Dying Light 1 than to Dying Light 2. A reference for you can be the first initial hours of Dying Light 1, where you enter Harran and just have a weak weapon and every zombie is a problem. Even though Kyle Crane has changed and is a different, more seasoned, more experienced character, the world around him has also changed for the worse, so now he's back to the moment where he is fighting to just survive.</p>
<p><strong>Okay, so there won't be any choices and consequences in The Beast.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smektala: </strong>No, we decided to go with a linear story, very compact and impactful. We think this approach can be stronger, more emotional, and more engaging for players. We just want to tell a story, and because we also want to close and tie some threads from both games, it was important for us to allow ourselves to tell our version of the story, how we envision the canon of Dying Light 1 and 2 combined into what happens next for Kyle and for the future of the series.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'We decided to go with a linear story, very compact and impactful. We think this approach can be stronger, more emotional, and more engaging for players.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>I know you've been working hard to improve Dying Light 2 post-launch. We had many interviews about those improvements. Are you grabbing all of those improvements, such as for the nighttime experience, and using them in Dying Light: The Beast?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smektala: </strong>Of course. With every game, we evolve the formula of Dying Light and redefine its gameplay. After the first game, we tried some new things with the second one. Now, we have a better picture and understand what works best from both approaches, so The Beast combines all of those. It is the next step in the franchise's gameplay evolution.</p>
<p>So yes, we are taking all the advancements of Dying Light 2. We are using the same engine, but the engine has also been improved, for example, some of the weather effects. Dying Light grows all the time. We get wiser and smarter as developers, and we understand our community and the player's expectations better, so I think there's a culmination of everything we have done in the series over the 10 years.</p>
<p><strong>Are you still going to continue improving Dying Light 2?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smektala: </strong>Yes. That's the plan. We have promised five years of support for the game. There will be more updates coming to Dying Light 2 this year and in the next years. That's all I can say; we don't want to reveal too much right now because the message that we have right now is that Dying Light: The Beast is a new zombie adventure set in the world of Dying Light. Kyle Crane is back and we have a great game on our hands. We'll focus on this for a moment, and then we'll get back to Dying Light 2 quite soon.</p>
<p><strong>Can you answer whether there will be more DLCs?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smektala: </strong>Right now, we are not planning a narrative DLC for Dying Light 2, but the game will be supported and you can expect more content coming to it over the next years.</p>
<p><strong>I'm guessing The Beast is not launching this year, right?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smektala: </strong>We are not revealing anything about the release date as of yet. Of course, information will happen quite soon when we're ready to announce that. By the way, I wanted to say that if you look at the title, the trailer, and the Gamescom demo, you would say it's easy: Kyle Crane is the Beast, right? Because of those new powers. But actually, it is not that simple. I would like to leave that question mark over your head.</p>
<p><strong>Can you talk a bit about the Castor Woods zone?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Katarzyna Tarnacka:</strong> Sure. Castor Woods is located in a valley. There are different areas that you can explore. There's a town that was previously a tourist destination but is now abandoned, and there's an industrial area.</p>
<p>There's a lot of woodlands, a lot of farm areas that we can explore, and it's very dense. In fact, we changed the approach to building the areas quite significantly compared to Dying Light 2. This is much more handcrafted, and there's much more attention to detail. We have the best of the best people working on it. By the way, I wanted to mention that about half of the team worked on Dying Light, and having Roger back gave us so much energy and excitement that it's a very beloved project for us.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Right now, we are not planning a narrative DLC for Dying Light 2, but the game will be supported and you can expect more content coming to it over the next years.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Something that I was thinking about is that there are some similarities with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dying-light-the-following-review-zombies-country/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dying Light: The Following</a>. That was also a standalone DLC, and you had vehicles in that game, too. How are you balancing vehicles in this case? Because the main focus of Dying Light is always parkour.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smektala: </strong>What we want to do with every Dying Light project is try to find something new in it. We understand what the core, the essence of Dying Light is, and each game experiments to grow them in different directions. Because the overall theme of Dying Light: The Beast is about surviving and survival - surviving those 13 years of experiments and surviving in this world - the survival aspect is very important. We have also applied this to the vehicles, so it's not something that you can drive around mindlessly, smashing into everything and crushing it however you want.</p>
<p>It's also almost like a character in that you have to take care of it, repair it, make sure that it's not damaged, that it's not broken, that it has fuel. So that's one way how we can balance the vehicles. It is important because, on the other hand, we're also going to give people more options to do things in the world. Imagine being chased on foot: usually, you run to the safe zone, but now you can run to the vehicle. Or when you're being chased, you can also use the vehicle to get away faster, right?</p>
<p>But the zombies are even smarter in this game, so they can do things to the vehicle. We understand that vehicles give you a little bit more power, but we balance it through mechanics, making it more immersive, more realistic, and more grounded</p>
<p><strong>In the presentation, they said you needed to repair the vehicles, right? Do they eventually break?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smektala: </strong>A vehicle can break. There's another difference between this and The Following, in which you just had one vehicle. Here, you can destroy the vehicle, but there are more vehicles in the world, so actually you can drive more than just the water.</p>
<p><strong>Are there different types of vehicles in Dying Light: The Beast?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smektala: </strong>Most of them are based on the off-road archetype, but we try to find differences between them.</p>
<p><strong>Can you modify them in some ways?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smektala: </strong>I'm not saying anything about this at this stage. Apologies, we're just focusing on what's important for now.</p>
<p><strong>No worries. Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

			<p>The plaintiff has voluntarily dismissed two lawsuits regarding game addiction. These lawsuits were against some of the biggest companies in the game industry, <span>and the cases were filed in Arkansas and Ohio, respectively.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ufo-50-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Game File</a> has reviewed the court records, but the summary is not available unless you subscribe to the website. The court cases were filed against companies such as Epic, Activision Blizzard, Take Two Interactive, Rockstar Games, Roblox, Microsoft,</span>&nbsp;and Sony.</p>
<p>The lawyers representing the companies involved used protections under the First Amendment to defend themselves, saying that "the plaintiffs should be bound by user agreements that mandate arbitration, not lawsuits."</p>
<p>This isn't the first time that game addiction lawsuits have been filed, as a dozen video game addiction lawsuits were voluntarily dismissed in June. For example, one woman sued companies in <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/column-first-video-game-addiction-lawsuit-got-knocked-out-will-others-follow-2024-06-21/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">East Saint Louis federal court</a> last fall, alleging that the defendants' "intentional, negligent, deceptive, fraudulent, willful, immoral, reckless and unlawful acts" caused her grandchild to become addicted to video games. Her complaint was written out in a 161-page complaint, stating that their grandchild became addicted at the age of seven and gets angry when told to stop playing games.</p>
<p>According to the lawsuit, the grandchild allegedly needed "medication therapy, outpatient counseling, and an Individualized Education Plan" at school. However, after Epic looked through their files for the supposed account, it was found that the supposed account the child was playing on was only used to play games for one hour.</p>
<p>Many more of these lawsuits are continuing to come forward, and the latest suits to be thrown out of court were filed by a mother on behalf of her child, saying that the child would play video games for 12 to 14 hours a day and spent approximately $3,000 on in-game transactions and downloadable content.</p>
<p>It isn't the first time that stories have been released speaking about children spending an unprecedented amount of money on in-game currencies, typically using their parents' payment methods without them knowing. One of the most common games in which this happens is Roblox, alongside Fortnite.</p>
<p>Roblox is a controversial game as it is, but it has currently been <a href="https://wccftech.com/turkiye-bans-roblox-due-to-potential-child-exploitation/">banned in Turkey</a> for potential child exploitation, and other countries may begin to follow suit.</p>

From the sound of it, I’m not the only one. I went looking to see if my technical problems were a result of my (reasonably beefy) PC having finally aged out of peak performance. Turns out, issues with gradual framerate drops <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/app/2322010/tradingforum/4843148117768339897/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2322010/tradingforum/4843148117768339897/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">are a common problem</a></span> with seemingly no permanent fix.

Action games like <em>God of War </em>are easily among the most affected by poor performance, and if the only way for me to get even a momentary reprieve from the game chugging while I’m trying to fight the Norse god pantheon is to stop playing it, what am I even doing here?

It wants its games to become worldwide brands that expand beyond the PlayStation box you’ve played them on in the past.

Sony’s brand of big-budget, award-winning prestige games is well-established on consoles, but its track record everywhere else is spotty. <em>God of War Ragnarök</em> is one of the company’s most decorated games of the past decade, and to see it come to PC as anything less than the best version of itself is a real shame. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It does what it says on the tin though, letting players run into Baldur's Gate 3 combat and cast spells as quick as their fingers will allow, instead of having to wait their turn.</p><p>The video shows tinybike exploring the ruins found early in Act 1 of Baldur's Gate 3 and immediately being rushed by the agitated enemy who awaits. But they, alongside the handful of other baddies exploring the ruins, are quickly taken down with a selection of speedy spells.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Best RPG of 2023</h3></div></output><p>Baldur's Gate 3 combat can be tricky even with 10 minutes between each move to think about things, of course, so it's difficult to imagine how real-time combat would work proper, especially for some more strategically driven classes like the Rogue. Regardless, mods will seemingly make it a viable option in the future, so those looking to explore Faerûn without a pause button can seemingly soon do so.</p><p>Baldur's Gate 3 mods have increased in prominence thanks to developer Larian Studios releasing an official toolkit for the game, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-modder-unlocks-complete-dev-toolkit-to-create-entirely-new-campaigns-and-content">this was quickly broken</a> to let players make <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-modder-reveals-first-custom-maps-including-avernus">fully custom maps</a> and more.</p><p>The toolkit arrived alongside Patch 7, which added lots of other content including <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/karlach-is-trending-on-xtwitter-after-baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-because-her-new-evil-ending-is-absolutely-metal">an "absolutely metal" ending for Karlach</a> and a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-player-finds-scrapped-evil-ending-in-patch-7-thats-hilariously-anticlimactic">hidden evil ending</a>.

            <link>https://aftermath.site/shirley-curry-retirement-skyrim</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/let%E2%80%99s-all-learn-a-lesson-from-skyrim-grandma.989037/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/shirley-curry-retirement-skyrim<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Creator “<a href="https://aftermath.site/pokimane-matpat-retiring-youtube-twitch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">retirement</a>” has been something of a trend this year, with stars on Twitch and YouTube stepping back from the content grind. The latest person to join their ranks is Shirley Curry, the beloved 88-year-old who plays <em>Skyrim</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>In a vlog yesterday titled “No More Gaming Videos,” Curry announced that she’s going to stop making gaming videos because, like many of the folks who’ve made this announcement before her, she’s tired of it. “I’m old and I’m tired,” she says. “It seems like I spend most of my time sitting in here at this computer, and lately–probably for the last month–I walk in here and look at my computer and think, ‘I’ve <em>got</em> to make a video today’ and then I just shake my head at myself and say ‘I don’t want to, I have no desire to’ and I turn around and walk back out.</p><p>“I’m just doing it for fun, and it isn’t fun anymore,” she says later in the video. “I’m <em>tired</em> of it, I’m <em>bored</em> with it, bored to death with it, so I’m making the decision now totally, finally, I am not going to be making any more game videos and uploading them.”</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Vlog#41:  No More Gaming Videos" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jNGH8o3LDBo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Curry isn’t completely abandoning YouTube, however. She says she’ll still make vlogs when the mood strikes her, “if I were to receive a gift or if I buy something I think is really cute, anything like that, if I see some pretty flowers sometimes I might take a video or a picture or something and come make a vlog and let you see it.” She also says she might make videos of herself <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyEuqwMuSA8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reading <em>Skyrim</em> books</a>, books she likes, or even stories she’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQ_2e-z-Z9hYc9pxnQ5kZ2azLUQLJ8E3S" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">written herself</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>In her offline time, Curry says, first she’s going to be having eye surgery. After that, there’s a quilt she’s been meaning to make. And she reminds viewers that she has a hefty backlog of videos for them to watch if they still want to get their <em>Skyrim</em> fix.</p><p>Part of Curry’s appeal is the incongruousness of someone who looks and sounds like your grandma (she calls viewers “grandkids”) making gaming videos, but that hasn’t made her immune from the common pitfalls of content creation. In 2020, she took a break due to <a href="https://kotaku.com/skyrim-grandma-is-taking-a-break-because-of-internet-as-1843663799" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">toxic comments</a>. And she’s wrestled with the pressures of being online since she started, telling <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/shirley-curry-gamer-grandma-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PCGamer</a> in 2016 that “The obligation makes me feel worn out a lot of the time. But the obligation also makes me feel guilty… It makes me feel guilty if I skip a day or two."&nbsp;</p><p>It’s a pressure a lot of content creators echo, though many of them have the added stress of it being an actual job they can’t just step away from. And Curry’s retirement mimics that of big-name streamers who’ve changed their approach this year: not actually leaving their platforms or giving up making videos, but stepping back from the most grind-like aspects to focus on the content they like. As Nathan <a href="https://aftermath.site/pokimane-matpat-retiring-youtube-twitch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a> of streamers “retiring” earlier this year, </p><blockquote><p>creators aren’t actually quitting: They still want to make stuff! They just don’t want to spend their lives in mind-numbing thrall to The Algorithm… The big creators who’ve announced their "retirement" are finally breaking free of that cycle, and good for them. They’re also doing something that smaller creators – and people working regular, less glamorous jobs – cannot.&nbsp;</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>In Curry’s case, it seems like she’s fallen into a pitfall many people far younger than her do: turning a hobby, especially online, into basically a fulltime job, thanks to the expectations of an audience and the infectious tentacles of hustle culture. I am certainly not one to speak here, since my favorite thing to do in my non-work hours is to do more work, but it can be easy to lose a sense of balance and forget that fun things are, well, supposed to be <em>fun</em>. If Curry, with decades more life experience than me and likely most of you reading this, can fall prey to the siren song of overwork, what hope do the rest of us have?</p><p>But I think her example here is a great one: noticing and naming her feelings, and taking steps to bring her life back into balance. The videos she still intends to make are the things that bring her joy: pretty flowers, cool <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWSAXJfDRG8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stuff</a>, hobbies outside of gaming. And she’s going to focus on her offline life too, including her health. (::Looks at pile of doctor’s appointment reminders I’ve been ignoring::) Few of us will ever be able to create a life that only contains things we <em>want</em> to do, but we can all prioritze making a little more time for fun, and remembering to <a href="https://aftermath.site/learning-new-stuff-as-an-adult-rules" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">focus on the <em>fun</em> aspect </a>of that stuff and not turning it into something that takes from our lives more than it gives.</p><p>So enjoy your retirement, <em>Skyrim</em> grandma. I hope the quilt turns out well.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> once included <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-maker">Super Mario Maker</a>-style gameplay, but for dungeons.</p>
<p>In a new Q&amp;A with <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/News/2024/September/Ask-the-Developer-Vol-13-The-Legend-of-Zelda-Echoes-of-Wisdom-Chapter-1-2659909.html">Nintendo</a>, Echoes of Wisdom's director Tomomi Sano (the first female director for the Zelda series), Satoshi Terada from the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-developer-seemingly-confirmed">now-confirmed developer Grezzo</a> and The Legend of Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma spoke more about how the upcoming release came to into being. </p>
<p>Grezzo was asked to pitch ideas for a new game - the team's first all-new Zelda title. "We asked Grezzo, 'If you were to make the next new game, what kind of game would you like it to be?'. We had the opportunity to hear ideas from members of Grezzo, which they came up with freely and proposed," the producer said.</p>

<p>A large number of ideas were pitched to Nintendo, but Terada said the ideas were eventually narrowed down to "a focus on copy-and-paste gameplay and gameplay that combines top-down view and side view". With these parameters set, Aonuma then asked the team to "think of ways to add some freedom" to the idea. And, this is when the dungeon-maker idea came to be.</p>
<p>"We were exploring a few different ways to play the game in parallel. In one approach, Link could copy and paste various objects, such as doors and candlesticks, to create original dungeons," Terada revealed. "During this exploration phase, this idea was called an 'edit dungeon' because players could create their own The Legend of Zelda gameplay."</p>
<p>Aonuma then gave this edit dungeon concept a go, and agreed it was "fun to create your own dungeon and let other people play it". However, the Zelda producer also thought this idea could be improved still.</p>
<p>"It's also not so bad to place items that can be copied and pasted in the game field, and create gameplay where they can be used to fight enemies," he said. And this is how Echoes of Wisdom's Echo mechanic began. "The gameplay was shifted from creating dungeons up until then to using copied-and-pasted items as tools to further your own adventure," Aonuma shared.</p>
<p>According to Sano, it was "about a year since [Grezzo] started prototyping with the 'edit dungeon' idea" and those now titular echoes getting threaded into the development.</p>
<p>"Everyone else was developing the game with dungeon creation in mind, but I was right next to them thinking of something different. But there's a reason it took a year to upend the tea table," he said, evoking the classic <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/shigeru-miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> phrase. "After all, you can't really see the potential for ideas to develop into solid gameplay until you can verify features and their feel, so I wanted them to try making it first."</p>
<p>Said Aonuma: "I felt that the 'edit dungeon' feature they showed me had significant potential to be developed into a new way of playing The Legend of Zelda games if the gameplay was changed to use 'echoes' instead. So I thought it would be good to expand in that direction and could be even more interesting that way."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-dungeon-maker<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em>'s producer and directors have&nbsp;revealed that during the early stages of the game's prototyping, the development team intended to allow players to create and share their own dungeons.</p>
<p>In a new <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-13-the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-part-1/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ask the Developer interview on Nintendo's website</a>, legendary producer Eiji Aonuma, along with game directors Tomomi Sano and Satoshi Terada, answers questions about&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>'s design philosophy and development process.</p>
<p>In that interview, Aonuma says that he asked employees of&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-developer">developer Grezzo</a> to pitch concepts for a new <i>Zelda&nbsp;</i>game, and that after receiving many pitches, the team settled on something "with a focus on copy-and-paste gameplay", as well as a mixed top-down and side-on view.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/echoes-of-wisdom-dungeon-maker-aonuma.jpg?itok=hp1NcrzS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/echoes-of-wisdom-dungeon-maker-aonuma.jpg?itok=Bgbaubgo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Eiji Aonuma says&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>originally let you make your own dungeons.</figcaption></figure><p>Terada says that Grezzo was "exploring a few different ways"&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>could go gameplay-wise, and that one such idea allowed Link to "create original dungeons" by copying and pasting objects.</p>
<p>Aonuma follows up by saying that while it's "fun to create your own dungeon", he thought the gameplay idea could be shifted from creating dungeons to "using copied-and-pasted items as tools to further your own adventure".</p>
<p>At that point, Aonuma decided to "upend the tea table" and to change the idea of editing dungeons into a "new way of playing the&nbsp;<em>Legend of Zelda&nbsp;</em>games".</p>
<p>This refers back to a point Aonuma makes earlier in the interview; he says he and Nintendo worried that "fans may not continue playing [<em>The Legend of Zelda</em>] unless they can think independently" and solve puzzles using their own methods, rather than the classic set solutions of earlier&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>games.</p>

<p>It's that philosophy that underpins&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>'s more&nbsp;<em>Breath of the Wild</em>-style open-ended approach to puzzles. Aonuma says the team needed to "increase the degree of freedom" inherent in&nbsp;<em>Zelda</em>'s design philosophy in order to achieve a more free puzzle-solving approach.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, Aonuma also says he's "always wanted to establish a 2D top-down&nbsp;<em>Legend of Zelda&nbsp;</em>series" that stands apart from mainline&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>entries. Could&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>be the start of that new series? Let's hope so!</p>
<p>It's well worth reading the full interview with Aonuma, Terada, and Sano, as well as its <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-13-the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-part-2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">second part</a>, if you want to learn more about&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>ahead of its release later this week.</p>

And it turns out that <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> originally started its life as a different idea entirely. </p><p>“We were exploring a few different ways to play the game in parallel,” Terada said. “In one approach, Link could copy and paste various objects, such as doors and candlesticks, to create original dungeons. During this exploration phase, this idea was called an ‘edit dungeon’ because players could create their own <em>Legend of Zelda </em>gameplay.”</p><p>Aonuma explained how the pitch evolved from there<strong>: </strong></p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>They showed it to me and told me to give it a try.

That was the beginning of gameplay using “echoes.” The gameplay was shifted from creating dungeons up until then to using copied-and-pasted items as tools to further your own adventure.</p></blockquote><p>While long-time <em>Zelda</em> fans would still love a game that’s all about designing devilishly fun and challenging mazes for people to play online, it’s fascinating to see how the idea for <em>Echoes</em> developed from Aonuma pushing back on the concept and seeing how it could be utilized in a more traditional, single-player context to expand on the standard type of <em>Zelda</em> gameplay players are used to. The idea for “edit Zelda” wasn’t short-lived either. Sano confirmed the team spent many months prototyping the original concept before changing it. </p><p><strong>“</strong>But there’s a reason it took a year to upend the tea table,” Aonuma said. “After all, you can’t really see the potential for ideas to develop into solid gameplay until you can verify features and their feel, so I wanted them to try making it first. I felt that the ‘edit dungeon’ feature they showed me had significant potential to be developed into a new way of playing the <em>Legend of Zelda</em> games if the gameplay was changed to use ‘echoes’ instead.”</p><p>There was one big concern, however. The <em>Zelda</em> producer said that with all of the items players can copy and the different types of echoes they can make, he was worried the mechanic might constantly crash the game. “I wasn’t sure how far we could go, but in the end, it was amazing to see how many echoes it was possible to create in the game.” And the results apparently turned out to be surprisingly fun, especially since <em>Echoes</em> changes viewpoints between 3D top-down and 2D side-scrolling. “I thought to myself, ‘Wow, I never knew this was possible,’” Sano said. “Of course, creating dungeons was fun, but being able to copy various objects and use them in different places was even more fun.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Nintendo has filed a new device with the FCC, but it doesn’t appear to be the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 console. Instead, based on the information provided by Nintendo, it looks like it could be a peripheral of some sort.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://apps.fcc.gov/oetcf/eas/reports/ViewExhibitReport.cfm?mode=Exhibits&amp;RequestTimeout=500&amp;calledFromFrame=Y&amp;application_id=m9V0HXBXo8nolsDsEYU3Nw%3D%3D&amp;fcc_id=BKECLO001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">filings with the FCC</a>, this device is being listed as a “wireless device” by the company. It’s specifically not being called a controller or game console. That leads to the belief it’s a peripheral of some sort.</p>



<p>What adds more credence to that is the claims that there is no battery of any sort. Instead, the device has to be plugged in via USB-C only. It also has 2.4GHz Wi-Fi.</p>



<p>There’s obviously not much to go on as far as what exactly the device could be. The only thing it’s likely not is the aforementioned  Nintendo Switch 2. That said, until we get an official announcement or reveal from Nintendo, nothing can be confirmed just yet.</p>



<p>Speaking of the Nintendo Switch 2, there has still been no announcement as to when to expect a reveal. That said, the latest rumors suggest a potential announcement within the next month or so. While a reveal date isn’t known, many of the console’s expected features have been circulating for months.</p>



<p>According to claims, the Switch 2 — if that’s the name — will be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-will-be-backwards-compatible-and-support-4k-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">backwards compatible</a>, have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-details-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">newly-designed Joy-Cons</a>, and even support 4K in some way.</p>

                <p>Almost anyone can become a star in the age of social media, but few have had the reach of Shirley Curry aka Skyrim Grandma. At 88 years old, Curry may be the world's oldest video game streamer. She's also amassed 1.29 million subscribers on her YouTube page. But now, after nine years of making Skyrim gameplay videos, Curry is bringing that part of her life to a close.</p><p>Curry made the announcement in a newly released video where she explained why she's hanging up her controller. "I'm just doing it for fun and it isn't fun anymore," said Curry. "I'm tired of it. I'm bored with it. I'm bored to death with it. So I am making the decision now, totally, finally. I am not going to be making any more game videos and uploading them."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNGH8o3LDBo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jNGH8o3LDBo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>While Skyrim videos are no longer in her plans, Curry noted that she doesn't intend to quit YouTube altogether. She plans to continue making videos about novels she's read, a quilt she wants to make, and potentially a book that she may write. This decision shouldn't be too surprising, since Curry had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skyrim-grandma-the-worlds-oldest-streamer-is-cutti/1100-6477685/" data-ref-id="1100-6477685">cut back on her posting schedule in 2020</a> after citing her dissatisfaction with some of the negative comments left on her page as well as a general desire to look after her own physical health.</p><p>Regardless, Curry's Skyrim fandom earned her admirers all over the world, including inside Bethesda. In 2019, Bethesda revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elder-scrolls-6-may-feature-skyrim-grandma-see-new/1100-6465961/" data-ref-id="1100-6465961">Curry had lent her likeness to the company</a> and may be featured as a NPC in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6492383/" data-ref-id="1100-6492383">The Elder Scrolls VI</a>. If that happens, Curry's legacy in Skyrim will live on beyond her videos.</p>

                <p>It's reportedly going to be a big week in the world of PlayStation, as Sony will host the next PlayStation State of Play briefing this week, according to reporter Jeff Grubb of GameSpot sister site Giant Bomb.</p><p>Many theorized a State of Play event could take place on September 24, and while Grubb didn't confirm that outright, he said the event is happening <a href="https://x.com/JeffGrubb/status/1838219505538895909" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"this week for sure."</a> Pressed for more details on what the event might include in terms of news, Grubb said he doesn't want to get anyone's hopes up, but he <a href="https://x.com/JeffGrubb/status/1838224206388994516" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">did say</a> he expects the event to focus on third-party projects and remasters.</p><p>Rumors and reports circulating recently have suggested that <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/insider-confirms-days-gone-playstation-5-remaster-sony-bend-studio-first-party-exclusives/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Days Gone</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-leaks-on-esrb-site/1100-6526550/" data-ref-id="1100-6526550">Horizon Zero Dawn could receive PS5 remasters</a>, and these could be two announcements at the rumored State of Play.</p><p>If there is indeed a PlayStation State of Play this week, it would come not long after Sony confirmed the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-release-date-specs-price/1100-6523695/" data-ref-id="1100-6523695">PS5 Pro</a> and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/sony-announces-playstation-30th-anniversary-collection-of-nostalgic-consoles-and-controllers/2900-5784/" data-ref-id="2900-5784">30th Anniversary PS5 console.</a></p><p>A State of Play might not be the only big gaming announcement event on tap for the semi-near future, as some believe Nintendo's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> reveal event may be lined up for as soon as this month. There is no genuine evidence of that, however, beyond wishful thinking and Nintendo's own history of hosting events in September.</p><p>Keep checking back with GameSpot for the latest.</p>

                <p>Cards Against Humanity, LLC--publisher of the raunchy card game of the same name--has announced plans to sue Elon Musk after the spacefaring billionaire allegedly dumped waste from SpaceX's production plant onto protected land owned by Cards Against Humanity.</p><p dir="ltr">The notoriously snarky card game company announced the suit in a rather unorthodox manner, creating a website called <a href="http://elonowesyou100dollars.com/" rel="nofollow ">ElonOwesYou100Dollars.com</a>, which provides details regarding the suit.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/CAH/status/1837177957913076160" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">7 years ago, we bought a plot of land on the US-Mexico border to stop racist billionaire Donald Trump’s dumb wall.<br>But this year, an even richer, more racist billionaire—<a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ElonMusk</a>—fucked that land with tractors and garbage, so we’re suing for $15 million. <a href="https://t.co/MzNuHAcRIo" rel="nofollow ">https://t.co/MzNuHAcRIo</a></p>  — Cards Against Humanity (@CAH) <a href="https://twitter.com/CAH/status/1837177957913076160?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 20, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">"We have terrible news," reads a humorously blunt statement on the site's landing page. "Seven years ago, 150,000 people paid us $15 to protect a pristine parcel of land on the US-Mexico border from racist billionaire Donald Trump's very stupid wall. Unfortunately, an even richer, more racist billionaire--Elon Musk--snuck up on us from behind and completely f**ked that land with gravel, tractors, and space garbage."</p><p dir="ltr">"Just look at it!" the statement continues, following photos of the land in 2017 versus its current state. "He f**ked it."</p><p dir="ltr">The story of how protected land became an unofficial dumpster for SpaceX is quite simple: According to Cards Against Humanity, Musk just started dumping SpaceX's waste there, and once caught, issued Cards Against Humanity with an ultimatum.</p><p dir="ltr">"Elon Musk's SpaceX was building some space thing nearby, and he figured he could just dump his shit all over our gorgeous plot of land without asking," alleges Cards Against Humanity. "After we caught him, SpaceX gave us a 12-hour ultimatum to accept a lowball offer for less than half our land’s value."</p><p dir="ltr">So how did Cards Against Humanity respond?</p><p dir="ltr">"We said, 'Go f**k yourself, Elon Musk. We’ll see you in court.'"</p><p dir="ltr">The statement goes on to announce that Cards Against Humanity is suing Musk for $15 million.</p><p dir="ltr">"If we win, we'll equally split the lawsuit's net proceeds among all 150,000 of our original subscribers, up to $100 each," the site states, explaining its unique URL. "While this isn't enough to compensate our subscribers for the anguish they've suffered witnessing Elon Musk defile their once-verdant land--<a href="https://cardsagainsthumanitystopsthewall.com/" rel="nofollow ">where wild horses galloped freely in the Texas moonlight</a>--we think it’s a pretty good start."</p><p dir="ltr">"Even if Musk un-f**ks our land, that doesn’t un-f**k the damage he’s done to our reputation," Cards Against Humanity said of the reason for the pricey lawsuit. "150,000 people gave us their hard-earned money, and in exchange we vowed to protect this land from racist billionaires and their dumb vanity projects."</p><p dir="ltr">The statement is signed, "With great vengeance and furious anger, Cards Against Humanity," referencing the (fictional) Bible verse Ezekiel 25:17, which appeared in cult classic Pulp Fiction.</p><p dir="ltr">Cards Against Humanity ends its statement with an amusing post-script: "P.S. We will also accept Twitter.com as compensation."</p><p dir="ltr">At the time of writing, neither Musk nor SpaceX have addressed the allegations regarding the alleged damage to the land in Texas or the lawsuit itself.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/frostpunk-2-already-profitable-sales-top-350k/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/frostpunk-2-already-profitable-sales-top-350k.988971/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/frostpunk-2-already-profitable-sales-top-350k/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In just three days, Frostpunk 2 has already crossed over 350,000 sales, as posted by Frostpunk 2 developer and publisher 11-bit Studios&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/frostpunkgame/status/1838181485859246232" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on X</a>. They have said that the game has already recouped the development and marketing costs and has already been profitable in the three days it's been available on the market.</p>
<p>If you want to know whether this is a game you should pick up, check out <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/frostpunk-2-day-after-tomorrow/">Chris' review of Frostpunk 2 here</a>.</p>
<p>The game has over 5,000 reviews on Steam so far, and has a Mostly Positive standing on Steam. Frostpunk 2 is also available on Game Pass, and was available as a day one title. Of course, this is just the beginning of Frostpunk 2, as 11-bit Studios say that the players' support touches them, but "the work doesn't stop here" as they continue to work on improving the Frostpunk 2 experience by adding new hotfixes and updates in upcoming patches. Development is still ongoing to make Frostpunk 2 the perfect game, and the game may receive major DLC expansions in the future, as the first Frostpunk game also did.</p>
<p>Frostpunk 2 isn't just an ordinary city builder, as this one comes with a story, much like the first one. It's the sequel to Frostpunk, a highly successful indie game made in 2018, and takes place 30 years after the first game. You have to work on building up a city in a post-apocalyptic land that is blighted by a permanent winter. Although you'll be building up a city, you'll also have to make difficult moral and political decisions, as you are the leader of your new town. Although Frostpunk 2 features a lot of the same stuff as the first game, it also introduces factions, districts, and the ability to create smaller cities. These new features can help or hinder you, depending on how successful your city is and how many supplies you have.</p>
<p>Frostpunk 2 is available on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. It also features a <a href="https://wccftech.com/frostpunk-2-to-have-mod-support-on-launch/">modding tool</a> so that players can experiment and add extra features to their game from the start. Compared to the first game, the sequel was built in Unreal Engine, meaning the process for adding mods to the game was totally different, and made it much easier to be able to implement a system like that. The modding tool is called FrostKit and will allow players to create their own custom maps and custom models and create custom scenarios as needed. Having the modding tool will allow players to create thematic cities. This means players can create a Lovecraftian or Cosmic city if they want to, depending on what assets they use.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-of-shire-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Private Division and developer&nbsp;Wētā Workshop have revealed the&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>release date, and the cozy hobbit game, which will let you live an idyllic life far from the likes of Ring-wraiths and Balrogs, is launching in spring.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the two studios revealed a&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>delay; the game was originally intended to launch this fall, but it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-of-the-shire-delayed">pushed back to early 2025</a> owing to a need for additional development time.</p>
<p>Now, however, it's <a href="https://x.com/talesoftheshire/status/1837932214920634512" rel="noopener" target="_blank">been revealed</a> that&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>will launch on PC and consoles on March 25th next year. It won't be an Early Access game, either, so you'll be getting the full cozy hobbit life sim experience when it arrives.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tales-of-the-shire-release-date-hobbit-home.jpg?itok=_zH96Ylo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tales-of-the-shire-release-date-hobbit-home.jpg?itok=dVvwKdVH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>is officially launching in March.</figcaption></figure><p>To commemorate the release date announcement, Private Division and Wētā Workshop revealed a new trailer in which the studios describe the game as a "<em>Lord of the Rings&nbsp;</em>gaming experience like nothing that's come before".</p>
<p>The devs say that "every aspect" of&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>"has been carefully crafted", and that "each bridge, path, plant, hobbit home, and second breakfast is drawn from the original vision", referring to&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings&nbsp;</em>author J.R.R. Tolkien.</p>
<p>Wētā Workshop says it's a game about "fellowship, community, and comfort", but that "most importantly, it's a game about living as a hobbit". If you've ever wanted to shirk the call to adventure and settle down in a cozy hobbit village, this one's for you.</p>
<p>You can take a look at the&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>release date announcement trailer, which also features some small snippets of gameplay, right here.</p>

<p><em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>officially launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2016460/Tales_of_the_Shire_A_The_Lord_of_The_Rings_Game/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10010195" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/tales-of-the-shire-a-the-lord-of-the-rings-game/9pkkjbvpp4gw" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/tales-of-the-shire-a-the-lord-of-the-rings-game-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> on March 25th.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/how-cyberpunk-2077s-most-complicated-boss-was-built-concept-to-controller<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>If you’ve played Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty, you’ll no doubt remember the Chimera. It’s a hulking, spider-like tank that chases you relentlessly, destroying every piece of the building around you before trapping you in a one-on-one battle. It's the biggest boss fight in the whole game, and was a monumentally complex sequence for developer CD Projekt Red to create. </p><p>So, how was this intricate multistage mission put together? We spoke to multiple developers from across several different departments to find out what the joys and complications were. This is how Phantom Liberty’s Chimera encounter was built, from concept to controller.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/20/awakening-1726849466079.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The thoroughly elaborate design process for the Chimera started with the most simple of propositions: a big boss battle with a big boss tank. Filippo Ubertino, Cyberpunk’s Senior Concept Designer explains:</p><p>“I had a very small brief and it was something like this: we want to do a boss fight that will be a spider tank. Internally, we always refer to it as a spider tank, but in fact it's not a spider because it has six legs, so it's not really a spider and it's not actually a tank because it doesn't have a crew. So Chimera fits better.</p><p>In the beginning, we didn't have this claustrophobic environment in mind. So we also thought about maybe we could have this tank jumping around, but we decided that we wanted something heavier, something scary in a sense, not like a toy jumping around.”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/20/hologram-spidertank-chandelier-room-20230112-1726849529872.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>That desire for heft and weight informed the complete look of the Chimera. It almost evokes kaiju-like monsters, further playing into the metaphor of it destroying the model of Night City’s Dogtown district at the centre of its museum home. It was built to impose itself on both the tight confines of its surroundings and the player, who is tiny by comparison, something Paweł Mielniczuk, Art Director at CDPR, expands upon:</p><p>“We thought that it would be perfect [to create] this kind of man versus machine, David versus  Goliath moment where we have to, as a single person, fight with something so massive and elaborate and powerful. There were a lot of iterations on even an accomplished model. Changing something, replacing things. Adding range, the capability of rotating faster, moving faster, et cetera. Adding grenade launchers. Eventually also adding the drone compartments, which were not part of the original design, but were needed to add an additional phase of combat in the third stage of the boss fight.”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/20/spider-tank-blue-print-wip11final-1-1726850576357.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>“We didn't have a perfect gameplay idea at the beginning,” Ubertino reveals. “So we started with [lots of different ideas;] many legs, high legs, something smaller, something bigger. And when one of those sketches was chosen, we were like, ‘Okay, now we need to block it out.’ So we have very rough 3D models so [the gameplay team] can test it in the level. That one was a little bit more similar to the final one. I tried to keep the shape as similar to that block out, even when I started adding details in 3D and making it more believable, more like a real tank.”</p><p>But despite being neither a spider nor a tank in the end, the eagle-eyed among you will be able to spot some aspects of the original design that remain to this day. Something that Ubertino found the perfect way to repurpose.</p><p>“If you look at the rear section, there's quite a big door. At the beginning we didn't know that we were not going to use a crew, so that door was supposed to be the opening for the crew. But we ended up [making the Chimera] a huge drone essentially, and the door is still there.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty - Chimera Work in Progress Designs</h3></div></output><p>Being an automated machine rather than a crewed vehicle allows the Chimera to move in a more animalistic way. Unhindered by the limitations of humanity, its motions are free to be animated in a way that better reflects its natural world influences, as explained by Cinematic Animation Acting Lead David Cordero Iglesias:</p><p>“We were mostly relying on scorpions, beetles, things that have six legs, because it's very important to pick up the balance on how he's moving, the volume motion that the Chimera showed through the entire sequence.”</p><p>Contributing to that animalistic-yet-mechanical feel is the fact that the Chimera is possessed by a rogue AI from beyond the Blackwall. This ‘cyberspace hell’ and the corruption it inflicts is at the core of Phantom Liberty’s storyline – and would also need to be conveyed in the way the metal monster would be heard. As such, noises were engineered to sound like nothing else – an amalgamation of natural, digital, and demonic worlds. It needed to sound like an overwhelming force eating away at whatever it came into contact with, be that the hulking Chimera or the new central character, Songbird – it’s an audio hellscape she, nor the player, can escape.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/20/tank-sound-1726849720036.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>“We wanted the Chimera to sound mechanical but not fully robotic”, states Lead Sound Designer Krzysztof Popiel.  “We wanted it to be something alive, and robotic growls help a lot with this. As the sequence progresses, the vocalisation of the Chimera changes to almost demonic Blackwall sounds.”</p><p>It’s a sentiment echoed by Michał Pukała, Senior Sound Designer: “I think the coolest and the most interesting thing about Blackwall is that it wasn't supposed to be futuristic. The descriptors I got from both the narrative director and the lead cinematic designers, they were talking about shamanistic sounds, cyber monsters. Essentially you would need to create sounds of cyber hell.”</p><p>Further inspirations for the sound of the Blackwall came from other, non-audio departments working on the sequence. This collaboration was made possible thanks to a completely new organisational system, implemented by CD Projekt Red after the release of Cyberpunk 2077. The Spider and the Fly, the mission in which the Chimera appears, was a big test subject for this new way of working. Members of every design department needed to be in constant conversation with one another to ensure that the visual design and animation all worked in concert with the sequence’s gameplay goals.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This sequence is one of the biggest achievements we did in terms of blending gameplay with cinematics.</p></div><p>“It was a bit tricky from our side because it was the first time in the company that we were divided into what is called content teams”, Iglesias recalls. “It's like a multidisciplinary team based on every discipline that we want to create this sequence. So everyone participated in the design with their own ideas. We have environment artists, we have animators, we have designers, we have gameplay, we have level design, so everything together to create the best approach to this. It was a very, very, very intricate process.</p><p>We needed to have this heaviness, this weight, tons of steel chasing you. But at the same time, later we have a boss fight. So we have to balance it out with gameplay that has other requirements, right? Because this sequence, for me, is one of the biggest achievements we did in terms of blending gameplay with cinematics. We tried all the time to mix those two in several intensities during the whole sequence.”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/20/balcony-sweep-1726850035140.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Blending gameplay with cinematics is something that Cyberpunk 2077 does elegantly. CDPR aims to never fully take control away from the player, even when a scripted scene is playing out in front of them. The Chimera sequence is a finely tuned set piece that demanded a tight relationship between the gameplay and cinematics staff. Managing the balance was a task that largely lay in the hands of Cinematic Designer Michał Zbrzeźniak:</p><p>“When the tank is rising up for the first time in this room and he's shooting at you in the middle of his animation, that makes him go to gameplay. So normally you would have a cut, a fade out and fade in, or maybe something will glitch at the transition from gameplay to scene. And in Cyberpunk, especially in this sequence, we always strived to make it invisible.</p><p> So actually almost the whole sequence, except for maybe just the fight itself, is actually a cinematic sequence. There are dialogues being played by the characters. There are even contextual animations played on V where she's covering her face from the missiles. But the soldiers that are on the balconies actually have gameplay behaviour. But we did it in a way [where] the turret’s swipe is so meticulous that they will die anyway. So it's kind of a risky mix, but it worked out in the end.”</p><p>From here, the mission transports you from the wide open museum space to a tight corridor, made even more claustrophobic by the presence of the Chimera hunting you down. It’s a chase sequence built on the principle of knowing when to pick your battles. The tank is too powerful to take down by yourself, and if you try, you’ll learn that the hard way.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/20/the-chase-1726850067335.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>“We kind of try to make sure that it's impossible to fight with it”, Iglesias explains. “There are several fail states that we create along the whole sequence, but I will say 90% of the players run away the first time because it's too scary. </p><p>It was a bit of a challenge to put this gigantic beast inside the corridor because it's pretty difficult to make him move anywhere. So we decided that he's destroying everything on his path [as he chases you]. It was the best way to create this horror feeling. [It’s] funny because I animated everything with the Chimera moving forward and destroying everything on his path, and probably 99% of the players don’t look [backward], which is kind of sad for me.” </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/20/chase-running-1726850102476.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Running forwards may be a simple enough task for the player, but was far more complex a conundrum for Zbrzeźniak and the cinematics team to solve: </p><p>“So the chase part was a challenge in that regard. We had to align the speed of the tank, which wasn't an easy task to do because it was completely animation-driven. So any change in his movement would require some animation tweaks. [We also had to] align that with how fast the player can go, because the player can be a bit faster or a bit slower [depending on their character build], and for every type of build it still needs to work and it still needs to feel like he's right on your toes. But he can never catch you if you are actively running from him.</p><p>One of the goals in the sequence for us was to foreshadow as much of the stuff the tank is doing as possible. For example, you shouldn't be close to it. Being close to it means death. He has a turret that is deadly, he has a laser swipe that is also deadly. So then when you actually fight him, you know what a given attack is because we showed it already through the sequence that precedes it.”</p><p>Before the big fight, though, comes a long fall. A floor-shattering descent through concrete and metal, this incredibly complicated transition scene posed some of the biggest technical challenges of the whole sequence.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/20/the-fall-1726850128269.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>“That fall was kind of my own personal baby, actually”, states Iglesias. “I wanted to create a bigger action sequence instead of just falling. So I took some inspiration actually from some other places. For example, the Uncharted 4 clock tower sequence. You are trying to grab onto everything you find for your life, right? We have these cables, you are on top of the tank again, and you have to jump out [and grab them]. </p><p>At the same time, to give this scale, I had another inspiration that I like a lot: Gandalf falling with the Balrog from the Bridge of Khazad-dûm [in The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]. So it's this massive fall, but you are still fighting and you have this behemoth by your side that you are watching fall with you. In the end, trying to achieve this result of an insane action sequence was very, very difficult from an animation point of view.</p><p>What we did is we had an incredible [motion capture] stunt team that we recorded for several days and we divided it into several clips. So you have your fallings – everything is recorded actually in motion capture, which looks insane  – but everything is recorded from the ground level. Of course, we're not throwing anyone three floors down. Later we have to cut and clip everything, cut and paste every single bit, so it makes sense. </p><p>It was incredible to work with that, but it was kind of a gigantic puzzle to build all these animation clips while at the same time having this Chimera keyframe animated on top of it and trying to sync everything. This was a very close collaboration with cinematic designers to try and nail that timing together with this insane action sequence.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/20/fall-stunts-1726850169689.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>“For the longest time we couldn't really make it work”, Zbrzeźniak adds. “We needed to be like, ‘This will work eventually, please trust us, we will make it happen’. But there were some tricks that we had to do there. For example, when V is falling down through the air, when you actually would fall [in real life], you would fall much faster. But we had to kind of fake it a bit to achieve a better effect and to also make it readable because in sequences, especially first-person ones, everything that you see is dictated by your perceivable angle of vision. And so we really had to be careful on what we present [to ensure that]the player even understands what's happening in that sequence. Achieving that wasn't an easy task and it went through many, many iterations.”</p><p>What looks like a simple fall actually turned out to be the most complicated part of the sequence for the cinematics team. Ensuring that the most scripted of events looks reactive is an art they put a lot of time and effort into perfecting.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We try to never take full control from the player for too long. It's kind of like a rule, like a philosophy of ours.</p></div><p>“Nothing there is procedural”, Zbrzeźniak continues. “Everything needed to be directed by us and put in a very specific, deliberate place. [We had to make sure that the] destruction that is happening [occurs] at the very precise moment when you're falling through that concrete floor. The smoke needed to go off at the very precise, specific moment. The pieces of debris needed to clear out for you to be able to see where you're falling. And it needed to be clear that you fall down on the tank and roll off from it. So putting this specific part of the sequence [together] was certainly the most challenging, but also the most fun.”</p><p>While this sequence delivers cinematic spectacle in spades, Cyberpunk is a video game, not a movie. As such it’s important that there are still flashes of interactivity through the most scripted of scenes. Not paying attention? Deadly quicktime events will make you pay the price. Zbrzeźniak explains how:</p><p>“We try to never take full control from the player for too long. It's kind of like a rule, like a philosophy of ours. There cannot be  [non-interactive] scenes that are too long, basically. And so on top of it being already difficult and containing multiple elements to piece together to work in perfect sync, we also made it so that you can get hit by the turret if you don't react quickly. If you don't manage to grab the cables, you will bounce off them. And if you don't dodge the spider tanks leg, you’ll get crushed by it.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/20/fall-fails-1726850293543.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>“We wanted to kind of test the streamers a bit. Sometimes during the scenes they just tend to look at the chat, maybe not pay full attention to what's happening on the screen. And in this case, and actually we witnessed it several times, they just died in the middle of the scene because they weren't paying attention. That's exactly what I'm talking about when we talk about scenes in Cyberpunk. You can never really look away. You can never put down your gamepad and just witness the events.”</p><p>The biggest challenge for the player was yet to come, however. After landing, the briefest of respites is granted so that you may gain a bearing of your surroundings. Savour those few seconds, though, because it’s the calm before the biggest storm Cyberpunk has to offer.  What was previously seemingly indestructible is now weakened, but that doesn’t mean it won’t put up one hell of a boss fight.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/20/the-battle-1726850352594.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The fight itself tasks you with taking on the Chimera and its many, many different weapons. It’s here that the design of the tank and the design of the gameplay scenario all comes full circle, with gameplay influencing visual design and vice versa. It’s something that influenced Mielniczuk and the art team's ever-evolving iterations:</p><p>“In the early pre-production of Phantom Liberty, the combat was supposed to happen on the street level. So we were thinking about ranged combat, larger distances, a big arena. Eventually, in the process of designing the expansion, we decided that it would be all held inside the buildings and, eventually, in the abandoned metro station.</p><p>When we ended up with the design of enclosing the whole arena in the interiors, it completely changed the game. So we needed to adjust a few things, but there was a constant negotiation with the gameplay team. In the beginning, I remembered they wanted to have a really fast and agile robot that runs over the ceiling and the walls, and it's all over the place. We wanted to have something super heavy, static, slow, inspired by Ghost in the Shell. So finding the compromise, it took us quite a time, but we found it.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty - Chimera Encounter Early Storyboards</h3></div></output><p>The arena’s not too big, not too small. Also, the device itself, which is designed to fight on the medium and long range, now has to deal with us, the small opponent, which is walking, running around their feet.” </p><p>Through player testing it was discovered that further tweaks to the tank’s design would need to be made. “There are many weapons on that tank and some of them were added very late,” recalls Ubertino. “For example, we found out that being in the middle of the level, if the character goes too close to it, you can keep shooting [with minimal danger]. So we added this [sweeping] beam just to make the player go far away from it.”</p><p>For the sound of the laser, Popiel and the sound team conveniently had the perfect reference point. “We had this case of the laser weaponry in the base game, when you were fighting in Royce's boss fight, and he was using this laser weapon that can sweep the environment. So with the Chimera, we wanted to do it x10. So basically what we went for here is this constant feeling of the threat, but also it needed to give the player information that the laser gun is winding up to give them a chance to hide behind cover and avoid the damage.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty - Chimera Laser and Turret Alternative Designs</h3></div></output><p>It wasn’t just the Chimera’s weapons that needed to be tweaked over time, though. Its armour also needed redesigning. Ubertino continues:</p><p>“Once we had a blockout, I knew that we needed armour, so I started designing the armour and what's underneath the armour and which places we wanted to be destroyed. We also worked with weak spots and we wanted to reveal them in a sense. We used the Kiroshi eyes [cybernetic ability] to reveal them, so you just need to scan and you see them. So I didn't really need to make them yellow or too obvious. It would also be kind of stupid for a weapon to show his weak spots. So using the Kiroshi eyes, it's a fantastic solution.”</p><p>It’s another great example of gameplay and art design working in tandem, and it and other similar combinations all build to the fight’s grand finale. After exploiting the Chimera’s weak spots and disabling it in spectacular fashion, it’s time to deal the killing blow. That finisher, involving the tank’s beating mechanical heart, is the perfect example of every department of the content team coming together.</p><p>“This whole boss fight is this story arc of the tank first being indestructible, impossible to defeat. And we wanted this feeling to slowly, over the course of the sequence, to shift and make you as a player feel more and more empowered”, Zbrzeźniak explains. “Finally the finisher, we wanted to do this kind of exclamation point after the boss fight to really make the tank go out with a bang. We assumed that you're going to be struggling with this guy for quite a long time, and we wanted you to really feel good when you finally destroy it.” </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/20/tank-heart-1726850471326.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>“So we have this Chimera core that resembles a heart,” says Iglesias, “and that was kind of a conversation internally because we said, ‘What looks cooler than having heart beating, heart of your enemy in your hand before you finish them off?’ Later it was super cool because with this multidisciplinary content team, we managed to even make it a piece of loot so later you can craft something out of it. So it is just a very cool ending for it.”</p><p>“The gameplay guys [told] me kind of late in the production that they wanted something to be used by the player, and I was kind of lucky in that case because I had just the spot for it”, Ubertino recalls. “So yeah, I got lucky there. There's a cylinder in the top with a hatch that you can open, take the heart, toss it, and destroy it.”</p><p>“We wanted the heart to sound consistent with the Chimera’s approach to sound design, where it needs to sound organic and mechanical at the same time”, adds Popiel. “I think there's a really cool thing when you just open the hatch and you can actually start hearing the heart beating and then once you grab it and rip it off, you can hear it's basically dying.” </p><p>Teamwork, does, in fact, make the dream work. But, in a level full of towering machines, crumbling architecture, and complex scripting, you’d perhaps expect something explosive to be the biggest challenge the team faced. Well, turns out it’s actually all in the much smaller details, Zbrzeźniak tells us: </p><p>“The small thing actually was to make Myers' rifle be attached to her back when it was necessary. You' will not believe how many issues we had with this one. Sometimes the rifle was going directly through her head. This was probably the biggest issue for us in this entire sequence, the small rifle from Myers.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/20/myers-gun-1726850427701.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>If you look at our game, there's never a situation where characters put guns on their back. It just doesn't happen. But she has a rifle, and since this is a main story [quest], we didn't want to create this artificiality where the rifle is just disappearing when she's putting it away. So we had to come up with a method of her putting the rifle on her back and then taking it out again seamlessly. We had it easier at the beginning because Myers had a pistol, not a rifle, so it was simple. She would just hide it in her pants and that's it, end of story. But no, it was decided that she needs to have a rifle, and the rifle then needs to be a reward for the player. And it created a bit of a complication for us. But it was all fun and games.”</p><p>All fun and games, and months and months of hard work. The Chimera encounter is one of the standout moments of Cyberpunk 2077, a complicated beast at the heart of the Phantom Liberty expansion that wouldn’t have come together without all of the different disciplines at CD Projekt Red combining forces tightly. It’s a mission with as much heart put in as is taken out of its central beast, and as cool as the metal panels that shield it.</p><p><em>Simon Cardy might get himself a pair of mantis blades for Christmas.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wolcen-developer-bullet-noir<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Wolcen: Lords of Mayhem&nbsp;</em>developer Wolcen Studio has announced&nbsp;<em>Bullet Noir</em>, a gritty and stylish top-down shooter that looks to blend&nbsp;<em>Max Payne&nbsp;</em>with&nbsp;<em>Hotline Miami</em>. It's scheduled to land in Early Access later this year.</p>
<p>Like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/hotline-miami-5th-anniversary-retrospective"><em>Hotline Miami</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Bullet Noir&nbsp;</em>will let you choose your approach; you can either break doors down and go in all guns blazing, or you can adopt a more methodical and stealthy approach to maps instead.</p>
<p>Of course, in&nbsp;<em>Hotline Miami</em>, the stealthy approach very often gave way to bullet hell carnage (for me, at least), so it'll be interesting to see whether&nbsp;<em>Bullet Noir&nbsp;</em>can pull off this mixture of approaches and make both of them feel rewarding.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bullet-noir-wolcen-dev-gameplay.jpg?itok=zsHJ-NgU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bullet-noir-wolcen-dev-gameplay.jpg?itok=bx3hCY_q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Bullet Noir&nbsp;</em>has more than a shade of&nbsp;<em>Hotline Miami&nbsp;</em>about it.</figcaption></figure><p>Wolcen Studio is also promising a "rich, story-driven experience" in&nbsp;<em>Bullet Noir</em>, one that tells the interconnected stories of four distinct protagonists.</p>
<p>As you play, you'll discover how each character's story dovetails with the main plot, and you'll also navigate each protagonist's "personal journey", so there'll be plenty of narrative meat to sink your teeth into.</p>
<p>According to Wolcen Studio, each of the game's characters will also have unique abilities you'll be able to use to take on combat challenges "in creative ways". Each chapter focuses on a different character, too, so you'll get a chance to try out each one.</p>
<p>You can take a look at the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Bullet Noir</em>, which gives a sense of what the stylish art will look like in motion, right here.</p>

<p>If you're a fan of games like the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>Hotline Miami</em>, as well as adjacent titles like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/otxo-review"><em>Otxo</em></a>, you'll probably find lots to like in&nbsp;<em>Bullet Noir</em>.</p>
<p>You'll get the chance to discover whether that's the case or not when&nbsp;<em>Bullet Noir&nbsp;</em>lands on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3204960/Bullet_Noir/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> on November 4th. Stay tuned for more on this.</p>

It’s a dark, atmospheric game set in a procession of ruined streets and abandoned buildings, where your flashlight is often the only source of illumination.<br></p><p>If you like exploring old buildings and abandoned neighborhoods, interspersed with the occasional puzzle or zombie brawl, you’re set for <em>Hollowbody</em>.</p><h2 id="h4857"><a id=""></a><strong>What Should I Know About <em>Hollowbody </em>Before I Start?</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="33c724f96fba0b1ef841bc941caef1df" data-recommend-id="image://33c724f96fba0b1ef841bc941caef1df" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Hollowbody fighting." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Hollowbody fighting." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Headware Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="33c724f96fba0b1ef841bc941caef1df" data-recommend-id="image://33c724f96fba0b1ef841bc941caef1df" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Hollowbody fighting." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>First off: <em>Hollowbody</em>’s resources are more scarce than those of the <em>Silent Hill </em>games that inspired it. If you aren’t careful, it’s easy to run yourself out of ammunition right around the same time that some tougher enemies start showing up. But worry not, you’ve got access to some good melee weapons, such as a spiked bat and an improvised ax, but they don’t work equally well on everything you’ll encounter.<br></p><p>So go into <em>Hollowbody</em> with an eye toward conserving your health and ammo, the same way you would in a <em>Resident Evil </em>game. Don’t get into any fights if you don’t have to, and when you do need to take out an enemy, try to use your bat or ax whenever possible.<br></p><p>Second: if you’re a serious arachnophobe, steer clear of this one. Trust us.</p><p>One final thing that I wish I’d known before I started: you don’t hit a real point of no return in <em>Hollowbody </em>until right near its end. You’ll probably know it when you see it.<br></p><p>Before then, you can backtrack all the way to Mica’s starting point, although it takes a while and you might have to dodge a few new enemies. There are a couple of big secrets and one useful weapon that can only be secured by returning to the first area with some of the later key items.</p><h2 id="h4858"><a id=""></a><strong>How Long Is <em>Hollowbody</em>?</strong></h2><p>My first blind run on Intended (normal) difficulty took about six-and-a-half hours. At the time of writing, you can’t skip all the way through cinematics, so <em>Hollowbody </em>isn’t very speedrun-friendly.<br></p><p>Once you know the routes and puzzle solutions, you could probably clear<em> Hollowbody </em>in well under three hours, especially if you skipped as many fights as possible. In order to unlock 100 percent of its achievements, you’ll need to run through it at least three times, one of which has to be on its hardest difficulty.</p><h2 id="h4859"><a id=""></a><strong>How Many Endings Does <em>Hollowbody </em>have?</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="96bf0447504c2d7e73908164da16f75e" data-recommend-id="image://96bf0447504c2d7e73908164da16f75e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A man stands on the ledge of a building." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A man stands on the ledge of a building." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Headware Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="96bf0447504c2d7e73908164da16f75e" data-recommend-id="image://96bf0447504c2d7e73908164da16f75e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A man stands on the ledge of a building." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>On a fresh save, you can get one of two endings. Which one you get appears to be triggered by the results of a plot-mandatory conversation near the end of the first area, with no other influencing factors.<br></p><p>A third ending is available if you manage a zero- to low-damage run through the game on the unlockable Punished difficulty.</p><h2 id="h4860"><a id=""></a><strong>What Kinds of Collectibles Are There In <em>Hollowbody</em>?</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="a179929b77a26a8876aeba04eada3991" data-recommend-id="image://a179929b77a26a8876aeba04eada3991" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Obligatory toilet screenshot." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Obligatory toilet screenshot." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Headware Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a179929b77a26a8876aeba04eada3991" data-recommend-id="image://a179929b77a26a8876aeba04eada3991" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Obligatory toilet screenshot." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There are a total of 34 collectibles in <em>Hollowbody</em>.<br></p><p>Eight are “lost signals,” where you can use Mica’s pocket radio to tune into old broadcasts in specific areas throughout the game. All eight of these signals have unique achievements tied to them, such as <strong>State Regulations</strong> and <strong>Occupational Hazard</strong>, and you’ll unlock the <strong>Walkie-Talkie</strong> achievement for finding all eight.</p><p>You can also find a total of 26 documents throughout the game, only one of which is ever put permanently off-limits.

Facing an existential malaise, Belova takes a job that ends up entangling her and a bunch of other washed-up Cold War operators like Taskmaster (Olga Kurylenko), Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen), U.S. Agent (Wyatt Russell), and Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) with a CIA run by Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus). Lots of punching, shooting, and car chases ensue, as well as a stripped-down remix of The Pixies’ “Where Is My Mind?” We also get a peak at the new Sentry (Lewis Pullman).&nbsp;</p><p>Take a look:</p><p>Pugh and Harbour’s on-screen charisma and father-daughter dynamic helps give the <em>Thunderbolts</em> trailer the feel of something beyond just another pit-stop on the never-ending MCU content roadmap. Louis-Dreyfus, putting a more sinister spin on her “WTF” smile and laugh from HBO’s <em>Veep,</em> is also putting in work. It helps that at least some of the big scenes in the trailer look like they were filmed in the actual real world instead of against a green screen, or at the very least with all of the principle actors actually in the same room together. </p><p><em>Thunderbolts</em>, which releases in May 2025, is part of a one-two punch with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/captain-america-brave-new-world-trailer-red-hulk-1851589562&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/captain-america-brave-new-world-trailer-red-hulk-1851589562"><em>Captain America: Brave New World</em></a></span>, which premiers months earlier on February 14. Harrison Ford plays President Thaddeus “Thunderbolt” Ross in that movie, complete with a Red Hulk transformation. It’s unclear if he’ll also be reprising that role in<em> Thunderbolts</em>, but it could be one of a number of interesting tie-ins between the two blockbusters. I’m sure, though, that really dedicated fans will also be retracing all of the steps leading up to <em>Thunderbolts </em>that Marvel has been laying out in its Disney+ streaming shows. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Rocksteady Studios could be returning to the Batman franchise in a more traditional sense. </p>



<p>According to leaker and rumormonger <a href="https://x.com/Shpeshal_Nick" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Shpeshal Nick</a>, he understands that Rocksteady is, in fact, working on a new Batman game. On top of that, he think’s Sony is trying to make a play for exclusivity in some way.</p>



<p>“Not sure which studio people’s dreams is, but I heard Rocksteady are back making it,” he <a href="https://x.com/shpeshal_nick/status/1838116987236655458" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said in a response</a> to a Tweet asking for fans’ dream developers on the next Batman game. “I also think Sony are trying to moneyhat it lol.”</p>



<p>No other information about what a new Batman game from Rocksteady would entail. The main question is would it be similar to the Batman games of the past — a single-player game — or would they go the live-service route due to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-live-service/">parent company Warner Bros. Games being determined</a> to keep making them?</p>



<p>Rocksteady hasn’t worked on a true Batman game since 2015’s Batman: Arkham Knight wrapped up the original Arkham trilogy. Since then they worked on the mixed Arkham VR for PC and PS4 in 2016 and 2023’s disappointing Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League.</p>



<p>It’s important to keep in mind that Insider Gaming has yet to independently verify this information. Nor has anything been officially confirmed by Warner Bros. Games or Rocksteady themselves. That said, if they are working on a new Batman game, it’s still likely years away from any sort of release.</p>

            <p>The mass exodus of staff from hit indie game company Annapurna earlier this month has been described as "a baffler" by a company spokesperson.</p>
<p>The publisher - responsible for the likes of Stray, Outer Wilds, and Cocoon - saw its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/annapurna-interactive-sees-exodus-of-entire-staff-as-negotiations-break-down">entire staff quit  following a dispute with the company's owner</a> that's put its future in jeopardy.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/developers-rush-to-reassure-players-of-forthcoming-releases-following-annapurna-interactive-mass-exodus">Developers working on projects with Annapurna have since reassured players they will still be able to play planned future releases</a>, but it remains unclear how the dispute can be resolved or how Annapurna will continue with its projects. It is, however, openly hiring to replace staff.</p>

<p>"The whole situation is a baffler, but now we're focused on moving forward," reads a statement from an Annapurna spokesperson to IGN.</p>
<p>"We've had really great conversations with an overwhelming majority of our existing development teams and are grateful for their partnership. If our inbox is any indication, a ton of developers continue to want to be a part of what we're building, and we look forward to seeing their pitches. We've also had an influx of quality job applicants and are excited to build a team passionate about our mission to tell original stories that aren't being told elsewhere. P.S. We're hiring."</p>
<p>One project left in a precarious position is Annapurna's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/blade-runner">Blade Runner</a> 2033: Labyrinth, its first in-house game. Game director Chelsea Hash appears to have left the company (per <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/saveremreve/">LinkedIn</a>) and, IGN understands, all other full-time members of the development team are out. Annapurna told IGN development on the project will continue despite these departures.</p>
<p>So what exactly happened to cause all staff to leave at once?</p>
<p>As per a lengthy <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-the-heck-has-been-going-on-at-annapurna-interactive-an-investigation">new report from IGN</a>, upheaval began in mid-March 2024 when <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/annapurnainteractive">Annapurna Interactive</a> co-founder James Masi was suddenly and unexpectedly let go. Annapurna president Nathan Gary also left the company, which Annapurna claimed was voluntary. However, sources told IGN both execs had been fired, sparking fury among staff - some even left in protest.</p>
<p>When Annapurna founder Megan Ellison allegedly expressed to staff the desire for all staff to stay, Masi, Gary and other staff returned and a new plan was formed: to form a new company called Verset with split ownership between Annapurna and Verset's leaders. However, staff eventually became sceptical of the plan owing to the return of Hector Sanchez (who previously left the company) to work on gaming projects without their knowledge.</p>
<p>This led to a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-and-control-film-and-television-rights-acquired-by-annapurna">deal between Remedy and Annapurna Pictures</a> for the film and TV rights to Control and Alan Wake, reportedly without the knowledge of staff. Ellison's intent for the two companies, a spokesperson told IGN, was for Verset to deal with indie games and Sanchez to lead on AAA and transmedia projects. Sources also told IGN Ellison herself began to exercise greater control over Annapurna Interactive in a way they found uncomfortable.</p>
<p>The situation ultimately reached a head in August when all 25 Annapurna Interactive staff signed a joint resignation letter and provided two weeks' notice before leaving on 6th September. Reportedly, partner developers did not learn about this mass departure until a day or two before, seemingly due to a dispute over whose responsibility this was.</p>
<p>While the staff who left could potentially be continuing the Verset company (as per a <a href="https://verset.com/">website currently online</a>), Annapurna has been left scrambling to replenish its workforce.</p>
<p>Annapurna's future projects include the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-artful-escape-developers-next-is-teen-drama-mixtape">Mixtape</a> from Beethoven and Dinosaur, Wanderstop from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-stanley-parable">The Stanley Parable</a> creator Davey Wreden, and No Code's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-townfall">Silent Hill: Townfall</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>According to a reputable insider, Resident Evil 9 could be announced soon, with a release date set for the second half of 2025. Many rumors have already been circulating throughout 2024, with rumors surrounding the game's starring characters, protagonist, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-is-official-director-it-was-difficult-to-figure-out-what-to-do-after-7-but-i-found-it-and-it-is-substantial/">other ambitions</a> popping up every so often. It was rumored that Resident Evil 9's reveal was going to happen this summer, but the plan was postponed at the last minute.</p>
<p>Lunatic Ignus is a reputable industry insider and has claimed in their Discord channel that the teaser for Resident Evil 9 will be coming in the following weeks or months. While this doesn't sound like much information at all to many people, and this rumor is quite vague in the grand scheme of things, Ignus also said that Resident Evil 9 can be expected to be released in the second half of 2025. This comes after a previous rumor said that Resident Evil 9's release has been delayed to late 2025, which adds more fuel to the rumor fire.</p>

<p>There are a couple of major events coming up in the next couple of months that could all be possible times for Resident Evil 9 to be announced. The rumored PlayStation State of Play will be held on September 24, followed by the Tokyo Game Show 2024 on September 26. On December 12, the Game Awards will be held, which is often home to some major release announcements.</p>
<p>The announcement window would be consistent with previous release patterns for Capcom, as they have consistently announced the games a year in advance. The insider didn't give any details on where and when Resident Evil 9 would be revealed, so it's completely up in the air now. However, <a href="https://tgs.nikkeibp.co.jp/tgs/2024/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tokyo Game Show 2024</a> and The Game Awards are both likely candidates, as Capcom is an exhibitor at Tokyo Game Show this year. Of course, we won't be able to know until the announcement comes.</p>
<p>However, if a State of Play is coming, it is also possible that it'll be announced there, as Capcom and PlayStation have a strong business relationship. Resident Evil Village was announced during PlayStation's Future of Gaming event in 2020, with the Resident Evil 4 remake being announced during a 2022 State of Play. If the State of Play is confirmed to be happening in the coming days, it is very possible that fans will see Resident Evil 9 announced at the State of Play.</p>
