			<p>The console war between PlayStation and Xbox is as old as time, and it doesn't seem to be slowing down any time soon. While it has been a financially rocky period for both PlayStation and Xbox, Xbox certainly suffered more than its competitor. However, an analyst in the gaming industry has shared that they think that Xbox is actually doing pretty well for themselves and has a bright future ahead of them.</p>
<p>Mat Piscatella, Executive Director of games at Circana, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/xbox-series-x/despite-a-rocky-couple-of-years-analyst-reckons-xboxs-console-war-is-actually-looking-pretty-bright-if-you-look-at-the-playstation-sales-chart-you-see-a-lot-of-microsoft-on-there/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spoke to GamesRadar+</a> about Xbox's history and what is in store for them in the future. According to Piscatella, if you look at the <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-remains-one-of-top-played-games-across-3-platforms-in-us-sonic-frontiers-gets-resurgence/">overall sales</a> and what is going on in the PlayStation sales chart, you may find that there is a fair amount of Microsoft on their charts. He says that for Xbox to be successful, they need to branch out to embrace other platforms instead of competing against them, which will boost their sales considerably.</p>
<p>"You can look towards the future and some of the things they've talked about; expanding the reach of the Xbox brand well beyond the Xbox console is a key initiative, and they're executing on that."</p>
<p>2024 was their most obvious attempt to date regarding moving away from their console and branching out and funneling money into other money makers. For example, Xbox started to promote Game Pass pretty heavily. While for a lot of companies, subscriptions don't particularly do well, Game Pass has a lot of potential as it allows those on PC and Xbox to access games for a fixed price, giving them access to triple-A titles and indie games.</p>
<p>While Game Pass is important to Xbox, Piscatella believes that they need to balance out their approach to Game Pass and their other services, rather than honing in on it so heavily.</p>
<p>"I think it has a really nice role to fill in a portfolio of products being offered to consumers. But perhaps the previous strategy of going all in on just that, course correcting them seems to have been a good decision."</p>
<p>Their competitor, PlayStation, made obvious efforts last year to work on putting some of their games on other platforms, instead of keeping them as a console exclusive. So far, this has worked tremendously in their favor. Games such as Helldivers 2 have been massively successful across both PC and PlayStation 5. When it comes to exclusives, Xbox doesn't really have that many on offer that players are desperate for, and as a result, they are trying to be more aggressive in getting Xbox titles shipped to other platforms to ensure the most profits.</p>

The lengthy technical document outlines a process for AI-upscaling that could be used to improve image quality using software rather than raw processing power, similar to DLSS used by Nvidia GPUs for PC gaming, as well as PSSR which was recently introduced by Sony for the PlayStation 5 Pro. </p><p>Dale also points out another potential use of the technology: keeping game file sizes small. Nintendo’s first-party releases on the current Switch are infamous for how optimized they are. <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> is the company’s biggest game on the platform and it’s still only 18.2GB.<strong> </strong>Higher resolution textures and other improved assets can all dramatically increase that digital footprint, however.</p><p> The patent outlines an example where native 4K textures might bump a game’s install size up to 60GB, while a 1080 native version that uses upscaling could get away with just 20GB, which is still less than the current 32GB cap on existing Switch cartridge memory sizes. </p><p>News of the patent comes alongside more alleged leaks about the Switch 2 hardware itself. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-images-leaks-ai-fake-reddit-1851729048&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-images-leaks-ai-fake-reddit-1851729048">Following a recent influx of possible first-look images at the upgraded console</a></span>, there are now <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1hqu83a/switch_2_motherboard/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1hqu83a/switch_2_motherboard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">potential photos of the hardware’s actual motherboard</a></span> floating around online. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-new-staff-post-please-read.55/page-3804#post-1495792&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-new-staff-post-please-read.55/page-3804#post-1495792" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This has led to some heated debate</a></span> about what semiconductor manufacturing process was used to create the Switch 2's chip and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/dark1x/status/1874534475734073681&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/dark1x/status/1874534475734073681" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">thus how powerful it might be</a></span>. </p><p>Ultimately, however, it’s impossible to know just how powerful the Switch 2 will be compared to the existing, seven-year-old hardware, until we get a sense of the full list of trade-offs Nintendo has decided on once it reveals the official list of specs and features. If the current Switch has proven anything, it’s that the <em>Mario</em> maker knows how to squeeze great results out of more affordable technology. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Last year was a great year for sports video games. In 2024, we saw the return of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inside-the-response-to-college-football-25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">college football</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/undisputed-review-redefining-the-boxing-game-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">boxing console games</a>, fantastic new indie titles, and some of the highest-rated games in the history of long-running franchises. But if 2024 was that great, just how much better could 2025 be? If what’s expected to release in any indication, sports fans could be in for another stellar year. So, let’s take a look at the biggest sports video games expected to release in 2025.</p>



<p>Whether you want to hit the links, drive around the track, or get back on the football field, there’s going to be no shortage of options for your this year.</p>

<h2 id="h-biggest-sports-games-of-2025">Biggest Sports Games Of 2025</h2>



<h3 id="h-college-football-26">College Football 26</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>College Football 25 took the world by storm in 2024, and became the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/college-football-25-remains-2024s-best-selling-video-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best-selling sports video game</a> in United States history. What’s more, the game has remained at the top of the 2024 sales charts in the United States, even keeping games like Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 at bay. So, naturally, it’s time to think about just how EA Sports will follow up with this year’s game.</p>



<p>We know it’s coming, but what will College Football 26 do to improve on the first college football game in 11 years? Will Road to Glory see added depth? Will Team Builder allow for custom stadiums? Facility improvements in Dynasty Mode? Will it come to PC? There’s a lot that can be done to keep the momentum going in 2025.</p>

<h3 id="h-pga-tour-2k25">PGA Tour 2K25</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>A game that hasn’t officially been announced yet, PGA Tour 2K25 is currently planned for a release by March 31, 2025. At least, that’s what <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-pga-tour-2k-game-confirmed-for-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Take-Two CFO Laine Goldstein let slip</a> during the company’s Q2 FY2025 earnings call last November. Since then, there has been no mention of the upcoming game in any capacity, seemingly confirming that it wasn’t supposed to be mentioned on the call. However, now that the game’s out there in the open, it seems like it’s only a matter of time before fans find out how it’ll improve upon PGA Tour 2K23.</p>



<h3 id="h-wwe-2k25">WWE 2K25</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>WWE 2K24 was the best-selling and highest-rated game in the WWE 2K franchise since Take-Two acquired the WWE license in 2013. The game wasn’t without it’s issues, however, which makes WWE 2K25 all the more anticipated. Sources have told Insider Gaming that due to the success of 2024, Take-Two is investing more into the game. So, the hope is that it translates into improvements that fans have been hoping for for years, such as updates to the game’s Universe Mode.</p>

<h3 id="h-iracing-nascar-25">iRacing NASCAR 25</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>It’s been over three years since NASCAR fans have received a proper video game — if you want to call NASCAR 21: Ignition a proper game. That’s what makes this year so exciting. A new NASCAR console game is scheduled for the fall, and it’s the first one coming from iRacing since it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nascar-announces-new-console-game-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">purchased the license</a> from Motorsport Games. </p>



<p>The deal was announced in October 2023, and it’s been pretty quiet on the update front from the team working on the game. We know it’s going to be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-iracing-nascar-console-game-monster-games-in-unreal-engine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">built in Unreal Engine with Monster Games</a> leading the way as well as it being available on PS5, Xbox Series, PC, and, as of today, Nintendo Switch. With the 2025 NASCAR season right around the corner, we should start getting more information on what to expect sooner rather than later.</p>

                <p>Game designer Hideo Kojima <a href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1873951232764895628" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">provided an update</a> on his in-development games, including Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, OD, and Physint. Starting with the latter two, both were impacted by the SAG-AFTRA strike for video game actors, which began in July 2024 and remains ongoing.</p><p>For OD, which is in the works alongside Microsoft and Xbox, Kojima said his teams "developed the game" and did scanning efforts for environments and the actors themselves. Scanning and filming for OD was suspended due to the strike, however. For Physint, which is being published by Sony, Kojima said casting was suspended due to the strike. "We hope to resume [in 2025]," Kojima said.</p><p>As for Death Stranding 2, Kojima said, "We started to play and build up the game." He added that his teams conducted music production and recording, along with ADR for the actors.</p><p>Games that went into development prior to September 2023 are understood to be exempt from the strike, along ongoing with live-service games. This likely explains why OD and Physint were impacted but Death Stranding 2 was not.</p><p>OD will feature the actors Sophia Lillis, Hunter Schafer, and Udo Kier, with Oscar-winning director Jordan Peele contributing to the script. The cast for Physint, meanwhile, is unknown at this point. Death Stranding 2, meanwhile, features Norman Reedus, Lea Seydoux, Troy Baker, Elle Fanning, and other celebrities.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-members-who-work-video-games-go-strike" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">strike began July 26, at 12:01 AM</a>. It's the first time SAG-AFTRA video game actors have gone on strike since 2016, when the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-video-game-voice-actor-strike-is-ending/1100-6453577/" data-ref-id="1100-6453577">work stoppage lasted for about one year.</a></p><p>SAG-AFTRA and game publishers like Warner Bros., Activision, Disney, and others, negotiated for about two years prior to the strike being called. The key sticking point appears to be regulation of generative AI technology.</p><p>Beyond games, Kojima said preparations and planning are underway for the Death Stranding movie and "other adaptations" of Kojima's games. When Physint was announced, Kojima also confirmed a partnership with Sony's Columbia Pictures, so it seems there could be a Physint film in the works as well.</p><p>Kojima attended The Game Awards in December 2024, but had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kojima-on-lack-of-announcements-at-the-game-awards-sorry-about-that/1100-6528464/" data-ref-id="1100-6528464">no announcements to share.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/2/24334067/samsung-odyssey-g8-g6-3d-smart-monitor-m9-specs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Just a few days after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/29/24331748/lg-ultragear-gx9-bendable-oled-5k2k-monitors-specs">LG announced</a> its CES 2025 lineup of monitors, Samsung is doing the same. The company just introduced several new models, and perhaps the most impressive among them is the Odyssey OLED G81SF. It’s a 27-inch 4K monitor with a maximum refresh rate of 240Hz, 0.03ms response time, a glare-free display, and rear-core lighting with 52 color options. Samsung is also including a number of burn-in protection measures to ensure that the Odyssey G81SF’s screen looks pristine for years to come. The G8 is likely to be using the latest and greatest OLED panel from Samsung Display.</p><p>Next up is the Odyssey OLED G60SF — also a 27-inch OLED monitor — with a QHD resolution and an impressive 500Hz refresh rate that Samsung says effectively “eliminates lag and motion blur for ultra-smooth gameplay during critical moments.”</p><p>In 2025, Samsung is also finally shipping the Odyssey 3D monitor it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/9/24031774/play-vr-games-without-a-vr-headset">first teased at least year’s CES</a>. It lets you experience 3D visuals <em>without</em> any special glasses by using a lenticular lens on the front panel. “Eye tracking monitors the movement of both eyes using a built-in stereo camera, while view mapping continuously adjusts the image to enhance depth perception,” Samsung said in its press release. The Odyssey 3D only comes in a 27-inch 4K size; the larger 37-inch display <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/21/24225133/samsung-odyssey-3d-gaming-monitor-glasses-free-announcement">mentioned last year</a> has apparently been scrapped. The company says it offers “a rapid 1ms gray-to-gray response time, and a 165Hz refresh rate.”</p><div><figcaption><em>Samsung’s Smart Monitor series is making the switch to OLED.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Samsung</cite></p></div><p>That does it for the gaming-focused monitors, but Samsung is also announcing two others that are more focused on everyday productivity. The SmartMonitor series is finally going OLED with the new Smart Monitor M9. And this year, Samsung is throwing in a ton of AI capabilities including AI Picture Optimizer. Like on its TVs, this feature “analyzes input signals to determine the type of content being viewed — such as gaming, video, or productivity applications — and automatically adjust the display settings for the best visual experience.” This also works for gaming and can detect the genre of what you’re playing.</p><p>AI Upscaling Pro can make lower-res content look crisper at the M9’s 4K resolution, and the monitor has a maximum refresh rate of 165Hz. That’s a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23180741/samsung-m8-smart-monitor-review-32-inch-4k-smart-tv-usb-c-hdr">significant upgrade from the M8</a>, which topped out at 60Hz. Samsung says moving to OLED also allows for a new “ultra-slim” design for the Smart Monitor M9 that should take up considerably less desk space.</p><p>The last monitor being announced (at least for today) is the only non-OLED model of the bunch. The new 37-inch ViewFinity S8 has a 16:9 aspect ratio, a built-in KVM switch, 90W USB-C passthrough charging, and covers 99 percent of the sRGB color gamut. Peak brightness for this 4K display tops out at 350 nits, which should be perfectly suitable for anything you’ll be doing at a desk.</p><p>Pricing and release dates are still to come, but <em>The Verge</em> will be in Las Vegas for CES 2025 in a matter of days. So you won’t have to wait much longer for some first-hand impressions of Samsung’s new monitors.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Each of <em>Oblivion</em>’s nine regions of Cyrodiil has unique flora and fauna for the team to recreate, and that’s on top of the enormous landscapes and cities.</p><p>The Gold Coast, for instance, is all but complete, with a new version of main city Anvil, “re-envisioned to realize its original concept art.” It’s the most wildly ambitious project, and as you’ll see in the video below, it looks <em>wonderful</em>.</p><p>Given <em>Skyrim</em> itself is 13 years old, it’s a testament to its engine how stunning <em>Skyblivion</em> is looking (albeit boosted by Bethesda’s own <em>Skyrim: Special Edition</em> upgrades). It does seem a bit galling that Bethesda will be sitting on whatever tech they’re using for <em>The Elder Scrolls VI</em>, but this still looks so, so much better than the 19-year-old <em>Oblivion</em> original.</p><p>The video’s narration makes clear that in order to release <em>Skyblivion</em>, they are legally required to remake every asset, including all the 3D models, which is a task of unimaginable magnitude. (Bethesda had a team of hundreds working for four years at full pay to do this the first time—this is a group of unpaid volunteers working in their spare time.) As such, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://skyblivion.com/volunteer/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://skyblivion.com/volunteer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the team is looking for more volunteers</a></span>—especially for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation_mesh&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation_mesh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">navmeshing</a></span>, UI and 3D modeling—to help them get the game over the line.</p><figure id="" data-id="8550ca352cd14e6cc4e20537a23563d2" data-recommend-id="image://8550ca352cd14e6cc4e20537a23563d2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1074" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image of a sunny, autumnal glen, with Worldspaces progress bars on the left." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An image of a sunny, autumnal glen, with Worldspaces progress bars on the left." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->TES Renewal Project / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8550ca352cd14e6cc4e20537a23563d2" data-recommend-id="image://8550ca352cd14e6cc4e20537a23563d2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1074" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image of a sunny, autumnal glen, with Worldspaces progress bars on the left." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This whole thing blows my mind. The Skyblivion Team has also written new music for each section of the game, and they’re even considering porting across the DLC when this main game is finished. Planned since 2011, prototyped by 2014, and in full development from 2018, they’re confident for a 2025 release, likely years ahead of Bethesda’s own follow-up, <em>The Elder Scrolls VI: Hammerfell</em>.</p><p>Kudos to Bethesda for letting extraordinary projects like these thrive, rather than sending takedown notifications and legal threats. To be able to play <em>Skyblivion</em>, you will be required to own legitimate versions of both <em>Oblivion GOTY Deluxe </em>and <em>Skyrim: Special Edition</em>, although given you can currently pick up <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/900883/The_Elder_Scrolls_IV_Oblivion_Game_of_the_Year_Edition_Deluxe/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/900883/The_Elder_Scrolls_IV_Oblivion_Game_of_the_Year_Edition_Deluxe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the former for $5</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/489830/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim_Special_Edition/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/489830/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim_Special_Edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the latter for $10</a></span> on Steam, that’s not a big outlay.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This premium pass is said to include the Front Man operator skin and other cosmetic items.</p><p dir="ltr">In the past, Call of Duty has included other major IP collaborations with event rewards themed around <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-collab-arrives-in-call-of-duty-mw3-and-warzone-this-week/1100-6524372/">Fallout</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-mw3-and-warzone-walking-dead-event-all-rewards-and-challenges/2900-5131/">The Walking Dead</a>, Dune, Warhammer, and more. Outside of the shop bundles, all of the event rewards could be earned for free by completing challenges or simply earning XP. This upcoming Squid Game event has the potential to be the first to lock some of the rewards behind an additional cost.</p><p dir="ltr">Activision hasn't revealed the full details of the Squid Game event, so we don't know how much it costs, and it's possible the details could change between now and the launch date. Currently, Black Ops 6 is a $70 game with the options for either a $10 standard battle pass or $30 extra-premium BlackCell pass for each season. It's also available via several Game Pass plans across Xbox and PC.</p><p dir="ltr">The Call of Duty and Squid Game crossover trailer can be seen above, which shows off several operator skins themed around the show. Season 1 of Call of Duty is currently winding down, and Season 2 should arrive near the end of January.</p>

However, now Game Science CEO Feng Ji has posted to Chinese social media platform Weibo to say it’s absolutely because of that, and specifically the lack of it in the Xbox Series S.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196181" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="180" data-playlist="196181,196230,197298" data-current="196181"><div><p>The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21718.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>God bless the Series S—a console so cheap that a few friends and I clubbed together to get it as a wedding present for a chum—but as we enter the second half of this console generation’s lifespan, it’s definitely becoming a problem for developers.

Perhaps a more experienced team could achieve it, but it’s seemingly beyond what Game Science is able to deliver right now. And given the enormous complexity and GFX-pushing nature of <em>Wukong</em>, Game Science has delivered an <em>extraordinary</em> amount. (It’s worth noting that Microsoft mad an exception to their rule for <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-xbox-series-x-s-split-screen-co-op-rpg-1850770513&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-xbox-series-x-s-split-screen-co-op-rpg-1850770513">where Larian could never get the Series S to handle co-op</a></span>.)</p><p>But the remarks raise concerns about Microsoft’s previous statements on the matter.

This followed leaks and rumors in August about the game supposedly failing Xbox’s “bug detection tests,” while <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-xbox-delay-due-to-sony-exclusivity-deal-not-tech-issues-according-to-source&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-xbox-delay-due-to-sony-exclusivity-deal-not-tech-issues-according-to-source" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">insiders told <em>IGN</em></a></span> that it was instead due to an unannounced exclusivity deal between Game Science and Sony. This was also tacitly suggested by Microsoft itself when asked about the lack of the game on its console, responding (emphasis ours):</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>We’re excited for the launch of Black Myth Wukong on Xbox Series X|S and are working with Game Science to bring the game to our platforms. <strong>We can’t comment on the deals made by our partners with other platform holders</strong>, but we remain focused on making Xbox the best platform for gamers, and great games are at the center of that.</p></blockquote><p>And yet, this all followed <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.heishenhua.com/news/detail?id=11&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.heishenhua.com/news/detail?id=11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Game Science’s July explanation for the delay</a></span> on Xbox, which stated, “We are currently optimizing the Xbox Series X|S version to meet our quality standards, so it won’t release simultaneously with the other platforms...We will announce the release date as soon as it meets our quality standards.”</p><p>So yes, it all comes full-circle with the latest statement from Ji, once again insisting the issue is the Series S’s limitations.</p><p>The Series S is a pretty extraordinarily little machine, making console gaming far more affordable, but it’s undeniably a thorn in the side of many developers who would far rather optimize for the top-end devices, instead of needing to create fully functioning versions on much more restrictive technology. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.vg247.com/bringing-dune-awakening-to-the-xbox-series-s-will-be-a-challenge-according-to-funcom-chief-product-officer&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.vg247.com/bringing-dune-awakening-to-the-xbox-series-s-will-be-a-challenge-according-to-funcom-chief-product-officer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Just ask <em>Dune Awakening</em>’s CPO, Scott Junior</a></span>.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We still don't know, but COO Johan Pilestedt has now confirmed he has an idea for what the team may make next.</p><p>Posting on social media, Pilestedt said, "What are your expectations and desires for what the next Arrowhead game will be? I am working on the high concept..."</p><p>The executive then invited people to share their "speculation" as to what Arrowhead could build next. One person said they'd like to see Arrowhead make a Star Fox-style game where players zip around on aircraft during on-rails missions before a level becomes open-world during a boss fight. Pilestedt said this matches up with the concept for a game Arrowhead wanted to make, "Eagles of Democracy." He even shared some images of this title--check them out below.</p><p>Someone else said they want to see Arrowhead develop a remake of the 1990 retro twin-stick shooter Smash TV. Pilestedt said his team actually created a high concept for this, saying it was aiming to be a top-down re-imagining of the classic arcade game.</p><p>The executive didn't elaborate as to why these two concepts never materialized. However, it's not uncommon in the creative process for ideas to be conceived and then never amount to anything.</p><p>While fans wait to see what Arrowhead might make next, there is still lots more planned for Helldivers 2 as part of its live-service programming. Its latest DLC, a crossover with Killzone, launched in December and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-boss-says-blame-us-not-sony-for-killzone-dlc-pricing/1100-6528564/" data-ref-id="1100-6528564">didn't go over perfectly with fans due its pricing and other issues.</a> Arrowhead <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-boss-says-blame-us-not-sony-for-killzone-dlc-pricing/1100-6528564/" data-ref-id="1100-6528564">made changes and apologized to fans</a> over this.</p><p>As of November 2024, Helldivers 2 is the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2024s-best-selling-games-in-the-us/2900-5106/#1" data-ref-id="2900-5106">No. 3 best-selling game of 2024, trailing only Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and College Football 25.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gothic-1-remake-will-launch-in-2025-developer-says.1072677/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gothic-1-remake-2025-release-window<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Alkimia Interactive has revealed a new&nbsp;<em>Gothic 1 Remake&nbsp;</em>release window, although it's perhaps not quite as specific as you might like if you've been waiting for the game since its announcement.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1297900/announcements/detail/519700531080333166" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post on Steam</a>, Alkimia wishes the game's fans and followers a happy new year, promising that 2025 will be "a truly key year" for&nbsp;<em>Gothic 1 Remake&nbsp;</em>and that it is "working tirelessly" to release the game.</p>

<p>A user named Mr Patrick <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1297900/eventcomments/600766396226347151?snr=1_5_9_#c600766396226353492" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">commented on that post</a>,&nbsp;saying that Alkimia "won't even inform [us] about [the] release date" after telling players they would "get the game in 2024". Alkimia refutes this claim in <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1297900/eventcomments/600766396226347151?snr=1_5_9_#c600766396226353606" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a reply</a>, then says that&nbsp;<em>Gothic 1 Remake&nbsp;</em>"will be released in 2025".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gothic-1-remake-2025-release-window-combat.jpg?itok=jrcgEJmI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gothic-1-remake-2025-release-window-combat.jpg?itok=XcHcjE1B 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Gothic 1 Remake&nbsp;</em>finally has a (very broad) release window.</figcaption></figure><p>While a promise that the game will launch in 2025 doesn't sound like much, this is technically the first time Alkimia and publisher THQ Nordic have committed to any kind of release window for&nbsp;<em>Gothic 1 Remake</em>.</p>

<p>Indeed, a collector's edition for the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gothic-1-remake-collectors-edition" rel="nofollow">was revealed in April</a>, allowing players to spend huge amounts of money on a game that still didn't have a release date or window nailed down.</p>

<p>It's nice to know that the two studios haven't given up on&nbsp;<em>Gothic 1 Remake</em>. Presumably, we'll be getting a more concrete release date sometime in the next few months, but we'll have to wait and see on that front.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Gothic 1 Remake</em>, it is, as you may have guessed, a remake of the first&nbsp;<em>Gothic</em>, although "reimagining" might be a little closer to the truth.</p>

<p>The original&nbsp;<em>Gothic</em>'s setting and basic plot setup remain intact, but the remake will add a number of more modern quality-of-life features, as well as a visual overhaul and other changes. Alkimia describes the project as "faithful".</p>

<p>We still don't know when&nbsp;<em>Gothic 1 Remake&nbsp;</em>will launch, but when it does, it'll arrive on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1297900/Gothic_1_Remake/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10005976" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/gothic-1-remake/9nbrlcpw4zgv" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Esports remains a relatively divisive topic going into 2025. Many still see the esports industry as a fledgeling thing doomed to fail, while others believe it’s a titanic powerhouse of potential with untapped avenues of income left, right, and centre.</p>



<p>In recent years, esports has been nothing short of a turbulent space to exist in. It’s still developing – and likely will be for many years to come – and a lot is happening under the hood that the average fan might not see or understand.</p>



<p>In a recent piece covered by Esports Insider, several high-profile stakeholders and leaders in the esports industry were interviewed about their predictions for esports in 2025.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-mature-and-evolve">‘Mature and Evolve’</h2>



<p>Some of the best answers in Esports Insider’s look-forward piece came from Steve Arhancet, the CEO of Team Liquid, one of the oldest and most successful esports organisations in the world.</p>



<p>When asked about his expectations for 2025, Arhancet said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think that in 2025, esports will solidify itself as a cultural force rather than a fleeting trend. The past few years have forced companies to mature and evolve, and the separation between companies that have built real businesses and those who chase empty metrics will grow even more significant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because of this, we will see more consolidation, mergers and acquisitions.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We’ve seen plenty of high-profile mergers and acquisitions in the last few years. For instance, in the Call of Duty League, several teams performed mergers to either stay afloat or bolster their resources, with the likes of Cloud9, Gentle Mates, and Team Falcons working their way into the Call of Duty pro scene in earnest.</p>



<p>Arhancet went on to dip into Tema Liquid’s success in 2024, commenting on what’s coming next:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Team Liquid achieved its 2024 goal of being EBITDA positive.</p>



<p>(In 2025, Team Liquid wants to) be a leader in competitive gaming and build a global and multigenerational sports team.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On the topic of ongoing success and sustainability, Arhancet suggested what needs to be done for more organisations to become profitable and hit their EBITDA boosts:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Monetisation models remain the Achilles’ heel of esports.&nbsp; We need to find that next gear beyond just ad spend and sponsorships, and create direct fan monetisation systems that feel natural, rewarding and equitable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This would go hand-in-hand with improved economics between developers and/or tournament organisers and teams.</p>
</blockquote>

            <p>Brendan Greene, the modder-turned-millionaire who designed battle royale game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG: Battlegrounds</a>, wants to make his studio's next game a "metaverse", although he says he's wary of using the term. The project is called "Artemis" (at least for now) and you won't be seeing it any time soon. That's because the studio is still working on the tech behind it all, and plans to release two other games before it. Meaning it'll be 10-15 years before it actually comes out. </p>
<p>Greene describes Artemis as an internet-like platform where users create and share things, but doesn't say specifically what those things might be. He doesn't know how his user-led "multiverse of worlds" will be moderated, or how it will prevent copyright infringement, or what makes this idea distinct from, say, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/roblox">Roblox</a>. He is nonetheless "full of confidence".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"[Yes], it's a big vision," he told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-creator-of-playerunknowns-battlegrounds-wants-to-build-a-true-metaverse">IGN in a recent interview</a>, "but I've got a good team of industry professionals and they don't think it's that crazy.</p>
<p>"I hesitate to talk about this, because it's just such a dirty word, but I want to build a metaverse because I don't think anyone else is. I think everyone's building IP bubbles that might talk to each other at some stage in the future, maybe if we're lucky, but it's not the metaverse. See, the Metaverse is a 3D internet. You should be able to create your own worlds and just have them all operating on the same protocol, like HTTP. So a world is a page, and that's what I'm trying to do with Artemis.”</p><p>What Artemis will actually look like, and what players (users?) will actually do within that realm isn't talked about in concrete terms, except to say it might be a bit like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-trek">Star Trek</a>'s Holodeck or Minecraft's survival mode. He also says his studio, PlayerUnknown Productions, may build it with the world-generation technology they're creating for their upcoming survival game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prologue">Prologue: Go Wayback</a>, which so far seems an aesthetically realistic orienteer 'em up with hunger, thirst, and all the usual survival game go-tos. Artemis itself, however, is years away from release, according to Greene. And even when it does come out, it's possible it'll take time to gain traction. </p>
<p>“The internet was empty when it first started, and it was just the way of sharing data, and I look at this the same. This is probably going to be empty for the first few years, but then eventually you'll start to see the possibility of what you can do with this kind of world generator that it's like a multiverse of worlds.”</p>
<p>Greene expands on his thoughts in the interview but the gist is this: Artemis is still a lot of big, cloudy ideas. My gut reaction to millionaires chasing the metaverse is rabid, frothing-at-the-mouth skepticism. The two mentioned inspirations (the Holodeck and Minecraft) have something of a chasm between them in technical terms. And the player-led creativity Greene describes already exists in other games such as Roblox, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/roblox-is-limiting-access-to-social-hangouts-and-unrated-games-for-children-aged-under-13">struggles just to keep its audience of children protected from harm</a>. </p>
<p>In the meantime, Fortnite has given players tools to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fortnite-creative-20s-beta-is-out-allowing-for-some-wild-custom-content">make their own creations with the Unreal Editor For Fortnite</a> and other studios are building similar games-as-a-platform, such as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/everywhere">Everywhere</a>, an upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/everywhere-from-a-former-gta-producer-looks-like-a-retro-throwback-to-2022s-metaverse-craze">make-your-own-minigame machine</a> by Build A Rocket Boy, itself described in somewhat grandiose terms for what looks to be essentially Dreams for the PlayStation with more multiplayer options. It might be exactly these types of games that Greene thinks of as "IP bubbles", but it's not clear what will make PlayerUnknown's Metagrounds different from these.</p><p>Artemis is also - let's face it - unlikely to be as revolutionary as the internet, the thing Greene repeatedly compares it to. I'm wary of calling the metaverse the holy grail of the tech world, mainly because many head honchos in games and technology seem to hear the words "holy grail" and think: "cool thing we can definitely achieve if we pump enough money into it!" Which is not quite the original meaning of the phrase. But also calling the metaverse a "holy grail" implies it is a universally desirable thing in the first place. And I'm not sure that's true. Many people just want to play a video game.</p>
<p>Greene does talk more about all the possibilities for Artemis in the interview, so it's worth reading if you want to understand his reasoning and get a sense for some of the other questions that arise from his ponderings. When asked how such a world-of-worlds would be moderated, he says: "we're going to have to figure it out" and acknowledges it is "important to get right".  When asked if Artemis will use NFTs, he says it won't, despite <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/artemis-pubg-creators-next-game-will-have-nfts-and-the-metaverse">a previous report</a> claiming this would be the case. </p>
<p>For now, Artemis remains a non-extant dream of unproven value. Whatever it turns out to be might be fun. It might even get the hundreds of thousands of players of Plunkbat. But will it get the millions Greene is fantasising about? Will it be a second 3D internet? I'm not so sure. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-could-make-1-billion-before-release/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gta-6-could-make-1-billion-before-it%E2%80%99s-even-released.1072641/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-could-make-1-billion-before-release/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has been estimated by a gaming research group that Grand Theft Auto 6, the world’s most anticipated game, could secure $1 billion in pre-orders before it hits the market later this year. This monumental figure was expanded by the agency suggesting that GTA 6 could go on to make more than $3 billion in under a year.</p>



<p>It has been predicted that GTA 6 will make around $3.2 billion in 12 months once it launches this year – expectations are currently sitting at an October release date.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-big-numbers">Big Numbers</h2>



<p>In a report published in the Financial Times, the stability of the games industry was explored. It all began with a deep dive into how much GTA 6 is expected to make when it’s finally released later this year. Per an estimation from DFC Intelligence, GTA 6 could make $1 billion in pre-orders alone. </p>



<p>Ultimately, it has been predicted that GTA 6 will go on to decimate the numbers secured by GTA 5 in 2013.</p>



<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/1413cdb1-aee9-422f-8b78-15aa0bf40dca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the Financial Times</a>, Strauss Zelnick, the CEO of Take-Two (Rockstar Games’ parent company) said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I never claim victory before it occurs. That said, I think Rockstar Games will once again deliver something absolutely phenomenal. Certainly the anticipation is high.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Zelnick also contributed to the discussion about the health of the current gaming generation and consumer spending habits:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s way too early to believe that this [console] generation is maturing or has reached its apex.</p>



<p>You’re seeing more consumer demand broadly. And the industry, frankly led by us, has an amazing release schedule coming in 2025 and beyond. A hit coming from one company tends to benefit the entire industry.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>GTA 6 has already broken viewership records on YouTube. From the moment the first trailer was released in December 2023, fans turned feral, scouring every frame for secrets and hints. Today, it’s still one of the most talked-about videos in the world, and that’s aided by the fact that a high-res version of the trailer recently surfaced online.</p>



<p>How do you think GTA 6 will perform in the pre-order stakes? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

Surprising no-one, GTA 6 is expected to be the biggest entertainment launch of 2025, ahead of any movie or competing video game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">DFC predicted total revenue from GTA 6’s first 12 months on sale will reach $3.2 billion. To put that into context, 2024’s highest-grossing movie, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/inside-out-2">Inside Out 2</a>, made just shy of $1.7 billion at the global box office. In 2013, it took <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">Grand Theft Auto 5</a> just three days to surpass $1 billion in sales — the fastest to that figure in entertainment history.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Strauss Zelnick, boss of Rockstar parent company Take-Two, told the Financial Times: “I never claim victory before it occurs. That said, I think Rockstar Games will once again deliver something absolutely phenomenal… Certainly the anticipation is high.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The huge projected revenue of GTA 6 is up against similarly huge development costs, which the Financial Times estimates from the high hundreds of millions to as much as $2 billion. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/theres-a-lot-riding-on-gta-6-and-not-just-for-rockstar-and-take-two">There’s a lot riding on GTA 6, then, but not just for Take-Two and Rockstar</a>. In March last year, Circana analyst Mat Piscatella predicted Rockstar’s surefire hit would spark “renewed interest” in video games, before going one step further: “There's probably never been a more important thing to ever release in the industry, so no pressure.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GTA 6 is the kind of game that will sell consoles. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-pro-likely-out-later-in-2024-analysts-say"><u>Sony’s PS5 Pro</u></a> will no doubt benefit greatly from interest in GTA 6, too. Let’s remember: GTA 6 is not coming out on PC at launch; to play you <em>must </em>own a PlayStation or an Xbox. Beyond the point of sale, GTA 6’s GTA Online equivalent will surely come packed with microtransactions as the current GTA Online does. Microsoft and Sony will get their cut of any money spent there, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the Financial Times points out, the almost guaranteed success of GTA 6 comes amid one of the toughest periods for the video game industry in recent memory. More than 33,000 people have lost their jobs since 2022, with huge layoffs at the likes of Microsoft and Sony.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-myth-wukong-xbox-port-delayed-due-to-series-s-memory-limitations-producer-says.1072623/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-xbox-port-series-s<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>producer Feng Ji has stated that the reason the game's Xbox port has been such a long time coming has to do with the Xbox Series S' memory limitations.</p>

<p>In a post on <a href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5118097780121223" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Chinese social media platform Weibo</a> (for which we're using machine translation), Feng Ji says that the Series S' 10GB of shared memory would make a&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>port impossible without "several years of optimization experience".</p>

<p>That's despite Microsoft itself <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-xbox-delay-not-due-to-platform-limitations-microsoft-reiterates" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">stating back in September</a> that "platform limitations" were not the reason behind the game's Xbox delay, sparking rumors that the game was subject to an undisclosed exclusivity deal between Sony and developer GameScience.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/black-myth-wukong-xbox-port-series-s-boss.jpg?itok=Ofw61xPl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/black-myth-wukong-xbox-port-series-s-boss.jpg?itok=ZHI6vf-1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>'s Xbox port has apparently been delayed for so long due to the Series S' memory limitations.</figcaption></figure><p>It's perhaps not a surprise that Feng Ji has come forward to say this. The producer and GameScience CEO is garnering something of a reputation for controversial statements.</p>

<p>Around the time of the Game Awards, Feng Ji <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/black-myth-wukong-game-science-ceo-the-game-awards-criticized-game-of-the-year-loss/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">criticized the ceremony</a> for not awarding&nbsp;<em>Wukong&nbsp;</em>the prestigious Game of the Year prize, which instead went to PlayStation platformer&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot</em>. He said he'd prepared his acceptance speech two years prior and seemingly wrote that he "came here for nothing".</p>

<p>This time around, Feng Ji could either be calling out the Series S for its memory limitations or describing his own team's lack of optimization experience, both of which seem to be contributing to the&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>Xbox port being so long in the making.</p>

<p>Either way, it looks like we're not going to be seeing&nbsp;<em>Wukong&nbsp;</em>gracing the Xbox anytime soon, unfortunately. Better make do with the PC or PS5 versions for now.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>, it's an action-adventure game with Soulslike elements developed by Chinese studio GameScience.</p>

<p>The game is heavily inspired by the classical Chinese novel&nbsp;<em>Journey to the West</em>, although it's not a direct retelling of that story. Instead, it tells the tale of the Destined One, a simian warrior who must ascend to claim the monkey king Wukong's mantle.</p>

<p><em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>proved massively popular on release, topping the Steam charts <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-24-hour-player-count" rel="nofollow">within a handful of hours</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-expansion-sales-18m" rel="nofollow">passing the 18 million sales milestone</a> just a few weeks after its initial release.</p>

<p>You can check the game out right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2358720/Black_Myth_Wukong/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/black-myth-wukong/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>. Whether or not it eventually does land on Xbox seems to be a matter for debate at the moment, so while you wait, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/black-myth-wukong-review-serious-monkey-business" rel="nofollow">check out my review</a> to see what I thought of&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arrowhead-studios-cco-dei-comments/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arrowhead-studios%E2%80%99-cco-speaks-out-against-forcing-%E2%80%98dei%E2%80%99-into-games.1072617/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/arrowhead-studios-cco-dei-comments/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a recent social media post, Arrowhead Studios’ CCO and the creative director of Helldivers 2, Johan Pilestedt, revealed he’s working on the high concept for the studio’s next game. Under the post, he engaged in a brief discussion regarding ‘DEI’ and the act of ‘shoehorning’ it into a game <em>just to have it there</em>.</p>



<p>The comments drew a mix of feedback from the community, with some praising Pilestedt’s transparency while others pointed out some potential flaws with what he said.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-pure-pursuit-of-amazing-moments">‘Pure Pursuit of Amazing Moments’</h2>



<p>Helldivers 2 turned heads when it was released in February 2024, with the game going on to sell millions of copies with ease. It had a rocky moment when it was review-bombed following a change on PC that required users to have and link a PSN account to play the game, but that wrong was righted quickly enough.</p>



<p>Now, Arrowhead Studios is preparing to piece together something new, and Johan Pilestedt is working on the concept for whatever comes next.</p>



<p>In a recent post on social media, the CCO revealed just that, and in the comments, he engaged with the community. One user made a bold statement: ‘Never add DEI to your games.’</p>



<p>Instead of ignoring the comment, <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1874271801146302738" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pilestedt went in with solid responses</a> that kickstarted a wave of comments:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>If it doesnt add to the game experience, it detracts. And games should be a pure pursuit of amazing moments.</p>



<p>I don’t like labels. But mankind is united in its extreme xenophobia on Super Earth. #Inclusion so, maybe that’s DEI? I really don’t care. </p>



<p>Make good games, don’t make a contemporary political statement.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Some users were quick to point out that Helldivers 2’s ‘entire setting is a political statement’, while others maintained the stance that Helldivers 2 is more satirical and rooted in absurdism than anything else.</p>



<p>What we can take away from Pilestedt’s comments is that adding DEI elements to a game just to ‘tick a box’ is wrong if it doesn’t add value to the game. In that case, it’s <strong>detracting </strong>value and serves no purpose, potentially spoiling the ‘pure pursuit of amazing moments’. </p>



<p>His latter comment suggests that games with these ‘contemporary political statements’ are inherently ‘not good’.</p>



<p>One game that was heavily criticised under topics like this in recent years was The Last of Us Part II. That game featured two lead female characters, one of whom was outwardly gay, and had a relatively major storyline concerning a trans character. These topics were targeted quite severely by review bombers angry at the game being ‘woke’ and forcing these elements on players.</p>



<p>But The Last of Us Part II is one of the most highly awarded games in history, so perhaps you can make a good game that also makes contemporary political or cultural statements.</p>

<p>A recent social media post confirmed that Helldivers 2’s developer, Arrowhead Studios, is fleshing out the concept for its next game. On Twitter, Johan Pilestedt, the creative director behind Helldivers 2, mentioned that he’s ‘working on the high concept’ and invited community speculation about the project.</p>



<p>Helldivers 2 was released almost a year ago to an overwhelmingly positive reception. The game went on to sell millions of copies and win awards throughout the year.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-s-next-for-arrowhead">What’s Next for Arrowhead?</h2>



<p>Arrowhead Studios is busying itself with whatever comes next after Helldivers 2, with the firm’s CCO drawing up plans for an all-new project.</p>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://x.com/pilestedt/status/1874226763913715938" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post on social media</a>, Pilestedt wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>With 10 minutes to 2025. What are your expectations and desires for what the next Arrowhead game will be? I am working on the high concept, but I would love to hear your speculation.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Pilestedt went on to engage with the community in the comments under the post, many of whom were eagerly pitching their own ideas to the creative director of one of 2024’s most surprising smash hits.</p>



<p>One user wrote, ‘I would absolutely love to see what Arrowhead could do with a remake of the retro twin-stick shooter “Smash TV”. So much atmosphere in that game!’</p>



<p>By way of a response, Pilestedt revealed that such a game was pitched ‘a long time ago’, sharing an image that contained a blurb for a proposed game:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Smash-TV is a top-down reiminaging of the classic arcade game of 1990. The game pits up to four contestants in a violent game show set in the distant future of 1999. The game focuses on the source inspiration for Smash TV to create a game filled with brutal action, death traps, and gladiator-inspired game-shows.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He also revealed that Arrowhead pieced together a concept for a first-person, on-rails game akin to Star Fox.</p>

            <p>
Images that look to have been taken inside Rockstar's San Diego office have been posted online, showing a computer screen with what appears to be <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> running. 
</p>
<p>
As a video game leak, the purported image of GTA 6 itself is essentially meaningless - it simply shows main character Lucia standing next to a wall and some crates. What's more, the image appears to date from the summer of 2021, three and a half years ago.
</p>
<p>
What's unusual here is that the image has been taken within the bowels of Rockstar's own offices, and posted online by someone who seems happy enough to live with the consequences. 
</p>
<p>
The photo and two accompanying video clips, which show a brief glimpse at more of the office surroundings, were first posted to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2F98ox9ku1jfae1.jpeg">reddit</a> by user JustLovett0 around 17 hours ago. "Someone I am close to took it when they worked at the Rockstar office for a few months," they wrote of the image, on a post titled "a photo from mid-2021. I think it's been long enough I can post this."
</p>
<p>
What's shown of the office itself looks relatively generic, though it's clearly the Rockstar San Diego building based on the shape of the windows and frontage that can be seen outside. 
</p>
<p>
Desks nearby house PlayStation and Xbox developer kits, one of which is labelled with a code beginning "SAND", presumably a reference to San Diego.
</p>
<p>
When asked whether their friend was worried about being traced, JustLovett0 wrote: "He is super far from Rockstar now, doesn't work there or in any related field. I'm not worried but I'll probably delete the post soon enough.
</p>
<p>
"Hopefully there's no camera footage from 3.5ish years ago."
</p>
<p>
The post has since been removed, though has been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1hratml/reupload_of_the_guys_gta_6_leaked_photo_vids_from/">reuploaded</a> elsewhere on reddit. Eurogamer has contacted Rockstar for comment. 
</p>
<p>
Back in September 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/90-gta-6-videos-and-screenshots-have-allegedly-leaked-online">a teenage hacker from the UK stole an enormous swathe of in-development GTA 6 footage and files</a>. The now-notorious leak remains one of the most prominent in video game history. Its culprit was later arrested, though was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/teenage-gta-6-hacker-given-indefinite-hospital-order">ultimately deemed unfit to stand trial</a>.

			<p>According to a <a href="https://twitter.com/X0X_LEAK/status/1874763185238274517?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1874763185238274517%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leak</a> from a Chinese app, NetEase's free-to-play third-person hero shooter game Marvel Rivals will add the Fantastic Four (Mister Fantastic, Invisible Woman, Human Torch, and Thing) to its playable roster next week. The launch is reportedly happening on Friday, January 10.</p>
<p>Marvel Rivals launched last month to great player figures <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-launches-with-a-bang-thanks-to-444k-concurrent-users-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a> and consoles. Overall, the game has already passed the mark of 20 million players engaged across all platforms, and it <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-remains-one-of-top-played-games-across-3-platforms-in-us-sonic-frontiers-gets-resurgence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ranked highly</a> on player charts in the United States for the final week of the year. So far, the game includes the following playable heroes (and villains):</p>
<ul>
<li>Black Panther</li>
<li>Doctor Strange</li>
<li>Groot</li>
<li>The Punisher</li>
<li>Hela</li>
<li>Iron Man</li>
<li>Loki</li>
<li>Rocket Raccoon</li>
<li>Mantis</li>
<li>Peni Parker</li>
<li>Magneto</li>
<li>Magik</li>
<li>Spider-Man</li>
<li>Venom</li>
<li>Scarlet Witch</li>
<li>Star-Lord</li>
<li>Storm</li>
<li>Luna Snow</li>
<li>Hulk</li>
<li>Namor</li>
<li>Adam Warlock</li>
<li>Jeff the Land Shark</li>
<li>Thor</li>
<li>Black Widow</li>
<li>Captain America</li>
<li>Cloak and Dagger</li>
<li>Hawkeye</li>
<li>Iron Fist</li>
<li>Moon Knight</li>
<li>Psylocke</li>
<li>Squirrel Girl</li>
<li>Winter Soldier</li>
<li>Wolverine</li>
</ul>
<p>With the leaked addition of the Fantastic Four, the roster would grow to 37 playable characters, and that's just in the first season of the game's live service. NetEase no doubt has a lot more characters planned to add in the coming months and years, provided that Marvel Rivals continues to do well. While the current list already includes the most popular heroes and villains, there's still a lot of characters left to introduce from the vast universe built over the past eighty years or so. Just off the top of our head, Deadpool, Captain Marvel, Daredevil, Kingpin, Green Goblin, Drax, Gamora, Nebula, Ghost Rider, Ant-Man, Luke Cage, Agatha Harkness, Miss Marvel, Red Guardian, Vision, Colossus, Cyclops, Gambit, and Sabretooth are just some of the potential upcoming entries.</p>

			<p>Native emulation of PlayStation 3 games on PlayStation 5 could become a reality in the future, as the possibility is reportedly being researched and prototyped.</p>
<p>Developer Implicit Conversions, the studio handling the PlayStation Classics ports on PlayStation 5,&nbsp;<span>lists on its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.implicitconversions.com/roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website</a> a roadmap&nbsp;</span>that it is researching and prototyping the possibility of a PlayStation 3 emulator package for Syrup, the engine that powers the other PS Classics ports. The "Dreaming About" tag, however, suggests that native PS3 emulation could be years away.</p>
<p>As of now, the PlayStation 3 Classics games available on PlayStation 5 with a PS Plus Premium subscription are only playable via cloud gaming, but there's little doubt that the current generation system from Sony is more than capable of emulating PS3 games natively. A test conducted <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-capable-emulating-playstation-3/">last month</a> using an AMD BC-250, a mining card that features the PlayStation 5 silicon, confirmed how the PS5 hardware would have little trouble running emulated PS3 games, as tested games such as Gran Turismo 5 Prologue and Little Big Planet ran well and at a higher than native resolution, even with some hardware limitations, such as memory limitations caused by some driver issues.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, PlayStation 5 users can enjoy a selection of PlayStation 3 games via cloud gaming as part of the PS Plus Premium subscription. More information on this subscription can be found <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps-plus/">here.</a></p>

It's frightfully early in the year to be bustling, but I can't get enough of the crowded streets of ancient "Chinese-style" <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-bustling-world">The Bustling World</a>. The latest trailer is a series of sweeping yet intimate, colourful urban cross-sections, showing dozens of NPCs selling fish, shaking hands on balconies, shouldering barrels, dancing with fans, honing their feng shui, and various other pursuits that allegedly form part of full NPC life simulations. It's like scrutinising a Hitman level from above, except that all of these people have evolving relationships and sleeping patterns and they might hunt you down if you murder any of their relatives. Me, I just want to play Where's Wally.

<p>
That's a slice from the game's minutiae. At its most expansive, The Bustling World threatens to become a 4X <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game: you can take charge of factions, lead armies, design houses, build cities of your own, and organise production chains into - my goodness, it sounds like they're trying to make it a factory sim as well? "Bustling" is certainly the word. "Bursting" might be more appropriate. "Breaking" seems like a possibility. This is a cross-genre pudding of fearful, perhaps ill-advised scale. The trailer proudly advertises itself as real-time and in-engine, but I can't quite believe they're going to pull it all off.
</p>
<p>
The Bustling World - <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2724650/The_Bustling_World/">Steam page here</a> - is the work of Chinese developers FireWo Games, with Lightning Games publishing. It doesn't appear to have a core storyline. Instead, you play a nameless everyperson who can either carry on being a nameless everyperson or evolve into a proper MC with globe-straddling aspirations. 
</p><p>
"In this ancient world, limitless possibilities await," comments the press release. "You can choose to lead a tranquil life--work, engage in trade, and build a family. Alternatively, satisfy your insatiable desires for wealth, status, and military might. Embark on daring journeys, exploring, adventuring, solving mysteries, combating bandits, and recruiting heroes. Or, aim for the peak of power through establishing influence, city planning, policy formulation, diplomatic endeavors, and territorial expansion."
</p>
<p>
The game promises "dozens of diverse maps, ranging from peaceful villages to strategic border fortresses" and a few special locations that blend "historical landmarks and mythology - like Xiaoxitian and the Underworld". There's a building system with "over 2,000 authentic components, enabling players to design and decorate with ancient Chinese furniture, tools, and artwork", plus a farming element with "over 60 varieties of typical plants from ancient times", each of which requires a certain soil type and temperature. 
</p>
<p>
You might also form bonds with "more than 30 creatures", training them up as mounts and selectively breeding them. But perhaps you'd rather set up a metallurgy business, hiring workers, opening branches, and doing promotion while sabotaging rival businesses at night. Or perhaps you'd rather be a diplomat. Or a black market dealer with a grappling hook. Or a wandering martial artist. Or a general with their own chariot and a retinue of catapults. Or a ravenous amalgamation of all these things.
</p>

I am deeply suspicious that all of this will work quite as promised, especially "in a world where every choice ripples through the tapestry of the game" and NPCs, "driven by their unique character traits and familial ties, dynamically shape the cityscape based on players' interactions" - they're apparently capable of building their own houses and running their own businesses, and they'll undertake more personal behaviours like fleeing warzones and avenging slain loved ones. That's a lot of cause-and-effect to thread together.
</p><p>
The Bustling World does not have a release date yet. I'm not sure how long it's been in development, but this feels like it needs to be a "ready when it's ready" gig of the sort Hooded Horse <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-manor-lords-publisher-thinks-we-should-all-reject-the-opportunistic-and-predatory-quest-for-a-viral-hit">like to fund</a>, perhaps even a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/caves-of-qud-one-of-the-most-exciting-development-projects-in-pc-gaming-hit-10-this-week">Caves of Qud</a>-style decade+ marathon. It's not being advertised as an early access game, and I haven't been able to discover how large FireWo Games are. I hope they've got resources and people to spare.
</p>
<p>
In trailer form, at least, The Bustling World is a treat for the eyes and synapses, a lavish historical ant farm in which every NPC looks like they'd be worth shadowing. My favourites from the video are the kids - will they eventually grow into adults? It seems consistent with the premise - all of whom bounce along with the same carefree gait, whether they're attending a lion dance or trampling fish guts on the dock. Ah, my sweet summer children. You will have troubles aplenty when I found my empire of textile sweatshops.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a>'s director has appeared to contradict Microsoft, stating the game's Xbox delay is due to the Series S's memory limitations. This is something that the Xbox maker has previously denied.</p>
<p>Writing on Chinese social media platform <a href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5118097780121223">Weibo</a>, Black Myth: Wukong producer and Game Science CEO Feng Ji said the Xbox Series S's memory is the reason behind the game's delay on Microsoft's consoles. Lamenting Black Myth: Wukong's absence on Xbox in an otherwise good year for the studio (it recently scooped up a number of awards at the Steam Awards), the director wrote:</p>
<p>"But that 10G shared memory, I can't really get it without a few years of optimisation experience" (translated on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-myth-wukongs-game-director-blames-the-xbox-series-s-10gb-of-memory-for-the-xbox-version-being-delayed.1072326/">ResetEra</a>).</p>

<p>In September of last year however, Microsoft said the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-xbox-delay-not-due-to-platform-limitations-microsoft-reiterates">delay to the game's Xbox release of Black Myth: Wukong was <em>not </em>due to "platform limitations"</a>. At this time, there was also chatter that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/confusion-over-black-myth-wukongs-missing-xbox-release-follows-claims-of-playstation-exclusivity">Black Myth: Wukong team had entered into an undisclosed exclusivity deal with PlayStation</a>.</p><p>"As we have said before, we're excited for the launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-review">Black Myth Wukong</a> on Xbox Series X/S and are working with Game Science to bring the game to our platforms," Microsoft said at the time. "We'd prefer not to comment on the deals made by our partners with other platform holders but we can confirm that the delay is not due to Xbox platform limitations that have been raised to us."</p>
<p>Eurogamer has reached out to both Xbox and Black Myth: Wukong developer Game Science for clarification on the game's Xbox delay.</p>

Following this, Game Science's CEO posted a lengthy statement regarding the action game's apparent snub, stating <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-producer-on-the-game-awards-top-prize-snub-i-came-all-the-way-here-for-nothing">he felt like he "came all the way here for nothing!"</a></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
