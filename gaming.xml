            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/07/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-25-to-21/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>We’re into the top half of our Most Wanted games of 2025, and there’s a mix of the familiar and the new in this selection of five. Co-op is a strong factor here, whether it’s sharing in the horror, taking on the latest soulslike experience, or surviving in an MMO with your buddies.</p>
<h2>25 – Little Nightmares 3</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PS4, XBO, NSW, PC – 2025</em></p>
<p>The Little Nightmares series has quickly felt like a staple of the horror genres, bleeding an unsettling setting and creepily oversized enemies in alongside puzzle platforming. Original series creators Tarsier Studios have moved on to create their own fresh take on this style with Reanimal, but Little Nightmares 3 is continuing on with Supermassive Games at the helm – another studio with a rich pedigree in horror.</p>
<p><iframe title="Little Nightmares III – 'You're Being Watched' Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0oSzWzliENs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Trapped within the Spiral, a cluster of “disturbing places”, Low and Alone will have to work together to survive in a dangerous world full of delusions and nasty things lurking around in the shadows, with this game looking to emphasise full co-op. Whilst the game continues the themes of “eww”, “yuk”, and “bork” found in the first two games, it is set in a completely different location, as Little Nightmares 1 and 2 were both set in The Maw.</p>

<h2>24 – Greedfall 2: The Dying World</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – TBC (out now in Steam Early Access)</em></p>
<p>Here’s one you can actually play already, with Greedfall 2: The Dying World currently going through PC Early Access on Steam. To say that this release has divided the fans of the original is a bit of an understatement, though.</p>
<p><iframe title="GreedFall 2 | Early Access Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QYklAgJGzlU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Set well before the events of the first game, Greedfall 2 looks set to explore the same world from a new perspective. Now you’ll play as a Teer Fradee native, witnessing the early impact that colonisers from the Old Continent have on this verdant land, before being dragged back to the old world as the story unfolds. What’s much more significant, though, is a complete shift in gameplay style, moving away from action RPG and back towards something more reminiscent of Dragon Age: Origins. Combined with the ropiness of an early access game, the initial reception has been mixed, but we’re keen to see how it comes together through its full release.</p>
<h2>23 – Sniper Elite: Resistance</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PS4, XBO, PC – 30th January 2025</em></p>
<p>You know what you’re getting with Sniper Elite: Resistance, a spin-off story that puts Karl Fairburne’s longtime co-op buddy character, Harry Hawker, in the spotlight. You’ll be sneaking through large levels, silently taking down patrolling guards, sniping from hundreds of meters away (to trigger the series’ iconic X-Ray killcam), and working your way through a variety of missions behind enemy lines in Occupied France.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Hands on Sniper Elite: Resistance – Harry Hawker takes aim" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LODts4M4BPk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>We went <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/05/sniper-elite-resistance-preview-stealth-action-comfort-food/">hands on with Sniper Elite: Resistance</a> at Gamescom this year, saying, “Sniper Elite has become a bit like stealth action comfort food over the past decade, having really settled into the sandbox levels and mission structure in the last few games. Sniper Elite: Resistance isn’t looking to revolutionise the series, but give a new campaign, a few new twists and tweaks to the formula, and just let you settle in with a nice glass of red – to go with all the red you spill in-game.”</p>
<h2>22 – Elden Ring Nightreign</h2>
<p>PS5, XSX|S, PS4, XBO, PC – 2025</p>
<p>FromSoftware aren’t making an Elden Ring 2, but they are working on a spin-off from their smash hit. Elden Ring Nightreign is a more specifically co-op game than before, mixing up the visual style, combat and general setting of Elden Ring with a new format.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN – REVEAL GAMEPLAY TRAILER" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Djtsw5k_DNc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While you can play Nightreign solo, it’s intended to be played with a group of three, working together across multiple in-game days to prepare for a final boss. There’s a little dash of battle royale thrown into this as well, with the playable area shrinking after players defeat a minor boss at the end of each day, limiting the second and third day as you get closer to that final encounter. An interesting twist on proceedings.</p>
<h2>21 – Dune: Awakening</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – Early 2025 (PC)</em></p>
<p>With the success of the recent films, Dune video games are popping up left and right, with Dune: Awakening one of the most exciting and intriguing in development. Coming from Conan Exiles developer Funcom Oslo, this is a big open world survival MMO.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Dune: Awakening – Survive Arrakis Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1S-l7NySFsI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It definitely feels like survival will be quite tricky here, given the setting. Worms are just one unkillable threat to contend with, as sandstorms, the heat and sunlight, and just finding water in this desert all being particular challenges. Of course, you can band together with other players, sharing resources, building bases, going on raids and quests, and deciding which of the factions vying for control over the planet you wish to align with.</p>
<p>There’s no defined release date yet, but Dune: Awakening will have betas before launch. That launch will also be split, first coming to PC before consoles arrive at a later date.</p>
<p><em>That’s this set of five, and we’re getting towards the pointy end of our list. What here takes your fancy, though?</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/07/helldivers-and-horizon-zero-dawn-movies-announced-by-sony/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>During Sony’s CES 2025 conference, the company announced some new film and show projects it has begun working on. The key announcements were projects based on Helldivers, Horizon Zero Dawn, and Ghost of Tsushima.</p>
<p><iframe title="CES® 2025 Press Conference｜Sony Official" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IV95SMpTW-M?start=2327&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Ghost of Tsushima Legends is an anime that is being produced at Crunchyroll, with the basis of the series being the Legends mode of the game. The Legends mode was added in 2020, bringing a co-op multiplayer experience to the samurai game, with four new warriors being made playable and each representing different classes. These were the Samurai, Hunter, Ronin, and Assassin characters who were tasked with working together to deal with supernatural situations. These stories are likely what the anime will be using as inspiration.</p>
<p>When it comes to the big screen, Sony had two major reveals. Both Helldivers and Horizon Zero Dawn will be getting movies. Sony has partnered with Columbia Pictures to make the Horizon Zero Dawn movie, though it is yet too early to know who will be playing Aloy and when it will be release. This follows on from the news that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/04/netflixs-horizon-zero-dawn-show-has-been-scrapped/">Netflix’s Horizon Zero Dawn show</a> had been scrapped in July. The Helldivers movie will be based on Helldivers 2, though again there is no confirmed release window, cast, or even what story will be told through the movie.</p>
<p>The next<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/16/until-dawn-movie-has-a-release-date-for-april-2025/"> big game based movie coming out is Until Dawn</a>, which is set to be released in cinemas this April. Until Dawn’s cast includes Peter Stormare, who has a long career of acting in big blockbusters as well as in videogames, Michael Cimino, Ella Rubin, Ji-young Yoo, Belmont Cameli, Odessa A’zion, and Maia Mitchell.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/10/until-dawn-2024-review/">Until Dawn Review</a></h2>
<p>Until Dawn was recently remade and released, following its original release in 2014. In our review for the remake of Until Dawn, Tuffcub said,&nbsp;<em>“Until Dawn remains a fantastic horror game with great acting and plenty of jump scares to get you out of your seat. While not essential for anyone that enjoyed the original game, this remake brings it to a new audience and is a solid update to what was already a great game.”</em></p>

            <p>I don’t want to talk to a game. I assume I’m not alone in this, because the tech’s been around for donkey’s and barely anyone tries to use it. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect-3">Mass Effect 3</a> tried voice commands. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOCOM_U.S._Navy_SEALs">Socom U.S Navy Seals </a>shipped with a headset. "Dunno if I wanna be shouting out tacticool commands in my living room," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GhostRecon/comments/jpbkhj/socom_us_navy_seals_voice_commands_for_ai/">wrote a Redditor</a> on the subject four years ago, speaking to my very soul in the process. "Gimme the clunky buttons instead".</p>
<p>Thankfully, you can also use your keyboard to interrogate suspects in murder mystery Dead Meat. It’s a moody, slightly goofy noir <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzler</a> that lets you ask anything you want. Whether this means you’ll always get a worthwhile response, I’m not sure. "Want to discuss their alibi? Probe them on the meaning of life? Confess your love? Or just troll them mercilessly? Your words hold power, and anything goes," reads the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2628740/Dead_Meat/">Steam page</a>. Here’s a trailer.</p>

<p>As you may have guessed by now, there’s a caveat to this seemingly boundless NPC reactivity - Meaning Machine are using what they call their ‘Game Conscious (tee-em) AI system’. "The advent of generative AI has the potential to kickstart a golden age of creative experimentation and innovation," they say. "But only if creative people remain at the helm."</p><p>Here is my drive-by reaction to this: if you don’t value the written word enough to have a writer create unique, intentional dialogue, then why make a game based around conversation? Same for actors - there’s an undeniable choppy tinge to the character’s voices you don’t get with a real human reading a whole line like they mean it. But then again, I’d be lying if I said Dead Meat felt devoid of personality. Its characters are certainly a far cry from the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-spoke-to-an-nvidia-ai-npc-and-he-mainly-wanted-to-get-me-bladdered">Nvidia AI NPC James</a> spoke to last year, and the dialogue they’ve shown off doesn’t give me any overt slop vibes (edit: actually, kinda.)</p>
<p>On the one hand, co-founder and tech lead Ben Ackland says he’s been working on AI for games for over six years "before it was cool", which you’d think might insulate them from some of the rabid gold-rush evangelism we’ve seen recently. One the other hand, <a href="https://www.meaningmachine.games/game-conscious-ai">their website</a> shows off a separate system called ‘battle banter’ by having it add AI battle barks to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>, which feels about as close to missing the point as you can get. Sparing dialogue and deliberately lonely encounters? I barely know ‘ers.</p>
<p>All I can really say is this: Dead Meat looks interesting enough (perhaps even interesting enough for me to actually talk to it) and I’m still learning. I’m off to go have a re-read of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/electric-nightmares">four parter Michael Cook did on generative AI for us</a>. Don’t do any murders while I’m gone.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>NVIDIA did not forget about its GeForce NOW cloud platform during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/watch-nvidia-ces-2025-ceo-jensen-huang-keynote-live-here/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">big CES 2025 keynote</a>. First, it was confirmed that two highly anticipated PC games, the action RPG Avowed from Obsidian and the first-person shooter DOOM: The Dark Ages from id Software, will be available to play on GeForce NOW.</p>
<p>Avowed is coming in a little over a month. Set for release on February 18 for PC and Xbox Series S|X, the game will provide fans of the Eora setting (previously seen in the Pillars of Eternity franchise) with a brand new perspective on the vibrant fantasy world.&nbsp;I got to play a few hours of a demo build last month and shared these thoughts in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-hands-on-preview-eora-from-a-whole-new-perspective/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hands-on preview article</a>:</p>
<p><em>Overall, this hands-on experience definitely left me hopeful and eager for the final version. It's unlikely to be a big success on the scale of Skyrim or Baldur's Gate 3, but it looks like another fun and engaging role-playing game from Obsidian that improves on their previous first-person title. All the worldbuilding work done for the Pillars of Eternity games will certainly pay off, too, both for returning fans of the isometric cRPGs who get to enter Eora from a wholly different perspective and for newcomers who will feel the depth and uniqueness of this fantasy setting.</em></p>
<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages doesn't have a launch date yet, but <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-features-dlss-4-path-tracing-at-launch-indiana-jones-alan-wake-2-updated-with-new-rtx-technologies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it will support path tracing and DLSS 4</a>. While the GeForce NOW servers don't support the newly announced DLSS 4 yet, Ultimate tier users will be able to run DLSS 3 as usual.</p>
<p>NVIDIA also announced that GeForce NOW is officially coming to a series of new devices, such as Valve's Steam Deck. Truthfully, a beta installation method was <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-can-now-be-installed-more-easily-on-steam-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> by NVIDIA last May. However, a native app will be available for download later this year.</p>
<p><iframe title="GeForce NOW | Full Support for Steam Deck Coming Soon" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SlK5UWuj9is?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>NVIDIA's cloud gaming solution is also expanding to VR and MR devices like the Meta Quest 3 and 3S, Apple's Vision Pro, and Pico headsets. Starting later this month, VR and MR users will be able to use GeForce NOW on these devices by opening the browser <a href="http://play.geforcenow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on this page</a>.</p>
<p>Last but not least, NVIDIA is adding India to the list of supported GFN countries later in 2025 thanks to the opening of an RTX 4080-powered data center. Thailand should also be added soon via a local partnership with Brothers Pictures.</p>

            <p>A new trailer for The Last of Us has been released, teasing some of the events to come in the show's second season.</p>
<p>Additionally, while we still don't have a specific date, it has been announced that The Last of Us season two will begin airing in April. That's the same month <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-finally-gets-itself-a-pc-release-date">The Last of Us Part 2 will make its PC debut</a>.</p>
<p>The trailer, which you can see below, lasts a little over a minute, but still manages to cram in the suspense. Along with Ellie and Joel, we also get another look at new characters for this season, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-casts-kaitlyn-dever-as-abby-for-season-two">Kaitlyn Dever's Abby</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/isabela-merced-cast-as-dina-in-hbos-the-last-of-us-adaptation">Isabela Merced's Dina</a>. Please note, beneath the trailer I will be going into more detail about what was shown, so <strong>be aware of major spoilers for The Last of Us Part 2 below</strong>.</p>

<p>But there are also two moments I particularly want to highlight, which are sure to pack an emotional punch upon the series' release.</p>
<p>The first is the very opening of the trailer, which begins in a hallway with a wailing siren and ominous red lighting. A lone figure walks into the shot. She is holding a gun with a Firefly pendant around her neck. It is Abby, and this scene is clearly set in the hospital <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-showrunners-explain-joels-john-wick-moment-as-a-god-mode-power-up">after Joel's rampage at the end of season one</a>.</p><p>Those who have played The Last of Us Part 2 know this means Abby is about to come across the body of the doctor who was set to perform surgery on Ellie before Joel killed him - her father. I won't deny, I cried when I played through this part.</p>

<p>The second moment that bears mentioning specifically is the lone shot of Ellie, again bathed in a red light, aiming a gun at an unseen target. The scene then cuts to black, but heavy breathing can be heard.</p>
<p>Based on events in The Last of Us Part 2, I am going to say this moment takes place after Ellie chases WLF member Nora (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-cast-adds-danny-ramirez-tati-gabrielle">played in the show by Tati Gabrielle</a>) down in Seattle. Ellie proceeds to torture and kill Nora, in one of the already harrowing game's most harrowing moments. Ellie's actions here traumatise her even further, and she returns to Dina and Jesse in a state of shock.</p><p>When I played The Last of Us Part 2, this moment with Nora left me feeling especially uncomfortable. I wonder if those who have not played the game will feel this same sense of unease when the second season airs.</p>

<p>Last year, The Last of Us showrunner Craig Mazin confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-will-be-shorter-so-every-episode-feels-like-a-blockbuster">the second season of The Last of Us will comprise of seven episodes</a>, with one of those episodes being "quite big" in length.</p>
<p>"The story that we're telling is much bigger than the story of season one, there's just a lot more going on, it's a lot harder to produce but we want every episode to feel like its own blockbuster to be honest with you," Mazin said in June.</p>
<p>The Last of Us Part 2's story will not be told in full during season two, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-tv-showrunner-discusses-series-overall-length">subsequent seasons expected to wrap up the narrative</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio and Sega have released a “pre-development concept video” for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/its-finally-happening-were-getting-a-new-virtua-fighter/">new Virtua Fighter project</a> that was announced during The Game Awards last month. Check it out:</p>
<p><iframe title="“New VIRTUA FIGHTER Project” pre-development concept video" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GtLRfES1YQU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Looks good, right? Well, it’s all just proof of concept right now, labelled as “Pre-development in-engine footage” and “not actual gameplay”, and so there’s absolutely nothing about the game name, platforms or release windows a moment, but it is showing some of the intent behind RGG’s fighting series revival.</p>
<p>There’s various things to note here, from the density of detail through the backdrops to the light 3D shifting through the stage, and an element of destruction as one Akira throws the other Akira around. There’s also some more of that fighting game visual flair with motion trails and other effects as hits land, where Virtua Fighter has generally been more constrained than others in the genre.</p>
<p>All of this is subject to change, of course, but it’s an initial direction that RGG are taking.</p>

<p>Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has become a lynchpin studio for Sega over the last few years. You’ll know them best as the studio behind the hugely popular <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/17/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-latest-trailer-reveal-naval-combat/">Yakuza/Like A Dragon</a> series, but as broad as that series has become, they’ve also handled <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/24/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-review/">recent Super Monkey Ball games</a> as well. Given that Yakuza’s own combat was a hand-me-down from Shenmue, which was in turn fed a branch off from Virtua Fighter, this makes them the perfect team to take the series’ reins.</p>
<p>Thus far, we’ve only seen Akira and Sarah Bryant going fighting, and with this pre-production video, it’s a pair of Akira battling.</p>
<p>Fans of the series have been waiting patiently ever since the original launch of Virtua Fighter 5. While it leapt through the past couple of generations with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/06/18/virtua-fighter-5-ultimate-showdown-review/">Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown</a>, and is still very playable on modern consoles, there’s little to no online community right now. Sega is looking to give that game a shot in the arm, both with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ny9qqpSc0cs&amp;pp=ygUQdmlydHVhIGZpZ2h0ZXIgNQ%3D%3D">a recent 2.0 update to Ultimate Showdown</a> with a new PC port, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKaR2wHDKlU">Virtua Fighter 5 REVO coming later this month</a>.</p>

		<p>HBO has released a new teaser trailer for The Last of Us Season 2, confirming that the show will return in April. Where season one of The Last of Us covered the events of the first game, season two will be delving into the story of the second game, introducing characters like Abby who will have a big part alongside Joel and Ellie.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Last Of Us Season 2 | April 2025 | Max" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ylovT43x3yo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Last of Us Season 2’s trailer gives us a lot of brief shots, showing scenes from The Last of Us Part II captured by the show, with a mix of action and terror as the danger increases for everyone. Neil Druckmann has stated that Season 2 will not cover all of The Last of Us Part II. This was revealed by co-creators Neil Druckmann and Craig Mazin in an interview with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/culture/article/the-last-of-us-finale-ending-explained-interview">GQ</a>. When asked if The Last of Us season 2 would feature the entirety of the second game, Mazin said, “No. No way.” Druckmann added, “It’s more than one season”.</p>
<p>In a previous <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/27/the-last-of-us-season-2-teaser-trailer-reveals-some-new-story-beats/">The Last of Us Season 2 teaser trailer</a> there was more focus on the story, with one major change being Joel talking to what appears to be a therapist about his experiences. This may help people remember some story beats from the previous season, along with providing additional background to the events that occur in Season 2 without having to dive deeply into all of them.</p>

			<p>Following the announcement of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-32-gb-gpu-1999-usd-2x-performance-of-4090/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new GeForce RTX Series GPUs</a> at CES 2025, NVIDIA has also unveiled a series of new or updated RTX technologies that will be in upcoming PC games, starting with <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-revealed-release-date-xbox-games-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DOOM: The Dark Ages</a>.</p>
<p>id Software's much anticipated medieval-themed first-person shooter game coming later this year will run on the latest version of the id Tech engine, powered by full path tracing and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-8x-faster-dlss-3-multi-frame-generation-enhanced-upscaling-rtx-20-above/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">newly announced DLSS 4</a> with support for Multi Frame Generation. It will also take advantage of the improved Ray Reconstruction for increased lighting stability and detail. You can take a peek at DOOM: The Dark Ages with the full suite of NVIDIA RTX technologies in the DLSS 4 medley video below. Needless to say, it looks absolutely stunning.</p>
<p><iframe title="RTX. It’s On. | The Ultimate in Ray Tracing and AI with DLSS 4" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M3fglmDxD2U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Billy Khan, Director of Engine Technology at id Software, has shared a comment:</p>
<p><em>With DLSS 4, we are stepping into a new era of gaming. The new ray reconstruction transformer model powers a historical leap in raytracing capabilities; not just accelerating performance but also enhancing visuals in DOOM: The Dark Ages.</em></p>
<p>The game doesn't have a fixed launch date yet. When it comes out, it will be playable on PC, Xbox Series S|X, and PlayStation 5 on day one.</p>
<p>Back on DLSS 4 and the newly announced or updated NVIDIA RTX technologies, they will, of course, be available at launch on other upcoming PC titles like <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-gets-first-trailer-showing-off-cirilla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Witcher IV</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-state-is-an-impressive-looking-single-player-third-person-shooter-with-strong-metal-gear-solid-vibes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black State</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-gamescom-qa-funcom-talks-endgame-post-launch-updates-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dune: Awakening</a>, all of which will support DLSS Multi Frame Generation. Kadir Demirden, CEO of Black State developer Motion Blur, said:</p>
<p><em>NVIDIA GeForce RTX 50 Series and DLSS 4 are game-changing. We now have the power and technologies to realize the future of interactive storytelling with Black State.</em></p>
<p>Rui Casais, CEO of Dune: Awakening developer Funcom, added:</p>
<p><em>GeForce RTX 50 Series and DLSS 4 mark the beginning of a new generation of games.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Dune: Awakening | 4K NVIDIA DLSS 4 Comparison - Captured on GeForce RTX 5090" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UjnEiP9a9kQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>But it's not just new games that will be updated. On top of the 75 games with day 0 support, more hit games from 2024 and 2023 will receive improvements, such as Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and Alan Wake 2. The former is being updated not only to add DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation and the improved Ray Reconstruction and Super Resolution models but also with a new RTX Hair technology. Jim Kjellin, CTO of Indiana Jones developer MachineGames, said:</p>
<p><em>With GeForce RTX 50 Series, players will be able to experience Indiana Jones and the Great Circle at its best. With elevated image quality, performance, and new neural rendering tech like NVIDIA RTX Hair introduces a new level of character realism, truly adding to the immersion of becoming Indy.</em></p>
<p>According to NVIDIA, RTX Hair features a new Linear-Swept Sphere rendering that runs faster, with improved image quality, whilst using less VRAM. You can preview the RTX Hair update in the comparison image below.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>As for Alan Wake 2, Remedy's horror game will be updated to include the new <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/rtx-kit#ido12x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTX Mega Geometry technology</a>, which is going to be available on all RTX GPUs and laptops. NVIDIA says it can accelerate BVH building for cluster-based geometry systems, enabling up to 100x more ray-traced triangles and better performance in heavily ray-traced scenes, reducing CPU overhead.</p>
<p>The game will also add DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation and the improved Ray Reconstruction transformer model. Additionally, NVIDIA unveiled that Remedy will introduce a new Ultra quality Ray Tracing preset featuring fully ray-traced refractions, fully ray-traced transparent reflections, and higher quality fully ray-traced indirect lighting. This will all be part of the next Alan Wake 2 update. Mika Vehkala, Chief Technology Officer at Remedy Entertainment, commented:</p>
<p><em>With DLSS 4 and GeForce RTX 50 Series we are seeing significant performance gains which enable us to create new game worlds larger and more detailed than ever.</em></p>

<p>Later this year, three more popular PC games will introduce support for DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation: Black Myth: Wukong, Marvel Rivals, and NARAKA: Bladepoint. There's no ETA on the availability for the first game, while Marvel Rivals and NARAKA: Bladepoint are both getting the update next month.</p>

<p>During CES 2025, Sega and Ryu Ga Gotoku revealed a 35-second snippet of in-engine gameplay from the ‘New Virtua Fighter Project’ that was unveiled during The Game Awards 2024. The glimpse of this developing title <strong>isn’t </strong>a gameplay sequence, but it’s a perfect representation of what RGG is aiming for with the first new Virtua Fighter game in almost 20 years.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-pre-development-only-no-gameplay">Pre-Development Only, No Gameplay</h2>



<p>It’s important to stress that the 35-second clip aired by Sega <strong>is not </strong>gameplay. It’s pre-development footage taken from the game’s engine.</p>



<p>In the short video, we get a look at two characters fighting in a marketplace after a brief introduction,. They trade blows for a few seconds, kicking each other into destructible elements of the environment before the sequence fades to black and the Sega logo flashes up.</p>



<p>Check it out here:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="“New VIRTUA FIGHTER Project” pre-development concept video" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GtLRfES1YQU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>It’s little more than a conceptual thing, but it admittedly looks brilliant, and that’s coming from someone who has never enjoyed a fighting game. The small details like the NPCs milling around in the background are super, and the intro sequence is interesting, taking players outside of the typically tiny environments that players fight in.</p>



<p>At The Game Awards 2024, RGG unveiled the ‘New Virtua Fighter Project’, which will be the first new VF game in the series since 2006. </p>



<p>What do you think about the clip? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/acer-nitro-blaze-11-revealed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/acer-has-revealed-the-nitro-blaze-11-an-enormous-gaming-handheld.1075728/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/acer-nitro-blaze-11-revealed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Acer’s recently revealed Nitro Blaze 11 is a new handheld, but they’re cutting it close with the dimensions of this thing. With a massive 10.95-inch display, the Nitro Blaze 11 is by far the chunkiest gaming handheld on the market, and it weighs more than three times as much as a Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>It’ll be a forearm workout just wielding the thing, regardless of how powerful or capable it is under the hood.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-high-performance-portable-gaming">‘High-Performance Portable Gaming’</h2>



<p>Acer’s Nitro Blaze 11 is a certified handheld device, but the portable aspect might be coming under question, given the size and weight of the thing. Once you’ve factored in the casing, the Nitro Blaze 11 is going to be 12 or 13 inches across, which trumps the ASUS ROG Ally X by a couple of inches.</p>



<p>It also weighs a staggering 1050g, while the Ally X, which is widely seen as the industry leader, weighs just 670g. That means a lot when it comes to a portable device. Do you really want to spend a lot of time gaming on something that weighs more than a kilo?</p>



<p>Size aside, the Nitro Blaze 11 is more than capable. It features a 120Hz display, an AMD Ryzen 7 8840HS processor, and up to 2 TB of storage. It also has detachable controllers in case you want to take the weight off, and it accommodates WiFi 6E and USB 4.</p>



<p>In the product’s blurb, Acer wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Nitro Blaze 11 smoothly transitions between daily tasks and gaming. Whether you’re browsing, working, or playing, this handheld adapts seamlessly with precise Hall Effect sticks, a sturdy built-in stand, and detachable controllers that provide flexibility for solo or connected play with the included connector. The front camera makes video calls and streaming easy, ensuring you stay connected wherever you are.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Also, the gigantic screen will likely be a monumental drain on the relatively small battery. The Acer Nitro Blaze 11 comes with a 55 Wh battery, which is nothing compared to the Ally X’s 80 Wh battery.</p>



<p>Finally, the price point isn’t ideal. The Acer Nitro Blaze 11 will set you back a whopping $1199, making it the most expensive gaming handheld on the market right now. It’s hard to see a real selling point for this device if I’m being honest.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/former-bethesda-dev-tired-massive-games/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/former-bethesda-dev-suggests-players-are-tired-of-massive-games.1075710/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/former-bethesda-dev-tired-massive-games/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Bethesda is the king of the castle when it comes to expansive, enormous games. Over the years, the company has produced the likes of Fallout, The Elder Scrolls, and most recently, Starfield, all massive open-world titles with hundreds of hours of content. However, one developer who contributed to many of these creations has suggested that players are ‘fatigued’ by these types of games.</p>



<p>In a recent interview with Kiwi Talkz on YouTube, Will Shen, former lead quest designer on Starfield, said just that. He believes that players are growing tired of 100-hour campaigns and gargantuan worlds that can’t possibly be explored in their entirety.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-a-tall-order">‘A Tall Order’</h2>



<p>Speaking exclusively to Kiwi Talkz, Will Shen explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’re reaching a point where people are fatigued — or a large section, a growing section of the audience, is becoming fatigued at investing 30-plus, 100-plus hours into a game.</p>



<p>They already have the games that they will continually come back to, and adding another one to that list is a tall order. It’s always a tall order.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Shen was instrumental in the delivery of Starfield, the biggest game that Bethesda Game Studios has ever produced. It features more than 1000 planets, all of which can be explored by the player at will. Before that, he worked on Skyrim and Fallout 4, which are gigantic games in their own right, if not by map size then at least by the amount you can do in them.</p>



<p>He mentioned that you can ‘pretty much play (these games) forever’, which is true for many Bethesda titles.</p>



<p>Here’s the full interview for your perusal:</p>

<p>Will Shen left Bethesda Game Studios after a 15-year stint in October 2023, just a month after the release of Starfield. He moved into Something Wicked Games to work on Wyrdsong, and since August 2024, he has assumed a lead designer role at Unknown Worlds Entertainment.</p>

<p>ASUS ROG has revealed the 2025 ROG G700 gaming desktop, a stunning device with more power under the hood than you could dream of. It comes equipped with either an Intel Ultra 9 or a Ryzen 7 9800X3D processor and an all-new NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPU, packing a whopping 32 GB of VRAM.</p>



<p>It’s a purpose-built device that features ‘hyper-efficient cooling’, ‘tool-less entry’, and ‘flagship-level performance’, per the release from ASUS ROG.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-last-pc-you-ll-buy">The Last PC You’ll Buy</h2>



<p>During CES 2025, ASUS ROG unveiled the <a href="https://press.asus.com/news/press-releases/asus-rog-g700-gaming-desktop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">2025 G700 desktop</a>, uncovering a PC with unparalleled gaming power.</p>



<p>Featuring the latest innovations in PC hardware, the G700 can rock the newest Intel and AMD processors, which go hand-in-hand with the recently revealed NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPU. This powerhouse of a unit features 32 GB of GDDR7 VRAM, which will provide gamers with a blistering gaming experience.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, the G700 features up to 64 GB of DDR5 RAM and a 2 TB PCIe Gen 4 NVMe SSD.</p>



<p>If you want to tweak, expand, or upgrade (yeah, right) the G700 desktop, you can do so with ease. One of the selling points of the G700 is that it boasts tool-less entry and standard-sized components that make maintenance a breeze.</p>



<p>If you’re concerned about the heat that’ll be generated by the top-of-the-range CPU, GPU, and the 1000W PSU, fear not. The team has promised hyper-efficient cooling that can be customised to suit either an air-cooled or water-cooled preference, as well as dust filters and a unique airflow path. </p>



<p>The price point of the G700 is yet to be revealed, but would you consider making a massive investment in this PC? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Samsung has lifted the lid on a staggering piece of gaming technology at CES 2025 – the Odyssey OLED G60SF. It’s the world’s first 500Hz monitor, and it’s a stunning OLED device with the lowest response time in the business at just 0.03ms. It’s a new bar for high-end monitor manufacturers to aim for, and it’s set to change gaming experiences worldwide.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-evolution">The Evolution</h2>



<p>Samsung’s Odyssey range has long been known as a pinnacle of technology, but the latest devices revealed during CES 2025 are borderline ridiculous.</p>



<p>The G60SF is set to shatter expectations, delivering a world-first 500Hz experience in 4K. It’s a VESA DisplayHDR TrueBlack 400-certified unit, which means the depth of contrast and colour will be unparalleled. It’s a 27-inch monitor that’ll blow your hair back, and it comes with HDR10+ capabilities.</p>



<p>Alongside the new G60SF, Samsung also revealed the Odyssey 3D, a glasses-free 3D display that utilises light field display technology to give you an immersive experience, the likes of which are currently unseen in the industry. It’s a hyper-ergonomic monitor with stacks of adjustment options, plus a 4K resolution and 1 ms response time to boot.</p>



<p>Also, Samsung took the opportunity to show off the Odyssey G7. This all-new, 40-inch display boasts a 21:9 resolution over a super-sized, widescreen profile. It’s the industry’s first 40-inch gaming monitor, and it’s enormous. If you want to cut down the number of screens you’re using, why not opt for one giant display with the Odyssey G7?</p>



<p>The price point for the 500Hz OLED G60SF is yet to be revealed, but you can bet your last dollar it’ll be a pretty penny. It’s one of the most innovative and incredible monitors I’ve ever seen, so you can be sure it’ll break the bank.</p>

<p>Recently, a slew of leaks and reveals surfaced online from the Marvel Rivals universe. Since being released on December 6, Marvel Rivals has established itself as a powerhouse title, maintaining a solid player base and refusing to stop growing, soaring up the charts as players dive in to experience the free-to-play, Marvel-backed shooter.</p>



<p>The most recent reveal showcased Reed Richards’ ‘The Maker’ skin, which will arrive with the introduction of the Fantastic Four on January 10. In a series of leaks, the Invisible Woman was detailed further, with her Malice skin being revealed alongside gameplay snippets.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-that-s-fantastic">That’s Fantastic</h2>



<p>In a leak posted online by Rivals_Leaks, a promotional image of Malice and The Maker was revealed. These skins, which are tied to Sue Storm and Reed Richards respectively, are now half-confirmed. Following the leak, NetEase posted a short clip showcasing The Maker, the skin for Mr. Fantastic that’ll arrive when the team enters the game on January 10:</p>

“Me? I’m Reed Richards. The ultimate Reed Richards. The one who’s finally going to solve everything.”

The Maker costume unleashes the dark brilliance of Mister Fantastic, showcasing a version of Reed Richards who’s embraced the ultimate… </span></p></article></div>







<p>Malice is yet to be unveiled in the same fashion, but NetEase did show the full promotional image at the end of the short trailer above. However, Sue Storm’s character was shown fighting bots while wearing the skin in a quick leak, also posted on socials by Rivals_Leaks (originally from RivalsLeaks):</p>











<p>The Fantastic Four will be the latest in a long line of iconic characters to make their way into Marvel Rivals. The game has a stunning lineup of characters and given how expansive the Marvel universe is, there’s a roster to pick from that’ll keep NetEase busy for quite some time.</p>

<p>WWE 2K25 has been teased by 2K and WWE during RAW’s first show on Netflix. The grandiose event, which was backed by a star-studded cast featuring John Cena, Roman Reigns, The Rock, and CM Punk, served as the official welcome for WWE on Netflix.</p>



<p>More information will be revealed by 2K on January 28, but the game can already be wishlisted on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-grand-reveal">Grand Reveal</h2>



<p>The upcoming reveal of WWE 2K25 has fans energised, and it comes just days after WWE 2K23 was finally taken offline, leaving just WWE 2K24 in a fully playable state.</p>



<p>Here’s the statement offered by 2K in the wake of the tease:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>WWE 2K returns bigger, bolder, and better than ever in a breakthrough year for the franchise! WWE 2K25 is preparing to charge down the ramp with all the authenticity and action fans love from the best in sports entertainment.</p>



<p>Discover game-changing features, iconic Superstars, and more details on&nbsp;<strong>January 28th, 2025.</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>The expectation is that WWE 2K25 will follow a similar release pattern to last year’s instalment, dropping in April 2025 – but that’s speculation and nothing more. </p>



<p>Following the teasers, Xbox took to social media to reveal the first screenshots of the game:</p>











<p>This tells us that at least CM Punk, Damien Priest, Liv Morgan, and Cody Rhodes will appear in the game, but that’s hardly a revelation in itself. What fans are most curious about is who will feature as the cover star for WWE 2K25. Last year, it was Cody Rhodes, and the year before that, John Cena took centre stage. </p>



<p>Given that all the recent talk is centred around John Cena’s epic retirement tour, could the superstar make yet another appearance on the cover of a WWE game? </p>

            <title><![CDATA[The United States Just Added Tencent to a ‘Chinese Military Blacklist’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/tencent-chinese-military-blacklist/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-united-states-just-added-tencent-to-a-%E2%80%98chinese-military-blacklist%E2%80%99.1075680/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/tencent-chinese-military-blacklist/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has been reported that the United States has added Tencent Holdings Ltd. to a blacklist identifying companies as having ties to the Chinese military. This story was shared by Bloomberg, and as the revelation broke online, Tencent’s shares declined. Tencent was joined by CATL, a tech manufacturer linked with Tesla.</p>



<p>Tencent is China’s most valuable company and has a reach that covers some of the biggest video game companies on the planet, such as Epic Games, Activision Blizzard, Ubisoft, Riot Games, and SuperCell.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-pentagon-warning">Pentagon Warning</h2>



<p>The ‘blacklist’, backed by the Pentagon, indicates whether a company is inherently linked to China’s military or the nation’s ‘defence industrial base’. In <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-06/us-adds-tencent-to-chinese-military-blacklist-shares-decline?embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg’s recent report</a>, it was written:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s unclear whether either company deals regularly with the PLA. Beyond direct ties to the government, US officials have pointed to laws that require Chinese companies to share information with Beijing on matters deemed relevant to national security.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Tencent’s stock value took a dive as the Pentagon’s designation hit the airwaves. It was followed up by a statement from Tencent’s representatives:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are not a military company or supplier. Unlike sanctions or export controls, this listing has no impact on our business.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was suggested <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c9q78wn9g8zo">by the BBC</a> that the Pentagon had been ‘pressured’ to add more Chinese companies to the blacklist, which is how CATL, a company that contributes to the manufacture of electric cars, ended up on the list.</p>



<p>Historically, companies have challenged the Pentagon’s decisions regarding this damning blacklist. For instance, DJI and Hesai Technologies took the intelligence agency to court but at the time of publishing, both remain on the list. In 2021, Xiaomi successfully petitioned for a removal from the blacklist.</p>



<p>The Department of Defense-backed list now features a whopping 134 Chinese companies, and that number is growing.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/no-z2-steam-deck-2-says-valve/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98there-will-be-no-z2-steam-deck%E2%80%99-valve-denies-recent-steam-deck-2-rumours.1075674/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/no-z2-steam-deck-2-says-valve/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Recently, rumours started circulating online regarding a Steam Deck 2, powered by AMD’s Ryzen Z2 processor, revealed just hours ago. The source of this speculation came from VideoCardz.com, which was the first site to share slides containing tech specs for the new processors, one of which mentioned that Valve’s Steam Deck would be a recipient of the Z2.</p>



<p>However, a Valve employee has taken to social media to declare that there is not and ‘will be no Z2 Steam Deck’, clearing the air and setting the story straight.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-for-now">For Now?</h2>



<p>On <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/plagman.bsky.social/post/3lf36y66ggs2b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bluesky</a>, Valve employee Pierre-Loup Griffais wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>There is (not) and will be no Z2 Steam Deck. Guessing the slide was meant to say the series is meant for products like that, not announcing anything specific.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The slide in question also mentioned the Legion Go and Asus ROG Ally, which already feature AMD’s Z1 processor range. It’s easy to see how the assumption could have been made that it would be <strong>the next Steam Deck </strong>that would house the Ryzen Z2, but that’s not the case.</p>



<p>In a report by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337300/amd-ryzen-z2-z2-extreme-z2-go" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, it was highlighted that AMD wouldn’t confirm either way whether the Z2 would be implemented in a Steam Deck 2 unit, nor would it mention <strong>any </strong>definite home for the new hardware – Lenovo, Asus, MSI, or whatever else. These conversations took place at CES, the ultimate stage for tech announcements. </p>



<p>With all that being said, there <strong>is </strong>a Steam Deck 2 on the horizon – Valve has made it clear that it intends to produce one at some point, such as the natural lifecycle of any gaming device. Only time will tell what hardware powers the device, though. For now, it doesn’t look like it’ll go hand-in-hand with an AMD Ryzen Z2 processor.</p>

Set primarily within the early Midgar chapters of Final Fantasy 7, the remake gives Cloud Strife and the rest of the Avalanche crew a massive graphical glow-up as they fight to stop Shinra Inc. from turning the planet's life essence into a power source. Ghosts from the past threaten Cloud and his friends, and toward the end of the game, there are major changes to the storyline that shake up the status quo.</p><p>The Intermission expansion focuses on Yuffie Kisaragi and her partner Sonon Kusakabe as they work to steal a powerful artifact from Shinra. This is a short but fun add-on to the main campaign of Final Fantasy 7 Remake, which also saw various technical and graphical improvements added to the game. It's a fairly linear game overall--with some annoying padding--but if you're looking to revisit the cyberpunk world of Square Enix's beloved sci-fantasy game, Final Fantasy 7 Remake won't disappoint.</p></div>                      </div><p>You should also check out the official Material Ultimania book focused on the PS5 version of FF7 Remake.

			<p>Despite being one of the longest-running JRPG series still active today, Falcom's Ys series started seeing some measure of success only recently, but this wasn't caused by an increase in the quality of newer entries in the series over the older ones, as Adol's adventures have always been extremely fun to play through and generally well-received by the dedicated fan base, with only a few exceptions. One of these exceptions is the third entry in the series, Wanderers from Ys, a game that wasn't as well received as the first two entries in the series due to the fact that it did away with the fast-paced top-down experience, replacing it with a side-scrolling experience similar to Zelda II which left something to be desired. As such, no one was surprised to see the original eventually getting completely remade with Ys: The Oath in Felghana, a well-realized remake that surpassed not only the original but almost every other entry in the series. Twenty years after the remake's original release, Western audiences on PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch can now enjoy an enhanced version of the game with Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana, which stands out as the definitive edition of the classic action role-playing game by Falcom.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/YsMemoireTheOathInFelghana_Screenshot_Portrait-Classic.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The core features that made up the Ys: Oath in Felghana experience haven't changed much in Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana, such as the story. Following their adventures in Esteria and Ys, the renowned red-haired adventurer Adol Christin and his new friend Dogi journey to Felghana, a region that has changed a lot since Dogi left his hometown of Redmont eight years prior. Everything that could go wrong is seemingly doing so, as the region is beset by monsters, a once dormant volcano has become active again, and the lord of the land is vexing the population and extorting money from them, with the apparent involvement of Dogi's childhood friend Chester. Not capable of turning the other way, Adol decides to help the people of Felghana and his friend Dogi, eventually discovering that there is much more at work than some tyrannical lord out to take money from the poor people he was supposed to guide and protect.</p>
<p>Those who got into the series only recently with games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ys-viii-lacrimosa-dana-wonderful-adventure/">Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ys-ix-monstrum-nox-the-night-is-dark-and-full-of-terrors/">Ys IX: Monstrum Nox</a>, or <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ys-x-nordics-one-more-memorable-adventure/">Ys X: Nordics</a> may find this story a little on the straightforward side, lacking a huge cast of well-developed characters or plot twists, but in more than a few ways, playing Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana in 2025 feels quite refreshing, as the game does its absolute best to keep players into the action, keeping the story elements to the minimum. This is not to say that the story is in any way bad. The contrary, actually: the sense of adventure that permeates the series is in full show here, just in a more condensed form that serves the experience in the best of ways.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/YsMemoireTheOathInFelghana_Screenshot_Battle_02.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Much like for the story and characters, playing Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana for the first time after experiencing more recent entries in the series may feel at first like taking a few steps back, as the experience is considerably more straightforward than in pretty much every game that came after the 2005 original. There are no multiple playable characters nor deep character customization here, only Adol, his sword, and the three special elemental attacks obtained during the course of the adventure that add a little complexity to the intense but basic hack-and-slash combat system together with Boost Mode, which can be used to temporarily power-up Adol once a specific meter is full. While combat doesn't evolve much during the course of the game, it doesn't overstay its welcome with its short 12-hour duration, the clever enemy design and the fast pace of the action make it enjoyable for the whole length of the game. As usual for the entire series, boss battles are among the highlights of the experience which push the limits of the combat system and player's skill to the maximum, even at lower difficulty settings.</p>
<p>While combat is a clear previous iteration of mechanics that are still present in the latest entries in the series, Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana feels like a markedly different game from titles like Lacrimosa of Dana or Nordics when it comes to exploration. Instead of featuring a variety of bigger locations that provide plenty of opportunities to stray off the beaten path in search of secrets, The Oath in Felghana is a much more compact and linear experience, as players don't get the opportunity to roam around almost freely, as each location is explored only when the story dictates. There are still plenty of secrets and alternate paths to find, but most definitely not in the same way as the latest entries in the series. What makes traversal nonetheless enjoyable are the platform game mechanics, which require a little bit of skill from the player in using certain abilities to reach normally inaccessible areas and so on. If you have played Ys VI: Ark of Napishtim or Ys Origins, you will find yourself right at home in this regard, as Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana employs similar mechanics.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/YsMemoireTheOathInFelghana_Screenshot_Battle_03.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While those who have played through the original PSP release will find a very familiar experience, there are some new additions and quality-of-life improvements that enhance the experience, some lifted from the PC release, others completely new. For example, at the Very Easy difficulty, it is possible to completely skip the Clock Tower segment, which is among the most challenging of the game, if not the most challenging. Turbo Mode is both a quality-of-life improvement and a feature that can up the challenge, as it speeds up the whole game and can make Inferno difficulty even more challenging. Rounding up the new additions are new narrated sequences that better tie the game with the rest of the series, making it feel more like a page in Adol's chronicles like more recent games, newly recorded voice acting for Adol, high-quality character illustrations, which can be switched with the original versions at any time, and enhanced visuals sporting higher quality textures and sprites. These visual improvements, however, are minor and are essentially a resolution bump, so if you already have played the PC version of the game, you shouldn't expect Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana to look any better. Nor sound any better, as the game features three soundtrack options (Original, PC-8801, X68000), which were included in previous versions of the game. Still, it is a great soundtrack featuring some blood-pumping pieces that go extremely well with the game's no-holding-back fast pace.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana was mostly meant to free the original game from the PSP prison it was stuck in, regarding consoles, while offering a bunch of new features and enhancements to make it more enticing, and in this regard, the game definitely doesn't disappointing. Those looking for some old-school Ys action will be quite happy to return to Felghana with Adol and Dogi, while those who never had the chance to play the game will find a fast-paced adventure that does not disappointing.</p>

						<section>
				<p>Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana was clearly designed to bring the remake of the third entry in the Falcom series to modern consoles, and in this regard, it fully succeeds. The game delivers a fast-paced, no-frills experience that remains engaging from start to finish, enhanced by new features, improved visuals and quality-of-life improvements. However, compared to more recent entries in the series, Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana is a more straightforward game with a relatively simple story and combat system, which may not appeal to those who were introduced to the series through its modern installments.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337949/nvidia-ace-ai-npcs-pubg-ally-teammate<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nvidia has spent the last two years showing off its digital “ACE” characters that can have in-game conversations with you using generative AI. But at CES 2025, the company is taking the ACE characters a step further by showing how they can be “autonomous game characters” — including, sometime this year, a teammate to help you get a chicken dinner in <em>PUBG</em>. </p><p>Nvidia says that ACE characters can use AI to “perceive, plan, and act like human players,” <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Fnvidia-ace-autonomous-ai-companions-pubg-naraka-bladepoint%2F">per a blog post</a>. “Powered by generative AI, ACE will enable living, dynamic game worlds with companions that comprehend and support player goals, and enemies that adapt dynamically to player tactics.” The characters are powered by “small language models (SLMs)” that are “capable of planning at human-like frequencies required for realistic decision making” as well as “multi-modal SLMs for vision and audio that allow AI characters to hear audio cues and perceive their environment.”</p><p>As for how that will work in <em>PUBG</em>, you’ll be able to team up with the “<em>PUBG</em> Ally,” which Nvidia and <em>PUBG</em> publisher Krafton are calling the “world’s first Co-Playable Character (CPC).” The Ally will be able to “communicate using game-specific lingo, provide real-time strategic recommendations, find and share loot, drive vehicles, and fight other human players using the game’s extensive arsenal of weapons,” Nvidia says. </p><p>Basically, it sounds like an AI teammate you can talk with natural language who’s supposed to be as capable as a human. And <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEKUSMqrbzQ">a video</a> shows the Ally indeed helping a player find specific loot, bringing over a vehicle, and attempting to flank opposing players. But the video is heavily edited and isn’t live, so I’m skeptical that the Ally will work as well as is being shown here.</p><p>AI characters built with ACE are coming to other games, too. <em>Naraka: Bladepoint Mobile PC Version</em> will get a “a local inference AI Teammate feature” in March 2025, while <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em> on PC will get the feature “later in 2025,” according to Nvidia’s blog post. “AI Teammates powered by NVIDIA ACE can join your party, battling alongside you, finding you specific items that you need, swapping gear, offering suggestions on skills to unlock, and making plays that’ll help you achieve victory.”</p><p>Krafton’s upcoming life simulation game called <em>inZOI </em>will also get CPCs called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pk9z1upOj3U">“Smart Zoi.”</a> And Nvidia says that ACE characters can be bosses, too, and they’ll be used for boss encounters in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8XeiZ4djKw&amp;t=2s">Wemade Next’s <em>MIR5</em></a><em>.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The 2025 Scar 16 and 18 come with RGB lights all the way around the bottom of the chassis as well as a user-programmable LED dot-matrix display on the lid, as seen on other ROG devices <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/8/24023549/asus-rog-phone-8-pro-ai-price-release-date-specs-features-gaming-smartphone">like Asus’ gaming phones</a>. </p><p>Beneath the flashy exterior, the Scar 16 and 18 can be maxed out with an Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX processor and Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 GPU. It can also be configured with up to 64GB of DDR5-5600 RAM and a 2TB PCIe Gen4 SSD. The ROG Nebula HDR display comprises a 16:10 2.5K Mini LED panel with a peak brightness of 1,200 nits and a 240Hz refresh rate. There are two Thunderbolt 5 ports included, and the design allows for easy access to the bottom panel for component upgrades. </p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->6</p><p><cite>Photo by Antonio G.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/asus%E2%80%99-latest-rog-flow-z13-gaming-tablet-uses-amd%E2%80%99s-new-integrated-graphics.1075629/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24335012/asus-rog-flow-z13-gaming-tablet-amd-ryzen-max-plus-price-specs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Asus has a new version of its Surface Pro-like gaming tablet for CES, and it’s making some sizable changes both inside and out. The Asus ROG Flow Z13 for 2025 is once again a slightly chunky, almost-half-inch-thick, 13-inch tablet with a built-in kickstand, magnetic keyboard cover, a bunch of ports, and a clear window on its rear with RGB lighting to show off its innards.</p><p>That fun glass window is now larger, with a direct view of the motherboard, but the biggest change for the ROG Flow Z13 is its switch to integrated graphics. That may seem like a step backward for a gaming-focused tablet since gamers covet dedicated GPUs, but Asus is outfitting it with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337025/amd-ryzen-ai-max-strix-halo-fire-range-9955hx3d">AMD’s powerful new “Strix Halo” processor</a>. The ROG Flow Z13 can be configured with the Ryzen AI Max 390 for $1,999.99 or the Ryzen AI Max Plus 395 for $2,199.99. The top-end model with the Max Plus 395 has 16 CPU cores and 40 graphics cores, while the base-model Ryzen AI Max Plus 390 (curse these names) has 12 CPU cores and 32 graphics cores. The Z13 utilizes a redesigned stainless steel vapor chamber for cooling these graphics-heavy chips, which are capable of 120W TDP. </p><p>All that power in the Z13 is responsible for driving a 13-inch, 2560 x 1600 touchscreen display with a speedy 180Hz refresh rate (up from 165Hz on the last-gen model), which you don’t often find in laptops and tablets of this size. For ports, it’s got two USB 4, one USB-A 3.2 Gen 2, HDMI 2.1, a microSD card slot capable of UHS-II speeds, and a 3.5mm combination headphone / mic jack. It’s also got a 5-megapixel front-facing webcam and 13-megapixel rear-facing camera — so you can flash your RGB as you awkwardly take tablet photos in public. It also has Wi-Fi 7.</p><p>The Z13 supports USB-C Power Delivery for charging, but that won’t be powerful enough to allow its full performance under load. Instead, it comes with a 200W power adapter that uses Asus’ proprietary and reversible slim power jack — like on its recent laptops.</p><p>Other quality-of-life improvements for the Z13 include a new detachable keyboard with larger keycaps and a more generously sized touchpad. And on its right side, beside the power button and volume rocker, is a new “ScreenXpert” button that summons a Command-Center-like widget that includes multiple-display window management controls, quick access to operating modes like Turbo mode or Silent mode, and other settings like muting your mic. It’s primarily there to help control things while in tablet mode since the keyboard contains shortcuts for most of these functions.</p><p>I got a quick glimpse of the new ROG Flow Z13 at a preview event, and Asus sent me a preproduction model right before CES to get a little bit of hands-on time. It’s what I’m writing this post on right now, and boy do I appreciate the updates to this keyboard cover. The 1.7mm key travel and bigger touchpad go a long way toward getting work done. While the Ryzen 395 chip has the potential to be power-hungry, the battery life on the Z13 shows some promise. Asus is only claiming 10 hours of battery life, and I did manage to get through a full eight-plus-hour workday of Chrome tabs, streaming music (though the speakers seem kind of bad at first listen), and writing across multiple virtual desktops the day before flying to CES — with pretty much no issues.</p><p>I definitely prefer a proper laptop to a tablet with a kickstand and keyboard cover, but being able to remove the keyboard deck for a little more flexibility and comfort when it’s time to fire up a game is pretty slick. I tried out a little <em>Helldivers 2 </em>on the Flow Z13, and it performed quite well, especially for a tablet. Set to the Z13’s native 2.5K resolution, in-game render scale on Ultra Quality, and texture details on medium, I saw 60fps or just slightly under, and it looked really nice. If I bumped it down from Ultra Quality to Quality scaling, it jumped up to an even smoother 80fps. This was, of course, while the tablet was plugged in and its fans were blasting on Turbo mode. Diving in again while unplugged dropped the Ultra Quality render scale performance down to the 45 to 50fps range since playing on battery limits you to Performance mode instead of Turbo.</p><p>This is preproduction hardware, but so far, it’s pretty impressive for integrated graphics. AMD’s new chip might have something special here for thin and light devices, but since it lacks Thunderbolt 5, that means the Flow Z13 can’t use the full GPU bandwidth of Asus’ new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/24100176">XG Mobile eGPU</a>. (Previous models could use the older XG Mobile via its proprietary connector.) But of course, that would make this somewhat portable PC gaming solution a little less portable, and the new XG Mobile costs about as much as the Flow Z13 itself.</p><p>But does a gaming tablet make much sense in 2025 when portable PC gaming is being so adequately served by the Steam Deck and a bunch of other dedicated handhelds? We’ll have to see how a production model of the ROG Flow Z13 fares when it launches sometime in February.</p><p><em>Photography by Antonio G.

			<p>During NVIDIA's CES 2025 keynote, <a href="https://wccftech.com/inworld-ai-showcases-latest-advancements-in-game-development-and-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inworld AI</a> announced a partnership with the maker of GeForce graphics cards and with Logitech's <a href="https://wccftech.com/logitech-enters-streaming-fight-with-89m-purchase-of-streamlabs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Streamlabs</a> division to unveil what they're calling the world's first Intelligent Streaming Assistant.</p>
<p>The collaboration mixes Streamlabs' live streaming expertise, NVIDIA's <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-unveils-ace-model-for-next-gen-games-integrating-ai-into-virtual-characters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ACE</a> technology and AI vision models, and Inworld AI's perception and cognition capabilities. Using multimodal AI, Inworld powers the brain of the Intelligent Streaming Assistant, transforming it into an interactive co-host, expert producer, and technical assistant.</p>
<p>Here's a more detailed overview of how everything works under the hood:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Interactive Co-Host:</strong> Leveraging NVIDIA’s computer vision capabilities to detect events in real time with Inworld’s ability to drive real-time agent behavior based on game state and contextual understanding of games, the Intelligent Streaming Assistant can offer contextually relevant commentary at the creator’s request. This awareness enables the assistant to do things like highlight a well-timed build, provide commentary during a dramatic Victory Royale, or even shout out at audience members for sending tips.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Stream Producer:</strong> The Intelligent Streaming Assistant can trigger audio and visual effects to enhance high-impact gameplay or clip the best highlights for replay. Inworld processes multimodal inputs from the creator, chat, and game to execute these Producer Actions through the Streamlabs API, giving the creator full control over how their stream unfolds.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Technical Assistant:</strong> The Intelligent Streaming Assistant also helps with setting up Streamlabs Desktop and troubleshooting. Inworld processes the input from the creator to execute scene transitions or animations through the Streamlabs API, helping ensure the stream runs smoothly.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Creators will be able to select from assistant personalities that pair well with the tone of their stream, whether they are looking for subtle behind-the-scenes support or a lively co-host. Check out a short demo video below.</p>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/909h0VZeOMM?si=nK6W23sTZR2xLDqi" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Kylan Gibbs, CEO of Inworld AI, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>The pace of innovation in generative AI is nothing short of extraordinary, propelling us beyond first-generation applications into a new era of sophisticated agentic behavior. Our collaboration with Streamlabs and NVIDIA exemplifies how Inworld's AI agents enable real-time, context-aware interactions. More importantly, it demonstrates the real-world potential of AI to augment games and entertainment—empowering creators to deepen engagement and delight their audiences.</em></p>
<p>Ashray Urs, Head of Streamlabs, added:</p>
<p><em>We hope that with this groundbreaking technology, creators can now embrace AI in a way that is authentic to their brand and enables them to push the boundaries of innovation. The first intelligent streaming assistant represents another leap forward for the medium, giving creators the power to harness this technology to make streaming easier and more captivating, all while maintaining the level of authenticity they need to nurture and grow their community.</em></p>
<p>The Intelligent Streaming Assistant will be available via the Streamlabs App Store later in 2025.</p>

Di Benedetto / The Verge</p></div><p><time datetime="2025-01-07T04:00:00.000Z"> <!-- -->Jan 7, 2025, 4:00 AM UTC</time></p><div><h2>Share this story</h2></div></div></div><div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Razer announced it’s overhauling the Razer Blade 16 inside and out. In addition to a new CPU and GPU, the Blade 16 is now thinner overall than the outgoing 2024 model and comes with a few tweaks to its audio system and keyboard. </p><p>The new Blade 16 comes with up to a Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 CPU and a “next-gen Nvidia<strong> </strong>GPU.” The company also bumped its speaker array from four to six speakers, while the display carries over the 240Hz OLED <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/4/24024217/razer-gaming-laptop-updates-blade-16-18-oled-4k-ces">introduced to the line last year</a>. This is the first time Razer has put an AMD processor in the Blade 16.</p><p>Razer says it’s packing all of that into a chassis that’s over 30 percent thinner than last year’s model at just 0.59 inches — or 14.9 millimeters — thick<strong> </strong>in the front and 0.69 inches (17.4mm) in the back, not including the feet. For reference, the 16-inch MacBook Pro M4 is 0.61 inches (15.5mm) thick, including feet. The new Razer Blade&nbsp;is also deeper than last year’s model, measuring 250.5mm front to back, versus 244mm for the 2024 Blade 16. Despite all of that, Razer says it increased the travel of its keyboard keys from 1mm to 1.5mm. And there’s now a Copilot key, of course.</p><p>That thinness may come at a cost: the new Blade 16 has a 90Wh battery that it says can charge to 80 percent in about 45 minutes. The fast charging may come in handy; the larger 95.2Wh battery in the Blade 16 we <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23588660/razer-blade-16-2023-review-specs-features-design">reviewed in 2023</a> already felt like it wasn’t up to the task. That review unit was also a hot laptop. Razer says it’s using a new thermal gel that covers more interior surface area than the 2023 model.</p><div><div><p><figcaption><em>The 2025 model (top) vs. the thicker 2024 model (bottom).</em></figcaption></p></div><div><figcaption><em>2024 (left) vs. 2025 (right).</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div></div><p>The AMD chip it’s using might help things, though. When <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24324299/asus-rog-zephyrus-g16-2024-gaming-laptop-review-amd-strix-point">we tested an Asus ROG Zephyrus G16 with that Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 CPU</a> against the same laptop with an Intel Core Ultra 9 185H, the AMD version ran for three hours longer in non-gaming tasks and put out slightly less heat, though Asus puts a much lower power draw cap on its gaming laptops than Razer does. Naturally, we won’t know how any of that affects the new Blade 16 until we have one in hand to test. </p><p>The 2025 Razer Blade 16 is due out in the first quarter of this year. Razer didn’t announce pricing, but you can bet it won’t be cheap.</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->10</p><div><figcaption><em>The new Razer Blade 16.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Razer</cite></p></div></div></div><div><p>Most Popular</p><p>Most Popular</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/4/24307731/ces-2025-tvs-gaming-smart-home-wearables-news"><h2>CES 2025: all the news, gadgets, and surprises</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24325799/dell-pro-max-premium-plus-ces-laptop-pc-rebrand-announcement"><h2>Dell kills the XPS brand</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337396/nvidia-rtx-5080-5090-5070-ti-5070-price-release-date"><h2>Nvidia announces next-gen RTX 5090 and 5080 GPUs</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337117/microsoft-bing-search-results-google-design-trick"><h2>Microsoft is using Bing to trick people into thinking they’re on Google</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/5/24336154/samsung-the-frame-pro-features-specs"><h2>Samsung announces The Frame Pro: could this be the perfect TV?</h2></a><hr></li></ol></div></div></article></main><div><h2>More from this stream<!-- --> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/4/24307731/ces-2025-tvs-gaming-smart-home-wearables-news">CES 2025: all the news, gadgets, and surprises</a></h2><ul><li><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24335238/msi-gaming-laptops-cyborg-stealth-raider-vector-nvidia-rtx-intel-amd-ces">MSI’s 2025 gaming laptops have the latest from Nvidia, Intel, and AMD — plus lots of RGB</a></h3><p><time datetime="2025-01-07T04:00:00.000Z"> <!-- -->Jan 7, 2025, 4:00 AM UTC</time></p></li><li><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24335564/alienware-27-inch-4k-240hz-oled-price-date">Alienware’s 27-inch 4K 240Hz OLED monitor is only a couple months away</a></h3><p><time datetime="2025-01-07T04:00:00.000Z"> <!-- -->Jan 7, 2025, 4:00 AM UTC</time></p></li><li><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24335027/msi-titan-18-dragon-edition-norse-myth-gaming-laptop-ces-price-specs">The Titan Dragon Edition is MSI’s latest all-out gaming laptop</a></h3><p><time datetime="2025-01-07T04:00:00.000Z"> <!-- -->Jan 7, 2025, 4:00 AM UTC</time></p></li><li><h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24332341/alienware-area-51-16-18-rgb-laptop-price-specs-ces">Alienware’s new Area-51 laptops have light-up trackpads and fans</a></h3><p><time datetime="2025-01-07T04:00:00.000Z"> <!-- -->Jan 7, 2025, 4:00 AM UTC</time></p></li></ul><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/4/24307731/ces-2025-tvs-gaming-smart-home-wearables-news">See all <!-- -->177<!-- --> stories</a> </div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24335320/hp-omen-32x-smart-gaming-monitor-g2-specs-ces-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HP is jumping into the smart monitor space with the Omen 32x, a gaming monitor that doubles as a streaming device running Google TV.&nbsp;It’ll ship this April for $749.99, the company announced at CES 2025.</p><p>The HP Omen 32x Smart Gaming Monitor has a 31.5-inch 4K IPS display with a 144Hz refresh rate, 1ms response time, 400 nit peak brightness, and DisplayHDR 400 with Dolby Vision. The panel covers 95 percent of the Display P3 and 99 percent of the sRGB color gamuts, and it has support for G-Sync and FreeSync Premium. For video inputs, it has one DisplayPort 1.4 port and two HDMI 2.1 ports, plus a 65W USB-C Power Delivery port with alt mode support for DisplayPort. It also has two USB-A 2.0 ports for peripherals, 3.5mm for audio (plus four built-in 3W speakers), and even an ethernet jack.</p><p>The hardware specs don’t jump off the page compared to other gaming monitors in its class, but the Google TV integration sets it apart. You’ll find it familiar if you’ve used a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/6/24214471/google-chromecast-line-discontinued">Chromecast</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/6/24214055/google-tv-streamer-features-price-matter-thread">Google TV Streamer</a>, or select <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/1/23619895/sony-2023-tv-lineup-bravia-xr-features">TVs from Sony</a>, Hisense, and the like. It delivers recommendations based on your watch history, and you can use Google Assistant voice commands to search for specific content within its deep library of apps as it pulls options from all available sources. You can also cast content from supported mobile apps. Most other smart monitors, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/31/24020920/lg-myview-4k-smart-monitor-display-tv-webos">LG’s MyView line</a> and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/24/23735566/samsung-smart-monitor-2023-m80c-m70c-m50c-tv">Samsung M series</a>, use their own custom operating systems, and most of them are more focused on productivity than gaming.</p><p>The Omen 32x also has some unique tricks we haven’t seen before, such as native support for streaming your screen to four platforms — including Twitch, YouTube, and Instagram — simultaneously with no additional hardware. It can stream up to two webcam sources in addition to what’s on your screen. You can also mirror your Android-based smartphone to the display and use it in desktop mode within a multiview window while you’re gaming. HP even built in wireless KVM functionality, allowing you to operate everything using the same keyboard and mouse.</p><div><figcaption><em>HP’s 2025 G2 monitors, like the pictured Omen 34c G2, have a minimum 180Hz refresh rate.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: HP</cite></p></div><p>HP is also updating its mainstream G2 line of monitors for 2025, including the $479.99 Omen 34c G2, a 34-inch WQHD curved ultrawide (21:9) display with FreeSync Premium, DisplayHDR 400, and a 4,000:1 contrast ratio. We’re also getting new 27-inch 16:9 options in the 1080p Omen 27 G2 for $249.99 in May, the QHD Omen 27q G2 for $299.99 in April, and the QHD 27qs G2 for $449.99 in June. </p><p>All will benefit from factory color calibration for the first time, and the former three will support boosted refresh rates up to 180Hz. The 27qs G2, however, is distinguished as the only monitor in the G2 lineup with an IPS Black display and the first ever with a 280Hz refresh rate. IPS Black displays are said to offer higher contrast ratios (2,000:1 on the 27qs G2) and better color accuracy than ordinary IPS panels.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[MSI’s 2025 gaming laptops have the latest from Nvidia, Intel, and AMD — plus lots of RGB]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24335238/msi-gaming-laptops-cyborg-stealth-raider-vector-nvidia-rtx-intel-amd-ces<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nvidia’s launch of its new RTX 50-series graphics cards is a big moment for a gaming-focused company like MSI. The PC component maker is refreshing most of its laptop line with new Nvidia GPUs, revised designs, and of course, plenty of AI branding fluff. It’s also offering more CPU options from AMD across its dizzying array of models and configurations. But while there’s a plethora of choices here for gamers, they’re best if you’re partial to jumbo-sized laptops, since many of them are big and heavy 18-inchers.</p><p>Here’s the rundown of what MSI is offering for its gaming laptops in 2025, starting from the top. (MSI hasn’t sent us finalized pricing and availability, but we’ll update this post once we have it.)</p><p><h3>MSI Titan 18 HX AI</h3></p><div><figcaption><em>Even in the standard-edition version, the MSI Titan is an over-the-top laptop.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: MSI</cite></p></div><p>Toward the top of MSI’s lineup is the new Titan 18 HX AI — the standard one, not the ridiculous <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/24099068">Dragon Edition</a>.</p><p>MSI’s halo gaming laptop sports an 18-inch Mini LED screen with a resolution of 3840 x 2400 (16:10) and 120Hz refresh. It only comes with an Intel CPU option — specifically, the new Core Ultra 9 275HX — where many other new MSI notebooks now offer AMD alternatives. For the standard-edition Titan’s GPU, you can pick from Nvidia’s new RTX 5080 or flagship 5090. It can be outfitted with up to 96GB of DDR5 RAM and both Gen5 and Gen4 NVMe M.2 SSD slots (the Gen5 slot even has extra cooling by way of a dedicated heat pipe for maximum performance).</p><p>The laptop weighs in at 7.94 pounds and has a 99.9Wh battery inside it, which is the largest capacity allowed on a plane. For ports, it’s got two Thunderbolt 5 / USB-C, three USB-A 3.2 Gen 2, HDMI 2.1, gigabit ethernet, and an SD card slot.</p><p>As the Titan is the capital-F flagship of MSI’s lineup, it’s once again got a sky-high starting price of around $5,000.</p><p><h3>MSI Raider 18 HX AI</h3></p><p>But you’ll notice some similar specs are present in cheaper MSI laptops, like the new Raider 18 HX. </p><p>The Raider has always been one of MSI’s most powerful laptops, with some of its showiest RGB lighting. For 2025, the Raider has a similar Mini LED screen, GPU options, RAM, ports, battery, and storage with dedicated SSD cooling as the Titan. It looks a bit like the Titan, too, but without the light-up touchpad and an added RGB strip on its front instead. Unlike the Titan, the Raider offers configurations with either the Intel Ultra 9 275HX or AMD Ryzen 9 9955HX3D.</p><p><h3>MSI Vector A18 HX</h3></p><div><figcaption><em>The new MSI Vector. This is what MSI considers a more low-key design for its gaming laptops.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: MSI</cite></p></div><p>If excessive RGB isn’t your thing, the MSI Vector line (in 18-inch, 17-inch, and 16-inch versions) offers a <em>slightly</em> more subtle gray styling with no colorful lights to speak of outside of its per-key RGB keyboards.</p><p>The Vector A18 has an 18-inch 2560 x 1600 (16:10) 240Hz IPS display, the choice of RTX 5070 Ti / 5080 GPUs, AMD CPU configurations, 99.9Wh battery, and a plethora of ports like its pricier counterparts (but with slower Thunderbolt 4 instead of Thunderbolt 5). The Vector 16 HX AI and Vector 17 HX AI models may have slightly smaller screens, but they still support 2560 x 1600 resolution and 240Hz. Each of them has new Intel Arrow Lake CPU options, but the 17-inch has more configurations that go up to the RTX 5090 GPU. </p><p><h3>MSI Stealth 18 HX AI</h3></p><p>While many of the above laptops are thick and heavy, the Stealth line is one of MSI’s most popular due to its slightly smaller and thinner size for those who don’t want to carry around a cinder block of a notebook.</p><p>For 2025, MSI offers the Stealth in 16-inch and 18-inch configurations with GPUs ranging from the RTX 5070 Ti to the 5090. The 18-inch model also offers a 4K 120Hz screen or QHD 240Hz model as well as either an Intel Ultra 9 275HX or AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370. The 16-inch Stealth only comes with the Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 .</p><p><h3>MSI Cyborg A17 AI</h3></p><div><figcaption><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23774468/clear-transparent-tech-gadgets-news-announcements-products"><em>Seethrough tech</em></a><em>? I am so here for it. Regrettable decisions made in tattoo parlors? Nahh, bro. Nahh.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: MSI</cite></p></div><p>But if you want something cheaper and funkier, MSI’s Cyborg is back again with yet another take on its partially seethrough design.</p><p>The Cyborg 14 and 15 have designs that look like last year’s models, with their innards only visible on the sides and bottom, but the Cyborg 17 has a new chassis with a smoked translucent top deck, allowing you to look directly into it from above. Unfortunately, it’s also uglier than ever thanks to its weird mix of Venom symbiote-style webbing / tribal tattoo line art / whatever that design is. It has CPU options up to the Intel Core Ultra 7 240H or AMD Ryzen 7 260 and RTX 50-series GPUs.</p><p><h3>MSI Crosshair 18 HX AI and MSI Pulse</h3></p><p>Lastly, MSI is also updating its economy-class Crosshair and Pulse series gaming laptops, which top out at configurations with just the Nvidia RTX 5070. MSI says the Crosshair will be its cheapest 18-inch laptop.</p><p>With the jump to RTX 50-series GPUs, MSI is taking its usual shotgun approach and trying to hit all facets of gamers who prioritize specs. It’s also riding the AI train <em>hard</em>. In addition to adding “AI” to the name of most everything, even its latest Claw handheld, MSI’s laptops will ship with a new chatbot dedicated to controlling your computer. Considering some Windows settings are buried in legacy menu structures that still look like they’re from the XP era, the thought of asking your computer to adjust those settings for you sounds a teeny-tiny bit appealing. But I haven’t had a chance to test it yet, and I fear it won’t work as it should — because, let’s be honest, Windows gonna Windows.</p><p>If you didn’t like MSI’s giant spec-heavy laptops before, there’s a good chance its new offerings may not move the needle for you. But if Nvidia’s new GPUs are all they’re cracked up to be, perhaps MSI can impress with raw performance per dollar.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
