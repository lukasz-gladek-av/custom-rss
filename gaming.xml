This is the GBC-looking Zelda-like from Yacht Club Games, the studio behind <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shovel_knight_treasure_trove">Shovel Knight</a>, that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/02/shovel-knight-devs-new-game-mina-the-hollower-smashes-kickstarter-goal">launched on Kickstarter</a> back in 2022, and only recently missed out on its initial release date thanks to a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/retro-zelda-inspired-adventure-mina-the-hollower-has-been-delayed-for-switch-2-and-switch">last-minute delay</a>. It feels like it has been a long time coming, a fact that Yacht Club is reportedly painfully aware of.</p>
<p>In a new report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-02/creator-of-hit-game-shovel-knight-is-at-make-or-break-moment">Bloomberg</a> (paywalled), studio founder Sean Velasco described Mina as "make-or-break" for the future of Yacht Club Games. In the time since Shovel Knight, the studio has downsized, faced a global pandemic and divided its teams into two — later reforged into one — and delays don't come cheap, either. “If we sold 500,000 copies, then we would be golden," Velasco told Bloomberg, "If we sold even 200,000, that would be really, really great. If we sold, like, 100,000, that’s not so good”.</p><div><figure data-videoid="W9fsZhwHLmM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W9fsZhwHLmM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytW9fsZhwHLmM" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/W9fsZhwHLmM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W9fsZhwHLmM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5efcbejgmzos&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>According to the report, the game's inception came back in 2019 by designer Alec Faulkner. Yacht Club initially split its staff into two teams — one focusing on Mina, and the other on a 3D Shovel Knight follow-up — though the former project quickly grew in ambition, with Faulkner reportedly struggling to operate as the game's director.</p>
<p>Seeing that the system wasn't working, the studio laid off some staff to cut expenses and re-combined the teams to focus purely on the Mina project, with Velasco stepping into the director role. According to artist Sandy Gordon, had the team stuck together right from the jump, "we would’ve finished it two to three years ago".</p>
<p>"If Mina flops, we'll still be around," Velasco told Bloomberg, though he's quick to clarify that they would "need more money". The studio is already taking steps to cut back on this front, moving fully remote at the end of the year and shifting its attention to only working on one project at a time.</p>
<p>From the little of Mina that we have seen so far, we remain cautiously optimistic that the full game will deliver the goods. There's a free demo now available on the eShop (sporting 120fps on Switch 2, no less), and it plays every bit as much like a 2D Zelda game as you would hope. A delay is never a welcome sight, but our fingers are crossed that we don't have to wait too long to see things hit their full potential.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Squeezing itself in <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-clair-obscur-hades-2-the-game-awards-players-voice-awards-nominees/">just before The Game Awards</a>, 11 bit Studios has announced that it will host its first-ever digital showcase next week on December 8, 2025, at 10am PT / 1pm ET / 6pm GMT / 7pm CET. It'll be livestreamed on the studio's YouTube channel and in partnership with IGN on its YouTube channel, featuring new looks at Frostpunk 2 DLC, new content coming to The Alters, and more.</p>



<p>The publisher and developer will include information on games it worked on in both capacities, with its published titles like Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault and Death Howl making an appearance, along with games it developed, like the aforementioned The Alters and Frostpunk 2. A press release for the event also includes that "<em>there may be a surprise or two in there, of course</em>."  </p>



<p>Hot off the release of Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault, which currently sits at a 'Very Positive' rating on Steam and just ahead of releasing Death Howl, 2025 has been a strong year for 11 bit Studios. The team has wins in both its publishing and development branches, with Moonlighter 2 representing the publishing win and The Alters representing its development win.</p>



<p>And that's even with The Alters getting caught up in one of the year's many scandals around developers using generative AI and not disclosing it. 11 bit Studios was caught using the technology for localization and a couple of small art assets, which did sour the game for some players, but that hasn't stopped it from being one of the highest-rated games in 2025, <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/browse/game/all/all/current-year/metascore/?page=2">with an 85 on Metacritic and the 46th best 2025 release</a> as sorted by Metacritic score (technically, it's listed at 48th, but that's with Metacritic including re-releases of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom at the top).</p>



<p>This showcase is the chance for the studio to end 2025 off with a bang, since the showcase will not only do its best to get players amped for what it has coming down the pipeline, but it also coincides with the release of Frostpunk 2's first major DLC, Fractured Utopias.</p>



<p>We'll see if 11 bit Studios is able to stick the landing this coming Monday, December 8, 2025, at 10am PT / 1pm ET / 6pm GMT / 7pm CET.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[This Is The ‘Easiest’ Way To Kill A Leaper In Arc Raiders]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-leaper-kill-spaceport-trials-into-the-fray-2000649665</link>
            <guid>1370695</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There are many reasons to kill a Leaper, <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-review-extraction-loot-shooter-embark-2000642198"><i>Arc Raiders</i></a>’ terrifying robotic spider-like menace that can cross vast distances in seconds. The quest “Into the Fray” specifically asks you to take one out. Weekly trials frequently require you to damage or destroy a Leaper. They’re also a source of some solid loot. Their <a href="https://ardb.tools/items/leaper-pulse-unit">Pulse Units</a> do respectable damage as a throwable and they’re needed for stage four of the current Expedition Project. Here’s the best way to take them out.</p>   <p>While I’d wager Leapers, though intimidating, are the weakest of the larger Arc forces, their ability to traverse large distances quickly makes them a tough target. They can also crush you to death without much effort. Luckily, they’re large, they can’t squeeze into tight spaces, and they don’t fire any projectiles. So if you can find a safe spot with a clear sightline, and you’ve got the right weapons, their ass is grass.</p>

 <p>After spending nearly 200 hours in this game, I’ve found what I consider to be the best place for taking down a Leaper quickly, whether you’re running solo or in a crew. To get there you’re gonna head to Spaceport, specifically the center of the map near the Central Elevator. There’s a bunker northeast of the Elevator, sandwiched in between it and the South Trench Tower. That’s our spot.</p>

 <p><strong>Read More:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-trade-fruit-loot-scrappy-lemons-mushrooms-2000649233">Extraction Shooter Player Puts Down Guns And Starts Selling Fruit Instead</a></p> <p>The only downside to this spot is that it’s in a wide open area, so you’re unlikely to be the only one who’ll join the fight and you’ll have to keep an eye out for hostile players. To be honest, this is also true of just about any place in the game. But this specific location has a few critical advantages when it comes to PvP and quick extraction, so let’s dive in.</p>

 <h2>Spaceport: The ultimate Leaper killing grounds</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000649669" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000649669"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000649669">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>This bunker is an excellent location to dig in for a Leaper assault as both of its doors are pre-blocked (if you get there and there’s no option to breach the door, it means other players have broken in already). The Leaper won’t be able to climb into the bunker and, as I mentioned before, they don’t shoot projectiles, so if you stay away from the windows when it charges up its singularity area-of-effect attack, you’re basically untouchable while you pour the heat on our robotic spider pal.</p>

 <p><strong>Read More: </strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-field-depot-crate-off-radar-down-to-earth-2000642525">This Is The ‘Easiest’ Field Depot In&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders</em></a></p> <p>Speaking of that Leaper, they usually spawn in the surrounding area. You’ll typically see it walking around near the Elevator, or close to the Launch Towers and Departure Building south of the Elevator.</p>

 <p>Sometimes, a Leaper will also spawn on the opposite, eastern side of the Launch Towers. In theory, you can lure one over to the aforementioned bunker, but it’s a hike and you open yourself to a lot of risk by doing so. If there’s no Leaper in the area near the bunker, I advise making yourself busy with something else and loading back into a new instance of the map where, hopefully, our prey will be waiting.</p>

 <h2>Step one: Arming up and fortifying the bunker</h2> <p><b><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-guns-blue-green-purple-gold-best-2000644142">Any gun with Heavy Ammo</a> will deliver sufficient damage to the Leaper.</b> A maxed-out <a href="https://ardb.tools/weapons/ferro-i">Ferro</a> will do well, as will an <a href="https://ardb.tools/weapons/anvil-i">Anvil</a>. If you’re bringing either of those weapons, be sure to have a healthy amount of ammo. The Leaper will go down faster than you think, but it will take a lot of shots.</p> <p>Hullcrackers are okay, but I’d save those for bigger threats. Thrown explosives are also handy to have, though having said that, we’re going to be shooting the Leaper through a two-foot window in the bunker and there’s a good chance that in the chaos of your assault, you may screw up the throw and end up bouncing the grenade back into the bunker and, well, that’s a less-than-ideal situation.</p> <p><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-inventory-full-stash-loadout-crafting-cheat-sheet-2000643629">The Hoarder’s Guide To Managing Your <em>Arc Raiders</em> Inventory</a></p> <p>If you’re at all a fan of <i>Rainbow Six: Siege</i>, you’re going to <i>love </i>this next part. Any combination of the following items will help make your mission more successful:</p>

 <ul> <li aria-level="1"><a href="https://ardb.tools/items/barricade-kit">Barricade Kit</a></li> <li aria-level="1"><a href="https://ardb.tools/items/door-blocker">Door Blocker</a></li> <li aria-level="1">Any trap or mine (Blaze Grenade Traps, Jolt Mines, or even Trigger ‘Nades will work well)</li> <li aria-level="1"><a href="https://ardb.tools/items/lure-grenade">Lure Grenade</a> (good for sending the Leaper or other Arc away from you if things get messy)</li> </ul> <p>While the Leaper can’t get into the bunker, other players can and <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-pvp-betrayal-bounty-rat-camp-2000649163">there’s no guarantee that they’ll be friendly</a>. So we have to do what we can to make it hard for other players to get inside while you’re taking on the Leaper.</p> <p>Good thing the bunker is pre-blocked! Other players can break those blocks, but they make a lot of sound while doing so, which can buy you time to shift your focus to the invading threat.</p> <p>But you’ll need to smash one of the blocks yourself to get in. I recommend picking the west-facing door to break open. <b>Once you’re inside, immediately block that door again with a Door Blocker </b><b><i>or</i></b><b> place Barricade Kits right up to both doors</b>. (You can get the Barricade Kit close enough to the door frame that you can’t walk past it on the western door. This is harder to do on the eastern door, hence the reason I advise leaving that door untouched when you break in).</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000649667" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000649667"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000649667">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>At this point, with doors blocked or barricaded, you’ll have bought yourself some valuable time from invading players looking to take advantage of you. Also, since there’ll be a Leaper jumping around the bunker as you attack it, enemy players open themselves up to serious risk if they try to break through the door blocks or take down the barricades.</p> <p>Still, there’s a chance an enemy player can get in to ruin your day. It can be hard to hear an enemy player breaching a door or taking down a barricade while the Leaper is making a racket while bouncing around.</p> <p>That’s where the traps come in handy. Go nuts here with whatever you have: Place Jolt Mines in front of the door or behind barricades. Rig the door with Blaze Grenade Traps. You could even place some <a href="https://ardb.tools/items/laser-trap-lure">Lure Traps</a> which in theory would go off, sending the Leaper to the doorway and calling over any nearby drones, positioning the invading player in between you and Arc threats.</p>

 <p>You can also place some Explosive Mines at the doors too, but I’d be wary of the shrapnel inside the bunker hitting you. There’s risk of that with the Jolt Mine too, but those just temporarily stun and don’t do any damage.</p> <h2>Step two: Luring the Leaper and commencing the attack</h2> <p>Once you’ve fortified the bunker, you should be able to spot a Leaper from inside. There’s usually one patrolling south of the bunker. If there’s no Leaper in the area, you may have to just reload into a new instance. It’s a common area for our spider pal, so you’ll see one eventually. Just fire a shot at it to get its attention and let it race over to try and attack you.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000649668" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000649668"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000649668">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Since it can’t get into the bunker, it won’t be much of a threat to you. Its charged-up area-of-effect attack <i>can</i> do damage if you’re close enough to the window, so if you see it charging up, just back away from the window.</p> <p><b>Prioritize your fire on its eye.</b> Just keep pouring the damage in. It’ll go faster if you’re with friends, but this is a perfectly soloable activity provided you brought enough ammo. Also, <a href="https://youtu.be/qLlNpSXlgAM">it sure would be nice if you had some grenades</a> or <a href="https://ardb.tools/items/wolfpack">Wolfpacks</a> (just be careful throwing them).</p>

 <p>The Leaper isn’t a total fool, however. After taking enough damage without returning any, it will start to walk away from the bunker. If you keep shooting it, however, you’ll retrigger its aggravated state and it will continue to try and jump on top of the bunker and squeeze into the windows. But try as it might, it can’t.</p> <p>Keep shooting and it will eventually go down.</p> <h2>Step three: Loot (if you need it) and GTFO</h2> <p>You’re going to make <i>a ton</i> of racket with this assault. Any nearby players who are looking to take advantage of you might wait until you’re looting the wreckage to jump you. So, once the Leaper’s dead, head out, grab what you need and then race over to the nearby Elevator to extract.</p>

 <p>Unless you’re doing a Night Raid (where Elevators are your only way out), I advise using a <a href="https://ardb.tools/items/raider-hatch-key">Raider Hatch Key</a> to get out somewhere else so you don’t have to mess around with any rats camping the Elevator.</p> <h2>Closing thoughts and considerations</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000649670" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000649670"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000649670">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Just about any place similar to this bunker will be a good spot for taking out a Leaper. That said, this particular bunker on Spaceport is advantageous given its proximity to an Elevator for quick extraction, the fact that the doors come pre-blocked, and its right near a common Leaper spawn point.</p>

 <p>There is a pre-blocked bunker south of the Central Elevator that also may work, but it’s a bit too close to the Departures and Arrivals Building where hostile players may be waiting to snipe or jump you.</p> <p><b>Also, if you’re taking out a Leaper for a weekly trial, be sure to run this tactic during a Night Raid or an Electromagnetic Storm since it will double the trial points.</b> The storms are riskier if you want to loot the remains as you open yourself up to a lightning strike, however.</p> <p>There are many other places across <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ current maps to take out Leapers, but this bunker in Spaceport is by far the most reliable spot to just load in and kill one while covering your ass from any rats looking to ruin your day.</p> <p>Happy hunting!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[New Elden Ring Nightreign Trailer Shows Off New Undertaker Character Ahead of DLC Release]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/new-elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-undertaker-trailer-forsaken-hollows/</link>
            <guid>1370662</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Elden Ring Nightreign is getting a new DLC expansion in just two days from the time of this writing, with the release of<a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-the-forsaken-hollows-release-date/"> The Forsaken Hollows DLC</a> arriving on December 4, 2025. The DLC was announced last month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-in-the-works-fromsoftware-kadokawa/">just as players were complaining about a lack of content</a> in Nightreign.</p>



<p>The Undertaker is one of two new characters added in the DLC, with today's trailer showcasing an impressive flying move where the Undertaker charges into enemies through the air, with a direct hit stunning even the more terrifying bosses.</p>



<p>When the DLC was announced last month, the Undertaker was described as a character featuring "<em>impressive strength and faith</em>," which this trailer definitely leans into with her swinging a heavy weapon around. In a press release, FromSoftware adds that she "<em>lets her faith be the hammer that purges the darkness festering in Limveld</em>."</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN The Forsaken Hollows | Undertaker Character Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z8qzE__2TTc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The Forsaken Hollows also adds a second new playable character, the Scholar, and two new bosses for players to fight with these new characters. It also adds The Great Hollow, a hole that opened in Limveld and isn't exactly a whole new map, but it seems to at least be a new area of Limveld for players to explore.</p>



<p>Overall, it'll be interesting to see how players respond to the Forsaken Hollows. If you didn't purchase the deluxe edition of Elden Ring Nightreign, then you'll have to pick up this DLC separately as a paid expansion for $15 USD. It's not the biggest ask, but after months of players complaining that Nightreign lacked post-launch support, arriving late to the party with two new characters, two new bosses, and a new sub-area might not be what players had in mind when thinking about what they would expect from paid DLC.</p>



<p>Of course, those who absolutely devour new content within the first few days of its release aren't the example to use for how the community feels about the new DLC overall; you can practically write the Steam reviews now for the players that have tens of hours in Nightreign already, who will complete all the new content within two days of its launch, complaining that there wasn't more to do.</p>



<p>That said, it's not unfair to say that if Nightreign wants to maintain the commercial success it achieved in 2025, FromSoftware will likely need to do more for it than it currently is.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-best-guns-tier-list">Arc Raiders</a> developers Embark have shed a bit of light on how their looter-shooter changed after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-extraction-shooter-from-the-finals-devs-is-no-longer-free-to-play-and-coming-2025">shifting away from the free-to-play business model</a> back in 2024. Apparently, it made Arc "drastically easier" to design, in the sense that the Swedish studio felt less pressure to turn players into whales.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
That's my admittedly rather blunt reading of the latest Arc Raiders <a href="https://youtu.be/ST_fD5NL_pg">behind-the-scenes development video</a>, as passed on by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/embark-says-moving-from-free-to-play-made-designing-arc-raiders-drastically-easier">GamesIndustry.biz</a>. Embark's previous multiplayer FPS <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-finals">The Finals</a> was free-to-play, and Arc Raiders was due to follow in its footsteps, but as design director Virgil Watkins explains in the video, this made it harder to "respect the player's time" when plotting out Arc's extraction shooting.
</p>
<p>
"In free-to-play, you need to, in some ways, make things a little stickier than they would be otherwise, take a little more time, a little more grind just so players are more incentivised to stay in and stick into those loops and keep playing your game, and ideally are incentivised and inspired to spend money on that game," he says.
</p>
<p>
"For this type of title, it made it kind of hard to respect the player's time in some of these areas around crafting or sessions and things like that. We were almost like 'slow down a little bit'. It felt a little bad so as soon as that decision came down, it made us able to make things take the amount of time that felt appropriate in a lot of ways."
</p><p>
Watkins offers some examples of how Embark changed Arc Raiders after deciding to charge for it upfront. "Crafting no longer has timers on it that you need to wait out or the amounts of things we are asking you to collect are a little more rational," he comments. "Effort and outcome match each other a little more precisely." 
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere in the video, Embark CEO and founder Patrick Söderlund makes the obvious point that Arc would have landed more players upfront as an F2P game. "A free-to-play game would attract a lot of players and we can maybe get tens of millions of players for a while," he says. "But as we started building what would become the rebirth of Arc Raiders, the team started to ask me questions - was free-to-play the right model for us?"
</p>
<p>
If Arc is now an old-timey "premium" release, it's still not worlds away from many F2P games in its reliance on grinding resources out of the maps. It also has microtransactions - cue <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-celebrates-the-launch-of-a-new-region-in-the-north-line-update-with-microtransactions-price-cuts">a recent player controversy</a> about pricing - which are ubiquitous among videogames today, but are more prevalent in F2P releases for obvious reasons. 
</p>
<p>
"It's helped a lot, but on the other side, launching it with a price point, we still need ways to monetise that doesn't feel predatory," Watkins concedes of the switch to upfront payments in the video. "That's also been an interesting challenge."
</p><p>
At the time of writing, Embark are gearing up for the first Arc Raiders expedition. This basically lets you reset much of your progression - including your inventory, blueprints, player level, skill points, quest progress - by sending your Raider off to join a caravan of pioneers, once you've offered up sufficient resources for the trip.</p>
<p>Expeditions operate according to an eight-week schedule, with the first one due to "leave" on 21st December. In return for packing your current character off to the frontier, you'll get increased XP gain, Scrappy materials, bonus skill points, more and cheaper weapon repairs, and more stash space. It's a novel way of characterising the routine live service practice of bumping players back to square one, both for "prestige" and so that we have an incentive to climb the ladder once again.

            <title><![CDATA[Wow, Helldivers 2‘s Install Size On PC Is Now 130GB Smaller]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-install-size-large-smaller-pc-update-150gb-arrowhead-2000649639</link>
            <guid>1370647</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-kotaku-review-pc-ps5-is-it-good-ps-plus-1851258251"><em>Helldivers 2</em></a> on PC is a solid version of Sony’s 2024 online co-op shooter. However, one significant flaw of the PC port was its massive installation size, which took up around 150GB of space and was approximately three times larger than the game on console. Arrowhead promised this would be cut down. And a new update does just that.</p> <p>On December 2, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/491583942944621371">Arrowhead Games posted a lengthy and detailed post</a> about the studio’s efforts to make the PC port of <em>Helldivers 2</em> less bloated. According to the team behind the sci-fi shooter, <em>Helldivers 2’s</em> total installation size on PC has been reduced from approximately 154 GB to around 23GB. That’s over 130GB slashed, which is <em>wild</em>. Arrowhead thanked support studio Nixxes, which apparently helped get the install size down to such a small amount.</p>

 <p>So why was <em>Helldivers 2</em> on PC so big compared to the console ports?<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/543369627969783286?l=english"> Well, as explained in this post from Arrowhead back in October</a>, <em>Helldivers 2</em> on PC supports both solid-state drives and older mechanical hard drives. In an effort to keep load times down and make<em> Helldivers 2</em> more optimized, Arrowhead included redundant and repeated files so that older drives that still spin tiny platters and seek out data wouldn’t be bogged down as much. This was a common technique back when games shipped on optical discs and when consoles didn’t use much faster solid-state drives. <a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-xbox-series-x-s-release-date-ps5-exclusive-1851785573">That’s also why the Xbox and PS5 ports of <em>Helldivers 2</em></a> were smaller in size: Those devices all have SSDs and don’t need redundant, repeated data to optimize loading.</p>

 <p>The majority of what was removed from<em> Helldivers 2</em> in the most recent update on PC were these redundant files. That might make you worry about players on PC still using older drives, but Arrowhead says load times for players on older systems will only be increased by a few seconds, a worthy tradeoff to get the file size below 25 GB.</p> <p>For now, this update is optional on PC as Arrowhead continues testing it to make sure nothing was overlooked. But eventually, sometime next year, this reduction in installation size will be mandatory as the studio doesn’t want to support two different versions of the game on PC.</p>

This list features games based on any Marvel license, from solo vigilantes to teams of Earth’s mightiest heroes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">First, some ground rules: we’ve picked just one game per subseries, so don’t expect to see all three Insomniac Spider-Man games on here, for example. All entries are primarily based on a Marvel IP, so we’re not including things like Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 2 just because Spidey makes an appearance, or Fortnite for having a lot of Marvel collaborations. The game can’t be 100% unplayable (RIP Gazillion’s Marvel Heroes), and overall quality, historical relevance, and how successful it is at fulfilling the superhero fantasy of feeling like you’re within the Marvel Universe are all taken into account.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With that covered, let’s dive into IGN’s Top 10 Marvel Video Games.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">10. X-Men: The Arcade Game</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/26/x-men-arcade-1764164630742.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Konami was the king of arcade hits throughout the 1990s, delivering many instant classics like The Simpsons, TMNT: Turtles in Time, and Dance Dance Revolution. Also included in that lineup is its take on X-Men, which continues to be one of the most endlessly replayable arcade games in Konami’s catalogue. Based on the Pryde of the X-Men animated pilot – a precursor to X-Men: The Animated Series – X-Men Arcade features six playable mutants traveling across the globe in an effort to thwart the schemes of Magneto, the villainous Master of Magnet (his words, not ours). </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/x-men-the-arcade-game">X-Men Arcade</a> doesn’t even take a full hour to complete, but its classic beat ‘em up design is polished to a mirror shine, so much so it’s impossible not to enjoy it with a group of friends. The goofy translations (“Welcome to die!”) only add to the game’s charm, and punching your way through armies of Sentinels, Reavers, and Magneto’s lieutenants is still as entertaining now as it was back in 1992. The last time it was re-released outside of specialty arcade cabinets was on the Xbox 360 and PS3, so we’re going to need a fresh port of it, stat.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">9. Captain America: Super Soldier</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/26/captain-america-super-soldier-1764164776198.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Marvel Cinematic Universe changed the game for quite a few classic Marvel heroes, most notably those associated with the Avengers. Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America were hardly nobodies before the MCU, but their popularity skyrocketed thanks to the success of Marvel Studios’ first wave of films. Said films also received a few game tie-ins courtesy of Sega, but the only one that’s worth looking back on is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/captain-america-super-soldier">Captain America: Super Soldier</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Starring the First Avenger on a WWII mission not shown in the film, the game features semi-open level design that unfolds across the campaign, and a rhythmic melee combat system – both of which are clearly inspired by Batman: Arkham Asylum. There are many foes to face, including several important villains from the comics, such as Baron Strucker, Madame Hydra, and Iron Cross. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Video games based on movies don’t typically play out well, but the key reason Captain America: Super Soldier fares better than its forgettable MCU tie-in peers is because it’s the only one that truly goes to lengths to make you feel like the hero it’s based on. Throwing Cap’s shield, deflecting enemy projectiles, and cracking Hydra skulls with a plethora of unique special move animations feels fantastic, and really sells the fantasy of playing as a super soldier.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">8. Lego Marvel Super Heroes</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/26/lego-marvel-super-heroes-1764164812047.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the best examples of Lego’s long, long video game history also happens to be a Marvel game: Lego Marvel Super Heroes, released in 2013 by veteran brick game developer Traveller’s Tales. Featuring over 100 playable characters from the comics universe, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/lego-marvel-super-heroes">Lego Marvel Super Heroes</a> unquestionably has the best roster of any Lego Marvel game, since it doesn’t excise Fantastic Four and X-Men characters like its successors, Lego Marvel’s Avengers and Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2. That’s not to say there isn’t fun to be had in those games, but the first Lego Marvel adventure was one of the last games to feel like it was based on the classic era of Marvel comics, before everything became strangled by MCU synergy during the mid-2010s. Running around a Lego version of New York with your favorite Marvel heroes while working to thwart the schemes of Doctor Doom and eventually defeating a giant Lego Galactus is still some of the most fun you can have in a game flaunting the Lego brand.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">7. Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/26/umvc3-1764164825231.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">After developing multiple Marvel fighting games in the early ‘90s, such as X-Men: Children of the Atom and Marvel Super Heroes, Capcom crossed over one of their own brands with the Marvel Universe in X-Men vs. Street Fighter. The rest, as they say, is history, and the Marvel vs. Capcom series has remained one of the company’s most beloved franchises ever since. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Choosing between MVC2 and MVC3 was hard; the former is arguably more historically important and has a larger character roster, but the latter has secured this spot thanks to its gorgeous 3D graphics, improved musical score, and absolutely chaotic gameplay, which has been driving fighting fans bonkers since the game’s original release. The incredible animation work makes each match a visual feast to behold, and the game brought in many new important roster choices such as Phoenix, Dormammu, and MODOK. The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ultimate-marvel-vs-capcom-3">Ultimate release</a> added even more iconic Marvel heroes, like Doctor Strange, Hawkeye, and Rocket Raccoon, thus making it the definitive version of one of the best fighting games ever made.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">6. Marvel Rivals</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/26/marvel-rivals-1764164996969.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s hard to launch a new live service game in today’s market; just ask Warner Bros. about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice Leagueign c</a> or Sony about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/concord">Concord</a>. But NetEase Games managed to pull it off with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a>, the most literal interpretation of the “hero shooter” genre. From slicing through enemies with Magik’s soulsword, to diving on opponents as Venom, or swallowing whole teams as the adorable Jeff the Land Shark, Rivals fulfills the fantasy of playing as Marvel’s most iconic heroes. These characters shoot (or otherwise maim/support) each other across a variety of maps that also pull from Marvel’s rich comic history, using the multiverse to deliver a wide variety of locations such as Asgard, Krakoa, K’un-Lun, and the Tokyo of 2099. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The base formula of moreish 6v6 matches and excellent art direction have been supplemented by a tsunami of fresh content over the game’s first year, including a dozen new playable heroes and numerous new maps and modes. It’s difficult to evaluate games like Rivals since they’re constantly evolving and adding new stuff, but as it stands, it’s exactly the sort of game that’s easy to get lost in while playing with friends or climbing ranks in Competitive. For your daily dose of Marvel gaming, it doesn’t get much better than this.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">5. Spider-Man 2 (2004)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/26/spider-man-2-1764165012272.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">When it comes to movie tie-in games, few have been as well-received as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/spider-man-2-2004">Spider-Man 2</a>. Released alongside the Sam Raimi film of the same name, it eschewed traditional self-contained levels for an open world approach – something deeply ambitious back in 2004 – and allowed you to freely swing around New York City to your heart’s content. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While not technically the first superhero game to use the open world format (would you believe that honor goes to the 1997 Batman &amp; Robin game?) Spider-Man 2 did popularize the idea with the gaming masses. The web swinging mechanics were revolutionary for their time, as you needed to actually attach your webs to environmental geometry instead of just firing them up for them to latch on to the skybox like in previous games. Developer Treyarch also expanded the movie’s story with characters from the comics, including fan-favorites like Black Cat, Mysterio, and Rhino on top of the requisite encounters with Doc Ock. It all adds up to an entry that changed how superhero games would be made for years to come. Plus, what other game lets you deliver pizza as a side activity?</p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. Marvel: Ultimate Alliance</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/26/marvel-ultimate-alliance-1764165026343.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re looking for a game that truly transports you into the Marvel Universe, then one of the best examples has to be Raven Software’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvel-ultimate-alliance">Marvel: Ultimate Alliance</a>. Built off a foundation developed for the studio’s earlier X-Men Legends games, Ultimate Alliance is a cooperative action RPG where you guide a team of four Marvel heroes in their fight through an epic adventure that’s essentially a company-wide crossover event come to life. Doctor Doom has assembled the Masters of Evil, and the Avengers, Fantastic Four, X-Men, and other unaffiliated heroes like Spider-Man have to team up to take them down. Such a strong roster means you’re free to recruit your own super team made up from your favorite heroes. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The reason Ultimate Alliance is still so beloved by Marvel fans is because it makes full use of the Marvel mythology, featuring characters and locations from virtually every corner of the Marvel Universe instead of just one. And unlike Lego Marvel Super Heroes, which has the abstraction of everything being made of Lego bricks, Ultimate Alliance feels like the world and characters of Marvel comics have been ripped right off the page and transplanted onto your TV screen without any compromises. It might not be the newest or prettiest game on this list, but the vibe and experience hasn’t been replicated by anything before or since, even its own sequels.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. Marvel’s Midnight Suns</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/26/midnight-suns-1764165041030.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">You might not expect Firaxis, the developer behind Civilization and XCOM, to create one of the best Marvel games, but that’s exactly what we got with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/midnight-suns">Midnight Suns</a>. A tactical RPG with turn-based combat, deck-building, and life-sim mechanics, Midnight Suns is a bizarre mix of elements that somehow coheres into something rather special. You take on the role of The Hunter, an original character who fights alongside established Marvel heroes like Blade, Ghost Rider, Iron Man, and numerous others. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Hunter and their allies fight in battles that emphasize strategy and team synergy, and then hang out between missions to develop interpersonal relationships. Featuring a lengthy single-player campaign, an engrossing narrative with strong character writing, and plenty of ways to customize the build of your Hunter and their allies, Midnight Suns is an underappreciated gem that’s sure to charm if you’re willing to go along with its quirks. But next time, Marvel, don’t call them “friendship” levels. Let us date our favorite Marvel heroes. You can’t tease me with a Scarlet Witch romance and not deliver.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/26/guardians-of-the-galaxy-1764165057266.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">After the disappointment of Marvel’s Avengers, who knew that Square Enix would publish one of Marvel’s best ever games shortly afterwards? That would be <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/guardians-of-the-galaxy">Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy</a> from developer Eidos-Montreal, a single-player action-adventure game starring the space-faring super team. Taking on the role of Star-Lord, you can give orders to Gamora, Rocket, Groot and Drax during combat, comboing teammate abilities for maximum effect. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the combat isn’t the star of the show here; it’s the story, which is a beautiful, character-driven tale that gets surprisingly emotional on multiple occasions. With fantastic performances from the main cast, a sharp script that merges elements of the Guardians’ comic personas with the MCU’s revisionist takes on the characters, and an incredible musical score from Richard Jacques, this game is arguably a more satisfying blockbuster experience than any of the Guardians movies. If you haven’t played it, you’re missing out on one of the best superhero stories released in any medium in years.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">1. Marvel’s Spider-Man</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/26/spider-man-1764165074017.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of great superhero stories, Insomniac Games of Ratchet &amp; Clank and Resistance fame delivered one of the very best in its first <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/spider-man">Spider-Man</a> game. Creating an original version of Spidey’s mythology, Insomniac used a fresh version of a familiar world as part of a larger effort to refine the many gameplay advancements that had been made in Spider-Man games since Treyarch’s ground-breaking web-swinging, and balanced all that with top shelf production values to deliver the most satisfying Spider-Man game ever released. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some may argue in favor of Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, but the sequel’s novel focus on switching between playing as Peter Parker and Miles Morales, as well as minor gameplay improvements, are offset by a much weaker script that doesn’t emotionally resonate in the same way the first one did. And so Marvel’s Spider-Man is the best overall Spider-Man game, featuring a lively world brimming with side activities, smart reworks of many of Peter’s supporting cast, and plenty of action from start to finish. We’ll see if Insomniac will finally top its best effort with the upcoming Wolverine game and the inevitable Spider-Man 3, but for now, this is the best it gets if you want to play as everyone’s favorite Web-Slinger. And as Marvel’s flagship character, it just feels right that his best game is also the greatest Marvel game ever made.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And there we have it, the 10 best video games to have come out of the House of Ideas.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><a title="Companies > Ghost Story Games [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/take-two-interactive-software/ghost-story-games">Ghost Story Games</a> has published the second developer log for single-player, narrative <a title="Genres > First-Person Shooter [2,833 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/shooter/fps">first-person shooter</a> <em><a title="Games > Judas [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/judas">Judas</a></em> on <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/02/judas-developers-ghost-story-games-discuss-the-origins-of-its-main-character/" target="_blank">PlayStation Blog</a>, which dives more into the game’s creative process and ideas that led to the creation of main character Judas, as well as shares a few seconds of new footage. <span id="more-1010689"></span></p><div><p><strong>Creating a “Judas Simulator”</strong></p><p>People often think our games start with the story, but we pretty much always start with a core design element. In <em>BioShock</em>, it was the Big Daddy and Little Sister bond. In <em>Infinite</em>, it was the companion character, Elizabeth. In Judas, it’s the dynamic narrative. We asked ourselves, “How do we tell a fully realized story where the characters can respond in real time to even the smallest choices the player makes?” Figuring out how to do that on a systemic level took many years. Eventually, the pieces formed around our main character, Judas.</p><p>“The project began with us wanting to tell stories that are less linear, that react to the player and unfold in ways that no one’s ever seen in one of Ken’s games,” said&nbsp;<em>Judas</em> lead narrative designer Drew Mitchell. “That told us a lot up front about what we’d need: namely, characters with strong, competing objectives, who each had a stake in everything the player did. Starting with that framework, we spent a lot of time thinking about those characters, their conflicts, the right setting to force them all together, and the systems underpinning it all. For a long time, there wasn’t even a set protagonist—just sort of a cipher, a blank slate.</p><p>“Eventually, the story and world started to coalesce into something specific, and we needed to figure out who the player character should be. As a rule, you want to put your heroes in the last place they ever want to find themselves. So, what kind of person would really struggle to deal with all these relationships and warring interests? And I remember that was the point where Ken came up with this monologue that kicked everything off.”</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Ghost Story Games studio president and <em>Judas</em> creative director Ken Levine said, “I often come up with ideas when I’m out on runs, and one day I thought of this speech that would define this character that we were trying to figure out. This speech popped my in my head as I was struggling through the third mile.</p><p>“I only eat at vending machines, because I don’t like interacting with waiters. Restaurants are more complicated: there are greetings and ‘hellos’ and ‘Is this table okay?’ And I’m thinking, ‘Why should I care what you recommend? You’re not me!’ But I’m not supposed to say that, so I just have to count the seconds until the interaction can end, devise socially acceptable ways of saying, ‘Go f*** yourself.’ Because for me, conversation is a prelude to failure. Vending machines never ask me a question that I don’t know the answer to. The exchange is reduced to the transaction: money in, product out. Why can’t people be more like that?”</p><p><em>—Judas Concept Art</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Judas-Dev-Log-2_12-02-25_002.jpg"></a></figure><p>This stream of consciousness became the touchstone we kept coming back to for the character and ultimately the entire game. “Judas,” as she came to be known, understands machines in a way she can never understand people. That became her greatest strength… and greatest weakness. We put her in a science fiction world, a colony ship filled with robots—a futuristic setting that makes someone like her extremely powerful. But it’s also a world where personal success hinges on how well you can conform to the rules, because dissent would lead to the failure of the mission. That makes her an outlaw, a pariah—a Judas. That tension at the heart of the character came to inform everything about the game, which we stopped thinking of as a first-person shooter and started calling a “Judas Simulator.” Everything comes back to that core idea of you interacting with the world as Judas.</p><p>“Where I think <em>Judas</em> differs the most from <em>BioShock</em> or <em>BioShock Infinite</em> is right there in the name,” said Mitchell. “The game is named after her. Booker and Jack were strangers in a strange land, just like the player. Judas is a native of the Mayflower. In fact, she’s at the center of the events that set the story in motion. She’s got history with this world and the people in it—most of it very, very bad. Her story is about so much more than getting off a sinking ship, and it gives the player so many ways to determine how her journey plays out.</p><p>“It’s always a risk to hand the player a really defined, really vocal character to control. You always worry about creating dissonance between them. So, it’s been great to see testers stop and ask themselves, ‘What would Judas do here? How would she react?’ It shows they’re in conversation with the character and taking her and the journey seriously.”</p><p><strong>The Mayflower</strong></p><p>We want to communicate this world as best we can, not only through lore, but visually. A unique challenge in creating our colony ship setting, is that it’s a much older space to craft for player exploration. Rapture and Columbia existed as they were from their foundings. But the Mayflower is decades into its voyage, and it’s changed immensely since its departure.</p><p>“At the beginning of its journey, it was a more practical, conventional, modular starship,” said Ghost Story Games studio art director Nathan Phail-Liff. “But over the course of its mission, due to conflict between factions of people and ideals, it’s changed into what you see now. And we’re working on communicating this through the environment. Like with any city with significant history, if you start digging up the street, you would find layers of the city’s past. Older eras of street long buried, forgotten, and built over by the roads upon which you now walk. With the Mayflower as a generational starship, we want to imbue this world with the same sense of time, history, and credibility; this is a civilization that went through eras of conflict and rebirth. And having the characters and the architecture of the world reflect those layers of the onion is a powerful mechanism for visual storytelling.</p><p>“This allows players to act as a sort of <a title="Companies > historia [19 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/historia">historia</a>n and architect as they explore the Mayflower. Through uncovering more, you’ll make increasingly informed decisions with the story and characters on your journey.”</p><p>Another factor in creating this setting is that the world itself is dynamic, not just the story and characters. Just like with the dynamic narrative, we had to train the system on what makes good environments by using sophisticated tagging and rulesets to populate the world with believable design elements.</p><p>“We basically identify the puzzle pieces and buckets of content that we want to make up the setting of the Mayflower,” said&nbsp;<em>Judas</em> lead artist Karen Segars. “One example is living quarters. We don’t just have one type of space—we have different categories: VIP Pilgrim Quarters, Regular Pilgrim Dorms, all the way down to Violator Quarters. The art team creates the set pieces and materials for each of these quarters and the design team does deep dives on how all those pieces can fit together in a variety of layouts that feel grounded for the theme and support gameplay. When assembling the layouts in game, the system has to understand the various buckets of puzzle pieces and the hierarchy of the content so it can stitch it together in a meaningful way that supports the storytelling. More exclusive and fancier places can have high ceilings, giant windows, and grand lobbies. But the Violator space is in the lower, grungy, underbelly of the ship and you have to take what we call the “Stairway to Hell” to get to them—separating these spaces both visually and physically.”</p><p><iframe title="Judas - Developer Log #2 Clip" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6HwhclXJADs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In our previous games we would do all of this by hand, but that doesn’t allow for the dynamism we are chasing. So, we took on this challenge of teaching the system how to be a storyteller and an interior decorator, creating a ruleset that we trust so it can populate the world in believable, compelling ways that allow for reactivity in a way you’ve never seen in our previous games.</p></div><p>Watch a new gameplay clip below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/judas-developer-log-discusses-origins-of-main-character]]></content:encoded>

<figure data-uuid="5c76adae19fa1"><a title="Metroid Prime 4: Beyond" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5c76adae19fa1/metroid-prime-4-beyond.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> is very nearly here. It's so close, in fact, that the reviews for the Switch 2 version of the game have now gone live, letting us all find out what we can expect from Samus' long-awaited adventure on the latest hardware.</p>
<p>Here at Nintendo Life, we had a blast with Beyond, calling it "quite possibly the boldest, most well-realised Metroid game to date" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our 9/10 review</a>. Here's a snippet, followed by the full shebang, so you can check out our thoughts for yourself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After 18 years of waiting, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond manages to replicate that magical sense of discovery from the GameCube original while pushing the series in some incredible new directions. Separating the main biomes with a vast open world sounds ridiculous on paper, but the slick traversal provided by Vi-O-La makes exploration more satisfying than ever</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:194214 @ 1764699039 -->
<p>But we're not the only review out there! Below, we've rounded up a handful of reviews from across the internet to give you a snapshot of the range of opinions on display. We predicted that this might be a rather divisive one in our review, and divisive it has been...</p>
<p>Kicking things off with a full beans 10/10 from <a href="https://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review/1900-805/">Giant Bomb</a>, where the outlet describes Prime 4 as "one of [Samus'] greatest adventures":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Time will tell where I place Metroid Prime 4 in the ranking of the overall series, but fresh off my first playthrough, I feel comfortable putting it among the likes of Super Metroid and the original Metroid Prime</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>With a similar score to us, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/metroid-prime-4-beyond/worth-the-wait">Game Informer</a> awarded Prime 4 an 8.75 out of 10, praising just about everything the game has to offer, but feeling let down by the finale and save shenanigans:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond maintains the high standard set by previous games in the series with incredible atmosphere and subtle touches that make the planet of Viewros look and sound real, but it is not without a handful of annoyances that hinder the immersion</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review">TechRadar Gaming</a> opted for a similar 4/5, and while the outlet seemed up on the story and "gorgeous" visuals, its big sticking point came in the open-field desert area:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the desert was a touch smaller, and there were a few extra rooms to explore in each biome, it'd be on its way to sitting alongside the first two Prime games in quality</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Things dropped ever so slightly for <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/metroid/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review/">GamesRadar+</a>, whose 3.5 review similarly struggled with the "padding" of the overworld, even amidst the excellent levels:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Within its actual levels, Metroid Prime 4 is triumphant, delivering immersive first-person exploration like nothing else in the genre, with some of the greatest levels in the series to date, dripping with potent atmosphere. But outside of those, Metroid Prime 4 is such a drag, and actively gets in the way of reaching those heights</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review/">VGC</a> went for a 3/5, describing Prime 4 as "a game stuck between two worlds", as it tries to keep the series' backbone while trying something new:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When it’s emulating the series’ past, Beyond is an entertaining, if overly conservative, sequel. However, as the shadowy corridors make way for open-world fetch quests, and Halo-style expeditions with AI companions, it’s left feeling like a diluted experience that doesn’t fully deliver on the spirit of earlier entries</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>And finally, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review">Eurogamer</a> also went for a 3/5, feeling let down by the game's ending and chatty companions, despite its high points:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No matter how much you enjoy the gameplay part, I don't think there's much more disappointing than finishing a game that's relatively narratively-driven and thinking, "that's it?" at the credits</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A pretty large spread, no? At the time of writing, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond sits at a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/metroid-prime-4-beyond/">Metacritic</a> score of 80, based on 63 reviews. We'll have to wait a little while longer to see how things fare on Switch 1, but rest assured, we'll have our impressions on the old hardware release with you before long.</p>

We expected the price to return to normal once the shopping holiday ended, but — surprise, surprise — it’s still going strong. Walmart is currently offering the gaming bundle for <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-2-plus-Mario-Kart-World-Bundle%2F16422361549" rel="sponsored">$449.99 ($50 off)</a> when you add it to your cart. Since it’s a high-demand item, you’ll need to create a Walmart account in order to go through the checkout process.</p><p>The current promo effectively gets you a free digital copy of <em>Mario Kart World</em>, which <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMario-Kart-World-U-S-Version%2F15940407280" rel="sponsored">typically retails for $79.99</a> on its own (the limited-edition bundle normally retails for $499.99). Given that tariff-induced price hikes have recently made consoles like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/717610/nintendo-switch-original-price-increase">original Switch</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/782079/microsoft-xbox-console-price-increase-us">Xbox Series X</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/762410/sony-ps5-price-hike-raise-digital-pro">PlayStation 5</a> to become more expensive, this deal is a welcome reprieve. However, we don’t anticipate it sticking around, so if you or someone you know is on the hunt for the Switch 2, now’s the time to pick one up.</p><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 offers a nice upgrade over the original, with an expansive 7.9-inch 1080p LCD screen, magnetic Joy-Con controllers, and improved performance. It can play most original Switch games, and the system’s library of must-play titles continues to grow, with big releases like <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/707704/donkey-kong-bananza-review-nintendo-switch-2">Donkey Kong Bananza</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/684518/mario-kart-world-review-nintendo-switch-2">Mario Kart World</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/826488/kirby-air-riders-nintendo-switch-2-vehicle-customization">Kirby Air Riders</a></em>, and the forthcoming <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/835325/metroid-prime-4-review-nintendo-switch">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a></em>.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6Njg3NzE5"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Brandon Russell</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/836519/nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world-bundle-walmart-deal]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Seems it’s a good day to be a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> player: in addition to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-latest-patch-buffs-a-bunch-of-guns-nerfs-tongues-and-dials-down-the-drawbacks-of-using-scopes">buff-happy Into the Unjust 5.0.0 patch</a> that launched earlier, developers Arrowhead have shared an update on their efforts to shave down the co-op shooter’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-does-helldivers-2-have-such-a-bloated-install-size-on-pc-old-hard-drives-says-dev">mammoth install size</a>. And it’s not so much a shaving as a fully fuelled chainsawing, high vis vests be damned. As the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/553850/announcements/detail/491583942944621372">Steam post</a> explains, there’s now a beta build, available to try, that cuts the 154GB game down to 23GB – a 131GB (!!!) reduction. That’s like surgically removing an entire <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/black-myth-wukong-walkthrough">Black Myth: Wukong</a> that was growing out of its back.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>There’s more good news for owners of mechanical HDDs, the aged technology of which – versus new, cool, handsome SSDs – was lightly blamed in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/543369627969783286">previous dev blog</a> for the bloat that Helldivers 2 had developed. In short, the fear was that by removing duplicated assets, assumed to be vital in keeping the game playable on slow-loading hard drives, Arrowhead’s measures would render older and lower-spec PCs unable to make the dive. This, so says the new blog, turned out to be a miscalculation, with HDD users only expected to endure a few more seconds of loading screens. Not, it seems, an effective loss of support.</p>
<p>"I am pleased to say that our worst case projections did not come to pass," the post reads. "These loading time projections were based on industry data - comparing the loading times between SSD and HDD users where data duplication was and was not used. In the worst cases, a 5x difference was reported between instances that used duplication and those that did not. We were being very conservative and doubled that projection again to account for unknown unknowns.</p>
<p>"Now things are different. We have real measurements specific to our game instead of industry data. We now know that the true number of players actively playing HD2 on a mechanical HDD was around 11% during the last week (seems our estimates were not so bad after all). We now know that, contrary to most games, the majority of the loading time in Helldivers 2 is due to level-generation rather than asset loading. This level generation happens in parallel with loading assets from the disk and so is the main determining factor of the loading time. We now know that this is true even for users with mechanical HDDs."</p>
<p>So the forest of identical trees wasn’t at fault after all. Sounds like everyone, myself included, owes those bark textures an apology.</p>
<p>It’s not a given though, that the lightweight 23GB build will arrive for all players as-is. A beta is a beta, which potentially means bugs, crashes, or indeed, longer load times than Arrowhead’s calculations predict. Even so, you can test it for yourself right now – opting in is just a matter of opening Helldivers 2’s Properties menu in Steam, navigating to the Betas tab, whacking "prod_slim" (without the quotes) in the Private Betas field, and selecting the slim build from the dropdown menu. To opt out, use the same menu to select "None", assuming you haven’t filled the last remaining 131GB of drive space up with high-resolution photos of redwoods in the meantime.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>18 years after <em>Metroid Prime 3</em> launched and <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-announces-metroid-prime-4-1796058481">eight years after the sequel was first announced</a>, Nintendo and Rare have finally finished<em> Metroid Prime 4: Beyond.</em> The long-awaited follow-up arrives later this week on Switch and Switch 2. And on December 2, ahead of release, reviews from critics went live across multiple outlets. In summary, <em>Prime 4</em> isn’t a bad game. But it doesn’t sound like a masterpiece either, falling short of past entries in the first-person shooter series.</p> <p>Launching on December 4, <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> is Nintendo’s last big game of 2025 and has a lot of hype and hope surrounding it. Fans have been wanting an <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-pro-metroid-prime-4-zelda-mario-1850098941">entire console generation</a>. So when previews last month featured an overly talkative sidekick, a big departure from the often atmospheric and empty worlds of past <em>Prime</em> games, people were nervous. Would players quickly grow tired of some bumbling sidekick?</p>

 <p>The good news is that many reviews, even the less glowing ones, indicate that <em>Prime 4</em>‘s human characters aren’t overly annoying and aren’t as big a part of<em> Prime 4</em> as some had feared. Another concern fans had involved the open world connecting the various areas of <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>, which Samus Aran traverses on a motorcycle. Many critics, even those who found the bike cool, weren’t convinced this was a necessary inclusion.</p> <p>Narratively, the world you explore in<em> Prime 4</em> is reportedly filled with excellent worldbuilding and lore teases, but some complained that this latest entry doesn’t feel like a complete story. Instead, it seems like it’s teasing the start of something more. <a href="https://kotaku.com/fans-who-pre-ordered-metroid-prime-4-six-years-ago-have-seen-their-entire-lives-change-2000645936">Hopefully, if <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> gets a sequel, fans won’t have to wait another decade for it.</a></p> <hr> <h2><em><a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/metroidhttps://www.pcmag.com/reviews/metroid-prime-4-beyond-prime-4-beyond">PC Mag</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p>At worst, these characters are somewhat stock, providing a contrast against a singularly awe-inspiring figure like Samus. For example, there’s a chatty nerd and an old, gruff general. They leave you alone for long stretches of the journey, so when they’re deployed, it’s with purpose. Initially, your comrades explain tutorials at base camp. Later, they pop up for set-piece moments that advance the story and diversify the gameplay. In a nice touch, soldiers aid you in battle if you can protect them, and a hulking robot companion clears paths blocked by debris. There are some neat hints of worldbuilding as one teammate explains his spiritual beliefs, which sets up a lovely payoff. These supporting characters are Beyond’s weakest element, but they’re inoffensive and serve their purpose well. As always, <em>Metroid’s</em> real story is between you and the planet.</p></blockquote> <h2><a href="https://www.polygon.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review/"><em>Polygon</em></a></h2> <blockquote><p><em>Metroid Prime 4</em> thinks you are very, very stupid. Like, unbelievably dimwitted. At one point, I’m running through a room that only has one exit and one entrance. My companion runs over to the only other door I can walk through and shouts “This must be the way!” Later, I blast down a machine while standing on a bridge. Everything explodes around me in a cinematic and the camera focuses on a morph ball-sized hole that has appeared in the chaos. The scene continues long enough for a soldier to point directly at the hole and tell me that it’s the way out. I gain map data for an area at some point and a pop-up tells me that I can press the minus button on my controller to open it. A companion chimes in: “Wanna check your map?” I get it. Metroid games can be alienating for mainstream audiences, and the series has always struggled to find commercial success. Having linear biomes and tighter direction helps ease the on-ramp for players who are intimidated by the idea of getting lost.</p> <p>But Retro Studios has already solved for that time and time again: cutscenes that telegraph where to go, a scan feature that tells players exactly how to kill bosses, on-screen button prompts. The soldiers don’t replace any of those ideas; they quite literally talk over them. You now get up to three nudges at a time when you encounter an obstacle. And all of that is happening in the&nbsp;<em>one&nbsp;</em>major Nintendo series that isn’t geared towards its youngest players.</p></blockquote> <h2><em><a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/metroid-prime-4-beyond/worth-the-wait">Game Informer</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p>The first-person action gameplay is familiar to previous Prime games and feels good. Samus’ new psychic powers don’t radically change the fun lock-on, shooter gameplay, but I enjoyed remote controlling the Control Beam at opportune times in boss fights and to solve puzzles. The pacing and unfolding of each location are immaculately designed, funneling you toward objectives while consistently planting seeds that make you want to return later with expanded abilities. The desert hub area where Samus drives her motorcycle between objectives is the perfect size: Big enough that the motorcycle feels necessary, but not so big that you are ever driving for too long.</p></blockquote> <h2><em><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/metroid/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review/">GamesRadar+&nbsp;</a></em></h2> <blockquote> <p id="bf1a2720-ff20-45e4-b300-098b15f2c95a">The overworld, the dune-covered Sol Valley, feels similarly dated conceptually, and, again, closer to classic <em>Zelda</em> than any kind of&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> twist I hesitantly expected – especially considering there are literally shrines that offer small puzzle challenges. There’s so few you can count them on two hands, and basically all amount to walking into a room and seeing if you have the power-up to progress or not – this is no bite-size revolution of the <em>Metroid</em> formula but something to fill an otherwise fairly empty open world map Sol Valley is how Samus accesses each of the five main key-hiding areas, which does make it the largest completely interconnected open world Metroid has ever had. Sort of. The problem is how much of a rigmarole it is to get back and forth between anywhere.</p> </blockquote> <h2><em><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review">Eurogamer</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p>The central desert, which you’ll be crossing often as you go back and forth between the main areas, is fun enough. Vi-O-La, the bike, is a blast to drive, with a few fun and simple mechanics to experiment with. The desert does give the impression, though, that it was designed separately from the rest of the game. I genuinely wonder if it was outsourced to a different team. Even the loading zones seem to suggest this, as it doesn’t even directly connect to the dungeons. In each case, there’s a loading zone, then a tiny ‘staging’ area you can cross in about a minute,&nbsp;<em>then</em>&nbsp;the dungeon.</p></blockquote> <h2><em><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review/">VGC</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p><em>Metroid Prime 4</em> is a Frankenstein fusion of ideas, which at its peaks delivers some great series moments, but at its troughs, feels like a dilution of the formula that made these games beloved in the first place. Throughout Prime 4, players neck-jerk between horror-style FPS sequences, open-world vehicle exploration, and comedy banter between a crew of wisecracking support characters. It’s an experience that feels like a collage of styles plucked from past Samus Aran adventures,&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda,</em> and&nbsp;<em>Halo</em>, but never really settles into a clear identity.</p></blockquote> <h2><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review-prime-but-not-quite-prime-prime/1900-6418446/"><em>Gamespot</em></a></h2> <blockquote><p>All of this is delivered with a visual fidelity on Switch 2 that is among the best we’ve seen on a Nintendo system. Sometimes particular details can look a little rough–some of the flora in Fury Green, or the industrial mesh grating of the Volt Forge, for instance–but other times it’s stunning. The frozen-over laboratory of the Ice Belt, or the futuristic beauty of Lamorn architecture in its artifacts, are particularly strong. It won’t match the best we’ve seen on PC or higher-powered consoles, but it’s a beautiful game regardless. Plus, I just love the look of Samus’ new suit, and in cutscene close-ups, the fidelity did it a lot of favors by showing the layers of its textures and materials.</p></blockquote> <h2><em><a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review">Inverse</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p>It’s possible that a version of <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>&nbsp;that leaned into the open-world aspects or even the party of secondary characters could work, but as it is now, both feel bolted onto a game that would be much better without them. Ultimately, much of&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime 4</em>&nbsp;feels like a failed experiment. As great as it is to explore the lightning-struck Volt Forge or pick through the haunted remains of the Ice Belt facility, the game’s standout moments are buried in drudgery.&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime 4</em> is thrilling at times, set across consistently beautiful environments, but it can’t stop getting in its own way.</p></blockquote>

<p>Arrowhead Game Studios has revealed that Helldivers 2’s file size has been reduced by 85%, and the new ‘slim version’ can be tried in beta. </p>



<p>The performance issues and installation size in Helldivers 2 have become a pain in Arrowhead’s neck, and they have been hard at work trying to solve these problems. The developers <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-devs-comment-on-installation-size-and-load-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commented</a> in October on improving the game’s file size, and now they have delivered the result, reducing the installation size by more than 3 quarters. </p>







<h2 id="h-helldivers-2-file-size-reduced-from-154gb-to-23gb">Helldivers 2 File Size Reduced from 154GB to 23GB </h2>



<p>The new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/491583942944621371" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> on Steam states that the Helldivers 2 developers have made good progress on reducing the PC installation size while adding new content. Thanks to their partnership with Nixxes, the team has reached its goal sooner than expected, with all data being de-duplicated. The file size reduction will also help improve load times, “seconds at most”. </p>



<p>The new file size for Helldivers 2 on PC has been reduced to 23GB, which cuts 131GB (85%) from the previous 154GB installation size. The new ‘Slim version’ of the game has gone through several rounds of internal QA and has been rolled out for early adopters as a public technical beta. After the public beta returns with no issues, the slim version will become the default for Helldivers 2. </p>



<p>At the same time, the legacy version will be available as opt-in once the slim version becomes the default to help players “self-troubleshoot any issues that were not picked up during our internal testing or the public technical beta.”</p>

            <p>The team working on Amazon's live-action God of War series is growing.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/12/god-of-war-frederick-eo-toye-production-casting-2-season-order-1236630007/">Deadline</a>, Emmy winning director Frederick E.O. Toye will direct the first two episodes of the upcoming God of War series.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>Toye has worked on a number of acclaimed shows during his expansive career, including Westworld, The Boys and The Walking Dead. He is also no stranger to video game adaptations, having additionally helmed episodes of Amazon's Fallout series.</p>
<p>Last year, Toye won the Emmy for outstanding directing for a drama series for historical drama Shōgun's ninth episode, Crimson Sky.</p>
<p>The director joins showrunner and former Battlestar Galactica executive producer Ronald D. Moore on Amazon's God of War series. Moore hasn't always been involved with the God of War TV show, only <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-tv-series-lands-new-showrunner-in-former-battlestar-galactica-executive-producer">joining the project towards the end of last year</a> following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-tv-series-reportedly-starting-from-scratch-as-showrunner-departs">departure of the original team</a>. Despite the shakeup, PlayStation Productions' Asad Qizilbash, Carter Swan, Sony's Hermen Hulst, Vertigo's Roy Lee and of course Sony Santa Monica head Cory Barlog remain involved with the project. Santa Monica's Jeff Ketcham is also a co-executive producer on Amazon's God of War adaptation.</p>
<p>Pre-production for the show is now underway in Vancouver, and casting for the God of War series has begun. Do you have any thoughts on who may play who? </p>
<p>Meanwhile, while we still don't have a release window for the first season, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-tv-show-getting-second-season-though-first-still-being-written">second season of God of War has already been greenlit at Amazon</a>. To quote Kratos, "Boy!"</p>

            <p>The PC version of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> will now take up 85 percent less space on your computer, as Arrowhead has successfully reduced the installation size with help from Nixxes.</p>
<p>Until now, the game took up around 154GB on PC. Back in October, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-developer-explains-why-its-so-big-to-install-on-pc-and-why-that-wont-be-changing-anytime-soon">studio explained it was looking into methods of reducing the size by eliminating duplicated assets</a>, but warned loading times for mechanical HDDs could be 10 times slower.</p>
<p>However, the studio's "worst case projections did not come to pass" and now it has successfully reduced the PC installation size down to around 23GB, a reduction of approximately 131GB.</p>

<p>Essentially, Arrowhead had previously duplicated a load of assets to maintain fast loading times for players using older, mechanical HDDs - this method makes it quicker for relevant data to be found. But as modern SSDs don't work in the same way, duplication is unnecessary and instead simply takes up more space.</p>
<p>By eliminating duplicated assets, the size has reduced with minimal impact on loading - "seconds at most," says Arrowhead, in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/491583942944621371">new blog post on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>"We now know that, contrary to most games, the majority of the loading time in Helldivers 2 is due to level-generation rather than asset loading," the post reads. "This level generation happens in parallel with loading assets from the disk and so is the main determining factor of the loading time. We now know that this is true even for users with mechanical HDDs."</p><p>This reduced size is available now for players if they opt in to test the "slim version". "You can also opt-out at any time if you experience issues," the post reads. "It's a low-risk way to save ~131GB of space on your drive and help us extend our testing to real-life conditions."</p>
<p>Once this technical beta confirms there are no issues, it will become the default for all players. "Given the very minor differences in loading times between the two versions, there is no justification for us to keep supporting the legacy version long term," the studio said. "Maintaining the legacy version alongside the slim version would only add extra burden to our developers, build machines, QA teams and release processes. Assuming all goes smoothly, the legacy version will be discontinued some time next year."</p>
<p>Instructions can be found in the Steam post.</p>
<p>Earlier today, we reported the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/newly-announced-helldivers-movie-director-may-not-be-a-gamer-but-he-has-worked-on-multiple-fast-furious-films">Helldivers film has found its director</a> - Justin Lin, who's directed multiple films in the Fast and Furious franchise.</p>

<p>Yoshinori Konishi (director and programming director), Hiroki Hamaue (programmer), and Takahisa Ikejiri (art director) sat down to share their experience in developing this online multiplayer title, which is controlled entirely with the Switch 2's Mouse Mode.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-20-drag-x-drive-part-1/">Part 1</a>, Konishi shares that the game was inspired by "sports such as wheelchair basketball, wheelchair rugby, wheelchair motocross, BMX and skateboarding", particularly the former. Hamaue had previously rode a wheelchair "for a research project back when I was a student", but for Konishi and Ikejiri, the first time they got to experience wheelchair basketball was at an experience in Osaka.</p><div><figure data-videoid="epMKq3hLRsg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/epMKq3hLRsg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytepMKq3hLRsg" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/epMKq3hLRsg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/epMKq3hLRsg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5f18d0pumzsq&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<p>The developers purchased both an everyday wheelchair and sports wheelchair to help with the process. But the problem was that, as Konishi says, "We were restricted to the small space inside the office and could only let loose down the hallway once everyone else had gone home for the day. (Laughs)" because the project was tightly under wraps.</p>
<p>Talking about the wheelchair basketball experience, Ikejiri recalls that he "wasn't prepared for how difficult it was to shoot the ball. In wheelchair basketball, the hoop is placed at the same height as in standard basketball. But since you take the shot sitting down, my shot didn't reach the basket at all."</p>
<p>"Maneuvering a wheelchair is difficult unless you get the hang of when to apply and release force," Hamaue adds. "You can't just propel yourself along smoothly in a single stroke. But it cemented for me how deep the controls are".</p>

<p>As well as trying out wheelchair basketball for themselves, Konishi details the variety of reading materials the team gathered up: "From an encyclopedia of wheelchairs to videos and essays by wheelchair athletes and even manga about basketball or wheelchairs, we pulled together as much reference material as we could lay our hands on and studied it together."</p>
<p>And, crucially, wheelchair basketball players also got a chance to go hands-on with Drag x Drive during development, which provided Konishi and the rest with valuable insights: "Because the players use wheelchairs in their daily lives, they were all really good at turning and moving backwards in the game. Of course, we learned a lot about the controls, but we gained even more insights watching them think about what to do on the court as they played."</p>
<p>Hamaue adds that "seeing actual wheelchair basketball players get the hang of the game and its controls so quickly confirmed to us that it could work well as an intuitive control scheme." And we'd agree; there's nothing else quite like Drag x Drive on the market, and while its control scheme may not be for everyone, it makes for a unique experience.</p>

<p>All <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-20-drag-x-drive-part-3/">three parts</a> contain video clips and test footage of Drag x Drive's development, and are worth reading especially if you're interested in checking out the new update. Perhaps it's time to dive back and try out Survival Tag mode as the Holidays approach...</p>
