            <p>Former <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a> staff were fired last month due to internal company messages being discussed on a Discord server shared privately between staff and union workers, a new report has suggested.</p>
<p>Rockstar Games fired 34 staff members for "gross misconduct", though further details have not been officially revealed. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-developer-rockstar-accused-of-union-busting-after-it-fires-dozens-of-developers">company has since been accused of union-busting</a>, with UK trade union Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unacceptable-and-unlawful-gta-6-developer-rockstar-hit-with-legal-claim-from-uk-trade-union-following-alleged-unfair-dismissal-of-staff">launching a legal claim alleging unfair dismissal of staff</a>.</p>
<p>Now, a new video report from People Make Games has revealed messages shared in a Discord server, sourced from a Rockstar insider who believes these may be the cause of dismissal.</p>
<p>Use of the Discord server began in 2022 and was invite-only for employees, with a "general" channel available to all and other channels accessible only for paying union members. Membership to the Discord was limited to either Rockstar employees, or representatives of the IWGB (which the Rockstar union was part of).</p>
<p>Most conversations in the Discord were around salaries, bonuses, and other HR issues - topics protected by the Equality Act of 2010 and relevant to the union members.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-acknowledges-gargantuan-grand-theft-auto-6-leak">major leaks in the past</a>, it's understandable Rockstar would be protective of its work. But it would appear this Discord server contained no confidential information about its games.</p>
<p>The catalyst towards these dismissals, however, appears to be the sharing and discussion in the server of changes to internal Slack policies.</p>
<p>Rockstar employees are unable to access their work emails outside of the office and, as at least one email concerning these internal policy changes was shared after work hours, it was instead discussed in this Discord server, with details and quotes shared.</p><p>People Make Games' source believes at least one server member brought this to Rockstar management, which reportedly led to an internal investigation into the Discord server. The Slack policy changes were initiated in the second week of October and by the end of the month, 34 employees had been fired - as such, the timing of these dismissals is in line with these messages, as the source suspects.</p>

<p>The Slack policy changes themselves include the removal of various miscellaneous chat channels concerning non-work topics, which Rockstar considered a distraction. The "Slack purge", as it became known by employees, proved unpopular and, as such, was discussed separately on the Discord server.</p>
<p>One Slack channel focused on gaming became a place for employees to share industry news on mass layoffs. Union members often reacted with the seedling emoji to show support. Elsewhere on Slack, employees would use emojis such as this (or the Palestine flag) in their status to show support for important causes. All of this was disallowed under Rockstar's new Slack policy.</p><p>"What we've seen time and time again is that Rockstar are desperately trying to prevent people from being able to communicate," IWGB president Alex Marshall told People Make Games. "And all these workers have ever been trying to do is to discuss their pay and conditions in order to try and improve them so they can deliver a game that's loved by millions."</p>
<p>Marshall also explained IWGB's presence in the Discord server is legally sound as it's completely normal for workers, when they join a union, to be supported by union staff.</p>
<p>Rockstar refused to comment on People Make Games' investigation.</p>
<p>In addition to the IWGB's legal case against Rockstar, over <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-is-a-blatant-unapologetic-act-of-vicious-union-busting-hundreds-of-rockstar-employees-sign-letter-to-management-demanding-fired-colleagues-get-reinstated">200 employees at Rockstar have signed a letter to management condemning the firing</a> of their fellow staff members.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstars-controversial-dismissal-of-31-employees-is-such-a-big-deal-its-made-its-way-to-uk-parliament">dismissal was also discussed in UK Parliament last week</a>.</p>

<p>With a 7CD physical release in the works</p>

<figure data-uuid="4bfd593560611"><a title="Shujinkou Soundtrack" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4bfd593560611/shujinkou-soundtrack.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Rice Games</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shujinkou">Shujinkou</a> surprised us all when it arrived on Switch in October, bringing its unique blend of dungeon-crawling RPG mechanics and the chance to learn Japanese through combat to the hybrid system after launching elsewhere in February. Now developer Rice Games is keeping the educational odyssey going with a release for the game's lengthy soundtrack, which recently went on sale as a digital download.</p>
<p>Popping up on <a href="https://ricegames.bandcamp.com/album/shujinkou-original-soundtrack">Bandcamp</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2098430/Shujinkou_Original_Soundtrack/">Steam</a>, and the <a href="https://ricegames.net/product/shujinkou-original-soundtrack-digital/">Rice Games store</a> for <strong>£19.99 / $25</strong>, the soundtrack comprises a whopping 158 tracks for almost seven hours of dungeon-crawling tunes. Lead composer Brian LaGuardia packs a bit of everything in there, too, with battle themes, character motifs, and minigame tunes spanning genres from classical to metal, rock to jazz.</p>
<p>All this comes from an orchestra of more than a dozen live performers, with the collection mastered by <a href="https://vgmdb.net/artist/13760">Ryuichi Tanaka</a> of Warner Music Japan — the same mastering engineer that you'll find on numerous Pokémon music collections.</p>
<p>As you'd expect, you can also stream the full collection on the likes of Spotify, Amazon, and YouTube, and there's a physical release on the horizon, too, with a seven-CD Collector's Edition planned to launch at some point in 2026. No word on price yet, but keep an eye out for that one.</p>

<p>If you missed it, Shujinkou is a dungeon-crawler that gives you the chance to learn Japanese as you play. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/shujinkou-has-been-updated-on-switch-here-are-the-patch-notes">A patch at the end of October</a> added a Visual Fidelity mode, which improved the presentation on Switch 2, as well as fixing some other issues. We've recently added expanded impressions to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/shujinkou">our review</a> of the game, so if you like the sound of this unusual language-learning RPG, check it out.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today, Serbian game development studio GFA Games announced that PIONER, their post-apocalyptic MMO first-person shooter, will launch <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3105890/PIONER/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam Early Access</a> on Tuesday, December 16.</p>



<p>The announcement comes at the same time as the game has officially surpassed 500,000 wishlists. No details have been revealed yet on pricing, but we do know that there will be a Standard Edition and a Deluxe Edition. The latter will be more expensive, but it will grant access to the following in-game items:</p>



<ul>
<li>Unique Skin: “Renegade” - a unique, exclusive armor and gear design</li>



<li>Weapon Skin with VFX - a unique weapon skin for the entire AR platform, including AR-12, AR-16, and AR-16 Ifrit</li>



<li>Exclusive Founder Title - a status symbol for social interaction</li>



<li>Premium Currency - 500 Efritanium Crystals</li>



<li>Weapon Accessory: “Creepy Charm” - cosmetic trinket for a weapon</li>



<li>Gadget: “Katana” Watch - inspired by the iconic 80s Japanese watch design; a retro-futuristic style that fits the world of PIONER</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>



<p>The game, initially <a href="https://wccftech.com/pioner-is-an-impressive-survival-mmofps-inspired-by-stalker-and-metro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> in 2021, was featured here on Wccftech multiple times thanks to two <a href="https://wccftech.com/pioner-qa-2-devs-reveal-pve-pvp-mechanics-of-this-stalker-like-mmofps-confirm-beta-in-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exclusive interviews with GFA Games</a>. We've often referred to it as clearly inspired by STALKER; it takes place on a vast post-apocalyptic island (spanning over 50 square kilometers filled with hidden dungeons, story quests and faction missions that influence alliances and rewards) where the remnants of the Soviet era have created an incredible alternate reality. As a social MMO, PIONER combines story-driven exploration with intense PvE and PvP gameplay. Here's an overview of what players can expect in this title:</p>



<ul>
<li>Story-driven campaign</li>



<li>Intense PvP modes</li>



<li>Unique Progression System that lets players grow their influence by completing quests, defeating monsters and exploring. The greater their influence, the more inclined merchants will be to sell you better items and the higher the quality of materials that will drop. Even non-combat abilities can be improved.</li>



<li>Diverse game activities include events, story-driven locations, and engaging mini-games such as fishing and Carnage, a unique tactical card mini-game featuring collectible decks, rewards, and ranked matches.</li>



<li>An extensive weapon customization system lets players tweak militarized weapons with a wide array of unique modules and designs.</li>



<li>Realistic survival mechanics require the maintenance of your character's strength by managing hunger, rest and resources.</li>



<li>In-depth crafting system: use artefacts, anomaly energy, and scavenged materials to craft powerful weapons and equipment at workbenches.</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Earlier this year, it looked like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/629678/zombies-run-marvel-move-six-to-start-layoffs-fitness-tech">time was up for ZRX: Zombies, Run!</a>, a popular fitness app that mixed couch-to-5K plans with postapocalyptic audio storytelling. Now, cocreator and author Naomi Alderman has announced that she’s bought back the franchise from the brink.</p><p>Zombies, Run! was first founded in 2012 with about 10 million users worldwide. The app, made by Six to Start, immerses runners and walkers in an episode-based storyline where the undead “chase” users. Despite the expensive and time-intensive process, the company was successful enough to make other immersive fitness games, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/18/23686893/marvel-move-six-to-start-running-fitness">Marvel Move</a>. Six to Start was bought by OliveX in 2021.</p><p>In March 2025, OliveX <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/629678/zombies-run-marvel-move-six-to-start-layoffs-fitness-tech">laid off all but two Six to Start staff members</a>, noting that the game would be shut down if a buyer could not be found. At the time, sources told <em>The Verge</em> that the Six to Start staff clashed with OliveX and its owner, Animoca Brands, over the games’ anticapitalist themes and the latter’s attempts to create crypto and NFT projects. Later, Six to Start alerted users that the Zombies, Run! app, archive, and message boards <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/633758/zombies-run-six-to-start-layoffs-statement">would remain available</a>, but that future episodes were paused, leaving the app’s future in limbo.</p><p>“I am incredibly delighted to be taking ownership of the game. This isn’t a big corporate takeover, it’s me buying back the game I made and love so I can look after it,” Alderman wrote in <a href="https://zombiesrungame.com/">a post on the Zombies, Run! website</a>. Alderman also confirmed the news in <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/naomialderman.bsky.social/post/3m6e5zqg3uc26">a Bluesky post</a>.</p><p>“We’re working on a new story for Zombies, Run!, which I’m intending to be a great ‘on-ramp’ for new players or people who want to come back to the game after a break,” Alderman tells <em>The Verge</em>. “We’ll also resume production on Season 11, which was paused halfway through — a very long cliffhanger to wait through!”</p><p>Alderman clarified that she hasn’t bought Six to Start. Rather, she’s bought the Zombies, Run! franchise, along with <a href="https://thewalkgame.com/">The Walk</a> — another immersive fitness game Alderman created with Six to Start. She also confirmed that Marvel Move had already been in the process of sunsetting, but that the app will be supported until the last annual subscription ends in July next year.</p><p>Alderman says that her main focus going forward will be preserving the app and experience, noting that she’ll be reaching out to the community soon with more news. “Zombies, Run! has been a community effort since the first Kickstarter, and we’ll keep it shambling on together.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6NjI1"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Victoria Song</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/827575/zombies-run-six-to-start-fitness-gaming]]></content:encoded>

Rockstar have been accused of union busting by the Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain over the firings, with the union having <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/iwgb-union-file-legal-claims-against-rockstar-due-to-gta-6-maker-allegedly-refusing-to-negotiate-over-firings">filed legal claims</a> against the company.</p>

<p>This new report from <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/chrisbratt.bsky.social/post/3m6eynx2ycc2f">People Make Games</a> cites an anonymous Rockstar insider as having passed on messages from the private Discord server Rockstar developers and IWGB staff were using to organise, with the insider claiming they believe these messages contributed to the firings. The alleged messages in question discuss and include snippets of text from internal Rockstar emails concerning a change in internal Slack policy, which the company reportedly announced to staff in the second week of October this year.</p>
<p>According to People Make Games, the policy changes included the removal of miscellaneous Slack channels which staff used for non-work related discussions, with Rockstar allegedly claiming these had become distracting and occasionally sources of poor conduct. The report claims that at least one of the two emails from Rockstar about the changes was sent out after 5PM UK time, with Rockstar staff reportedly only able to access their work emails while at the company office during work hours. Some members of the Discord who were still in office then allegedly shared information or quotes from the emails in the server, so staff who'd gone home could see and discuss them.</p>
<p>People Make Games claim Rockstar management then became aware of these messages when at least one non-union member of the Discord server reached out to them to express concern.</p>
<p>I've reached out to Rockstar for comment.</p>
<p>Asked about the Discord discussion of the Slack policy changes by People Make Games, IWGB union president Alex Marshall said the following:</p>
<blockquote>I think it is absolutely normal for people to be discussing their material conditions, whether that's bonuses, whether that's policies, whether that's anything like that. That's completely normal for staff to be doing that and for an employer to respond in a way that comes down so hard on that shows not only that they are governing by this lack of transparency, but they're also trying to govern by fear. They feel completely threatened by the idea of workers talking to each other and that's why they've taken this act to try and destroy the union, decimate any form of kind of solidarity being built between workers.</blockquote>
<p>Earlier this month, Liberal Democrat MP Christine Jardine <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-this-from-happening-again-uk-politician-calls-out-rockstar-over-gta-6-developer-firings">raised the issue of the firings in UK Parliament</a>, revealing that she'd written to Rockstar asking for information about the issue and requesting a meeting with a relevant minister in the hopes of discussing what support may be offered to affected staff.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/djis-4-7-star-wireless-microphone-is-a-massive-pre-black-friday-steal-2000645986</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dji-goes-into-black-friday-clear-out-mode-with-the-mic-mini-bundle-and-each-mic-feels-practically-free.1362910/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Look up any portable video device — smartphone, tablet, or camera — and you’ll get a full, vivid description of just how good its video quality is. That does leave out one very important and all-too-often ignored part of a truly pro-quality recording — the sound. Even the best smartphones and pocket-sized action cams can leave you with truly spectacular video paired with tinny, shallow sound filled with background noise.</p>
<p>There’s no need for a boom mic — the DJI Mic Mini wireless lavalier microphone transmitter is the tiny, ultra-lightweight (10 grams) solution that delivers exceptional sound from as far away as 400 meters. Content creators, vloggers, and travel buffs can give their content a massive upgrade for a lowest-ever price during this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5868/">Amazon Black Friday blowout that drops the price of the DJI Mic Mini by 45%, down to just $66.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5868/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Pro-Level Sound for Pro-Level Content</h2>
<p>As 4K or even higher-resolution video has moved from being the exclusive property of professional videographers to being a smartphone feature that you carry in your pocket, the world of content creation has exploded. But with ultra-hi-res videos and vlogs being created by virtually anyone and everyone, the best way to set yourself apart from the masses is with content that pairs that video with sound that’s just as good. DJI has mastered ultra-high-quality cameras, both in their tiny action cameras and their famous fleet of consumer drones. Once they turned their attention to sound, it was no surprise that the result was exceptionally small and lightweight, highly versatile, and of the best quality.</p>
<p>In barely a year’s time the Mic Mini has become the gold standard of rechargeable wireless microphones, with a stellar 4.7-star average rating at Amazon. It can be worn as a clip-on, on a lanyard, or magnetically attached to your clothes — regardless of how you decide to go, it’s unobtrusive on camera and able to deliver a highly stable, impeccable sound transmission from as far away as 400 meters, even in busy or noisy environments. Two built-in levels of noise cancellation — Basic for quiet indoor settings and Strong for noisy environments or outdoor shoots — cut out the background noise, often the biggest shortfall of video shot on a smartphone.</p>



<h2>The Total Package</h2>
<p>The sound quality of the DJI Mini Mic sets it apart from the built-in mics of any consumer-level video device — 48Hz sampling and 120 decibels of full, clear, rich sound. This Amazon deal includes everything you need to give your videos a huge sound boost – two transmitters and one receiver, a USB-C charging cable, four mini windscreens, a type-C smartphone adapter, two DJI Mic Mini Clip magnets, and a carrying pouch.</p>
<p>If you’re already shooting video with a DJI Osmo camera — the Pocket 3, Action 4, or Action 5 Pro, the Mini Mic can be used in a direct wireless connection to the camera, delivering premium audio without the need for a receiver. And a single charge gives you 48 hours of shoot time, so you never have to worry about going silent in the middle of a shoot.</p>
<p>For anyone who wants their videos to sound as good or even better than they look, this is the best $66 upgrade you can make. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5868/">It’s an amazing pre-Black Friday deal that’s live right now at Amazon — 45% off the price of the DJI Mic Mini.</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-millennium-falcon-stays-full-price-on-official-site-but-selling-for-pennies-on-amazon-2000646840</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>LEGO’s official website lists flagship sets at full retail price year-round with very little pricing variations. Amazon manages its own inventory and slashed the prices of thousands of products aggressively on Black Friday. Indeed, while <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/">LEGO still sells the Star Wars Millennium Falcon (25th anniversary) set for $84 on its website, Amazon slashes it to $67</a>. This <strong>921-piece collectible build</strong> of one of the most iconic starships in cinematic history is now at its lowest price ever.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Our Favorite Star Wars Set</h2>
<p>The 921-piece construction is satisfying to build and requires several sessions of focused building time. Each bag of parts opens up a new section of the Falcon, from the detailed cockpit to the iconic sensor dish. The process of building naturally encourages mindful relaxation as you work your way through the instructions, never hurrying the pace.</p>
<p>The <strong>mid-scale size</strong> hits the sweet spot between desktop models and massive display pieces: At 9.5 inches long, 7.5 inches wide, and 5 inches high, the finished Falcon commands attention without dominating an entire shelf. The proportions of this LEGO version hold true to the ship from A New Hope and do so in a structurally safe way. You can place this next to other mid-scale starships from the LEGO Star Wars collection with no mismatched sizes. The dimensions are perfect for home office desks, bedroom shelves, or living room displays.</p>



<p>Authentic details recreate the Falcon’s most recognizable features in LEGO brick form: The cockpit sits offset on the starboard side, just as it should. The quad laser cannons rotate and articulate for different display poses. The sensor dish mounts on top in its classic pre-Return of the Jedi configuration. The hull greebling makes use of clever part combinations to suggest the weathered, lived-in aesthetic of the original prop.</p>
<p>Thoughtful presentation features on the display stand take this set from toy to décor piece. Instead of placing flat on the table, the angled mounting provides dynamic visual interest. The nameplate clearly identifies the ship for guests who might not be too familiar with Star Wars. There is <strong>also a brick that commemorates 25 years of LEGO’s partnership with Star Wars</strong>. This stand design shows LEGO understands their adult audience, wanting display-worthy builds rather than play sets.</p>



<p><strong>4.9 out of 5 stars, with almost 2,000 reviews,</strong> confirms this set lives up to expectations. More than 10,000 sold in the last month prove sustained popularity well beyond a niche following among Star Wars fans. The wide appeal crosses multiple demographics: long-time fans of the franchise, LEGO collectors, décor-conscious adults, and gift-givers seeking a well-appreciated gift. The universal recognition of the Millennium Falcon transcends typical hobby boundaries.</p>
<p>At $67, the Star Wars Millennium Falcon set offers collectible quality 20% off retail this Black Friday. LEGO’s official site is still charging full price, while Amazon moves inventory aggressively.</p>

<p>Arrowhead Game Studios recently spoke about their next title, revealing that it shouldn’t be too far from Helldivers.</p>



<p>We have been hearing a lot about Helldivers 2 recently, with the developers also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-ceo-comments-on-switch-2-port/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commenting on a Switch 2 port</a>. However, we have yet to hear new details about the next game that Arrowhead Game Studios has been working on. The latest comments from the devs don’t provide too much information, but should be enough to make Helldivers fans happy. </p>



<h2 id="h-arrowhead-studios-next-game-will-not-be-too-far-from-helldivers">Arrowhead Studios’ Next Game Will Not Be ‘Too Far’ from Helldivers</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/arrowheads-next-game-wont-be-something-thats-too-far-off-from-helldivers-2-creative-lead-says-were-looking-to-continue-the-legacy-of-what-weve-created/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>, Arrowhead Game Studios CCO, Johan Pilestedt, spoke a bit about their next title. Pilestedt first revealed that the game is currently in his favorite phase, the part he loves the most. The CCO revealed that he loves getting a new team together, breaking down boundaries among themselves, and getting to the heart of “who we are as people, and what games do we want to make together.”</p>



<p>Talking about what Arrowhead devs want to make, Pilestedt states that the team is “looking to continue the legacy of what we’ve created already.” The CCO added that the next title is “something that’s too far off from Helldivers”, which means that people who are massive Helldivers fans will be able to jump into their next game and “recognise the DNA” they have become familiar with over the years. The devs didn’t provide any more details about the game or explain how Helldivers will inspire it. </p>



<p>In other news, Helldivers 2’s Xbox port helped increase the sales and engagement for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-xbox-port-helped-increase-ps5-and-pc-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PS5 and PC versions</a>.

                <p>Bethesda did a shadowdrop for The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered earlier this year, and it was a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025-best-selling-games/2900-6281/" data-ref-id="2900-6281">big success</a>. Another Bethesda-published game, Hi-Fi Rush, had a shadowdrop as well. Now, Bethesda Game Studios director Tom Mustaine is openly calling for more releases of this type in the future from other developers across the industry.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-elder-scrolls/after-oblivion-remastered-and-hi-fi-rush-bethesda-game-studios-director-wants-more-shadowdrops-because-we-all-have-short-attention-spans-now/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>, Mustaine said the shadowdrop approach is a favorite of Bethesda boss Todd Howard, and releasing games like this can be a way to reach players who may have short attention spans.</p><p>"We all have short attention spans now," he said. "There's Grand Theft Auto, for example. I want that today, right? So it is an interesting strategy ... I don't have any ideas of what would be next, but I hope it's not the last. Personally, I think it was great to own the internet for that day and, you know, give people exactly what they want the moment we talk about it. I'm a fan of that personally, but I'd love to see more people do it."</p><p>Oblivion Remastered was technically a shadowdrop because it was released on the same day that it was announced, but the game wasn't a total surprise to everyone. After all, the existence of the game had <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oblivion-remaster-fallout-3-remaster-and-more-leaked-from-microsoft-document" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">leaked years earlier.</a> The same 2023 leak said a Fallout 3 remaster was planned, and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-3-remaster-is-real-another-report-says/1100-6536093/" data-ref-id="1100-6536093">recent report said this game is still in the works.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elder-scrolls-6-is-still-a-long-way-off-todd-howard-says/1100-6536089/" data-ref-id="1100-6536089">Speaking to GQ</a> earlier this year, Howard said he's a big fan of announcing games and releasing them shortly thereafter, and this has contributed to people believing the rumored Fallout 3 remaster could be a shadowdrop. He would also like for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6492383/" data-ref-id="1100-6492383">The Elder Scrolls 6</a> to "just appear" one day.</p><p>"I like to just announce stuff and release it. My perfect version--and I'm not saying this is going to happen--is that it's going to be a while and then, one day, the game will just appear," he said.</p><p>Next up for Bethesda is the Burning Springs update for Fallout 76, which releases on December 2. It adds Walton Goggins' The Ghoul from the Prime Video TV series, which itself returns for its second season on December 17.</p>

Set during ancient China's Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period (about 907 to 979 AD), the game is this fantastical amalgam of MMO, action-adventure, and RPG mechanics that seamlessly blends into an open-world environment you can play either in solo or multiplayer modes. There are epic sword fights with flashy combos, Tai Chi moves to basically force-throw animals and enemies, and bosses that rival a From Software game in size and difficulty. Not to mention the wealth of content in the first two regions--Kaifeng and Qinghe--that easily contain hundreds of hours of stuff to do, secrets to find, puzzles to solve, and baddies to beat up. The best part is it's all totally free.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Where Winds Meet - Coming 2025</p>
      </div>
<p>Almost everything you experience in Where Winds Meet is free to play. There are premium currencies to buy, a battle pass to purchase and upgrade, clothes and accessories to fill your (digital) wardrobe with--you know, "free-to-play" stuff. However, the action of the game--the bosses, the weapons, the main and side objectives, the minigames, etc.--doesn't cost you anything to play. That's true of future content as well. Since the game's Chinese servers get new features before the global ones do, players on those servers have shared what's coming to the game in upcoming updates, like new regions to explore and weapons to fight with.</p><p>All of this has skyrocketed Where Winds Meet to massive popularity. Following its global launch on November 14 for PC and PS5--it's been out in China since December 2024--the game reached two million players, becoming a top-three best-selling PlayStation game and a top-seven best-selling Steam game.</p><p>At the time of this writing, it's also rapidly climbing Steam's charts. According to data tracker <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3564740/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>, Where Winds Meet has a 24-hour peak player count of 251,008, with 201,807 people playing right now. It was so popular that, over the weekend, Where Winds Meet surpassed even Arc Raiders, sitting fourth on Steam's <a href="https://steamdb.info/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">most-played games</a> chart. Arc Raiders now has 207,234 players on right now, putting it above Where Winds Meet, but the two are struggling for fourth. Meanwhile, market research firm Circana states that <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m6f2uc2g5s2z" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Where Winds Meet has cracked the top 15 on PC and PS5</a> for player engagement in the US and Canada.</p><p>It's not all sunshine and rainbows for the open-world martial-arts sim, though: The game reportedly uses a ton of generative AI for NPC voice acting and <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/wuxia-mmo-where-winds-meet-is-full-of-ai-chatbot-npcs-and-people-are-doing-all-the-standard-obscene-stuff-to-them-i-made-him-think-that-my-character-was-pregnant-with-his-child/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">chatbots</a>. One Redditor named MisterZan25 was even able to convince an NPC that they were <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WhereWindsMeet/comments/1oxqhuz/anybody_else_mentally_break_the_zhao_dali_ai_just/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">pregnant with his child</a>, leading the NPC to fall to his knees and weep uncontrollably. On top of that, the game's monetization, while completely ignorable, is a little wild. According to <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/this-where-winds-meet-skin-can-cost-up-to-42000-if-youre-unlucky-3285089/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dexerto</a>, there's a skin that can cost you upwards of $40,000.</p><p>Still, this is a free-to-play game with a smattering of content that exposes a global audience to not just Chinese development but ancient Chinese lore as well. This doesn't excuse the wild monetization or disheartening AI usage, but it doesn't necessarily dampen an otherwise impressive Wuxia experience.</p><p>Where Winds Meet is available now on PC and PS5, with Android and iOS versions slated to launch on December 31.</p>

<p>Lurking in the shadows</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="f91587d6942cf"><a title="Assassin's Creed Shadows" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f91587d6942cf/assassins-creed-shadows.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ubisoft</em></figcaption></figure><p>With just one week to go before <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> arrives on Switch 2, Ubisoft has updated the game's eShop page with some noteworthy details to keep in mind before you buy. Like, for example, the dreaded file size.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/Assassin-s-Creed-Shadows-2967695.html">updated listing</a>, Shadows will take up a beefy <strong>62.8 GB</strong> on your system. It's not the most surprising news considering the size of the game, but it's something to keep an eye on as we head towards release.</p>
<p>For reference, this file size puts Shadows above the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a> (60.6 GB), <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-madden-nfl-26">Madden NFL 26</a> (57.1 GB), and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0: Director's Cut</a> (45.3 GB), but it's still a good step below <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a> (69.2 GB) and the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> (90-95 GB). Not the end of the world, then, but it might be time to start looking for a Micro SD Express, if you're hoping to have a couple of these in your library.</p>
<p>For those who missed the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/its-official-assassins-creed-shadows-comes-to-switch-2-in-december-with-cross-progression">initial announcement</a>, Assassin's Creed Shadows will arrive on Switch 2 on <strong>2nd December</strong>, complete with cross-progression saves, touchscreen support and all the title updates you could wish for — apart from the Claws of Awaji expansion, you'll have to wait until 2026 for that.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’re on the hunt for a new monitor, be it for your main screen or as a second, or dare I say, a third display, you can get a solid piece of hardware without emptying out your entire wallet. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5867/">Right now, Amazon has the ASUS ROG Strix — a 24.5-inch Full HD gaming monitor — on Black Friday sale for 43% off.</a> This hefty discount brings the price down by a whopping $130. It usually sells for $299, so that means you end up only having to pay $169 for a limited time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5867/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Insane Frame Rates</h2>
<p>When it comes to monitors, if you want to stay within a reasonable budget, you’re going to need to make some decisions on what your priority is. Like, do you want your screen to be massive above all else? Do you want the sharpest detail with a crazy 4K resolution? Well, the ASUS ROG Strix is for the frame rate freaks out there. Sure, it only measures at a humble 24.5 inches. It only displays in your standard 1080p HD resolution. However, this monitor is capable of up to 310Hz. People love to argue online over what the maximum perception of the human eye is when it comes to screen refresh rates, but this thing has got to be approaching that.&nbsp;You’ll be able to game at ridiculously fast frame rates without sacrificing much size or detail. 24.5-inches and 1080p is still good.</p>



<p>The ASUS ROG Strix monitor has a 1ms response time. This will make it so all your inputs feel immediate and snappy. A high response time will make it so every move feels like you’re walking through mud. That won’t be a problem on this monitor. I’ve been playing <em>Ho</em><em>llow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>through Game Pass UItimate, meaning I have access to it on both my Xbox and my PC. I had started out on my Xbox which is connected to a fairly cheap 2017 Vizio. I struggled hard with a lot of the platforming sections, but then I switched over to playing on a new Lenovo Legion gaming laptop and man is that change night and day. I now know it’s time my TV gets and upgrade.</p>
<p>You have multiple options when it comes to how you connect to this ASUS monitor. It supports USB-C, DisplayPort 1.4, and HDMI. So you can connect a laptop, your PC tower, a phone, or perhaps your new ASUS ROG Xbox Ally if you so please.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Bose and Sonos watched nervously as Amazon entered the soundbar market after noticing the category’s massive sales potential. Amazon’s strategy was simple: create their own hardware and undercut premium brands on price while delivering competitive quality. The <strong>Fire TV Soundbar Plus</strong> represents this approach perfectly and packs 3.1 channels, a built-in subwoofer, Dolby Atmos, and DTS:X into a package that costs a fraction of comparable models.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4053/">$149, down from $249, this newest model has hit an all-time low price</a> on Amazon for Black Friday.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4053/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Best Soundbar</h2>
<p>The <strong>integrated subwoofer</strong> addresses the most significant compromise in budget soundbars by housing appropriate bass drivers within the main unit. You get deep, room-filling low-end without buying and placing a separate subwoofer box. Action movies provide satisfying rumble during explosions and car chases. Music playback maintains warmth and body across genres from hip-hop to rock.</p>
<p>The <strong>3.1 configuration adds a dedicated center channel </strong>specifically for reproduction of dialogue. Conversations, narration, and vocal performances come through exceptionally well. You finally stop reaching for the remote when scenes switch between quiet talking and loud action. It also keeps your center channel focused on speech frequencies while left and right channels handle music and effects, which stops a muddy audio mix plaguing cheaper 2.0 soundbars.</p>



<p><strong>Dolby Atmos support introduces 3D audio</strong> that flies around and above your listening position. Height virtualization bounces the sound off your ceiling to create overhead effects in movies and shows. Helicopters fly over your head, rain falls from above, and atmospheric sounds envelope you on all sides. DTS:X offers similarly multi-dimensional audio with somewhat different processing. Both transform your living room into a theater-like experience without needing to install ceiling speakers.</p>
<p>Setup takes only minutes via a <strong>single HDMI cable attached to the eARC or ARC port on your TV</strong>. Audio automatically stays perfectly synchronized with video over the HDMI connection. You avoid the lip-sync issues that plague budget setups with optical cable connections. Power the soundbar on, and your TV instantly recognizes it. The included HDMI cable means you do not need to invest in any more accessories.</p>
<p>It has <strong>four preset audio modes that automatically adjust the sound</strong>, depending on the content. Movie mode enhances dynamic range for cinematic experiences with deep bass and clear dialogue. Music mode balances frequencies to accurately reproduce your favorite songs and albums. Sports mode amplifies crowd noise and commentary for live events. Night mode compresses dynamic range so late-night viewing won’t disturb others.</p>



<p>The Amazon Fire TV Soundbar Plus delivers premium features at nearly half the retail price this Black Friday, priced at $149. Amazon actually made up the soundbar category to begin with specifically to provide better value than the established brands. If cinematic audio is what you need but want to avoid the premium prices, then this record-low deal proves that you don’t need to spend over $500 on a soundbar.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The team behind FiveM has officially announced support for GTA 5 Enhanced Edition, allowing users to convert Legacy assets for GTA 5 Enhanced Edition through a new tool called Alchemist. </p>



<p>As we wait for Rockstar’s next big thing to arrive, GTA 6, players still have time to sink their teeth into all that Grand Theft Auto 5 and GTA Online have to offer. Recently, we were informed that GTA Online <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-online-now-included-with-gta-membership/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will be included</a> with a GTA+ membership. Now, the modding community has some good news to celebrate, thanks to mods being updated for Enhanced Edition support. </p>



<h2 id="h-alchemist-will-convert-fivem-mods-for-gta-online-enhanced-edition">Alchemist Will Convert FiveM Mods for GTA Online Enhanced Edition</h2>



<p>According to a new <a href="https://forum.cfx.re/t/introducing-alchemist-for-fivem/5366795" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> by Cfx.re (via <a href="https://rockstarintel.com/new-fivem-conversion-tool-released-by-rockstar-games-owned-team/#google_vignette" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rockstar Intel</a>), Alchemist is the first tool in a series of updates set to arrive for GTA 5 Enhanced Edition to support FiveM. The new tool will allow players, server owners, and creators to convert assets that were originally made for the GTA 5 Legacy edition and make them compatible with the Enhanced Edition. Alchemist also lets users refine existing Legacy assets to address potential formatting or compatibility issues introduced by earlier tools.</p>



<p>The Asset Conversion feature in Alcehmist allows users to convert a folder and all its content automatically. When choosing the folder, Alchemist can identify all GTA 5 Legacy assets inside the subfolders and “convert them to the GTAV Enhanced format inside the selected target directory.” The tool will also copy scripts, interfaces, and configuration files without altering them. </p>

Additionally, Rockstar’s recent firings have led to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rockstar-hit-with-legal-claim-after-firings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">legal issues</a> with IWGB.

"There is an amazing French actor by the name of Maxence Cazorla who did almost all of the motion capture for that role in that game. Any nomination, or any credit I get, I have to give to him. I believe the performance of that character is really down to him and my voice was just a part of that process."</p><p>Cox was nominated for Best Performance alongside two other Expedition 33 actors, including Ben Starr and Jennifer English. Erika Ishii was nominated for Ghost of Yotei, Konatsu Kato for Silent Hill f, and Troy Baker for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.</p><p>Expedition 33 led all others this year with 12 total nominations, including a nod for Game of the Year. With 12 nominations, that makes it the most-nominated game in the history of The Game Awards.</p><p>The Game Awards take place on Thursday, December 11, but it's expected there will be teases ahead of that, so keep checking back with GameSpot for the latest.</p>

            <p>An upcoming Pokémon game may have a darker story than you'd expect given its cheerful look and typical Nintendo vibrancy. With links to the original Pokémon game trilogy and hints at older lore, what appears to be a quirky spin on the franchise might actually have a sadder side if fan theories are spot on.</p>
<p>That game, for those not tuned into all things Pokémon, is Pokopia. This is an Animal Crossing style game in which you play a Ditto, morphed into human form, and find Pokémon spread around the island in order to restore some life to the place. Cool right?</p>
<p>Well, the extended trailer The Pokémon Company released earlier this month does offer some hints at a more dire tale hidden beneath the surface. First of all, while a Pokémon Centre is present, there are no other buildings. Ruins, sure, but no sign of human life. This is stated explicitly by your in-game guide Professor Tangrowth, who hasn't seen a human in a long time.</p>

<p>So what's happened? Well, there are some clues hidden fans believe which point to an important link to early Pokémon games. For one, the Pokédex seen at the start of the extended trailer is a generation one Pokédex, which offers a good starting point for where Pokopia takes place. Secondly, the game is set on an island, a key detail to the puzzle.</p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/1oxrrpd/cant_unsee_the_connection_after_rumors/">Pokémon fans believe the game may be set on Cinnabar island from the Kanto region</a>. This location was a key spot where the fire gym was located in the first generation Pokémon games: Blue, Red, and Yellow. However, by the time Pokémon Gold, Silver, and Crystal takes place, the volcano on the island erupts, leaving only the Pokémon centre standing - just like the starting town we see in the Pokopia trailer.</p>
<p>Following this eruption the entire island is evacuated, explaining the lack of people present on the island despite clear evidence of buildings, roads, etc. In case you think this isn't enough evidence, there's actually more proof Pokémon Pokopia takes place on a post-eruption Cinnabar. Ditto, who you take control of in Pokopia, can only be found in one spot in the generation one Pokémon games: Pokémon Mansion. If this games <em>does</em> take place between the generation one and two Pokémon games, where else could a Ditto come from?</p>
<p>If we accept Pokémon Pokopia is set in Cinnabar Island it explains a lot of the new Pokémon we see in the trailer too. Pokémon Mansion is where a lot of experiments on Pokémon took place - it's where Mewtwo was created - so it's not out of the question to say other tinkering may have happened.</p>
<p>Failing that, the new Pokémon like Mosslax could simply be a Snorlax left in the same spot mid-sleep, uninterrupted for a super long time. Without people around, it's not out of the question. Maybe Smearguru is what happens when Smeargle is left alone to paint without interruption. Cinnabar may also explain the ghostly Pikachu we see: Peakychu. If there was a volcanic eruption then, well, maybe they got wiped out? A sad possibility.</p><p>There are alternate theories out there that are equally tantalising. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/1p3sg81/pokopias_world_is_created_by_mewtwo/">Some believe this</a> could be some alternate spin on early Pokémon games where Mewtwo removed humans from the Kanto region. Not entirely off the cards, <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_multiverse">given alternate realities is something the Pokemon franchise has arguably embraced over the years</a>. In the Mystery Dungeon series there are no humans whatsoever, so anything is possible.</p>
<p>It's something fans of the franchise will surely be digging into come March 2026 when Pokémon Pokopia comes out on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. Until then, theories and speculation run amok. Or perhaps, a-Muk.</p>

<p>The surprise sequel to the under-appreciated GameCube racer <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/kirby_air_ride">Kirby Air Ride</a> has performed much better than its 2003 predecessor, boosted by fantastic visuals and performance, a plethora of characters and stages, and so many custom vehicles.</p>
<p>It's an absolute blast with friends, and our very own PJ O'Reilly agrees, scoring the game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">an 8/10</a>, summing up that "This is a chaotic and frenzied racer, there's no doubt, but it's got depth for those who wish to learn and plenty of competition to be had both online and at harder difficulties for diehards."</p><div><figure data-videoid="M1hEbqIQJAc" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytM1hEbqIQJAc" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed6de8adkymhgq&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>It's a fantastic comeback, and yet another feather in Kirby's cap; seems the pink puffball can do little wrong on the Switch and Switch 2. We've <em>always</em> loved him, of course. But what about you lovely folks?</p>
<p>Yes, we want to hear what you think of Kirby Air Riders on Switch 2. Have you been blitzing through it all weekend and have some strong thoughts on it? Or have you just dabbled and want to put more time into it? You can give the game a score below and, if you change your mind later, come back and do just that!</p>

<p><em>Thanks for voting! If you've got even more thoughts to share about Kirby Air Riders, hop on that warp star and let us know if you're enjoying the game in the comments.</em></p></section></article><div><p>Alana has been with Nintendo Life since 2022, and while RPGs are her first love, Nintendo is a close second.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>People who upgraded from a Nintendo Switch to a Nintendo Switch 2 quickly learned (if they didn't already know) that the MicroSD cards they used on the original Switch would not work with the Nintendo Switch 2. Instead, the Switch 2 requires <a href="https://wccftech.com/teamgroup-launches-apex-sd7-1-microsd-express-card-for-nintendo-switch-2/">MicroSD Express cards</a> to expand the system's 256 GB of internal storage. Finding those Express cards could, however, become more difficult and more expensive if a current shortage of non-Express MicroSD cards continues.</p>



<p>Why would a shortage of MicroSD cards impact MicroSD Express cards? The answer lies with AI companies. According to an interview with Japanese publication <a href="https://www.itmedia.co.jp/pcuser/articles/2511/22/news019.html?s=31">IT Media</a> (spotted and translated by <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/microsd-cards/large-capacity-microsd-cards-are-now-regularly-out-of-stock-in-japan-as-storage-crunch-claims-another-victim-high-capacity-hdds-are-also-vanishing">Tom's Hardware</a>), while consumers seemingly moving towards using large-capacity MicroSD cards for their storage requirements is part of the issue, the bigger part is how AI companies are swallowing up huge amounts of storage products, including HDDs, SSDs, and MicroSD cards.</p>



<p>"<em>It looks like large-capacity models are getting sucked up for AI use, so we aren't getting any stock at all,</em>" one tech shop owner told IT Media. "<em>Everyone knows what's going on, so even if the price goes up, the drives sell out immediately...and the cycle repeats</em>."</p>



<p>It was already difficult to grab a MicroSD Express card <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-microsd-express-cards-sell-out-amazon-best-buy-1851776846">when the Switch 2 was first revealed</a>. Now, with AI companies swallowing up storage stock, paired with a consumer move to MicroSD and MicroSD Express cards as the more common storage option, as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/ongoing-microsd-shortages-could-have-a-knock-on-effect-for-switch-2-storage-availability">Nintendo Life</a> points out, a shortage and price hike of the only kind of storage cards the Nintendo Switch 2 uses feels inevitable. </p>



<p>Essentially, if you were already looking at <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-first-party-games-like-super-mario-odyssey-get-rare-discount-for-black-friday-2025/">grabbing a new game for your Switch 2</a>, or if you were looking to grab <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-friday-2025-nintendo-switch-2-deals-save-on-console-accessories-and-games/">a Switch 2 console as part of ongoing Black Friday sales</a>, then you would be wise to include a MicroSD Express card in your shopping cart while you can still get one.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloodlines-2-name-chinese-room</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ex-chinese-room-head-says-bloodlines-2-shouldnt-have-been-called-bloodlines-2.1362820/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Chinese Room co-founder and former creative director Dan Pinchbeck has expressed his regret that&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>wasn't called something different, suggesting that his studio felt the game wouldn't serve as a true sequel to the 2004 cult classic.</p>

<p>In an interview with The Goth Boss Podcast's Cat Burton (via <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/dan-pinchbeck-ex-the-chinese-room-was-aware-they-couldnt-make-the-vtmb2-that-fans-wanted-in-time-and-wanted-paradox-to-call-it-something-else.1362589/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ResetEra user doops</a>), Pinchbeck says that he and a former producer at&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>studio Paradox would hold planning sessions for how to get the producers "to not call it&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines 2</em>".</p>

<p>He says that trying to recreate the "magic" of the original&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines&nbsp;</em>is "wrongheaded" in the modern environment, because the finished product wouldn't make anyone happy; fans of the original would be disappointed, and new players would get a "flawed game that was built too fast and with not enough money".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bloodlines-2-chinese-room-comments-combat.jpg?itok=Nva6RQx- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bloodlines-2-chinese-room-comments-combat.jpg?itok=cHg2jW8J 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>There might be a reason&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>doesn't feel much like the first game.</figcaption></figure><p>Pinchbeck reckons that it wasn't possible for The Chinese Room to make a true&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>because the studio had neither the time nor the money to do so; instead, he says his studio approached development from a perspective of what could be done with what it had available.</p>

<p>The result of that was, according to Pinchbeck, something that wasn't&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines 2</em>, nor was it an open-world RPG like&nbsp;<em>Skyrim</em>. Instead, it was something closer to&nbsp;<em>Dishonored</em>, a "tightly focused and true to the mythos" game that, nonetheless, wasn't a&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines&nbsp;</em>sequel.</p>

<p>Judging by the <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/19138/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">critical</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/532790/Vampire_The_Masquerade__Bloodlines_2/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">fan</a> reception to&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines 2</em>, Pinchbeck is right; most people don't really seem to view it as a proper successor to Troika's flawed-but-fun 2004 RPG. Perhaps a change of name might have been a good idea on that front.</p>

<p>Still, even if&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>isn't what it should be, it's perhaps a miracle that the game was released at all, given its lengthy history of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-indefinitely" rel="nofollow">delays</a>, developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-back-developed-by-chinese-room" rel="nofollow">changes</a>, and slightly sketchy <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloodlines-2-toreador-lasombra-paywall-removed" rel="nofollow">monetization practices</a>.</p>

            <p>
The former creative director of The Chinese Room's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a> has finally said the quiet part loud and agreed that the game really shouldn't have been called Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2. Have you played Bloodlines 2? What would you have called it? I'm going with Vampire: The Masquerade - Third Cousin Twice Removed.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Speaking to Cat Burton in <a href="https://youtu.be/iyWDyNLAo1E">an hour-long career retrospective</a> passed along by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/how-do-we-get-them-to-not-call-it-bloodlines-2-chinese-room-co-founder-reveals-early-masquerade-doubts/">VGC</a>, The Chinese Room's departed co-founder Dan Pinchbeck revealed that getting publishers Paradox to change the name was an unofficial priority after the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dear-esther">Dear Esther</a> studio <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-back-and-now-under-development-by-dear-esther-studio">took charge</a> in 2023.</p>
<p>"Right from the word go, there was one of the producers, then at Paradox, who I'm still friends with, who's now with another publisher," Pinchbeck explained. "We used to sit there and go and have these planning sessions of: 'how do we get them to not call it Bloodlines 2? That feels like the most important thing we do here is to come at this and say this isn't Bloodlines 2. You can't make Bloodlines 2. There's not enough time. There's not enough money'."
</p>
<p>
If Pinchbeck was unsuccessful at getting Bloodlines 2 renamed, The Chinese Room did apparently succeed in persuading Paradox to publish a more constricting breed of bloodsucker. "I came in and went, 'we can't make Bloodlines 2, we can't make <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>, but we can make <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a>'," Pinchbeck explained. The Dishonored parallel struck a chord with journos: in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-review">our own review</a>, Dominic Tarason called Bloodlines 2 "a blend of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/batman-arkham-city">Batman: Arkham City</a>, Dishonored and a first-person Streets Of Rage". 
</p><p>
Paradox themselves downplayed the idea that Bloodlines 2 was a direct continuation of the old Bloodlines style <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bloodlines-2-is-more-spiritual-successor-than-sequel-to-a-a-competently-good-game-by-2004-standards-say-paradox">when we spoke to them in October 2024</a>, with Paradox's deputy chief executive officer Mattias Lilja calling the new game a "spiritual successor". 
</p>
<p>
In the same interview, Lilja also opined that aspects of the original Bloodlines "wouldn't fly today", though he didn't go into much detail beyond noting that the 2004 CRPG had a bunch of technical problems. In this week's interview with Burton, Pinchbeck made the same argument a little more colourfully.</p>
<p>"Bloodlines 1 came out at a really interesting period in game development," he said, "when it was the same time as games like Stalker and Shenmue, when you could ship a really ambitious game that was full of bugs and holes, was totally flawed, but the ambition was really exciting." 
</p>
<p>
"A lot of those games, they're real cult games now, but they really weren't very good when you actually broke them apart and analysed them," Pinchbeck continued. "They had great ideas, wonderful ideas, players loved them. But you couldn't get away with it now.
</p><p>
"So trying to recreate that magic in a different environment felt wrongheaded. No one would be happy. You wouldn't make people who loved Bloodlines 1 happy, and you wouldn't make people who didn't know about Bloodlines 1 happy, because they'd never get Bloodlines 2, and they'd always get a flawed game that was built too fast and with not enough money."
</p>
<p>
The worryingly pale elephant in the room here is, of course, the earlier version of Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 that was in development at ill-fated Hardsuit Labs under the narrative leadership of original Bloodlines designer and writer Brian Mitsoda, with former RPS contributor Cara Ellison pitching in as senior narrative designer.</p>
<p>I saw a bit of Hardsuit's game at preview stage in 2019 - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-preview">as did Alice Bee</a> (RPS in peace). Inasmuch as I can still make out the details of that preview session through my rose-tinted goggles, I thought it seemed quite promising. I'm keen to learn how the project stood when Paradox pulled the plug. Back in October 2024, Lilja told me only that "with Hardsuit Labs, we agreed on a vision of what they were gonna make, [and] they had a problem delivering on that."

              <p>One of <a href="https://kotaku.com/intergalactic-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-ps5-actors-1851722128">the biggest surprises at 2024’s trailer-fest The Game Awards</a> was a brand new game from&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us</em> creators Naughty Dog, a sci-fi action-adventure called&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-trailer-1851720900"><em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</em></a>. Being the first new property from the developer in 12 years, there was good reason to sit up and take notice. Except, following that initial reveal, there was nothing to take notice of. A year later, tipsters are advising us not to get our hopes up for this year’s Geoff-Fest, given the game is very unlikely to be seen.</p> <p>That reveal last year was so compelling. Central character Jordan A. Mun was instantly very appealing, her misanthropic approach to space travel seemingly a result of the falling apart of her previous band of criminals, the Five Aces, as she now appeared to be hunting them all down. Of course, the trailer was also met with a vicious and deeply pathetic backlash from the remaining denizens of X who cannot tolerate the existence of a female video game protagonist who isn’t there for them to fap over before crying themselves to sleep. But idiots aside, it showed truly wonderful acting from Tati Gabrielle as Jordan, and potential for more of the exquisite storytelling that Naughty Dog is known for. If we can just ignore the excruciating ads for Porsche and Adidas.</p>

  <p>But since last November, we’ve not heard a peep, other than just how far away we are from getting this game. In September this year, <a href="https://kotaku.com/intergalactic-heretic-prophet-neil-druckmann-last-us-part-3-hbo-2000624967">game director Neil Druckmann spoke to&nbsp;<em>Variety</em></a> and mentioned that the game is in full development, but spoke of&nbsp;<em>Intergalactic</em>‘s massive scope and budget, suggesting this was nothing imminent. And in the last couple of days, the likes of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1p3zwoe/comment/nq8f5f9/">Jason Schreier</a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/grubb.wtf/post/3m6ajw5exkk2p">Jeff Grubb</a> have been telling people that there’s no chance of seeing the game before 2027. (Thanks&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/naughty-dogs-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-reportedly-still-years-from-release-and-dont-expect-to-see-it-at-the-game-awards"><em>IGN</em></a>.)</p>

 <p>Grubb went further, posting to BlueSky that not only is the game likely a couple of years away, but also that “it will not be shown at The Game Awards.”</p>   <p>They were responding to a rumor that spread from an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-2026-release-report/"><em>Insider Gaming</em> article</a>, citing a&nbsp;recent episode of the Dan Allen Gaming podcast, in which former IGN editor and podcast host Colin Moriarty said he&nbsp;“believe[d]” the game would appear at The Game Awards, and called <em>Intergalactic</em> “content complete.” “I think next year it’ll be good to go,” he said, explaining that he had heard from people who’d “interacted with the game,” and based on Naughty Dog hiring for localization.</p> <div role="listitem" aria-roledescription="message" data-qa-hover="true" data-qa="virtual-list-item" data-qa-unprocessed="false" data-qa-placeholder="false" id="message-list_1763995661.805549" tabindex="-1" aria-setsize="-1" data-item-key="1763995661.805549"> <p>This inspired others to jump in and suggest the complete opposite, with Moriarty himself saying they were just personal speculation. But if we know anything in 2025, it’s that big games take <em>forever</em> to make, with colossal budgets and enormous scope meaning entire businesses ride or die on their individual success. <em>Intergalactic</em> will appear when it’s good and ready, no matter how frustrating that might be for us as we impatiently wait for more details.</p> </div>

Now, according to a new </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TvWNFBBwuY"><i><span>People Make Games</span></i></a> <span>report, the entire saga actually started after Rockstar started cracking down on developers communicating about non-work topics in the company Slack.</span></p> <p><i><span>People Make Games </span></i><span>posted a new video that includes alleged messages from the Rockstar union workers’ private Discord server where members discussed conditions at the studio, but specifically not the status of projects like the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-november-rockstar-games-2000641787"><span>recently delayed </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto 6</span></i></a><span>. One former Rockstar employee claimed the only company information that was shared there were emails about updates to the company’s Slack guidelines following discussions in recently shut down channels.</span></p>

 <p><span>In October, Rockstar reportedly made changes to the company’s Slack, which included removing several miscellaneous channels where employees discussed non-work topics like pets, hobbies, and games they were playing. The “Slack Purge,” as it was called, prompted discussions in an outside union channel on Discord. This was then followed by another change preventing people from using emojis in their Slack statuses, which workers theorized was to prevent people from using the Palestinian flag or the Sprout emoji used to symbolize Union support.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>These emails were sent outside of work hours, and Rockstar has systems set up so workers cannot access their work email outside of their office. As such, Union members sent these emails to the Discord so people outside of the office could see their contents, which led to one member of the Discord expressing their concerns to management about the discussions. </span><i><span>PMG</span></i><span> theorizes that Rockstar gained access to the Discord at this point and read the previous chat logs to make a case for firing 34 workers by the end of that month.</span></p>

 <p><span>You can watch the full video below:</span></p>  <p>Rockstar limiting workers’ email access may have started this entire mess, but as&nbsp;<em>People Make Games&nbsp;</em>explains, the company has been the subject of several high profile leaks over the years, including a <a href="https://kotaku.com/gtavi-gta-vi-gta-6-grand-theft-auto-leak-video-dump-1849550414">massive data dump of unfinished <em>Grand Theft Auto 6&nbsp;</em>assets and footage back in 2022</a>. So it’s not entirely surprising that the studio has a lot of internal communications on lock and key to prevent leaks. That being said, as the IWGB Game Workers Union lays out in the video, discussing your working conditions is not the same as freely posting&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI&nbsp;</em>footage on a Discord server, and should fall under protected union discussions.</p>

 <p>In the weeks since Rockstar fired these workers, those affected have been holding protests outside both Rockstar and publisher Take Two’s London offices. Despite being fired, several members have expressed a desire to come back and finish working on&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>, which is still a year away after its recent delay.</p> <p><strong>Update, 11/24/25, 10:43 a.m. EST: </strong>An IWGB representative has released a statement to <em>Kotaku</em>, claiming the Discord was only used for sharing the information laid out in the&nbsp;<em>PMG</em> video, and that there were “strict policies” against sharing confidential updates on internal projects like&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>. The full statement reads as follows:</p> <div dir="auto" data-qa="virtual-list-item" role="listitem" aria-roledescription="message" data-qa-hover="true" data-qa-unprocessed="false" data-qa-placeholder="false" id="message-list_1763998870.447709" tabindex="0" aria-setsize="-1" data-item-key="1763998870.447709"> <p>“Obviously we can’t get in the minds of Rockstar management to know what they were referring to when they referred to leaked information – they’ve provided us with about as much (or less) information than they have put out in public statements. We can confirm that the Discord was only used for discussing information related to organising, such as the decision to remove Slack channels and pay and bonuses as the video mentions, and that there were strict policies about sharing confidential information.”</p> </div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Galaxy Watch 7 is currently <strong>ranked #1 as Amazon’s Best Seller in smartwatches</strong>, ahead of all Apple Watch models. Sales are skyrocketing on Black Friday, with one simple truth: value trumps brand loyalty when the price is right. This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5766/">2024 model is down to nearly half price at $129 from its original $249 (48% off)</a>. You’re taking here zero risk on a smartwatch that thousands are buying.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5766/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Galaxy AI That Understands Your Body</h2>
<p>It uses <strong>Galaxy AI analysis to calculate your physical readiness</strong> every morning. The watch builds up data on yesterday’s activity, quality of sleep, variation in heart rate, and recovery measures. Your phone then processes the information overnight and gives you a personalized score that lets you know how hard to push today. Low energy days indicate lighter workouts or rest, while high scores show your body is ready for intense training.</p>
<p><strong>Heart rate monitoring gets a serious boost from Galaxy AI</strong> filtering that takes into consideration the movement of the body. Conventional optical sensors are hardly accurate during high-intensity exercises when your arm is always in motion. The Galaxy Watch 7 introduces sophisticated algorithms that separate your actual heart rate signal from motion artifacts. You get reliable readings during high-intensity intervals, running, cycling, and strength training. This kind of accuracy matters when you’re training in specific heart rate zones or monitoring cardiovascular health.</p>



<p>Detailed analysis of sleep stages and quality goes beyond basic time-in-bed measurement. The watch tracks your sleep cycles throughout the night, monitoring light sleep, deep sleep, and REM phases of your sleep. Galaxy AI analyzes this data and gives you meaningful insights into your sleep patterns and habits. This feature screens for moderate to severe sleep apnea that may need medical attention. And you also get personalized recommendations to improve the quality of sleep based on your sleep patterns.</p>
<p>Wellness tips provide <strong>personalized recommendations that adjust to your real behavior and objectives</strong>. Your watch tracks detailed health information all day and night. Your connected phone then uses Galaxy AI to create relevant tips from those insights. Recommendations may include adjusting the time you work out, drinking more water, or going to bed earlier. Advice changes as your habits change and you receive coaching that remains pertinent to your life</p>
<p>Performance tracking lets you compare current workouts to previous efforts in real-time. Running the same route? The watch shows whether you’re ahead or behind your last pace. Cycling your regular loop? See instantly if you’re improving or struggling today. It’s this type of comparative data which encourages you to push that little bit harder or helps you realize when your body might need recovery.</p>



<p>The <strong>40mm case size fits comfortably on smaller wrists</strong> without looking oversized. The Green colorway provides a fresh alternative to standard black and silver options. Battery life reaches approximately <strong>30 hours with typical use</strong>, covering a full day plus some buffer. Charging happens via the included wireless charger that snaps magnetically to the back. <strong>Water resistance up to 5ATM</strong> protects during swimming, showering, and sweaty workouts.</p>
<p>The <strong>touchscreen display stays readable in bright sunlight</strong> and dims automatically in darkened rooms. Rotating bezel navigation comes with tactile control that works with sweaty or gloved fingers. From minimalist time displays to data-rich fitness dashboards, watch faces can be customized as needed. Notification mirroring from your phone keeps you connected without constantly needing to check your device. The <strong>watch works both with Android and iOS</strong>, though Android users get deeper integration features.</p>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 provides AI-powered health tracking at almost half the retail price this Black Friday for $129. This happens to be the #1 best-selling smartwatch on Amazon because the feature-to-price ratio finally makes sense. Want comprehensive health tracking without paying Apple Watch prices? This record-low deal takes every excuse off the table.</p>

<p>Your graphics card is going to get even more expensive. According to a new report from Taiwan’s UND, AMD is set to raise the cost of its GPUs due to rising memory costs.</p>



<p>This follows recent rumors that the company had begun notifying its board partners of the plan. </p>



<p><strong>“The continuous rise in memory prices has led to a sharp increase in graphics card costs,”</strong> <a href="https://money.udn.com/money/story/11162/9158350?from=edn_maintab_index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the report says</a> via machine translation. <strong>“Industry sources indicate that AMD, the second-largest graphics card manufacturer, has notified its partners of a second price increase across its entire product line. </strong></p>



<p><strong>“The increase is estimated to be at least 10%.”</strong></p>



<p>As of writing, you can still get AMD graphics cards for somewhat affordable prices. This new price point is likely to go into effect for new builds and next-gen cards. </p>



<p>It’s worth noting that AMD has yet to officially confirm its plans, so this claim should still be taken with a grain of salt until it happens. That said, Insider Gaming has reached out to AMD for clarification on what graphics cards will be impacted and if ones already manufactured will be hit with a price increase. Should a response be received, it will be added to this article.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>As a cyclist, I have a <a href="https://aftermath.site/zohran-mamdani-scavenger-hunt/" rel="noreferrer">bad habit</a> of ignoring directions and navigating by vibes. I'll look at whatever route Google Maps spits out, agree it seems reasonable, and then completely ignore it in favor of getting somewhere based on a deeply personal sense of how I think roads fit together, using landmarks like "It's the street with the bar where I fought with my ex once" or "I think it's near the place that had good vegan sandwiches 20 years ago." This almost always works <em>eventually</em>, even if it's inefficient. My friends don't get it, but <a href="https://aftermath.site/despelote-review/" rel="noreferrer"><em>Despelote</em></a><em> </em>creator Julián Cordero gets it.</p><p>Cordero's <em>Bike Race: New York City</em> was one of four games I saw at Saturday's <a href="https://gamecenter.nyu.edu/event/no-quarter-2025/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">No Quarter</a> exhibition at the NYU Game Center. No Quarter is an annual showcase of games commissioned by the game design department; the event is always a fun time, and the games are always the good kind of weird. Cordero described <em>Bike Race</em> in a written blurb by saying that, as a daily cyclist, "I tend to be very late to things and I always think I can catchup on time by biking faster. This is a game about that."</p><p><em>Bike Race</em> uses two repurposed Citi Bikes as controllers. (Game Center chair Naomi Clark told me one of the bikes had been found abandoned, and the other had been decommissioned recently.) The bikes are imposed onto a scan of New York City, similar to a <a href="https://youtu.be/VIHZYGKbjp4?si=rSF9cRmgSlAaHhlJ&amp;t=4719&amp;ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">late game level</a> in <em>Despelote</em>. Two players have to race to a real location, while the game encourages spectators to use Google Maps and shout out directions to help them get there.</p><p>The bikes aren't easy to control; turning is imprecise, and pedaling feels like it's on a kind of delay that made it hard to keep up my momentum. This meant a lot of careening up buildings or flying off the tops of cars, though wrestling with the bike <em>did</em> feel a lot like riding a real Citi Bike. All of this is made more difficult by the scan of the city, which turns a place I've biked for decades into a blobby nightmare of vaguely familiar buildings and streets.</p><figure data-kg-thumbnail="https://aftermath.site/content/media/2025/11/noqmov2_thumb.jpg" data-kg-custom-thumbnail="">

        <img src="https://aftermath.site/content/media/2025/11/noqmov2_thumb.jpg"></figure><p>When I played, I was tasked with getting to the <a href="https://www.tenement.org/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">Tenement Museum</a>, a place I have biked by approximately ten million times and even have a friend who worked there. I knew it was downtown somewhere; I had an intense <em>feeling</em> of who I was when I was regularly nearby, and vivid memories of navigating the neighborhood on a bike I had kitted out in distinctive bands of red and black gaffer tape. But trying to turn all that into lefts and rights, especially without street signs, was thrillingly hard. The people watching me eventually surmised our game had started in midtown and we needed to go south, but I quickly ended up too far south, though quite how far wasn't clear until someone recognized a white building and realized we'd somehow gone to City Hall. Trying to get from City Hall to the Tenement Museum– again, a ride I have made countless times--became a stressful, dreamy, impossible journey. I swapped places with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/yussef-cole?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">games journalist</a>  <a href="https://bulletpointsmonthly.com/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">Yussef Cole</a> and quickly Google Mapped the museum. Yussef was able to identify its location of Delancey Street, but we couldn't locate the cross streets in <em>Bike Race</em>'s version of NYC; going east, we hit the Williamsburg Bridge without finding it, and as Yussef peddled frantically back toward the west, the other player beat us to it.</p>

<p>Some players I spectated had to get to No Quarter, which means Brooklyn must be in the game too. Other games I watched ended up by the Intrepid on the west side and the spot at the bottom tip of Manhattan where you can see both the Brooklyn and Manhattan bridges. But there were lesser, more personal landmarks too: a random bank placed just so on a corner that made me realize we were near my undergrad college, or a storefront that made me yell unhelpfully "we're on that street in Chinatown with all the lamp stores!" </p><figure data-kg-thumbnail="https://aftermath.site/content/media/2025/11/noquartvid_thumb.jpg" data-kg-custom-thumbnail="">

It turns the whole city into vibes, and forces players to navigate the way I do: vague memories, hunches, and their own personal compass. I felt vindicated watching people have fun with it, even if it made me understand a bit more why my commitment to vibes drives my friends nuts. </p><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/the-definitive-citi-bike-strategy-guide/"><div><p>The Definitive Citi Bike Strategy Guide - Aftermath</p><p>Would you like to get the most out of NYC’s Citi Bike while paying the least amount of money?

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple-breaks-its-own-pricing-rules-airpods-max-hits-a-wild-black-friday-low.1362778/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Discounts on Apple’s products are few and far between. This is true for both the latest releases and most older generation models that still perform well. But thanks to Black Friday and Cyber Monday, that changes today.</p>
<p>Even though the events are technically still a few days away, early deals have started popping it. There’s a wide range of items to grab, from tech essentials to kitchen appliances, games, outdoor gear, and even toys! We also just spotted Apple AirPods Max — one of the best wireless headphones out there — at a discount.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5865/">These headphones usually sit at $550, but they can be yours for $430 today. That’s after a sweet 22% discount.</a> The offer applies to blue, orange, starlight, and purple color options. Those after the classic black version can grab it for $479. There are no weirdly long coupon codes or complicated checkout processes to worry about. Just add the product to your cart, and the discount applies automatically. Prime members will also enjoy free shipping on their orders.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5865/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Pro-Level Active Noise Cancellation</h2>
<p>The headphones don’t just look good; they are comfortable to wear, too. The pair is designed with a knit-mesh canopy and memory foam ear cushions that fit nicely to seal the sound in. Unlike most over-ear headphones, these don’t apply unnecessary pressure to the ears, which means you can wear them for longer without feeling uneasy.</p>
<p>Carring them around safely won’t be a problem either, thanks to the color-matched smart case that’s included in the box for free. Plus, since there are multiple fresh colors to choose from, you can pick one that suits your aesthetics the best. Like your audio gear a bit on the minimal side? The black or starlight options can be a great pick. Want something with a bit more personality? The purple version is stunning!</p>
<p>Performance-wise, these are packed with a dynamic driver and the Apple H1 chip for rich, high-fidelity audio. There’s Active Noise Cancellation that blocks all background sound for a more immersive experience, even in noisy, chaotic settings. This feature is great for when you really want to focus on a task (or vibe to a track) without any distractions. Just put these on, and block the outside world for as long as you want.</p>



<p>Of course, that doesn’t work for every situation. Sometimes, it’s better to be aware of what’s happening around you. For that, you’ve got the Transparency mode. This one lets ambient sound in while still delivering deep, quality audio. You can enjoy what’s playing, plus stay in touch with the world. This mode is best when you’re travelling and don’t want to miss your stop, or when you’re in a cafe and want to hear the barista call your name.</p>
<p>Spatial Audio is supported, too. This mode pushes sound that suits your unique ear shape for a 3D experience. The headphones are also smart enough to pause the audio automatically when you take them off! Tweaking other settings doesn’t require pulling your phone out, either. You can adjust volume, mute yourself on calls, skip tracks, and more using the digital crown right there on the headphones.</p>
<p>Pairing these with your device is straightforward. You can place the headphones near your iPhone, iPad, or Mac, and just tap Connect on the screen to get started.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5865/">The current deal brings the price of this high-end pair to $430.</a> We know it’s still a bit of an investment, but the discount somewhat makes these a bit more approachable. If you’ve been wanting to grab premium headphones from Apple for less, today is the day to make the move.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scalper-reseller-trading-card-van-gogh-pikachu-1850925900"><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>card scalpers</span></a><span> are getting even more creative in their quest to ruin the card collectors’ hobby forever. Lately, resellers have started bringing scales to stores to weigh packs before they buy them in hopes of identifying ones with heavier rare cards inside. GameStop, the store that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/donald-trump-halo-gamestop-console-wars-meme-ai-images-2000639237"><span>likes to play nice with America’s fascist regime</span></a><span> on social media, is warning scalpers that if they do this in their </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/funko-pop-starnger-things-bitty-bankrupt-2000642395"><span>Funko Pop-covered walls</span></a><span>, they’ll be banned from the store for the rest of their lives.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you bring a scale to GameStop to weigh Pokémon packs we will ban you for life for your own good. <a href="https://t.co/nAiu7vwVAa">https://t.co/nAiu7vwVAa</a></p> <p>— GameStop (@gamestop) <a href="https://twitter.com/gamestop/status/1990544735942160760?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 17, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Though there are </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BVY7ES5QEejd2lJIGkTrwerp6dvk0QPVZIiDc1DVFqo/edit?usp=sharing"><span>conflicting accounts</span></a><span> on this, some </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>collectors believe that packs with rare full art cards weigh more than those without them. All these cards are made of the same cardboard, but full art cards do weigh slightly more because they have more ink and foil than a standard card. Depending on the scale you use, you may be able to pick up slight variations in weight, but it’s not a foolproof tactic.</span></p>

 <p><span>Now, will anyone actually enforce this? Probably not. The GameStop social media accounts love to performatively post </span><a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1991594896386584827?s=20"><span>things like memes</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1987706054071951839?s=20"><span>nostalgia-bait content</span></a><span>. Funnily enough, if you look at the replies, you’ll see several commenters pointing out that GameStop locations tend to sell Pokémon cards at inflated prices, so the store is actively benefiting from this nonsense. But hey, if we hear that someone is actually getting banned for weighing Pokémon cards at a GameStop, we’ll be sure to write about it here at </span><i><span>Kotaku </span></i><span>dot com.</span></p>

 <p><span>Other stores like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-trading-card-tcg-scalper-walmart-purchase-limit-2000641073"><span>Walmart have finally started to take some action against scalpers</span></a><span> after years of people reselling </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>cards have finally come back to bite them in the ass, with several viral videos of employees doing nothing to stop it. Stories of scalpers and retailer indifference have become so prominent that the good in the hobby has become overshadowed by the bad, though there are still parts of the community that are trying to ensure it </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-card-tcg-vendor-scalper-reseller-stream-shows-2000630658"><span>stays a welcoming place for real fans</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p><span>GameStop employees are about to face plenty of chaos without having to slap the wrists of a scalper with a scale. The store is having a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/gamestop-trade-in-anything-day-rules-2000645098"><span>“Trade Anything Day”</span></a><span> that will let customers bring in just about anything in hopes of getting store credit, and workers are bracing themselves for the chaos, panic, and disorder they’re going to be stuck dealing with because corporate wanted a day of viral shenanigans. </span></p>
