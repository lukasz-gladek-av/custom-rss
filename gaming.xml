        <p>Well, I say that, they've actually addressed "certain irregularities"</p>

            <p>South Korean publishers Nexon are investigating a recent bit of TikTok marketing for their free-to-play shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-first-descendant">The First Descendant</a>, after players spotted some ads that feature AI-generated 'human' streamers bigging up the game. Well, we at least have to assume it's following that, as Nexon's statement omits mentioning AI in favour of the wonderfully nebulous phrase "certain irregularities".</p>
<p>If you've not seen one of these ads that look to have been posted by The First Descendant's official account, allow me to show you, because you'll see right quick why folks have been asking questions. <a href="https://x.com/MoxsyOG/status/1956400478855573771">Boom</a>. There are further booms compiled into one Reddit post by user iHardlyTriHard down below.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As you can see, them be some weird renderings of streamy blokes, especially the one who says <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nier">Nier</a>: Automata in a fashion that'd be hilarious if this wasn't terrible AI sloppage. Seriously, he pronounces it NEER (pause for ten seconds) audomada. He also gets points for doubling up on his use of free-to-play in his attempt to get you hyped about an F2P update to the F2P looter shooter, which has launched F2Ply.</p>
<p>Anyway, in addition to the more obviously not-streamers, it appears the first one in the compilation below may be based on the likeness of streamer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DanieltheDemon/videos">DanieltheDemon</a>. He's since taken to the comments section of a TikTok about the clips to make clear he didn't agree to any of this. "I have no affiliation nor contract with The First Descendant," the streamer <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@game.central/video/7539498130065214742">wrote</a>. "They stole my face/reactions from my most viral video and used AI to change what my mouth says and a voice that isn't mine. I did not consent for my likeness to be used..."</p> 
<p>While you can't find these full ads if you go to The First Descendant's official TikTok account, you can see some of the <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@firstdescendantofficial/video/7525009515557932296?lang=en">gameplay</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@firstdescendantofficial/video/7525333042924211463?lang=en">clips</a> the AI streamers have been paired with to deliver their samey sales pitches.</p>
<p>What do Nexon have to say about this? The <a href="https://x.com/FirstDescendant/status/1957361838964006977">following</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We would like to inform you of certain irregularities identified in the operation of our TikTok Creative Challenge for creators. As a part of our marketing campaign for Season 3: Breakthrough, we recently ran a Creative Challenge program for TikTok creators, which allows creators to voluntarily submit their content to be used as advertising materials. All submitted videos are verified through TikTok’s system to check copyright violations before they are approved as advertising content.</p>
<p>However, we have become aware of cases where the circumstances surrounding the production of certain submitted videos appear inappropriate. Thus, we are conducting a thorough joint investigation with TikTok to determine the facts. We sincerely apologize for the delay in providing this notice as the review is taking longer than expected. Once the verification is complete, we will promptly share an update through an official notice.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, the company ran <a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/business/creativecenter/quicktok/online/tiktok-creative-challenge-introduction/pc/en">a competition of sorts</a> that let anyone create ads for the game, which is a strange example of outsourcing at the very least, then seemingly left final approval for publication to TikTok's copyright checker, which merrily waved this dodgy stuff through. Either that or Nexon potentially gave it all the green light themselves. Either way, oof.</p><p>We'll have to see what the company say once that investigation's concluded, but here's hoping the next statement's a bit more like the easier-to-parse response offered when Nexon were accused of taking <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-first-descendant-has-decided-to-make-adjustments-to-barely-changed-destiny-2-icons">a bit too much inspiration</a> from some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> icons.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>There’s a new reason to revisit <em>Battlefield 2042</em>, <em>Euro Truck Simulator</em> 2 gets ported after 13 years, and I don’t need another <a href="https://kotaku.com/balatro-goty-game-awards-app-store-steam-sale-1851709617"><em>Balatro</em>-like in my life,</a> but I might make an exception for fellow dopamine drip machine <em>Raccoin</em>. Welcome to another edition of <a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/morning-checkpoint">Morning Checkpoint</a>, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s round-up of gaming news and cultural discourse. Also, ongoing updates on the fate of D.C.’s most infamous sandwich slinger. A 20-person goon squad was sent to his home last Friday <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-goons-sent-swat-team-to-bust-the-dc-hoagie-hurler/">to re-arrest the guy</a>, but murals memorializing the moment <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ianlivingston.bsky.social/post/3lwmpmzwl322h">will be harder to detain</a>.</p> <h2><em>Raccoin</em> is a coin pusher for roguelike deckbuilder freaks</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="RACCOIN: Coin Pusher Roguelike | Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yy1FcT6sfIo?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Playstack’s next game is about watching coins fall off a ramp as you use special items and tricks to generate giant, super-satisfying combos. It’s certainly being presented as <em>Balatro</em> for coin-pushers, complete with a nice, quirky arcade cabinet art style. You select different characters with unique advantages and unlock special coins you can deploy to rack up bonuses. There’s a physics simulation element and lots of jingling.</p> <p>The developer is Doraccoon, and this appears to be their first game. If you’ve ever wandered by someone hunched over a coin pusher in the wild with a zombie look in their eyes and shook your head in dismay, well, hey, that could be you when<em> Raccoin</em> launches. There’s no release date yet, but <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3784030/RACCOIN_Coin_Pusher_Roguelike/">a free playtest on Steam is live starting August 18</a>.</p>

 <h2>Keeping <em>Anthem</em> online forever might have made it a worse game</h2> <p>Ex-BioWare producer Mark Darrah recently mused about<em> Anthem</em>‘s <a href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-server-shutdown-bioware-dragon-age-mass-effect-1851786136">servers shutting down next year</a> in light of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/stop-killing-games-break-switch-2-cart-size-ign-layoffs-pilotwings-music-2000614692">Stop Killing Games movement</a>. Had it been designed to stay online forever, “it would have been an uglier game, probably would have had more latency issues,” he recently told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pd9OG3HmN0">YouTuber MrMattyPlays</a>. “It would have been a worse experience second-to-second in order to get something that basically wouldn’t need to ever be sunset.”</p> <p>But he also added that those tradeoffs might be worth it in the long run. “I think maybe it is that we want to be in a world where we’re willing to sacrifice some fidelity, sacrifice some things in order to get it so that games don’t just vanish one day.”</p> <h2><em>Battlefield 2042</em> gets a big surprise update called “<em>Road to&nbsp;<span>Battlefield</span> 6</em>“</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Road to Battlefield 6: Iwo Jima" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Xq0BbFJ0DU?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>EA’s last beleaguered multiplayer shooter is being repurposed into a bridge to the future. A new update that goes live today adds a new free pass full of unlockable nods to the franchise’s past as well as new rewards for <em>Battlefield 6</em>. A version of the Iwo Jima map is also returning, alongside other new content. Fans are grudgingly on board. “<span dir="auto" role="text">Okay <em>2042</em>, ill bite one last time,” wrote one YouTube commenter.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><em>Euro Truck Simulator 2</em> is coming to console</h2> <p>A PlayStation store listing for the hit highway-and-chill series <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EuroTruck2/comments/1mthopc/ets2_is_coming_to_ps5/">leaked over the weekend</a>. The PS5 version is arriving <a href="https://truck-simulator.fandom.com/wiki/Euro_Truck_Simulator_2_Version_history">over a decade</a> after the game came out, though regular updates have continued adding new vehicles and fleshing out the sprawling continental road map.</p> <h2>There’s an enhanced version of <a href="https://kotaku.com/shenmue-3-the-kotaku-review-1840175041"><em>Shenmue III</em></a> on the way</h2> <p><em>Shenmue III Enhanced</em> will have more NPCs in the streets, better graphics, menu and gameplay fixes, and a new camera mode inspired by the original two games. It also brings the game to Xbox and Switch 2, with an upgrade path for those who already own it on PC and PS4.</p>

 <h2><em>The Last Of Us</em> <em>Online</em> game director teases new multiplayer project</h2> <p>Vinit Agarwal left Naughty Dog <a href="https://kotaku.com/naughty-dog-last-us-online-vinit-agarwal-1851785806">earlier this year</a> to set up a new game studio in Japan. He recently shed more light on what fans can expect from the studio’s new project, whose team also includes fellow <em>Last of Us Online</em> lead Joe Pettinati. “A big part of what inspired me to [go independent] was seeing the potential in combining Naughty Dog’s specialty, cinematic action, with multiplayer,” he <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/08/13/155975.html">told GameSpark</a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/director-of-scrapped-the-last-of-us-online-says-his-new-us-japan-studio-is-making-a-cinematic-multiplayer-title/"><em>VGC</em></a>).

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/does-helldivers-2-have-cross-progression/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/does-helldivers-2-have-cross-progression-on-xbox-playstation-pc-cross-platform-status-explained.1272846/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hell may not have frozen over, but the release of Helldivers 2 on Xbox Series X|S is rapidly approaching and shows that nothing can be ruled out. If you want to know whether the release on the platform includes cross-progression, we’ve got all the details you need.</p>



<p>Due to be released on Xbox on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-helldivers-2-release-on-xbox-exact-release-date-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">August 26</a>, though there are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-devs-have-no-plans-of-putting-it-on-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no plans to bring the title to the Game Pass service</a>, Arrowhead Games’ title is one of the biggest releases of the summer for the platform and shows a major shift in approach from Sony, which published the title.</p>



<p>If you’ve already played Helldivers 2 on PC or PlayStation and want to know whether you can transfer your progress and any unlocked content to a different platform, like Xbox, we’ve got a full explanation on the feature.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-helldivers-2-have-cross-progression">Does Helldivers 2 Have Cross-Progression?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Squad up. Image via Arrowhead Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, Helldivers 2 does not support cross-progression between platforms, and any unlocked content is only available on the existing version.</strong></p>



<p>An<a href="https://arrowhead.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12517679456156-Does-Helldivers-2-have-cross-progression-Can-I-transfer-my-stuff-to-another-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> FAQ published by Arrowhead</a> in July, it was confirmed that any progression, including limited-time content, cannot be transferred between accounts. It was also confirmed that accounts cannot be merged.</p>



<p>This means, for example, that Xbox players will not be able to show off any content from earlier seasons in Helldivers 2, with any unlocks before the Xbox release being unavailable on the platform. However, you also can’t share your account between PlayStation and PC either.</p>



<p>Although cross-progression is unavailable, crossplay support is offered between PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, so you can play with friends regardless of their platform.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-cross-progression-be-added-to-helldivers-2">Will Cross-Progression be Added to Helldivers 2?</h2>



<p><strong>It is unlikely that cross-progression will be added to Helldivers 2, as Arrowhead stated there are “no plans to implement cross-progression at this time.”</strong></p>



<p>While you can never say never, it’s clear that cross-progression is not a priority for the development team, and if the stance were to change, it would likely take a lengthy amount of time for the feature to be implemented.</p>



<p>There could be additional demand for cross-progression following the launch of Helldivers 2 on Xbox Series X|S, particularly as many players may have opted to purchase the game on PS5 or PC due to the previous unavailability on Xbox. </p>



<p>Do you want to see cross-progression added to Helldivers 2? Let us know your thoughts in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/will-there-be-another-battlefield-6-open-beta/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/will-there-be-another-battlefield-6-open-beta.1272843/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Battlefield 6 community is now without BF6 content again. Two weekends of betas have seen you all rack up millions of eliminations, building destructions, and more. So let’s see if EA and Battlefield Studios are planning another Battlefield 6 beta before the game’s release window.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-sign-up-for-battlefield-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield Labs</a> was a limited testing phase for BF6. Early indicators were good, but all this did was make the BF community feverish to try it out for itself. The first chance arrived with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-early-access-to-the-battlefield-6-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Early Access Open Beta</a>. Another couple of days passed, and it was time for worldwide destruction. </p>



<p>This couldn’t have been more fitting as the BF6 beta destroyed all expectations, the game blew up, and Battlefield 6 destroyed CoD with over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-battlefield-6-conucrrent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">500,000 concurrent players</a> in the betas. With the Weekend 2 beta now finished, we need to see if you get one more chance to play before launch.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-there-going-to-be-more-battlefield-6-betas">Is There Going to be More Battlefield 6 Betas?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It was a good run. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Battlefield 6 Comms page suggests that there will be no more Battlefield betas, and the next time you get to play BF6 is when the game comes out.</strong></p>



<p>If you’ve been playing the BF6 beta at any point, chances are you’ve been keeping up with the Battlefield Comms X page. This has been a constant source of information since day one. From <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-dlss-dlaa-not-working-issue-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DLSS and DLAA updates</a> to general bulletins on matchmaking, it has provided up-to-date details.</p>



<p>On August 18, it posted what appeared to be a farewell message on <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> for BF6 beta testing:</p>



<p>“Thank you all for playing throughout these Open Beta weekends. You made this truly special for us as you captured flags, controlled sectors, blew holes in buildings, charged into combat, nailed vehicles with RPGs, dove into fire to resurrect a teammate, sniped from different angles, pushed the line forward in tanks, and circled the battlefield in aerial combat. You truly showcased the huge variety of action-packed gameplay that is coming in Battlefield 6.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-battlefield-6-come-out">When Does Battlefield 6 Come Out?</h2>



<p><strong>Battlefield 6 is due for release on October 10, and this is likely the next time you get to play BF6.</strong></p>



<p>Unless something catastrophic happens between now and October 10, I think it’s a case of waiting a while until the full launch, as there won’t be any more betas. Battlefield Labs testing lasted many weeks. Thousands of hours were accrued during the Open Betas, too. I would hazard a guess that Battlefield Studios has accumulated all the data and feedback it needs.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Servers Closing Down Soon

The playlist options and game servers for Open Beta Weekend 2 will begin closing down in 1 hour at 12:00 UTC. Once the shut down starts, you’ll be able to continue to play until your match ends.

Thank you all for playing throughout these Open Beta</span></p></article></div>

<p>Did you get a chance to play any of the Battlefield 6 betas? What are your thoughts about the game ahead of its full-scale launch in October? I can’t wait, as we need a CoD alternative.

                <p>The Pokemon Company is making some big changes when it comes to the video game series' world championships. Over the weekend, the latest Worlds tournament took place in California, and as is usual for the event a number of announcements were made. The biggest one for the Pokemon Video Game Championships is that the upcoming pseudo-spin-off game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-champions/">Pokemon Champions</a> will be the main game at next year's Pokemon World Championships. On top of that, the game was also finally confirmed to be releasing on Nintendo Switch 2.</p><p dir="ltr">A trailer announcing this news also revealed that Mega Evolution will feature in the "first set of regulations for Ranked Battles in Pokemon Champions." There was also a teaser for a new in-game device called the Omni Ring, which you can check out on Pokemon Champions' <a href="https://champions.pokemon.com/en-gb/" rel="nofollow ">official website</a>. This will seemingly let you rotate between Mega Evolution and other similar abilities in the series like Z-Moves and Dynamaxing.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDOstmYXLVs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rDOstmYXLVs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-champions-announced-for-switch-and-mobile/1100-6529752/">back in February</a>, details on Pokemon Champions are still pretty light overall. An <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/pokemon-champions-official-overview-trailer/2300-6466201/" data-ref-id="2300-6466201">overview trailer from last month</a> did go into a little bit of detail about the game. It showed a bit about how you can recruit Pokemon, how you can change their stats, and the kinds of battles that will be available. You'll also be able to connect the game to Pokemon Home, and there's cross-platform support between the original Nintendo Switch, the Nintendo Switch 2, and mobile.</p><p dir="ltr">A release date hasn't been set in stone just yet, but it is planned for release sometime in 2026 on Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2 iOS, and Android.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-announces-kirby-air-riders-nintendo-direct-a-45-minute-deep-dive-with-director-masahiro-sakurai.1272798/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Nintendo has announced a new Nintendo Direct presentation for tomorrow, Tuesday, August 19, 2025, that's 45-minutes long, featuring legendary game director and designer Masahiro Sakurai, that's all about the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 title, Kirby Air Riders.</p>



<p>The news first broke on the Nintendo Today app, before being published to social media, as we've seen Nintendo do several times now regarding major news and updates for its products. It'll kick off at 6am PT / 9am ET / 2pm BST, and you'll be able to watch it live on YouTube. </p>



<p>"<em>Join us on Aug 19 at 6am PT for a Kirby Air Riders Direct with director Mr. Sakurai</em>," a <a href="https://x.com/KirbyAirRiders/status/1957432749125779831">post on X (formerly Twitter)</a> from the official Kirby Air Riders account reads. "<em>The livestreamed presentation will last roughly 45 minutes and provide an in-depth look at the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 game</em>."</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Kirby Air Riders Direct 8.19.2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QtkHiB7WKf4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>It'll be the first we've seen of the first non-Smash Bros. game from Sakurai in years, and the first Switch 2 game directed by Sakurai. The game is also currently set to release sometime later this year, so it's likely that tomorrow's presentation will also include an official release date announcement, along with a bevy of information and gameplay footage of what to expect from the follow-up to the 2003 GameCube title, Kirby Air Ride.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Verdun&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Isonzo&nbsp;</em>developer BlackMill Games has announced&nbsp;<em>Gallipoli</em>, the next game in its series of World War I-set shooters, and it's promising "the most authentic WWI FPS battles yet".</p>

<p>As the name suggests,&nbsp;<em>Gallipoli&nbsp;</em>will shift the focus from the traditional European battlefields featured in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tannenberg-holding-historical-wolf-truce-event" rel="nofollow">previous games</a> in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/verdun-christmas-truce-dlc-supports-charity" rel="nofollow">franchise</a> to those of the Middle Eastern front. That means you can expect a healthy dose of desert warfare alongside the usual "beach landings, historical classes, and realistic weaponry".</p>

<p>In a Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3065940/view/834973992999715448" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a>, BlackMill says&nbsp;<em>Gallipoli&nbsp;</em>will come complete with its very own "signature game mode", and while the studio doesn't want to give too much away about that mode right now, it'll all revolve around momentum.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gallipoli-wwi-shooter-explosive.jpg?itok=KaAK5DS9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gallipoli-wwi-shooter-explosive.jpg?itok=owOReAWI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Gallipoli&nbsp;</em>will continue its predecessors' focus on WWI-era realism.</figcaption></figure><p>The mode will support 50 players and will split them into two teams. If you're on the attacking team, you'll need to try and complete your objectives as fast as you can, but the defending side will be trying to scupper you as you do so.</p>

<p>It sounds as though momentum will be incorporated as a gameplay mechanic rather than just a vague sense of initiative; BlackMill is promising opportunities to regain lost momentum other than completing objectives.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to improved gameplay and visuals in&nbsp;<em>Gallipoli&nbsp;</em>compared to previous installments; the studio says it's "gone to great lengths to faithfully recreate" Middle Eastern front weaponry, which it says was "usually quite obsolete, weird, or both".</p>

<p>BlackMill is also promising "major improvements to progression, loadouts, cosmetics, and the health system", but you'll have to wait for future updates in order to learn specifics about how all of those things are being improved.</p>

Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Creepy Jar has announced the Early Access release date for its open-world survival-crafter&nbsp;<em>StarRupture</em>, and it's set to launch on PC early next year.</p>

<p>As revealed in a Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1631270/view/597409112655921163" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a>,&nbsp;<em>StarRupture&nbsp;</em>will be coming to Steam Early Access on January 6th. Creepy Jar says it knows "you will need to wait a little bit longer than you originally anticipated" for the game's launch, but that the delay will mean "more polish [and] more improvements".</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>StarRupture</em>, it's an open-world survival-crafter game with base-building elements that was first revealed as part of the PC Gaming Show <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/green-hell-dev-starrupture" rel="nofollow">all the way back in 2023</a>. The name is a reference to the star at the heart of the game's solar system, which creates "extreme living conditions" for those residing on the planet nearby.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/starrupture-early-access-release-date-horde.jpg?itok=Aaxun9oo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/starrupture-early-access-release-date-horde.jpg?itok=h8uBugG8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>StarRupture&nbsp;</em>is finally coming to Early Access next year.</figcaption></figure><p>Creepy Jar describes its game as a "first-person open world base-building game with advanced combat and tons of exploration" in which you can either play on your own or as part of a group.</p>

<p>You'll explore an "ever-changing open world" in which you'll have to construct a "complex industrial system" in order to "extract resources, produce goods and expand your base", in a similar fashion to titles like&nbsp;<em>Factorio&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Satisfactory</em><em>.</em></p>

<p>Once the base is built, you'll also have to make sure you're defending it from the "hordes of alien monsters" that will lay siege to it, as well as the constantly-changing conditions of the planet on which you find yourself.</p>

<p>You can check out the Early Access release date trailer for&nbsp;<em>StarRupture</em>, which also gives a pretty good sense of what you can expect from Creepy Jar's game, right here.</p>




<p><em>StarRupture&nbsp;</em>is set to land on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1631270/StarRupture/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> on January 6th. You can read our very own Ashley's preview of the spacefaring base-builder <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/starrupture-preview" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a>.</p>

</header>
  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>I was ready to skip MicroProse's just-announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deck-and-conn">Deck &amp; Conn</a>, on the grounds of it being far too early in the week for games that consist entirely of dials and rangefinders, but then a scrambled communique from Sin Vega alerted me to the fact that it's the work of Elissa Black, one of the peeps behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/objects-in-space">Objects In Space</a>, which I think is one of my top five <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-space-games-on-pc">space games</a>. So here we are. </p>
<p>At a glance, Deck &amp; Conn is Objects In Space, but turn-based and minus Objects In Space's slightly distracting 3D background elements. That's to say, it's a testing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategickal</a> simulation that seats you in front of a terrifying retro pixel display, and expects you to trace distress calls, manage your fretful crew, spin up torpedoes and so forth, all without bursting your puny monkey brain. </p><!--more-->
<p>It takes inspiration from older MicroProse games - the ones made by the MicroProse of the 1990s, before they got repeatedly bought and skinned and eventually <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroProse#Brand_revival_(2018%E2%80%93present)">wrapped around the bones of a different company</a> - and the 1971 Super <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-trek">Star Trek</a> mainframe game, which is from before my time, though I think I've played one of its descendants in Thomas Spreen's Rescue!.</p>
<p>Being turn-based, Deck &amp; Conn should be a mite less stressful and exhilarating than Objects In Space, but I'm already having kittens over the sensor management tab in the screenshots. Remember: just because there's a dot on your radar doesn't mean that's where the ship you're fighting actually is. Here's a trailer.</p>

<p>The noble vessel you command in Deck &amp; Conn is "a Cold War-style nuclear corvette", which sounds about as safe as a bed of rusty nails. I'm guessing that it will not have enough reactor power for all the individual things you need it to do, prior to upgrades at least. Please brace to be impacted by these bullet points, direct from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3828500/Deck__Conn/">the Steam page</a>.
</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Command a nuclear-powered space corvette in a Cold War-inspired sci-fi universe</li>
<li>Turn-based tactical combat with limited resources and system management</li>
<li>Dynamic campaign with war patrols, ship upgrades, and crew promotions</li>
<li>Individual combat scenarios to hone your tactical skills</li>
<li>Capture or destroy enemy ships to gain rewards and shape your legacy</li>
<li>Pixel art visuals inspired by early '90s MicroProse classics</li>
<li>Respond to HQ orders and make tough choices in the forever-war</li>
<li>Inspired by the 1971 Super Star Trek mainframe game</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Black's other previous games include <a href="https://expectproblems.itch.io/swords-of-freeport">Swords Of Freeport</a>, "a text-mode social RPG heavily inspired by the style of Bulletin Board System door games from back in the '90s", which "is part MUD and part BBS Game - but without the need for a BBS. You can play it on your home machine alone, or play/install it on an internet-accessible machine where others can join you - anywhere they have terminal access."</p><p>That sounds like catnip to a certain venerable species of internet wayfarer. I think I prefer the space submarines personally. If you are similarly fond of astral tugboats with copious blind sides, you might enjoy playing or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-space-strategy-sim-nebulous-channels-eight-years-in-the-us-navy">reading about Nebulous: Fleet Command</a>.</p>
<p><em>Small disclosure: Sin Vega is an online acquaintance of Elissa Black from back in the day.</em></p>

<p>The latest Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 leak has revealed that 16 6v6 maps will be available at launch. </p>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 leaks have been surfacing in large numbers recently, with several new details emerging over the past couple of days. We recently learned that the upcoming title will feature some remastered maps and also the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-leaks-remastered-maps-a-return-of-specialist/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">return of specialist abilities</a>. Now, we know how many 6v6 maps will be available at launch. </p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-will-feature-13-original-6v6-maps">Black Ops 7 Will Feature 13 Original 6v6 Maps</h2>



<p>The details about Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 6v6 maps come from a reliable COD leaker/insider, TheGhostOfHope. According to their recent post on <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1957173644649488771" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), 16 6v6 maps will be available at launch. Out of these, there are 13 original maps and three remastered ones from Black Ops 2. </p>



<p>Moreover, two maps will be available at launch for large-scale Skirmish, which features the leaked <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-accidentally-reveals-20v20-wingsuit-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wingsuit mode</a>. Lastly, players can expect “plentiful” post-launch content. For comparison, Black Ops 6 had 12 6v6 maps at launch and 4 for Gunfight. </p>

<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-co-op-campaign-characters-leaked">Black Ops 7 Co-Op Campaign Characters Leaked </h2>



<p>Hope also provided players with a Black Ops 7 campaign <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1957124861173678175" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">leak</a> yesterday, which revealed which characters will be available for 4-person co-op. These include David “Section” Mason, Mike Harper, Eric Samuels, and Chloe “Karma” Lynch. However, as the information about the Black Ops 7 campaign characters and the launch maps doesn’t come from an official source, readers should treat it with caution. </p>

<p>The Battlefield 6 Open Beta may be over, but there’s still work to be done to prepare for the release, with a fresh slew of exclusive rewards available to earn through the Battlefield 2042 Road to Battlefield 6 Pass.</p>



<p>Due to be released on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-release-date-officially-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">October 10</a>, Battlefield 6 is one of the most anticipated games of the year, which was proven by it taking just a few hours for over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-battlefield-6-conucrrent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">half a million concurrent players</a> to assemble on Steam. </p>



<p>While it’s too late to earn the exclusive Battlefield 6 Open Beta rewards that were available, there’s now more loot to secure to bolster your locker before the game releases. Here are all the details.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-battlefield-2042-road-to-battlefield-6-rewards-amp-how-to-get-them">All Battlefield 2042 Road to Battlefield 6 Rewards &amp; How to Get Them</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Loot to earn. Image via EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Six exclusive cosmetic bundles are available in the Battlefield 2042 Road to Battlefield 6 pass, which will be immediately unlocked in Battlefield 6 on release.</strong></p>



<p>The rewards are cosmetic items, so won’t provide any boost to you in gameplay, but are a decent way of showing your support to the Battlefield franchise and you can flex on other players in the lobby with items they won’t be able to get their hands on.</p>



<p>The Battlefield 2042 Road to Battlefield 6 Pass is available now and expires on October 7, just a few days before the release of Battlefield 6. In total, 30 exclusive rewards are available, as <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1957412193198100646]" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announced on X</a> (formerly Twitter).</p>



<p>Check out all the exclusive rewards available in the pass in the table below.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Name</th><th data-align="center">Type</th><th data-align="center">Tier</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Western Front Bundle</td><td data-align="center">Weapon Cosmetic</td><td data-align="center">8</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Muller Bundle</td><td data-align="center">Weapon Cosmetic</td><td data-align="center">19</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Aurora Bundle</td><td data-align="center">Vehicle Cosmetic</td><td data-align="center">30</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Blackburn Bundle</td><td data-align="center">Vehicle Cosmetic</td><td data-align="center">40</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Commander Bundle</td><td data-align="center">Operator Cosmetic</td><td data-align="center">49</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Sovereign Soldier Bundle</td><td data-align="center">Operator Cosmetic</td><td data-align="center">60</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-what-other-rewards-are-available">What Other Rewards Are Available?</h2>



<p><strong>While the highlight of the pass is undoubtedly the exclusive rewards available to secure for Battlefield 6, there’s plenty more up for grabs with 60 free tiers and over 50 new rewards.</strong></p>



<p>This includes a journey back in time through the Battlefield franchise, with rewards inspired by Battlefield 1, Battlefield Bad Company 2, Battlefield 3, and Battlefield 4.</p>



<p>There are still a few months to go until Battlefield 6 releases, so working through the Battlefield 2042 Road to Battlefield 6 Pass is a good way to kill time while you wait.</p>



<p>Are you planning on diving into Battlefield 2042 to unlock these exclusive Battlefield 6 rewards? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Surprise! A brand new Nintendo Direct focused on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> will land tomorrow, Tuesday August 19 at 6am Pacific, 9am Eastern, or 2pm UK time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once again, Nintendo revealed the show first via its Nintendo Today smartphone app, and promised the broadcast would feature 45 minutes of information about the upcoming Switch 2 game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kirby Air Riders is notable for being the first new project in years from Masahiro Sakurai, the famed director of Nintendo's smash hit Super Smash Bros. series. Tomorrow's deep dive look at the game is also intriguingly timed, suggesting it may finally be playable at this week's Gamescom event in Cologne.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">To date, Nintendo has kept details of Kirby Air Riders close to its chest, though has said the pink puffball-staring racer should be expected to launch on Switch 2 later this year. It seems likely tomorrow's Direct will provide a firmer release window.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Announced earlier this year alongside further details of the Switch 2 itself, Kirby Air Riders will be a sequel to the 2003 cult classic Kirby Air Ride for GameCube. Production on the game began in earnest back in 2023, following the end of Sakurai's time overseeing Super Smash Bros. Ultimate's lengthy schedule of downloadable content.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's no suggestion tomorrow's show will include any other Switch 2 games beyond Kirby Air Riders (sorry, Metroid fans). Still, more information on what's next from Sakurai and his talented development team should suffice.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

Fortunately, an all-new Road to Battlefield 6 event for Battlefield 2042 will bridge the gap, as it kicks off today and runs through October 7. Players can expect new content, including a free rewards pass that EA says will celebrate the legacy of the Battlefield series with new gear, a reimagining of the fan-favorite Iwo Jima map, and more.</p><p>EA added that the event will feature 20 exclusive rewards for Battlefield 6, and these can be unlocked in Battlefield 2042 ahead of its launch. Players can pick up the KFS2000 assault rifle and the Lynx sniper rifle, and for aerial warfare, the A10 Warthog and SU-25TM Frogfoot are being pulled out of the vault so that they can be put back into service.</p>

Sony Santa Monica is the developer, most recently, behind God of War Ragnarök.</p><p>"I’d like to share a little bit about our new project," Barlog wrote on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cory.barlog.357128/posts/pfbid0JHwrN1fGFLZGN5BBa7qneq6Qcc3prpVKvHpfPnZBewgcnZ4sehaHporp97xaLq3Jl">Facebook</a>. "I’m incredibly proud of what the team at Santa Monica Studio has been accomplishing. It’s a technically ambitious project, something that’s not easy to achieve. This is a new IP we’ve been working on for years, and if all goes well, we’re planning to show it to you later this year. I couldn’t be more excited." Barlog ended the post with two heart emojis.</p>

<p>Barlog's post doesn't specify that this is Sony Santa Monica <em>next</em> project or that it is its <em>only</em> project. Since the release of Ragnarök's free rogue-lite mode DLC, it has been quiet about what's next.</p><p>In terms of God of War, developer Bluepoint Games (primarily known for its remakes of Shadow of the Colossus and Demon's Souls) was working on a live-service game connected to the God of War franchise. That game was publicly cancelled earlier this year according to a statement Sony shared with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-16/sony-cancels-two-more-playstation-projects?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTczNzA2ODk1MywiZXhwIjoxNzM3NjczNzUzLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTUTdFWjJUMEcxS1cwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.OtpjLAX_fLRPjeIhmdZSXLhsiFNDef1RlL6IxoCIQes&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>.</p><p>Whatever this new project may be, we will apparently learn more about it later this year.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/18/god-of-war-developer-sony-santa-monica-is-working-on-a-new-technically-ambitious-ip]]></content:encoded>

    <div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> has run <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-is-battlefields-biggest-open-beta-ever-says-ea">its last open beta</a>. This, obviously, is a tragedy. How else am I meant to spend my weekends? Where else can I drive around with four loads of C4 strapped to the boot, or engage in high-flying aerial duels? Well, there's always <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a>.</p>
<p>But why go back? Well, it seems as though EA understands a widespread longing may have been on the cards with Battlefield 6's absence, and has therefore introduced a limited-time event to the older title to keep folks engaged for the next few months. A celebration of sorts for 2042 before everyone leaps off towards greener pastures.</p>
<p>This new Battlefield 2042 update - which is straight up titled the "Road to Battlefield 6" update - includes a free battle pass full of little goodies, a revamp of the Iwo Jima map, and some prizes for those looking to jump into Battlefield 6 come October. Some of those battle pass rewards I mentioned earlier carry over, making 2042 a must-play for early-onset completionists.</p>

<p>It's a clever ploy, offering permanent rewards for the new game. EA did it too for the Battlefield 6 beta, offering various cosmetics for hitting career levels or finishing challenges. It's not like the Beta needed any help, but it surely would have brought folks back for the second beta even if they likely were fulfilled on the first beta alone. Battlefield 2042 offering such rewards will inevitably push those who never played the game - or maybe touched it only briefly - back into the fray.</p><p>Is this taking advantage of people's FOMO? The voice in their heads that demands they need everything? Yeah absolutely, and as a former WoW mount collector that can be a real burden, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-the-lukewarm-reception-to-battlefield-2042-fans-seem-to-be-getting-behind-battlefield-6-as-steam-wishlist-numbers-soar">it'll also inject a lot of life into Battlefield 2042</a> in its sunset period. For people who have stuck with Battlefield 2042 through thick and thin it'll be like one last hurrah, and for Battlefield 6 refugees it'll be a cool way of passing the time.</p>
<p>It does also help that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-2042-with-humility-and-hustle-dice-might-yet-win-the-war">Battlefield 2042 is a lot better now than it used to be</a>. After years of updates, tweaks and changes, it's really come into its own as of late. While a sizable number of players who'll jump into Battlefield 2042 for its Road to Battlefield 6 event will be fair weather friends, there for a good time and not a long time, it may very well do wonders in remedying popular sentiment around the game that lingers from its troubled launch.</p>

</figure>
<p>So yeah I'll hop back into Battlefield 2042 - I too haven't really touched it since its release. I'll try out the new KFS2000, I'll squad up with some friends, and hey, maybe I will crash some helicopters into people. The Battlefield 6 rewards are nice and I'll take great joy in showing them off come October.</p><p>But honestly? I just think it's a nice curtain call for a game that'll inevitably be left largely behind when Battlefield 6 comes along. I do hope that for many people, it'll leave a fond final memory of 2042 before the game is memory holed and thrown down the same well Hardline lives in.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/towa-and-the-guardians-of-the-sacred-tree">Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree</a> shows a side of Bandai Namco that we don’t always see. Sure, this is an anime-flavoured Japan-centric roguelike brawler, but it’s one that’s priced as a smaller indie title, and it is doing things just that little bit differently. Personally, I think we could do with more of this kind of thing.</p>
<p><iframe title="Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree - Guardian Trailer 3" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D87bFNKiKS0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The village of Shinju, named after the benevolent god who watches over it, is home to Towa. A being that is neither human nor god, Towa lives as the village guardian, protecting and nurturing the inhabitants of the village. Shinju remains an idyllic haven until Magatsu arrives. Alongside an army of monstrous Magaori, Magatsu spreads his miasma across the land, poisoning and corrupting everything that lies before him.</p>


<p>Towa, with eight chosen ‘prayer children’ from the village, sets forth against the forces of evil, wielding the Sword of Ablution and the staff of Divination, both of which allow her to tackle the monsters and the corruption that lie before her.</p>
<p>That said, it’s not Towa you directly take control of. You actually control one of the Prayer Children – starting out with Rekka in our hands-on – but Towa is tethered to you, following you into battle, while you protect them from harm.</p>

<p>Combat isn’t quite as you’d expect either, with Rekka carrying two swords, each of which have a finite amount of energy. When you’ve used up the energy, the damage from that sword will halve, forcing you to swap to the other option. Each has specific qualities, and ranges, so you have to plan ahead as you face each foe. It takes some getting used to, with early encounters feeling a bit clunky as you consistently ‘break’ each sword over and over again, but you soon find the rhythm of attacks, and start to learn how to use each one effectively.</p>

<p>Besides your standard attacks, there’s also special abilities which are provided by your support character. Towa is able to cast a zone of protection that freezes enemies, or summon a giant hand to bash the bad guys with. Dodging plays an important role too, made somewhat easier by enemy attacks being displayed via glowing area-of-effect zones.</p>
<p>Defeating all the enemies in an area will drop some kind of reward, with Graces enhancing a character’s attributes, or ores being usable in crafting back at the village. These rewards get better based on your performance, and you’re given a selection to choose from so you can tailor your character through your run – or Journey as the game calls them. Graces come in different levels too, so if you’re lucky you might find an Epic move nestling amongst more ordinary ones.</p>
<p>Once you’ve made it through the opening moments, you can assemble a team of two from the eight Prayer Children. Each of them has their own look, weaponry and abilites, but one member of the team must be the Tsurugi, the main attacker, while the other becomes the Kagura, who supports them with spells. You can switch it so the Kagura stays in place, though the Tsurugi can only go a limited distance from the Kagura.</p>

<p>Playing solo sees you controlling both as a team, and you tend to find that the Kagura ultimately loses a lot of health as they’re not your primary focus, and they don’t quite dash in time with your main character. It feels as though the designers really want you to play in co-op, and fortunately there’s both local and online options to make that possible. It definitely makes the game easier, and you only have the one character to worry about.</p>
<p>As a roguelike, runs feel fairly familiar, with each area housing a small number of enemies or a boss, and collecting better abilities and more power the further you go. I like that you can see the different rewards across each route, but otherwise this remains about making yourself as powerful as possible, while collecting permanent upgrades for further runs.</p>
<p>There’s plenty to keep you busy outside of the Journeys when you return to the village. Forging new swords is a key task, and it presents you with a minigame that lets you design and customise your own blade. It’s a little unclear what you’re doing – it should have a tutorial for all of the sections the first time you do it – but once you’ve got the hang of it, it’s an intriguing task. Swords can be equipped by all characters so that removes any issues with swapping between them, but upgrades are limited, so you will need to focus on your favourites from the roster and their upgrade trees ahead of everyone else.</p>

<p>There’s some interesting differences between the in-game visuals and the artwork from the cutscenes. Where the in-game action is an attractive, isometric-view anime battler, the cutscenes boast traditonal Japanese art, evoking a more realistic and human approach. There’s then further comic-like art during the fully-voiced character conversations, and while all of them look fantastic in their own way, there’s some visual dissonance to the way that each character is perceived. Towa in particular is pictured in the cutscenes as a powerful goddess, in traditional Japanese garb, while the in-game version of her comes across as a mildly annoying traditional anime girl. It doesn’t detract from the action, but it’s an odd choice.<br>
That said, I really like the design of the eight Prayer Children, especially the adorably huge canine Bampuku who makes a great companion for the Carp-like Nishiki.</p>
<p>Towa and the Gaurdians of the Sacred Tree makes a good first impression, and the giant boss characters you face along the way add a real sense of scale to the action. The story and characters are interesting, and the action sufficiently unique, to immediately draw you in and, with the game launching on 18th September, I’m looking forward to spending more time with them through the coming weeks.</p>

No release date or window has been shared, but we'll be getting an official announcement at Gamescom 2025, which kicks off tomorrow (19th August).</p>
<p>And, yes, the wording is just 'Nintendo" an not Switch or Switch 2, so we have no idea if the game is coming to one or both consoles. If we had to guess, it's <em>probably</em> aiming for Switch 2, but that's just speculation.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067yxhjmq&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Shenmue III Enhanced is exactly what it sounds like — an upgraded version of the long-awaited 2019 Shenmue sequel created by former Sega legend Yu Suzuki. This version will bring upgraded graphics, gameplay tweaks, and improvements to character interactions.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of all the upgrades:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>- Enhanced Graphics &amp; Performance</strong> – Sharper textures, richer details, faster load times, and smoother gameplay.<br>
<strong>-</strong> <strong>4K Texture Uplift</strong> – Refined, more detailed environments and characters.<br>
<strong>- DLSS/FSR Support</strong> – High-quality upscaling without sacrificing performance (supported platforms only).<strong><br>
-</strong> <strong>Increased NPC Density</strong> – The city village Niaowu feels more alive with more characters populating the streets.<br>
<strong>-</strong> <strong>Classic Camera Mode</strong> – An optional camera perspective inspired by <em>Shenmue I &amp; II</em>, alongside the modern view.<br>
<strong>-</strong> <strong>Gameplay Tweaks</strong> – Optional stamina system adjustments, health restoration before fights, and reduced money barriers for smoother progression.<br>
<strong>-</strong> <strong>Improved Interactions</strong> – Cutscene and conversation skip options, expanded QTE timing window for more accessible gameplay.<br>
<strong>-</strong> <strong>Menu &amp; UX Enhancements</strong> – Streamlined navigation and helpful purchase alerts.<br>
<strong>-</strong> <strong>Optionality First</strong> – All major changes can be toggled to preserve the original experience for purists.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally announced at E3 2015 as a Kickstarter project, Shenmue III released to mixed reviews four years later on; some loved that it stayed faithful to the Dreamcast originals, while others were frustrated with the lack of changes and the story. Our sister site Push Square rather enjoyed it for what it is, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps4/shenmue_iii">scoring the game a 7/10</a>.</p>
<p>ININ Games has been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/shenmue-iii-on-switch-2-publishers-latest-tease-suggests-it-might-be-happening">teasing this announcement for some time</a>, so we're glad the wait is over! Now, to see what it looks like at Gamescom, then.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In what feels like the greatest period of turmoil for <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-ceo-blames-star-wars-outlaws-failure-on-the-ip-says-no-game-can-be-supported-forever/">Ubisoft</a> in the company's history, Assassin's Creed Shadows continues to be the bright spark of life that the company needs, as a new report from <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/assassins-creed-shadows-is-the-no1">The Game Business</a> (backed by numbers from Europe's <a href="https://www.gamesalesdata.com/login">Game Sales Data</a> firm) names it the best-selling new game in Europe in 2025 so far.</p>



<p>To clarify, Shadows is, at the time of this writing, the best-selling PC and console title in Europe of all the games released in 2025. It's not the best-selling game overall, since that marker unsurprisingly goes to last year's EA Sports FC 25, which will likely hold the title until <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-fc-26-gameplay-deep-dive/">EA Sports FC 26</a> next month. But as of right now, Assassin's Creed Shadows stands above games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-drive-another-record-year-for-capcom/">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-has-sold-2-million-units-in-2-weeks/">Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-was-one-of-may-2025s-top-5-games-by-revenue-according-to-newzoo-while-oblivion-remastered-remains-firm-in-the-top-20-for-revenue-and-mau/">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-delivered-outstanding-revenue-performance-is-a-benchmark-for-successful-remasters-says-newzoo/">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>, and every other major release you can think of from this year so far.</p>



<p>In fact, according to GSD figures, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-says-split-fiction-had-hugely-successful-launch-with-almost-4-million-copies-sold/">Split-Fiction</a> is the only game to get close to Shadows as far as 2025 releases are concerned. The next-closest is Monster Hunter Wilds, and then <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-early-digital-sales-toby-fox-deltarune/">Mario Kart World</a>, which is followed by Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, Oblivion Remastered, and Nightreign after that. Out of the top-20 best-selling games in Europe for 2025 so far, including games released last year and older, Split-Fiction, Wilds, World, Deliverance II, Oblivion Remastered, Nightreign, and Shadows are the only seven games released in 2025 to make the list.</p>



<p>Other notable entries on the list not released in 2025 are <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-battlefront-ii-developers-would-like-to-get-the-gang-back-together-for-battlefront-iii/">Star Wars Battlefront II</a>, which is having an incredible year despite being nearly eight years old at this point, and Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Siege, which is enjoying a boost from Ubisoft revamping it with <a href="https://wccftech.com/rainbow-six-siege-x-is-out-now-brings-free-access-to-the-game/">Rainbow Six Siege X.</a></p>



<p>Here's the full list of the top-20 best-selling games in Europe on PC and consoles according to GSD, per The Game Business: </p>



<ol>
<li>EA Sports FC 25</li>



<li>Assassin's Creed Shadows</li>



<li>Grand Theft Auto V</li>



<li>Red Dead Redemption 2</li>



<li>Hogwarts Legacy</li>



<li>Split-Fiction</li>



<li>Monster Hunter Wilds</li>



<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</li>



<li>Mario Kart World</li>



<li>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</li>



<li>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</li>



<li>Star Wars Battlefront II</li>



<li>Elden Ring: Nightreign</li>



<li>It Takes Two</li>



<li>Grand Theft Auto Online</li>



<li>NBA 2K25</li>



<li>F1 25</li>



<li>Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Siege</li>



<li>Mario Kart 8: Deluxe</li>



<li>Battlefield 1</li>
</ol>



<p>Of course, it's worth remembering that this is just what the sales charts for Europe's PC and console videogame releases look like so far. Those are the key words here, because by the end of this year, it's doubtful that Shadows will be able to hold onto that top spot for 2025 releases. Not just because EA Sports FC 26 is on the horizon, but because FC 26 is coming, and this year's new Call of Duty, and Battlefield 6, and Borderlands 4, and Ghost of Yotei, and Pokemon Legends Z-A, and The Outer Worlds 2 - and those are just some of the big autumn-to-winter-timed games we know about that have release dates.</p>



<p>We'll see what this top-20 list looks like in a few months' time. But for now, Ubisoft can enjoy its moment at the top.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/shenmue-iii-enhanced-wants-to-be-the-definitive-shenmue-iii-experience.1272726/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Shenmue&nbsp;</em>auteur Yu Suzuki and his studio Ys Net have announced&nbsp;<em>Shenmue III Enhanced</em>, a...well...enhanced re-release of&nbsp;<em>Shenmue III&nbsp;</em>that brings visual and gameplay improvements aplenty.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/shenmue-iii-enhanced-announced-for-ps5-xbox-series-nintendo-and-pc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gematsu</a>,&nbsp;<em>Shenmue III Enhanced&nbsp;</em>is slated for release on PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and "Nintendo" at some point in the future. No release date was revealed, and it's not specified whether "Nintendo" refers to both Switch 2 and the original Switch or just one of the two.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Shenmue III Enhanced&nbsp;</em>will bring improved visuals and performance, complete with 4K textures, support for DLSS and FSR on PC, and increased NPC density to help Niaowu feel "more alive with more characters populating the streets".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shenmue-iii-enhanced-edition-landscape.jpg?itok=UUdDARBq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shenmue-iii-enhanced-edition-landscape.jpg?itok=g0Xn-Hev 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Shenmue III&nbsp;</em>is getting a re-release in future, and it'll bring improvements galore.</figcaption></figure><p>It's not just the visuals getting some love, though. Ys Net is also promising gameplay tweaks, including a new "classic" camera mode that brings&nbsp;<em>Shenmue III</em>'s gameplay perspective closer to that of its predecessors.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to stamina system adjustments, Ryo's health being restored before fights, and "reduced money barriers for smoother progression", as well as the opportunity to skip certain cutscenes and conversations.</p>

<p>All of the gameplay improvements promised by&nbsp;<em>Shenmue III&nbsp;</em>can be switched off if you want the original gameplay experience, though, so if you just want to enjoy the game with its new and improved visuals, you can do that as well.</p>

<p>If you missed out on&nbsp;<em>Shenmue III&nbsp;</em>the first time, it's the long-awaited sequel to 2001's&nbsp;<em>Shenmue II</em>. Launching <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shenmue-iii-release-date-delayed-three-months-to-november" rel="nofollow">eighteen years after that game</a>, it continues the story of protagonist Ryo Hazuki, who's on the hunt for his father's murderer.</p>




<p>Many of&nbsp;<em>Shenmue III Enhanced</em>'s additions have seemingly been introduced to combat much of the criticism of the original game, including its slow pace, gated money grinds, and frustrating combat.</p>

<p>If you want to check out&nbsp;<em>Shenmue III&nbsp;</em>before the enhanced version launches, you can do so right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/878670/Shenmue_III/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP2047-CUSA12289_00-SHENMUEIII0000US" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 4</a>.

              <p><span>This weekend, the 2025 </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-plush-scalper-reseller-world-championships-2000618087"><span>Pokémon World Championships</span></a><span> were held in Anaheim. Most of the event was dedicated to the franchise’s multiple competitive scenes across video games, the card game, and fans </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-world-championship-merchandise-scalper-reseller-2000617744"><span>fighting scalpers for exclusive merchandise</span></a><span>, but the tournament’s closing ceremony also included some new announcements you might’ve missed if you didn’t stay up late to catch the livestream. If you missed the mini-Pokémon Presents showcase, here’s everything The Pokémon Company announced:</span></p>  <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Eternatus Emerges | Pokémon GO" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4xN0zU-uMCs?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>Kicking things off was a quick trailer for </span><i><span>Pokémon Go</span></i><span>. Eternatus, one of the legendary Pokémon from the Galar region, is the centerpiece of Pokémon Go Fest 2025’s Max Finale, taking place on August 23 and 24. Players at Worlds were able to get Eternatus early, as if those of us who couldn’t make it to Anaheim needed more reasons to feel FOMO.</span></p> <h2><b><i>Pokémon TCG Pocket</i></b></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Pokémon TCG Pocket | Mega Evolution is coming this fall!" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6vS2fnu49pw?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>  <p><span>Next up is </span><i><span>Pokémon TCG Pocket</span></i><span>, which is getting new Mega Evolution cards later this fall.

First up, Sinnoh water starter Emploeon will join the roster on September 19, followed by Dhelmise, who has a grappler kit that lets it latch onto enemies and get in close. Vaporeon will come sometime after, bringing Unite’s Eeveelution count to six. All that’s left are Jolteon and Flareon, then all the current versions of Eevee’s evolution line will have joined the roster.</span></p> <h2><b><i>Pokémon Trading Card Game</i></b></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Pokémon Worlds | TCG | New Mega Evolution Pokémon ex Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9uj-A1J_rf0?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>Outside of the mobile app, the regular </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> TCG is also featuring Mega Evolutions pretty heavily next year.

The game will feature a four-player multiplayer mode in which players pit their parties against one another and earn points for each Pokémon they defeat within the three-minute time limit. According to </span><a href="https://legends.pokemon.com/en-us/news/battle-with-trainers"><span>the game’s official website</span></a><span>, these matches can be played casually with friends or in a ranked mode.</span></p>

Tickets go on sale on September 17. The teaser trailer was light on details, but the official Pokémon website says XP will feature “panels, unique workshops, special guests, exclusive merchandise, and so much more.”</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The 2026 Street Fighter 6 movie is shaping up nicely. Cody Rhodes has been touted as one of the big-name stars set to light up the Street Fighter stage, and while it’s not official, we think we’ve gotten an idea of how Guile could look, presumably, with Cody playing (and looking) the part.</p>



<p>It’s not uncommon for WWE superstars to transition from the hallowed grounds of the squared circle to the silver screen. The likes of Hulk Hogan, Andre the Giant, and Rowdy Roddy Piper famously paved the way. Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson was the one to make the complete leap from professional wrestler to actor.</p>



<p>Others have followed suit—such as John Cena—and the new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/street-fighter-movie-has-reportedly-lined-up-chun-li-balrog-actors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Street Fighter</a> movie could catapult Cody Rhodes into greater superstardom.</p>



<h2 id="h-first-cody-rhodes-teaser-as-guile-for-2026-street-fighter-movie">First Cody Rhodes Teaser as Guile For 2026 Street Fighter Movie</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Acting has more than one royal family. Credit to 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p>Actor and comedian <a href="https://www.instagram.com/andrewschulz/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Andrew Schulz</a> is playing Dan in the Street Fighter movie. They recently took to their personal Instagram page to share a story showing the shadow of someone sporting an iconic hairstyle—Guile from Street Fighter.</p>



<p>Guile’s inverted shaven style is equal parts bizarre and legendary. I’ve never tried to replicate it, and it’s not something I’m going to try—although it’s nothing a few cans of hairspray couldn’t sort.</p>



<p>Again, we’ve not had official confirmation that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/street-fighter-movie-casts-m-bison-and-eyes-wwes-cody-rhodes-for-guile/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cody Rhodes is playing Guile</a>. Eagle-eyed fans can infer this to be the case if they look at the song mentioned in the IG story. If you didn’t know, Kingdom by Downstait is Rhodes’ famous theme song he’s used for years. Put 2 and 2 together, and I think we get the picture.</p>



<div><article><p><span>A teaser of Cody Rhodes as Guile on the set of the Street Fighter movie 👀

<p>The Street Fighter Movie cast also features more rumors and confirmed names, including Jason Momoa, 50 Cent, and fellow WWE star Roman Reigns.</p>



<p>Will the Street Fighter movie be a knockout? Or will it be a swing and a miss? Let me know through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

    <p><em>Daggerfall </em>certainly has '90s DOS RPG charm in spades.

<p>Ostensibly, C:\ArsGames is to some extent about actually driving a few game purchases, but in reality it's mostly an excuse for me and my colleagues to wax nostalgic about the games that were formative for us. Case in point: This entry in our ongoing series with GOG is about a game that's completely free. I think Ars can withstand this tiny revenue shortfall for the sake of peak nostalgia!</p>
<p>There are a couple of reasons I chose <a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8984087-15232592?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fthe_elder_scrolls_chapter_ii_daggerfall"><em>The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall</em></a> this time around: its co-creator, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/07/julian-lefay-the-father-of-the-elder-scrolls-has-passed-away-at-59/">Julian LeFay, recently passed away</a>, so it seemed timely. Also, it was one of the defining games of my youth—one I have continued to revisit now and then.</p>
<p>But it's also interesting because of where its developer, Bethesda—a studio people both love and hate—is at today. Going back to <em>Daggerfall</em>, we find a game that shows off so much of what we've lost from the bygone era of '90s PC gaming, but also one that makes it abundantly clear why the industry left those sensibilities behind.</p>
<p>I'll spoil the conclusion though: I still love this game. It's profoundly not for everybody, but it's definitely for me.</p>
<h2>The kids don’t get it</h2>
<p>OK, so we've established that I love <em>Daggerfall</em>. Knowing Ars Technica's readership, some of you probably do too. So who, exactly, doesn't like it?</p>
<p>Just search YouTube and you'll find a bunch of videos with titles like:</p>
<ul>
<li>"<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdaxG_bFASk&amp;pp=ygUQdHJpZWQgZGFnZ2VyZmFsbA%3D%3D">I FORCED myself to play Daggerfall in 2025</a>"</li>
<li>"<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7NejhzVz3M&amp;t=537s&amp;pp=ygUQdHJpZWQgZGFnZ2VyZmFsbA%3D%3D">Skyrim Player Tries Daggerfall (It Goes Terribly)</a>"</li>
<li>"<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPZ0nYJM4XM&amp;pp=ygUQdHJpZWQgZGFnZ2VyZmFsbA%3D%3D">I really tried. But I can't play Daggerfall anymore.</a>"</li>
</ul>
<p>Ouch. That's rough. Granted, one of those isn't actually negative if you sit through the video, but it still acknowledges that it's not easily accessible for everyone.</p>
<p>Look, I get it.&nbsp;<em>Daggerfall</em> hails from an era when "game design" primarily meant "experiment with programming techniques to come up with cool, unproven stuff no one's seen before" rather than "meticulously craft a conveyor belt of nonstop fun via proven formulae."</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Those experiments are all exciting and interesting, and it's refreshing to go back to an RPG from this era that was willing to try some wild ideas and deep systems, as opposed to most (not all!) RPGs today, which seem to have the same basic format with talent trees and so on.</p>
<p>I love that <em>Daggerfall</em> includes odd mechanics that you don't often see in RPGs, like climbing. I like its vast world and accurate representation of most wilderness as meaningless liminal space. I think its opaque and sometimes maddening faction reputation systems are fascinating. Its character progression system is detailed and interesting.</p>

      I know this is already what the game is best known for, but I'd be remiss if I didn't note that the scope of the game's map is <em>staggering</em>.

<p>For me, the most frustrating aspect to <em>Daggerfall</em> is not its jazzy mechanics. It's the mechanics that aren't explained at all.</p>
<p>For example, in the playthrough I started to refresh my memory for this article, I spent a couple of hours doing quests in Wayrest, one of the most prominent cities in the game. Everything seemed to be fine as I rode my horse around town helping people out, training my skills, and buying new gear. But then a guard ran up to me and arrested me for assault. Who did I assault? I had no idea, but I pled guilty in order to get a softer sentence, even though I was pretty sure I wasn't <em>actually</em> guilty.</p>
<p>I wrote that off as a fluke, but then it happened again: assault. And a third time, again assault. I couldn't fathom why I kept getting arrested.</p>
<p>To DuckDuckGo I went for a quick Internet search to see if anyone else was having this problem. It was pretty common, and the cause was something I never would have imagined: I had been riding my horse around the town, galloping for speed to complete quests faster. It turns out that galloping too close to wandering NPCs in the street registers as assault, with penalties of up to a month in prison and hefty fines.</p>

<p>There was no feedback about this when it was happening. I didn't even know I was doing it. I don't specifically remember having this problem back in the '90s, but it seems likely I did, and I must have just shrugged it off, because back then I would have had no way of figuring out what was going on.</p>
<p>I get why this sort of thing is a big barrier to new players, but I also think some of the YouTubers I watched applied a double standard. One complained that the game doesn't explain itself, but then in the same video extolled the virtues of <em>Minecraft</em>—a game that explains itself even less.</p>

      Save early and save often. That was ingrained in me by '90s gaming. Watching some of the YouTubers take this game on, it stressed me out how little they saved.

<p>It may be that we're more patient with learning games when we're kids. I played <em>Daggerfall</em> as a kid (well, a young teenager) so I'm relatively chill about its opaqueness and idiosyncrasies. That YouTuber played <em>Minecraft</em> as a kid, so that's the one he's willing to gloss over.</p>
<p>If you're willing to spend a lot of time on wikis (just like with <em>Minecraft</em>) then <em>Daggerfall</em> as a lot to offer to those who are patient. I often feel the most engaging games in the long run are ones that have a steeper learning curve up front.</p>
<h2>The unspoken spiritual successor</h2>
<p>Of course, it's not just the learning curve or opaque mechanics that are an issue for many players. A lot of people don't like <em>Daggerfall</em>'s procedurally generated world and quests—especially players who are used to <em>Skyrim</em>'s more hand-crafted environments and quest lines.</p>
<p>Yes, <em>Skyrim</em> has "Radiant Quests," which resemble <em>Daggerfall</em>'s. But with the exception of a relatively small number of main story missions, <em>Daggerfall</em> only has what <em>Skyrim</em> calls Radiant quests.</p>
<p>A loose modern analogue to that is <em>Elite Dangerous</em>, which has no meaningful story content at all. Some people might be more comfortable calling that a simulation than a game.</p>
<p>But there's another modern space title that has some strong resemblances to <em>Daggerfall</em>: Bethesda's own <em>Starfield</em>. As with <em>Daggerfall</em>, <em>Starfield</em> has a small cohort of obsessive fans amidst a much larger crowd that thinks it's just terrible.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>When people bought <em>Starfield</em>, they were expecting <em>Skyrim</em> in space. I believe that one of the reasons a lot of people were disappointed was that they actually got <em>Daggerfall</em> in space, and that's a very different experience.</p>
<p>Like <em>Daggerfall</em> and <em>Elite Dangerous</em>, <em>Starfield</em> not only accepts but even centers the notion that most of the environments are filled with, well, not a whole lot. It accurately reflects what space or wilderness actually are and makes much of the game a slow-paced mood piece rather than a constant dopamine dispenser.</p>

<p>Most of <em>Starfield</em>'s dungeons are randomized. It's more about taking in the vibes and playing with the systems than it is about following an authored narrative—though <em>Starfield</em> does have an authored narrative. (It's just not the game's strongest suit, so it explains why people who are looking for that aren't big fans.)</p>
<p>Granted, there's little crossover between the original <em>Daggerfall</em> team and the folks who made <em>Starfield</em>. <em>Daggerfall</em> was pre-Todd Howard-as-creative-director and pre-Emil Pagliarulo, the two main creative leaders at Bethesda Game Studios since the <em>Morrowind</em> days.</p>
<p>But that's why it's all the more surprising that <em>Starfield</em> is, at best, a hybrid of the sensibilities of <em>Daggerfall</em> and <em>Skyrim</em>. Given those YouTubers trying and failing to play <em>Daggerfall</em> in 2025, it's no wonder that <em>Starfield</em> didn't land for a lot of people.</p>
<p>(I quite like it, personally, but I also like <em>Daggerfall</em>, so I'm either a masochist, old and archaic, or just plain wrong, depending on who you ask.)</p>

<h2>A pure expression of one of gaming’s oldest dreams</h2>
<p>There has long been a recurring dream in PC gaming of one super game that would allow you to fully live out a particular fantasy life of your choosing. Whether it was intended by developers, promised in marketing, or just in hopeful players' heads, there's an appeal to the idea of living an alternate existence in a sophisticated simulated world that's so immersive in its escapism that you reliably forget your real life for hours on end. The idea is "I want to be a space trader," or "I want to be a wandering fantasy adventurer," and the game gives you a toolkit that's both wide and deep to experience that entirely on your own terms.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

<p>A lot of times, the titles that went for this on some level seemed more like simulations than games or stories. They were less consistently fun than other games, but they were often profoundly ambitious.</p>
<p>Since they were all about helping a player live out something in their imaginations, they were also prone to viscerally negative reactions at launch from people who had personal expectations that didn't map to the reality of what a game can actually do or chooses to focus on. (This continues today: look at the reactions to <em>No Man's Sky</em>, <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, and yes, <em>Starfield</em>.)</p>
<p><em>Daggerfall</em> is one of those games. It is not for everybody. But for that niche group of players who are up for something jazzy and simulation-y that takes risks to let them live an alternate fantasy life that's as much in their head canon as on the screen, it's one of the best games of all time.</p>
<p>I strongly believe it's important to judge a game (or any other art or media) more on whether it achieves what it's <em>going for</em> than whether it meets whatever external expectations you might bring to it. If you agree, then that puts <em>Daggerfall</em> in a better position than if you have a more prescriptive attitude about game design.</p>
<p>The fidelity expectations of modern AAA titles and accompanying scope and cost make the kind of experimental, life-sim focus of a game like <em>Daggerfall</em> all but impossible to pursue now, but I miss it. Personally, I'll usually take a deeply flawed work of sheer ambition over a retread of proven ideas I've already experienced before, no matter how skillfully crafted and consistently fun the latter is.</p>
<p>Yeah, I enjoy a good formula game now and then; my point was exactly that when I <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/assassins-creed-shadows-is-the-dad-rock-of-video-games-and-i-love-it/">wrote about <em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em></a> a few months ago. But as much as I have enjoyed&nbsp;<em>Shadows</em>, it won't stick with me for 30 years.&nbsp;<em>Daggerfall</em> has, and revisiting it this week, I can see that's not purely because of nostalgia. It represents a maximalist philosophy of game design I feel is sorely underrepresented in today's market.</p>

      The Unity version of <em>Daggerfall</em> installs on top of a normal DOS installation, and it makes the game much, much more playable in 2025, with additions like long view distances.
