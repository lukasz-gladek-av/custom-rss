		<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is an inherently quite intimidating game. A lot of that is built off the reputation of the original, and much like the first game, it’s as close as we can really get to a medieval Europe simulator, albeit with the kind of fairytale character arc as you go from being a peasant to holding a fairly significant and influential position alongside those of noble blood. Your path is up to you, whether you play as a wholly honest and loyal subject, or rob and steal your way through the world to amass wealth, but whatever your choice here, it’s going to be a challenge.</p>
<p>In my time with the game so far, I have spent two hours being killed by three bandits time and again because one of them was in plate armour. I was convinced I almost had him and his two friends, but in actual fact was barely damaging him at all with my pathetic little hunting sword. These are randomly occurring bandits who just happened to appear on the way of my quest objective – they don’t even have real names. Like I said, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</a> is as intimidating as its name is odd.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 Final Preview on PS5 Pro –&nbsp;Use mace on bandits in this medieval sim" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pCblr7pQt0A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The game puts you back into Henry’s shoes, picking up after the events of the first game as he and Sir Hans Capon travel to deliver a letter of peace and alliance to Trosky Castle. Naturally, things go awry quite quickly and you lose the message, your armour, your weapons, and all of the other men in Sir Hans’ retinue. Without all your fancy looking armour, you can’t get into the castle to see the Lord and if you could, you’ve lost the official letter anyway. Retreating to the village of Troskowitz, you’re separated from Hans after falling out over his classic spoilt rich brat breakdown, leaving you to get into contact with the Lord of Trosky Castle all by yourself. That’s trickier than it already sounds when he rides off into the distance with a retinue.</p>
<p>Wearing your beggar’s clothes, you’ll have a hard time getting much done, but I was able to find a job at a blacksmith who also gave me somewhere to sleep so I could save my game without drinking Saviour Schnapps. I quickly set about trying to find my lost dog, Mutt, and found myself tumbling through a comedy of errors. First I wandered around the area he was supposed to be and was torn to pieces by wolves in the pitch black of night, then I did some stuff that eventually led to me finding out that Mutt was, in fact, likely with those wolves and I just didn’t notice whilst they were killing me.</p>

<p>Ten hours of game later, I went back to this place to face off against these wolves, better armoured, weaponed, and skilled, only for the aforementioned three bandits, only able to defeat the one in plate armour after two hours of repeated deaths once I gave up and left to get a nice big mace that. I’ll soon use for my sweet revenge and then finally get my dog back.</p>

<p>I don’t even have a horse yet, unless you count the one I stole after I saw its owner get murdered by a bandit. Obviously I avenged his death and took his horse as a postmortem payment, but even the horse fence wanted more than a thousand gold to make the horse be summonable and not considered itself stolen – horses, as we all know, are very litigious and want to see paperwork in triplicate before. Instead I sold the horse for 300 Groschen and went back to walking everywhere for the time being.</p>
<p>Thankfully, KCD2 is a very, very good looking game when it isn’t night time and you can actually see. Even facial expressions are particularly detailed, though more so with Henry. There are moments in this game where you could swear that the landscape you’re looking at is real. It’s gorgeous enough that just strolling through nature is quite pleasant. Until the bandits attack, obviously.</p>

<p>The fact that many of these eccentricities can’t be found in other games due to fear of narrowing its target audience is part of the attraction here. This is a grown up game that won’t really sugarcoat your failures or streamline things to make it easier for you. It instead feels like an immersive sim of medieval Europe. If you’re not going to take that on board and engage with that idea, you’re going to struggle constantly, but if that’s your thing and you enjoy existing in a convincing rendition of the real world, this is probably going to be one of the best games out there for your tastes.</p>
<p>There’s still some minor quirks that we hope are addressed with a patch in time for launch – KCD2 went gold in early December, and we’ve been provided with a review build roughly a month before release, so there’s plenty time for a further polish update. The aspect that most affects the believability of the world is how inconsistently characters will react to you. They’ll often vacillating between being generally friendly and angry at your mere presence between interactions, or sometimes even in the same conversation.</p>
<div id="attachment_455908"><p id="caption-attachment-455908">This was literally 2 minutes after he hired me…</p></div>
<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 seems like an uncompromising marvel. It’s slavishly devoted to realism and accuracy in a way that likely makes it a very niche game, as working out how to do things can be difficult and requires real attention and care. Then again, that was exactly what drew millions to the first game, and as those fans will attest, it’s also incredibly rewarding. The first time I finished a quest that involved combat without it feeling like too much trouble I physically punched the air in celebration, and when I finally reached the blacksmith, got a job, and forged myself a new sword I was grinning from ear to ear. This is a unique game that turns being a peasant in medieval times into an enjoyable experience. Ironically, perhaps.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lords-of-the-fallen-studio-ci-games-will-not-integrate-dei-elements-in-their-games-to-maximizing-player-enjoyment-and-commercial-success.1079148/</guid>

			<p>The Lords of the Fallen studio CI Games will not integrate DEI elements in their games to maximize player enjoyment and commercial success after having observed the high commercial risk these elements can present.</p>
<p>During a recent <a href="https://strefainwestorow.pl/czaty-inwestorskie/20250108/ci-games-marek-tyminski">investor chat</a>, the studio was asked about their stance on DEI in gaming. Global Marketing Director Ryan Hill confirmed that the studio remains committed to producing player-first video games that prioritize excellent user experience with compelling themes and characters created specifically for <em>"core and adjacent audiences"</em>. While some recent video games have taken the opportunity to implement <em>"social and political agendas"</em> within their experiences, Hill continued, the lower than expected commercial performance of some of these games shows that many players do not appreciate these elements. As such, the studio will continue to develop experiences that maximize player enjoyment and commercial success.</p>
<p>In the same investor chat, Lords of the Fallen studio CI Games talked about what's <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-will-continue-to-receive-meaningful-updates-up-to-version-2-0-sequels-playtesting-to-take-place-this-year/">next for the game and the franchise as a whole</a>, confirming the game released in 2023 will continue to receive updates up to version 2.0. Development of the sequel is also proceeding, and extensive play testing will be conducted in 2025.</p>
<p>Lords of the Fallen is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. You can learn more about the game, which has been <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-update-1-7-improves-combat-fluidity-adds-npc-summons/">improved</a> quite a bit since its release, in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lords-of-the-fallen-frustration-your-side/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Lords of the Fallen boasts impressive visuals and an interesting story for a soulslike, but unfortunately, that's where the praise ends. Despite functional gameplay and a well-designed world, the experience is marred by frustrating combat mechanics, subpar enemy placement, and an overall lack of polish, making it one of the most frustrating soulslikes ever released.</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-rivals-clamps-down-on-mods-with-season-1s-arrival.1079145/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-modding-clampdown<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>developer NetEase appears to have clamped down on the use of skin mods within the game in its latest update, effectively banning users from changing characters' skins with mods outright.</p>

<p>Per an IGN <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-season-1-update-appears-to-have-disabled-mods-much-to-the-dismay-of-fans-of-custom-skins" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, the latest season of the game has added a process called "asset hash checking" to&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>, which is essentially a way for the game to check whether assets are legit or not.</p>

<p>Naturally, this means that any unauthorized user mods, such as the one that turns Iron Man into&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/marvelrivals/mods/105" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dragon Ball</em>'s Vegeta</a> or the one that gives Guardian of the Galaxy Mantis a <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/marvelrivals/mods/435" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">decidedly goth bent</a>, are no longer valid as far as&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>is concerned.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-rivals-modding-clampdown-mantis.jpg?itok=RG2Ln1V5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-rivals-modding-clampdown-mantis.jpg?itok=Yyq4HoS- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sorry, modders. Your&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>Mantis goth mod won't work anymore. Image courtesy of svanax's mod on Nexus Mods.</figcaption></figure><p>As IGN points out, modding has always been against&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>' terms of service, and NetEase itself has warned players against using mods to change their skins or do anything else unauthorized within the game.</p>

<p>In a statement to IGN, NetEase says it doesn't recommend modifying game files, because doing so "carries the risk of getting banned". It doesn't seem to provide any official confirmation that asset hash checking has been added.</p>

<p>It is, of course, entirely possible that enterprising modders (and is there any other kind?) will find a way around this latest setback. For the time being, however, you'll have to shelve your&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>mods if you don't want to get banned.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>is, it's a multiplayer hero shooter developed by Chinese studio NetEase and heavily inspired by the likes of&nbsp;<em>Overwatch</em>.</p>




<p>Revealed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-announced" rel="nofollow">in March last year</a>, the free-to-play game was released in December, going on to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-10m" rel="nofollow">hit 10 million players within a 72-hour period</a>. Of course, it's free-to-play, so many of those players may not be repeat customers, but it's still an impressive number.</p>

Stevenson was a highlight of the show’s first season, presenting a noble but twisted former Jedi warrior who had turned Sith mercenary after surviving Order 66, the directive which killed most of the rest of Jedi order in the prequel trilogy. He clashes with Ahsoka in his hunt for a map that would lead him to the banished mastermind Grand Admiral Thrawn, providing a worthy and charismatic foil for her principles and worldviews in the process. </p><p>Tragically, Stevenson passed away from illness just prior to season 1 airing, leaving questions as to who would carry on the pivotal role heading into season 2. McCann, who became one of <em>Game of Thrones</em>’ emotional lynchpins across the hit HBO show’s eight seasons, seems like a natural choice to step into the character’s conflicted shoes. After all, he spent most of his time as The Hound being a noble-hearted asshole who was easy to root for even when he was being terrible. </p><p>It’s not clear when McCann, who recently appeared as head of the Praetorian guard in <em>Gladiator 2</em>, will join the rest of the cast in filming season 2.

<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 has been a long time in the making. It has been almost seven years since the release of the first game, pushed to market following a Kickstarter campaign that raised $1.3 million in just one month. On February 4, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 will be released, and I’ve been lucky enough to piece together a preview of the game.</p>



<p>I’m a huge fan of the first title, which was steeped in historical accuracy, featured gruelling mechanics, and had an authentic story that left you feeling immersed and challenged in equal amounts. All that and more awaits you in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.</p>



<p>Here’s my full preview – it’s an exploration of a cinematic masterpiece in progress.</p>



<p>If you’d prefer, you can watch the full preview in video format:</p>

<hr>



<h2 id="h-enter-the-world">Enter the World</h2>



<p>I can’t stress how immersive I’m already finding Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 to be. With a surround-sound headset, I’m traipsing through summertime forests and fields, hearing the leaves and brush crunch under my feet while birds twitter above me in the canopy. The light’s rays pierce the branches, splashing a burst against a nearby stag, who catches my scent and scarpers through the trees.</p>



<p>Perhaps I’ll hunt later.</p>



<p>In the next moment, I’m on a beaten path flanked by a twinkling stream, which would be idyllic if I wasn’t being held up by cutthroats. They demand my Groschen; I simply plead with them to leave me alone, for I have nothing.</p>



<p>They don’t care, and in a flash, I’m on my back.</p>



<p>After a reload, I’m in a nearby village, watching a fight break out between two shopkeepers, for whatever reason. The townspeople gather to watch the spectacle as I turn tail and walk down the path, avoiding making eye contact because I’m not familiar with the residents and they are inherently mistrusting of me because of a recent tavern brawl.</p>



<p>That’s how granular Warhorse Studios has made Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.</p>



<p>From the reputation system to how the AI treats items you’ve dropped, and from manually smithing a sword step-by-step to needing to dry herbs and smoke meat to preserve everything, the finest details and all the most monumental moments alike have been considered by the studio in this awe-inspiring game.</p>



<p>This is just the beginning.</p>



<h2 id="h-henry-returns">Henry Returns</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Henry of Skalitz (Tom McKay) is one of my favourite game characters of all time. His ascendance in the first game was nothing short of memorable, with his rags-to-riches story capturing perfectly the true grit of a survivor hellbent on turning around his ill fortune.</p>



<p>Henry returns in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, flanked by Sir Hans Capon (Luke Dale), his trusty companion – a brash, cocky counterpart with a sense of swagger as large as the fortune that sits in his family’s coffers.</p>



<p><em>Audentes fortuna iuvat</em>, and all that.</p>



<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 sees our troubled duo land in hot water within a few minutes of the game’s opening sequences, left for dead after a skirmish and a near-naked chase through the night. The game’s deeply cinematic introduction left my mouth agape – everything from the soundtrack to the way the camera pans over medieval vistas blew my hair back right off the bat.</p>



<p>Immediately, McKay and Dale deliver stellar performances, perfectly representing the chemistry they’ve built up both on- and off-screen over the years. There’s humour, there’s intensity, and for the first three or four hours, there’s… Well, the typical tutorial missions you’d expect from a game like this – but it’s all <strong>great</strong>.</p>



<p>If you’ve never even heard of Kingdom Come Deliverance, you’ll enter the second game unsure of what to expect, but after a few hours settling into the ambitious open-world RPG, you’ll be chomping at the bit to explore, grow as a character, and pursue the winding, branching story.</p>



<h2 id="h-evolution-at-its-finest">Evolution at its Finest</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>The first Kingdom Come Deliverance game was a marvel – but it was rough around the edges at times. It felt a little sluggish, there were a fair few bugs to deal with, and occasionally, it felt a bit <strong>too </strong>challenging. It’s not a game that holds your hand, but sometimes the difficulty level felt a bit too punishing for the average gamer.</p>



<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 retains that obvious challenge in the earliest sequences of the game, presenting players with a dire set of circumstances that take them from being a lauded nobleman to little more than a peasant begging for scraps. Where you once had a fine set of armour and a razor-sharp sword, you now have rags and bloodied knuckles.</p>



<p>That’s the welcome you get in KCD2 – but it’s phenomenal.</p>



<p>For those new to the franchise, you’re starting at the beginning, building Henry of Skalitz from the ground up and shaping him into what you want, and Warhorse Studios has done such a perfect job of explaining <strong>why </strong>that’s happening. This is an RPG at heart, and from the skill paths to the way you build your character based on your desired fighting style, everything is manipulated and experienced by you, the player.</p>



<p>For my Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 preview, I worked my way through the first ten hours or so of the game, but that was enough time to see that Warhorse has taken everything from the first game that I loved and improved upon it immeasurably – an evolution indeed.</p>



<p>Visually, the game is <strong>stunning</strong>. The audio palette is sumptuous and realistic, the movement mechanics are much smoother and more satisfying than the first game, and combat has been toned down a bit and optimised. The game’s AI is believable, interactive, and sensible, and the world around you feels as though it exists.</p>



<p>Of course, it helps that it’s rooted in history and authenticity – Warhorse made sure to employ the sharpest experts to make sure everything from swinging a sword to the behaviour of the local farmers is correct to the game’s period.</p>



<p>Performance-wise, I’m having no issues. I’m playing KCD2 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-pc-specs-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on a high-end gaming PC</a> with a controller, and running it at Ultra 1440p is giving me no concerns about the game’s stability. It’s buttery smooth and (almost entirely) bug-free.</p>

<p>When <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tom-mckay-interview-kingdom-come/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I spoke to Tom McKay</a>, the actor behind Henry of Skalitz, he let me know about the depth of the choice and consequence system in this game. As I explored the opening sequences, piecing together the steps for my Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 preview, I became aware of just how impactful even a passing comment in a conversation could be.</p>



<p>The world is truly what you make of it, and if you want your Henry of Skalitz to be a conniving, manipulating criminal, then so be it. If you’d rather be a stalwart and honest member of the wider community in the open world of KCD2, then you’re free to do that as well.</p>



<p>As you explore the game and mould your character, you’ll come to experience intense fights, incredibly cinematic cutscenes – all of which are fully acted – and at times, a slower pacing that makes you feel as though you’ve been teleported back in time by a few hundred years.</p>



<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 starts as a very slow burner. You might not even hit the title flash for a good while, depending on your play style. It’s designed to give all players a solid introduction, a spread of the backstory, and a tutorial for the game’s many mechanics. It’s nice – it feels natural and entertaining, and the best way to learn is by doing, so I was more than happy to crack on with it.</p>



<h2 id="h-not-long-to-wait">Not Long to Wait</h2>



<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will be released worldwide</a> on February 4, 2025. That’s just a few weeks away – and until then, I’ll be neck-deep in the game, exploring every nook and cranny in preparation for my full review, which you’ll find here on Insider Gaming on February 3.</p>



<p>I hope you’ve enjoyed this brief Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 preview – stay tuned for more coverage as the game’s release date draws closer, and as always, stop by the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a> to chat about the game.</p>

                <p>When Star Wars Episode I: Jedi Power Battles was released nearly 25 years ago, it featured a roster of heroes--and a few villains--from Lucasfilm's Star Wars: Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace. Jar Jar Binks was not among the playable characters in the game's original form, but he will be featured in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/24-year-old-star-wars-game-coming-to-modern-consoles/1100-6527092/" data-ref-id="1100-6527092">the game's upcoming release</a> on modern consoles. In the reveal trailer below, Jar Jar finally gets a chance to become an action hero.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQsFR66qYU4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rQsFR66qYU4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Jar Jar shows far more skill and fighting prowess in that trailer than he ever displayed in The Phantom Menace or any of his subsequent appearances. Regardless, Jar Jar's ridiculous side is also on full display when he runs away from a pack of charging animals on Naboo. Courage was never Jar Jar's strong suit, but it might be fun to play all the way through the game as this unsung hero.</p><p>Obi-Wan Kenobi and Qui-Gon Jinn are the two primary controllable characters in Power Battles. However, the game will also allow players to use Mace Windu, Plo Koon, Adi Gallia, Queen Padme Amidala, Captain Panaka, Ki-Adi Mundi, a battle droid, and Darth Maul. It's also been tweaked by developer Aspyr to give the Jedi screen-accurate depictions of their respective lightsaber colors. For example, that means Mace Windu will be getting his purple lightsaber.</p><p>Players will be able to fight each other in Power Battles' Versus mode, or they can face the Trade Federation side-by-side in co-op gameplay. This release will also feature Big Head Mode and other cheats that can be used during the main game.</p><p>Star Wars Episode I: Jedi Power Battles will hit Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on January 23, 2025. If the game follows the same pattern as Aspyr's previous Star Wars games, there may eventually be a physical edition available through Limited Run Games as well.

The Vermin double-attack bug is one of these, and like the Terminus speedrun fix, the proper solution for it unfortunately can’t be implemented as quickly as some of the other items listed above. Look for both of those fixes when Season 02 launches on Jan. 28.</em></p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/manor-lords">Manor Lords</a> today receives its fourth major update as early access continues, bringing a new bridge-building mechanic, bug fixes, and some experimental changes.</p>
<p>The bridge-building utilises the same road-building tool and arrives alongside two new maps, one of which includes a huge river, making bridges a necessity. Another watery addition is a stone well upgrade with increased water supply, while taverns can also be upgraded to level two.</p>
<p>Another new feature is an additional Overstock setting, which allows users to control the amount of extra goods placed in stalls or the tavern to exceed what's currently needed.</p>

<p>These additions come alongside a huge number of bug fixes, crashfixes, performance boosts, and more.</p>
<p>There are some experimental changes too, including a rework of cliffs to ensure they're less ambiguous (plus fixed pathfinding errors); changes to building costs to encourage more diverse resource use; amending food consumption to consume all types equally; and changing region strength selection so regions are picked from a finite pool to ensure necessary resources are available.</p>
<p>The full patch notes for this update, 0.8.024, can be found on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1363080/view/534338967351329253">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Manor Lords is available now on PC across Steam, GOG, Epic, Microsoft, and on PC Game Pass.</p>
<p>There's no date yet for its 1.0 release, though updates such as this prove developer Slavic Magic is hard at work.</p>
<p>"There's a confidence to Manor Lords that belies its one-person development, and what's there can be spellbinding, but it's a pastoral idyll that still needs significant development," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/manor-lords-early-access-review-beautiful-foundations-but-missing-important-pieces">Manor Lords early access review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-game-currency-rule-roblox</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/us-government-agency-proposes-new-rule-to-protect-victims-of-scams-and-theft-involving-in-game-currency.1079106/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-game-currency-rule-roblox<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a United States government agency tasked with ensuring that people are treated fairly by banks and financial institutions, proposed a new rule that targets, among other things, video games. In short, the Bureau is hoping to ensure that companies operating games with robust in-game currency marketplaces – think <em>Roblox </em>– actually help players struggling with unintended transactions, hacks, theft, and scams.&nbsp;</p><p>The CFPB explained its rationale in a post that it shared with Aftermath, noting that over time, some games have grown to function <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/research-reports/issue-spotlight-video-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more and more like banking and payment systems</a>.</p><p>“Gamers – or in some cases their parents and guardians – have reported issues such as trouble when converting dollars to in-game currency, unauthorized transactions, account hacks and takeovers, theft, scams, and loss of assets,” the agency wrote. “They have also described receiving limited to no help from gaming companies and the banks or digital wallets involved. Refunds are often denied, people are finding their gaming accounts suspended by the video game company after a player tries to get a refund from their financial institution, or people are left caught in doom loops with AI-powered customer service representatives while they’re just trying to get straight answers.”</p><p>To help mitigate these issues, the CFPB is proposing an interpretive rule, meaning one that draws on preexisting laws rather than drawing up new ones. In this case, it aims to clarify that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Fund_Transfer_Act" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Electronic Fund Transfer Act</a> – signed into law by Jimmy Carter in 1978 – extends to video game companies, as well as virtual currency wallets and credit card rewards points accounts.&nbsp;</p><p>“The proposed interpretive rule clarifies that gaming companies that are subject to the Electronic Fund Transfer Act could violate federal consumer financial law if they fail to address problems gamers have with their accounts,” wrote the CFPB.&nbsp;</p><p>The proposed interpretive rule, viewed by Aftermath, further specifies that it’s taking aim at accounts with features that include but are not limited to “paying for goods or services from multiple merchants, [the] ability to withdraw funds or obtain cash, or conducting person-to-person transfers.” This would seem to imply that games like <em>Roblox </em>and <em>Second Life </em>are covered, but a game like <em>Fortnite </em>– which does not allow any of the above – might not be. <em>Fortnite </em>in particular, it’s worth noting, used to do exactly what the CFPB is describing and ban accounts associated with chargebacks under the assumption of fraud, even if, say, the account holder purposefully initiated a chargeback to counteract an unwanted purchase (for example: a kid got their hands on a parent’s credit card and bought a bunch of V-Bucks).

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/halo-the-master-chief-collection-playstation-5-switch-2/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Halo: The Master Chief Collection and Microsoft Flight Simulator will be among the Xbox games that will launch on other platforms in the near future, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>Speaking during a recent podcast, well-known insider <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NatetheHate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NateDrake</a> talked about the Xbox games that will launch this year on PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch 2. Beyond the obvious, the insider confirmed he heard that Halo: The Master Chief Collection and Microsoft Flight Simulator will launch on the other systems this year. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-unreal-engine-5/">yet-to-be-announced Oblivion remake, </a>which is supposedly launching this June, will be another game launching on consoles other than Xbox systems, although this is more speculation than an actual rumor based on the fact that there is no reason for the game not to be a multiplatform release. At the same time, the "loss" of two exclusives will be compensated with the release of Final Fantasy VII Remake and Rebirth, which will be released in 2025 and 2026, respectively, not only on Xbox consoles but also on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p><iframe title="Xbox 2025 Predictions: Gears E-Day in 2025, FF7 Remake, BIG Switch 2 &amp; PS5 Games, Oblivion &amp; More" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AIhoTirZxlk?start=3220&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While the Nintendo Switch 2 probably won't have much trouble running the Halo: The Master Chief Collection, it will be very interesting to see how the much more demanding Flight Simulator will run on the next Nintendo system. If recent rumors are any indication, these ports may be <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-dynamic-ai-upscaling-ports-xbox-series-s/">scaled-down versions of the Xbox Series S versions</a>, which would make sense considering the system is currently the less powerful current generation console.</p>
<p>The launch of Halo: The Master Chief Collection on PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch 2 would be a landmark moment for Microsoft, further highlighting the company's <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-ceo-xbox-fans-are-being-redefined-into-enjoying-games-on-all-their-devices-i-feel-very-good-about-the-gaming-division/">shift in strategy. </a>Hopefully, it won't take much longer to know if PlayStation 5 and future Nintendo Switch 2 owners will be able to experience the first few entries in the series on their platform of choice.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-engineers-2-steam-workshop-confirmed</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/space-engineers-2-steam-workshop-support-confirmed-for-post-launch-update.1079094/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-engineers-2-steam-workshop-confirmed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Keen Software House has announced that&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em>will, in fact, be using Steam Workshop as its main user-generated content platform.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1133870/view/527583567913419118" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Steam, Keen Software House CEO Marek Rosa says that the decision to switch to Steam Workshop came from "listening to our community, particularly our content creators, who have expressed a strong preference" for the platform.</p>

<p>The original plan, according to Rosa, was to use Mod.io, which Rosa says was "driven by the goal of providing a unified backend" for&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2</em>'s PC and console versions. However, user feedback subsequently "made it clear" that Steam Workshop was the preferred direction.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/space-engineers-2-steam-workshop-astronauts.jpg?itok=p7SAGgLS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/space-engineers-2-steam-workshop-astronauts.jpg?itok=xTKQW9up 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Space Engineers 2</em>'s user-generated content will primarily use Steam Workshop, it's been announced.</figcaption></figure><p>Rosa goes on to say that Steam Workshop support will be added for&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2</em>'s user-generated content in the game's first major post-launch patch, which will arrive after the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-engineers-2-early-access-release-date" rel="nofollow">planned Early Access launch on January 27th</a>.</p>

<p>As for console players, Rosa says he and Keen Software House are currently "evaluating the best approach" when it comes to console-based user-generated content, and that the studio will "share more details as we progress".</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://2.spaceengineersgame.com/roadmap-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">roadmap</a> has also been updated to reflect the Steam Workshop decision, with Vertical Slice 1.1 now connecting the in-game workshop to Steam Workshop rather than Mod.io.</p>

<p>Future Vertical Slices for&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em>will bring the likes of improved gameplay mechanics, support for modding via the VRAGE Editor, and the opportunity to explore individual planets, plus lots more.</p>




<p>As you can probably guess,&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em>is the sequel to the original&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers</em>. It expands the original's sandbox gameplay with new blueprint tools, new gameplay systems, and plenty more.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em>when it launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1133870/Space_Engineers_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> on January 27th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

Instead of a mostly single-player campaign like its predecessor, the spin-off focuses on co-op play between three players (or you can play solo) as they take on successive waves of tough enemies and bosses through a day-and-night cycle, while exploring a randomized version of the original game’s open-world map. </p><p>It’s going to be a $40 release and feels a bit like FromSoftware drew inspiration from various PC mods that turned <em>Elden Ring</em> more into a survival roguelite than a traditional action-RPG. The combat shown in the initial trailers also looks like it will be faster, flashier, and more dynamic than the version in <em>Elden Ring</em> proper. Some lucky players will find out soon enough when they go hands-on with the game in next month’s network tests. And while those are only for current-gen consoles, the full game will be on PC as well as PS4 and Xbox One. </p><p>.﻿<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Players must choose from eight unique characters, each with their own abilities and powerful Ultimates. Their journeys take them to Limveld, an ever-changing environment, where they will have to make split-second decisions when it comes to combat and exploration in the face of a night cycle that shrinks the map with the coming Night’s Tide.</blockquote><blockquote>At the end of each night, players will face a powerful boss and, if victorious, awaken to bigger challenges. Each session will culminate in the third night when they must face off against the chosen Nightlord. Individuals can fight the night alone, but strength will come in numbers. Nightfarers must learn to cooperate to take down these challenges, combining their unique abilities together for an unparalleled experience. All is not lost for those who fall in defeat. Unsuccessful runs will grant players relics to allow them to customize and upgrade their characters tailored to their personal play styles.</blockquote><blockquote>Elden Ring Nightreign is unlike any experience created before by FromSoftware, Inc. In this condensed action RPG, players will never experience the same journey twice as enemies, rewards, and Limveld itself are ever-shifting and evolving with each new session. Defeating greater enemies and venturing into the more dangerous parts of the map will uncover more powerful weapons and greater Rune rewards. Finding Sites of Grace gives each hero a chance to level up and gain crucial power. With each session-based adventure being akin to playing through an open-air dungeon, every journey provides an opportunity to grow lasting stat bonuses. Successful runs against the night bring players ever closer to defeating the Nightlord and unraveling the story behind each Nightfarer in this parallel world.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Last year IGN had the opportunity to visit FromSoftware and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-we-played-it"><u>go hands-on with an early build of Elden Ring Nightreign</u></a>.

<p>For the uninitiated, House of Dead 2 is, funnily enough, the sequel to Sega's prolific 90s rail-shooter zombie series. In this instalment, you take on the lone role of secret agent James - either alone or in co-op mode alongside fellow agent Gary - with one single mission: to neutralise the dangerous denizens standing in your way.</p>
<p>As well as the features listed above, there will also be a boss mode in which you'll have to speedrun killing all of the game's bosses, and a training mode is available to help you hone your skills.</p>
<p>This is the second of Sega's zombie games to get the remake treatment. However, as Matt summarised for us this time last year, reception to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/house-of-the-dead-remake-heading-to-playstation-5-this-week">first House of the Dead: Remake's reception was pretty mixed</a>. With complaints highlighting control scheme issues and performance on last-gen consoles, so it'll be interesting to see how the second remake will be received.</p>
<p>ICYMI, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/house-of-the-dead-film-in-the-works-from-resident-evil-monster-hunter-director">Sega's The House of the Dead is also set for the big screen, with Paul WS Anderson</a> on board to write and direct.</p>
<p>Anderson will also serve as a producer, alongside his partner Jeremy Bolt. The duo have also worked on adaptations for the likes of Mortal Kombat (1995) and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter">Monster Hunter</a> (2020), as well as multiple Resident Evil films.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-best-mobile-skateboarding-game-now-has-a-new-york-sequel.1079064/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24339211/skate-city-new-york-review-apple-arcade<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For me, skateboarding has always been about getting into a flow state. Much like playing <em>Tetris</em>, I’m at my best when I’m skating almost subconsciously, not thinking and acting in the moment. It’s not an easy zone to get into, and music has always been my shortcut. So the greatest compliment I can give to <em>Skate City: New York</em> is that I’ve spent the past week fine-tuning the perfect playlist, all so that I can also perfect my runs in the game.</p><p><em>New York </em>is a sequel to the original <em>Skate City</em>; both are available through Apple Arcade, though the first game was eventually ported to consoles as well. It comes from Snowman, the studio behind the <em>Alto </em>series, and the shift to New York is a lot like the move from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/19/8064545/altos-adventure-iphone-ipad-snowboarding-game"><em>Alto’s Adventure</em></a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/21/17035830/altos-odyssey-sequel-iphone-game-ios-adventure-snowboarding"><em>Alto’s Odyssey</em></a>. It’s not an entirely new experience but, rather, one that changes the setting and adds some seemingly small — but very impactful — tweaks.</p><p>What makes the series so well suited to mobile is the way it balances approachability and depth. <em>Skate City</em> is extremely easy to pick up. It’s a side-scrolling game, so you’re always moving left to right, and all of the various tricks and moves are performed either by a swipe, tap, or hold. It all feels very natural. For example, each side of the touchscreen represents a side of your board, and even complex individual moves only require one input to pull off. So even if you don’t know what you’re doing, you can mash your way to some cool tricks. But what really makes it work is how, once you get the hang of things, you can chain together tricks in very satisfying ways.</p><p>This was all true of the original, and the core is the same in <em>New York</em>. The biggest change (aside from the location) is that levels all have multiple paths, so that if you time a jump or grind <em>just</em> right, you can make it to a new area with new possibilities. Given how much you’ll be grinding through the same streets, this extra layer adds some necessary variety. There are also a handful of new tricks, like being able to wall ride, that give you new tools to play with. On their own, these additions seem small. But together, they add just enough to make <em>New York</em> have its own feel.</p><p>Seemingly the most disappointing thing about the new game is that it’s restricted to a single city. The original <em>Skate City</em> was appropriately global; after a series of updates, it now has levels in Tokyo, Barcelona, Los Angeles, Venice, Miami, and Oslo. But even though <em>New York</em> only has, well, New York, there’s a decent amount of variety (and presumably more coming in the future).</p><p>At launch, there are three areas — Central Park, Brooklyn, and Manhattan — and each has its own distinct vibe, both in terms of how they look and the makeup of the levels. And once again, there are three modes to play through: one that teaches you the game through a series of tutorials; another that lets you put those skills to the test in pro challenges; and a free skate mode where you have time and space to be creative.</p><p>It’s this last mode that has had me, for the past week, huddled over my phone, <a href="https://www.esquire.com/uk/style/fashion/a61736444/yuto-horigome-winning-skateboarding-gold-wearing-airpods-is-our-olympic-highlight/">headphones in</a>, approaching the same rails and staircases over and over trying to nail the exact line I’ve envisioned in my head. Just like skating in real life, it can be tedious and frustrating at times. But the satisfaction of pulling it off is worth it — and that playlist has helped pull me through.</p><p><small>Skate City: New York<em> is available now on Apple Arcade.</em></small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>The holidays are over, which means we're back at our desks.</p><p>Last year, <a href="https://remapradio.com/video/lets-build-a-3d-model-of-patricks-new-office/" rel="noreferrer">the <em>Remap</em> crew helped Patrick work through ideas for a new office</a>, and over Thanksgiving and Christmas, Patrick finally made good them. Doing so, it turned out, proved to be a shockingly emotional experience beyond building desks and buying endless accessories.</p><p>Then again, how spaces define us has been a huge part of <em>Remap</em>, and what ultimately lead to the creation of the HOA podcast. We're all older, and while not necessarily wiser, we certainly find ourselves thinking about these topics a lot, and it's got us in our feelings.</p><p>Prepare for some Sad Dad thoughts, folks.</p><hr><p><strong>Patrick: </strong>Back in the fall, inspired by the work Janet had done to make her work space more functional, I decided enough was enough with my own space, as well. I have written in the past about how my life as a reporter—where I’ve often written while huddled around half-broken laptops, cold coffee, and terrible seating—has made me complacent. Hell, one of my “offices” in a tiny San Francisco apartment was literally inside of a closet, because it’s all the space we had.&nbsp;</p><p>Rob, <em>I wrote in a closet for the better part of a year</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>It sounds ridiculous, but it’s part of a larger personality quirk/feature: I can get used to things. Think about all the times we’ve hung out with one another. How often have I expressed all that much interest in where we eat or drink? I pretty much never chime in beyond realizing that people are not picking something that is in a reasonable walking distance, and even then, I once let you guide us through a rain storm towards a place that, to your credit, had some terrific food.&nbsp;</p><p>But…I’m older now. I turn 40, despite what my face might tell you, next month. I find myself in a position where, despite being semi-recently laid off, I am in a good final position! (In no small thanks to the continued stability of my wife’s job while the weirdness of mine worked itself out.)</p><p>To that point, last month I asked our financial advisor, aka the guy who scares the shit out of me about how much I need to keep putting aside each month to prevent my daughters from being saddled with debt for the rest of their lives, to drum up a life insurance policy for my wife and I. There is a whole other story to tell about that process about how I was denied good coverage from a bunch of places because I had the good fortune of my dad dying of a heart attack, but we can get into that another day. The point is that I’m now paying for the kind of life insurance coverage that’s supposed to make my life easier, or my wife’s life easier, if great tragedy strikes.</p><p>I’m almost 40. My dad died when he was 56 years old—and I was 27. 13 years. In another 13, which feels simultaneously like an eternity and no time at all, I’ll be on the doorstep of that same age. I now forget which birthday it was, but there was one in his early 50s where he said “hey, I made it past the point where my dad passed away.” He didn’t make it much longer, though.</p><p>When I was in high school, my dad finally bought what he’d wanted his entire life: a small lake house in southern Wisconsin, where he spent his formative years. What do we spend all this time working and toiling, if not to finally, at some point, try and make ourselves happier? That what we’ve grown complacent with isn’t enough, that it’s okay to have a meaningful treat?</p><p>I did not expect the introduction to this back-and-forth to be so somber, but in unpacking and dismantling my old desk, I found the original print out of the eulogy I wrote for my father. In moving on from that desk, it felt like I was moving on from a different era in my life, too. I am not in a position where I expect to move homes anytime soon, so when you reinvent a room, it has many of the same emotional arcs as moving to, say, a new apartment. I wasn’t expecting that.</p><p>I’m writing this from my new L-shaped standing desk. Yes, Rob, I bought the biggest one, even though half the desk is empty. This morning, I answered emails and did other busy work while standing. A few hours later, I tapped a button, watched the desk lower, and sat in my new Aeron chair to begin typing this out. In a few hours, I’ll put this computer into sleep mode, walk over to my production suite, and stream with Cado. I’ve only spent 36 hours in this setup, and beyond the newness, it’s making me credibly happy. No, it was not cheap—but man, worth every penny.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m hoping to bring that mentality to other parts of my life, too.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@carlheyerdahl?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Carl Heyerdahl</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Rob: </strong>One of the joys and frustrations as you age is that it’s easier to identify things that are worth prioritizing, and if you’re reasonably lucky you also have more resources to invest in those priorities. It’s joyful because you have all these moments where you realize how much you are being paid-back in experience for the money and time you invested in something for yourself. It’s frustrating because you realize you could have done some of this sooner and made life easier. Maybe not to the exact same degree, I have more money now than I did as a freelancer who had just moved to Boston with his grad student girlfriend. But often it’s the self-knowledge that is the real difference between then and now. There are things I could have benefited from back then, even if I would have had to do them on a shoestring, that I didn’t realize I needed until much later. You rejoice in solving a longstanding problem or removing a recurring irritation, but you also rue the years you spent “putting up” with something that in retrospect you didn’t need to.</p><p>MK had a moment like that when she realized we needed a stick vacuum. Simple thing, made a world of difference. We have a very <em>nice </em>stick vacuum and those have gotten better in ten years, but ultimately we would have benefited from one of those far more than the other stuff we’ve used over the years. It just didn’t click for her until this year that what she hated wasn’t vacuuming, it was dragging a vacuum around a house and wrestling with a long power cord. Small thing, no stakes at all really, but an example of what I mean.</p><p>When I got my Uplift desk, one of the extras I got with it was an anti-fatigue mat. I didn’t really need it in my office and I kind of forgot about it for a while, but a couple months ago I tossed it in front of my kitchen sink and realized that I was suddenly <em>comfortable </em>standing there doing dishes and chopping vegetables. I’d gotten used to how hard my kitchen floor was, and if you’d asked me I wouldn’t have said working in the kitchen caused me any discomfort much less pain, but really I’d just gotten habituated to enduring and ignoring a constant, mild level of irritation. I’d also, not coincidentally, lost a bit of interest in cooking and baking, subconsciously avoiding working in the kitchen without acknowledging that it had become physically unpleasant.</p><p>Again, these are small examples of what I’m talking about. Low-stakes stuff. But I think some of the same dynamics apply to higher-stakes stuff around family, work, and even how we conceive of ourselves and our vision of a good life. A lot of us are taught early that if we can avoid bothering other people with a need or a discomfort by enduring our adjusting our own expectations, then that’s what we should try to do. But if you’re really good at doing that, if you have a lot of resilience, endurance, or both, then you can end up being the proverbial frog being slowly boiled in a pot of water. It becomes habit to ignore a problem instead of checking for straightforward solutions.</p><p>A few years ago, my wife and I were on a walk and we spotted a group of turtles sunning themselves on a log in a river. She said she loved seeing turtles in the wild, not because of a particular love for the various species, but because the presence of healthy turtle populations is often a visible indicator of broader ecosystem health. For whatever reason that concept stuck in my head: that if you want to gauge the health of a system, sometimes it’s less about looking for problems than it is about looking for indicators of active well-being. Problems can be sneaky and hard to diagnose, and sometimes it’s easier to find signs that things are in a good place.</p><p>Since then, “is this good for turtles?” has become a shorthand in our house for a whole range of subtler questions. </p>

<p>It has been announced that there will be a network test for Elden Ring Nightreign from February 14 to February 17.</p>



<p>Announced on X (formerly Twitter), the network test will be available on the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S/X, and applicants can register to gain access by January 20. To apply for registration to the Elden Ring Nightreign test, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-join-the-elden-ring-nightreign-network-test/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">click here</a>.</p>



<p>Elden Ring Nightreign is a brand new co-op action-adventure game that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-announced-at-the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was announced during The Game Awards 2024</a>.</p>



<p>However, despite being a co-op game, the game will not be playable as a duo, as the developers announced that the game has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-solo-or-trio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">designed to be played either solo or trio</a>. </p>



<p>The developers have already said that the network test is a “preliminary verification test in which the selected testers play a portion of the game prior to the full game launch.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Various technical verifications of online systems will be examined by conducting large-scale network load tests,” the test description reads.</p>



<p>It’s currently unclear how much of the actual game content will be available to players, but anyone with a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series S|X can sign up.</p>



<p>First released in 2022, Elden Ring has sold 28.6 million units by September 2024, making it one of the best-selling games of all time, and the fastest-selling game published by Bandai Namco. Shadow of the Erdtree, a DLC for Elden Ring, sold five million copies in its first three days of release.</p>



<p>Will you be signing up for the Elden Ring Nightreign network test? And what do you think of it being solo or trio only? Let us know in the comments or our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/888/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/manor-lords-update-4-brings-bridge-building-new-maps-and-more.1079043/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/manor-lords-update-4<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Slavic Magic and publisher Hooded Horse have released a brand new&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>update, and it's packing a new bridge-building mechanic, new maps to check out, and more.</p>

<p>Previous <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/manor-lords-update-beta-none-glitch" rel="nofollow">updates</a> for the medieval city-builder have brought the likes of bug fixes and gameplay improvements, but as the name implies, Update 4 is a bigger patch that introduces some major new features.</p>

<p>First up, you're getting two new maps, High Peaks and Winding River. No prizes for which one of those includes "a huge river", as Hooded Horse and Slavic Magic say. Naturally, that river leads on to the new bridge-building mechanic, which is also included in Update 4.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/manor-lords-update-4-town.jpg?itok=ZE_PPcfh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/manor-lords-update-4-town.jpg?itok=nYPQSCuR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Manor Lords</em>' latest update brings tons of new features with it.</figcaption></figure><p>That's right: you can now use&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords</em>' Road tool to build yourself bridges, which can be used to cross things like the aforementioned "huge river" included in the Winding River map.</p>

<p>Additionally, Update 4 brings with it new gameplay tweaks like an Overstock setting for taverns and marketplaces, an upgrade to the Stone Well, and a level 2 Tavern upgrade, as well as a new visual for the Tavern's first level.</p>

<p>All of this is in addition to an absolute onslaught of bug fixes, gameplay improvements, and other changes. You can check out the full patch notes for&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>Update 4 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1363080/view/534338967351329253" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a>, but you might want to grab a coffee before you do, as it's pretty long.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords</em>, it's a medieval city-builder-slash-strategy game that emphasizes realism in its simulation. You'll build and maintain a village, see to the needs of its citizens, and even grow your empire through conquest of neighboring lands.</p>




<p>The game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/manor-lords-price-player-count" rel="nofollow">released back in April</a>, attracting over 100,000 players on Steam within just a few hours of its launch (which is particularly impressive given that it's also available on Game Pass).</p>

<p>In just a few days,&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/manor-lords-sales-player-count" rel="nofollow">broke a million</a>. They would go on to hit&nbsp;two million in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/manor-lords-sales-two-million" rel="nofollow">under three weeks</a>. It's safe to say Hooded Horse has a hit on its hands with this one.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1363080/Manor_Lords/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/manor-lords-game-preview/9p5f966564fs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>. It's also available as part of Game Pass Ultimate or PC Game Pass.</p>

All the while, Nintendo has sat silently, presumably watching our frenetic rushing about with arch amusement, perhaps taking some sort of pleasure in not actually announcing the console. But last night, the Japanese company finally spoke up, only to tell us all to sit back down.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195670" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="184" data-playlist="195670,193658,194644" data-current="195670"><div><p>This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21167.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p> “The gaming hardware that Genki is claiming to be Nintendo hardware at CES is unofficial and was not provided to the company by Nintendo.” </p><p>That’s what we’ve got, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://japan.cnet.com/article/35228142/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://japan.cnet.com/article/35228142/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">given in response to a request for comment by the Japanese <em>CNET</em></a></span>, translated by machines and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-switch-2-mockup-revealed-during-ces-2025-is-unofficial-and-was-not-provided-by-us-nintendo-says/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-switch-2-mockup-revealed-during-ces-2025-is-unofficial-and-was-not-provided-by-us-nintendo-says/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the people at <em>Automaton</em></a></span>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-warzone-season-2-release-date/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Warzone Season 2 come at a pivotal moment. CoD remains absolute and steadfast in its consistency, but its popularity is waning. Season 2 is a chance to rekindle the FPS fire, and we’re here to run through the latest info.</p>



<p>When former Call of Duty World Champion legend Seth “Scump” Abner describes CoD as “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/scump-on-call-of-duty-state/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kind of depressing</a>,” it’s deeply concerning. Many are switching over for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-1-eternal-night-falls-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals Season One Eternal Night Falls Update</a>. Player counts are dropping big time and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> isn’t as hot as it was, despite fun variations in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-squid-game-event-release-date-details-everything-we-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Squid Game event</a>. Warzone isn’t doing so hot either, and Season 2 is paramount to CoD’s coming weeks.</p>



<p>Warzone and Black Ops 6 Season 2 needs to be special and must hit harder than an Archangel Launcher.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-amp-warzone-season-2-release-date">Black Ops &amp; Warzone Season 2 Release Date</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Let’s see if CoD can restore some faith. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Black Ops 6 and Warzone Season 2’s release date is January 28 and it was confirmed by Activision through patch notes.</strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-01-patch-notes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">January 9 patch notes blog</a> for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Season 1 discussed stability fixes. It goes into greater detail, and ends up saying, “<strong>Look for both of those fixes when Season 02 launches on Jan. 28.</strong>“</p>



<p>It’s quite uncommon for a date to be revealed this way, but we’re not complaining. We already imagined this to be the date due to the Battle Pass end date, but it’s now official. You only don’t have long left to complete your Season 1 Battle Pass and secure limited-time unlocks.</p>



<h2 id="h-possible-warzone-amp-black-ops-6-season-2-content">Possible Warzone &amp; Black Ops 6 Season 2 Content</h2>



<p>There have been no leaks or suggestions as to what content is coming in Season 2. But it’s safe to assume Black Ops 6, Zombies, and Warzone are getting the usual slew of content: <strong>New Maps, Guns, Perks, limited-time modes, Operator Bundles, and a new Battle Pass</strong>.</p>



<p>It’s funny, sometimes we know of at least something fresh by now, but we don’t—and no one does. Season 2 is being kept under wraps, and fingers crossed it’s because it’s a big one. </p>



<p>Black Ops 6 players want a Ranked game mode without hackers, the Warzone community wants <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-verdansk-coming-back-to-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verdansk</a> back now, and Zombies is unlikely to get major content after the introduction of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-sword-upgrades-in-citadelle-des-morts-bo6-zombies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Citadelle del Morts</a>—an LTM could be fun given the novelty of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-win-dead-light-green-light-in-black-ops-6-zombies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dead Light Green Light</a>.</p>



<p>Keep checking back as we’re going to update this guide once we learn any news or rumors about Season 2.</p>



<h2 id="h-bo6-amp-warzone-season-2-battle-pass">BO6 &amp; Warzone Season 2 Battle Pass</h2>



<p>Again, it’s not officially revealed, <strong>but a Season 2 Battle Pass is inevitable for Black Ops 6 and Warzone</strong>.</p>



<p>An even bigger question is if Activision is going to continue with additional Battle Passes. The Squid Game event didn’t just bring new game modes and special skins, but also a <strong>controversial Event Pass</strong>. It had a free version, along with a Premium Tier. This didn’t go down well with the player base, so we’ll see if this is addressed once Season 2 is announced.</p>



<hr>



<p>Call of Duty is a huge talking point at present. What do you like and dislike about it? Is Black Ops 6 dying? Does Warzone need a content injection? Let us know your thoughts below.</p>

<section><p>The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap created a new kind of magical fantasy by showing us an unseen side of Hyrule at microscopic scale.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr"><em>The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap is celebrating its 20-year anniversary today, January 10, 2025. Below, we look back at how the team came up with a playful sense of scale as its central hook.</em></p><p dir="ltr">The Legend of Zelda series is filled with dynamics that stretch and alter the world of Hyrule. Whether it be going back in time or into a realm of darkness, these add a new element of exploration that you wouldn't see in a peaceful Hyrule. The goal with many of these design choices was to inspire wonder--to give players a reason to explore familiar areas they've seen several times before. The Minish Cap's shrinking feature is one of the best examples of The Legend of Zelda designers achieving that goal.</p><p dir="ltr">Recent games like Tinykin, It Takes Two, and Grounded have explored what it's like to explore the world while tiny, but few have created the dichotomy that The Minish Cap had with its shrinking feature. It encouraged fascination with the mundane--anything and everything could be hiding Link's next discovery.</p><p dir="ltr">"When we started thinking about what that gimmick could be for Minish Cap, first, we knew it couldn't be that far-removed or out-there from the world of Zelda," said The Minish Cap director Hidemaro Fujibayashi in a <a href="https://shmuplations.com/minishcap2/" rel="nofollow ">2004 interview</a> in Nintendo Dream magazine. "I started thinking, what feature[s] of these game worlds could we possibly expand on, what dimension could we explore? "Front and Reverse, Past and Future, Light and Darkness… we'd done all these before, but could some other pairing remain? I racked my brain until I realized--ah hah, if we make Link small, that would be like entering a whole 'nother world within his own."</p><p dir="ltr">The Minish Cap's hallmark shrinking feature led to an overworld that was absolutely packed with puzzles to solve. Its clever use throughout the game make it one of the best examples of The Legend of Zelda designers inspiring wonder, and it's an aspect of the game that still stands out 20 years later.</p><p dir="ltr">While individual dungeons and the overworld are packed with fascinating content to explore, the mere idea that an entire village could be hidden inside a tree or rock inspires a Breath of the Wild-like sense of wonder that was somehow accomplished with 2004 technology.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfEMNbjLd3Y" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UfEMNbjLd3Y" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">In Capcom's The Legend of Zelda adventure, the world of Hyrule has tiny beings called the Minish packed into stumps, under rocks, and in dozens of other places across the kingdom. These Minish are everywhere, even under the snoozing nose of a shoemaker. Link and the rest of Hyrule have never heard of these creatures, making further discovery of how they live a wonderful story thread to pull on.</p><p dir="ltr">The Minish Cap lets you yank on that thread early on in your adventure, shortly after peril comes to Hyrule. Soon after the villain of the entry, Vaati, unleashes a horde of monsters across Hyrule, Link travels to The Minish Woods to find the Minish, retrieve four elemental stones, restore the sword of legend, and restore Hyrule and a Zelda, the latter of whom has been turned to stone.</p><p dir="ltr">Much of this is standard Zelda flare, although the leadup to discovering the Minish for the first time establishes the larger-than-life level design that will fill the rest of the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Link's new sidekick, Ezlo, shrinks him down using a portal found in The Minish Woods, eventually leading him through logs, over drifting pondweed, and around life-size sticks and acorns to find the miniature race of people who would kick off the rest of his adventure.</p><p dir="ltr">Looking back, this moment doesn't seem incredibly impressive on its own, but its ingenuity is found in how it sets up the rest of the game. Navigating the small platforming section and keeping an eye out for areas that can only be explored while small is what, as Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma said, turns the entire overworld into something just as challenging as the series' trademark dungeons.</p><p dir="ltr">"Dungeons have a certain limited format to them, right? Find keys, advance further, defeat the boss," Aonuma said. "In contrast, the outside world, the field map, can offer more multifaceted gameplay."</p><p dir="ltr">Kinstone fragments scattered across the overworld feel like standard collectibles at first, but they amount to more by unlocking other areas of the map. Find two of the same type, fuse them, and the classic Zelda discovery jingle will play--meaning a new path opens up, a chest is revealed, or something similar happens.</p><p dir="ltr">Many of these Kinstones are found within puzzles that require you to shrink down and climb a bookcase, run across bakery shelves, or even dodge gigantic raindrops: simple acts that give you an entirely new angle through which to view Hyrule.</p><p dir="ltr">"Collecting the fragments opens up areas far from your current location," Aonuma said. "In a sense, this makes the overworld map itself act like one big dungeon."</p><p dir="ltr">This sense of wonder came from Capcom's goal to shift away from their design approach on Oracle of Ages, Oracle of Seasons, and Four Swords. While they ended up building off of the Gnat Hat--an item that shrunk Link down in Four Swords--they wanted to replicate Nintendo's approach to Zelda by focusing on worldbuilding. In doing so, they just happened to create an amazing world that came from posing a simple question: What's hidden beneath and within all the familiar workings of Lake Hylia and Lon Lon Ranch?</p><p dir="ltr">"We wanted to make a 'mainline' traditional 2D Zelda game. Traversing overworld maps, exploring dungeons. The essence of Zelda," Fujibayashi said. "I see it as following in the steps of the Famicom Zelda and A Link to the Past, but a more powered-up version for today's hardware."</p><p dir="ltr">Exploring cracks in rocks and tiny holes in the side of cottages in 2004 is the equivalent of scaling the side of the mountain in Breath of the Wild in 2017. The biggest contrast is the technology, as Capcom worked within the parameters of Game Boy Advance hardware in order to instill a magic that could be felt through a 2.9-inch screen. That tiny, mystical world hidden amongst fantastic combat and puzzles makes The Minish Cap one of the most memorable Zelda games today,</p>

                <p>Nintendo's next console, the apparent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a>, is the talk of the town in Las Vegas for the Consumer Electronics Show this week due in part to the peripheral company Genki claiming to know what Nintendo is cooking up. Now, for the first time, Nintendo has broken its silence and commented on the leaks.</p><p>A spokesperson told Japanese newspaper <a href="https://www.sankei.com/article/20250110-XHI3U6QWZ5CZ7IFGTGUGJUVH4A/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Sankei Shimbun</a> (<a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-switch-2-mockup-revealed-during-ces-2025-is-unofficial-and-was-not-provided-by-us-nintendo-says/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">translated by Automaton</a>) that the images and videos from CES are "not official." A spokesperson told <a href="https://japan.cnet.com/article/35228142/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CNET Japan</a> (translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-switch-2-mockup-revealed-during-ces-2025-is-unofficial-and-was-not-provided-by-us-nintendo-says/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>), "The gaming hardware that Genki claims to be Nintendo hardware at CES is official and was not provided to the company by Nintendo."</p><p>At CES, Genki created a mockup of the Switch 2 that it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-month-and-more-accessories-apparently-revealed/1100-6528689/" data-ref-id="1100-6528689">claimed was based on a real Switch 2 console that it saw</a>, going on to say the company was surprised by the media attention. Later, however, Genki told <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/01/10/148376.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game Spark</a> that its mockup was in fact based only on leaks, not from seeing the system first hand, and that it doesn't actually know what Nintendo is planning.</p><p>Genki also said at CES that it expects the Switch 2 to launch in April 2025. In addition to the leaks that stem from Genki, other reports claim to reveal the first details on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/leaked-switch-2-renders-grant-a-360-degree-look-at-the-console/1100-6528727/" data-ref-id="1100-6528727">Switch 2's new Joy-Cons, which could include a new feature and a more ergonomic design. </a></p><p>Nintendo has confirmed it will announce its next console by the end of March 2025, so a reveal could happen very soon. Many are expecting the console to then launch later in the year.</p><p>The Switch 2, or whatever the system may be called, has enormous shoes to fill, as the original Switch sold more than 146 million systems and 1.3 billion games.</p>

<p>The concert will take place to mark the new year and will see Astra Yao performing at the "iconic" Starloop landmark in New Eridu. However, all is not as it seems, and there's a conspiracy brewing that may threaten Astra.</p>

<p>Naturally, Astra Yao is one of the two new S-rank Agents you can recruit in&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 1.5. She's an Ether Support Agent who can provide damage bonuses to your squad, and she's also the game's "first healing character", with her Ultimate restoring HP to your team.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zenless-zone-zero-version-1.5-new-characters.jpg?itok=j7tAOTf4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zenless-zone-zero-version-1.5-new-characters.jpg?itok=MUaP8O4f 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 1.5 will bring two new characters for you to recruit.</figcaption></figure><p>Your second new character in this update is Evelyn, Astra Yao's "trusted guardian". She's a Fire Attack Agent who can unleash a Chain Attack by herself, so she's a pretty powerful addition to your lineup.</p>

<p>In addition to the above two characters, you can also expect reruns of Ellen and Qingyi in Version 1.5's banners, as well as a new S-rank Banbgoo in the form of Snap, which comes complete with a camera.</p>

<p>Version 1.5 also brings with it new minigames, including a new parkour-based arcade game by the name of Mach 25, which allows you to "race with various vehicles". Plenty of other new gameplay changes and features are coming in Version 1.5 too, so make sure you add January 22nd to your calendar.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero</em>, it's part of HoYoverse's live-service gacha RPG lineup, alongside&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/genshin-impact" rel="nofollow">Genshin Impact</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/honkai-star-rail" rel="nofollow">Honkai: Star Rail</a>&nbsp;</em>(and also&nbsp;<em>Honkai Impact 3rd</em>).</p>

<p>The game is more overtly action-oriented than its stablemates, and it's less fantasy-inspired too, taking place in an urban setting reminiscent of the likes of&nbsp;<em>Persona&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Jet Set Radio</em>.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>right now for free on <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/en-us/main" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices</a>. Version 1.5 lands on January 22nd.</p>
