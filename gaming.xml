<p>Ahead of 'Wicked: For Good'</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="706d691edd75b"><a title="Super Mario Bros. Movie" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/706d691edd75b/super-mario-bros-movie.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Universal Pictures</em></figcaption></figure><p>If you're itching to see what <strong>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong> will actually look like, then you might not have much longer to wait.</p>
<p>According to movie scoops outlet <a href="https://x.com/MyTimeToShineH/status/1985029599063843018">My Time to Shine</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-next-mario-galaxy-movie-reveal-is-reportedly-coming-very-soon/">VGC</a>), the next trailer for the upcoming flick will be presented before showings for <strong>Wicked: For Good</strong>. If accurate, this presumably means that the trailer will get its debut either on <strong>21st November</strong>, which is when Wicked: For Good releases, or at some point beforehand.</p>
<p>Now, it doesn't sound like a very Nintendo move to just let the trailer play in theatres without any kind of build-up, so we'd imagine that there would be some sort of Direct showcase in which Miyamoto reveals the trailer himself, followed by Chris Pratt reiterating how much he just loves to stomp those darn Koopas.</p>

<p>Whether this claim is accurate or not, The Super Mario Galaxy Movie is releasing on <strong>3rd April 2026</strong>, so Nintendo and Illumination will likely want to kick off the marketing campaign pretty soon.</p>
<p>The upcoming movie is a direct sequel to <strong>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</strong>, which released back in 2023. Actors Chris Pratt, Anya Taylor-Joy, Jack Black, Charlie Day, Keegan-Michael Key, and Kevin Michael Richardson are all set to reprise their roles.</p>
<p>The movie's title was revealed during the most recent Nintendo Direct, during which the 40th anniversary of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros">Super Mario Bros.</a> was recognised with several key announcements.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6%E2%80%99s-maps-proven-to-be-smaller-than-most-series%E2%80%99-maps-in-new-community-effort.1342237/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Many fans of the series feel that Battlefield 6's maps are smaller than the rest of the series, and it seems like they were right, judging from a comparison put together by a member of the community.</p>



<p>Over on the <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1omver9/updated_battlefield_maps_from_bf3_bf4_bfhl_bf1/">Battlefield subreddit</a>, user ClaraTheRed shared a couple of comparison images that show all of the series' 87 maps, their total and playable area, their shapes and how they rank in terms of size.</p>



<p>The findings are not in the Battlefield 6 maps' favor at all. The game's largest map, Operation Firestorm, a remade version of Battlefield 3's map, ranks 32nd in terms of playable space. It is also considerably smaller than the original, which ranks at 7th in terms of playable area.</p>



<p>Every other Battlefield 6 map ranks relatively low in the total ranking for playable space. Mirak Valley is the largest of the game's original maps, ranking 35th, while the smallest, Saints Quarter, is also the 2nd smallest map in the entire series. As such, those who felt that the game's maps were small were clearly onto something, even without doing an accurate comparison as the user ClaraTheRed did.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While many of the largest maps in the series were DLC maps released long after each respective game, there's no denying that Battlefield 6's maps do leave something to be desired in terms of playable space, even compared to the launch maps of previous entries in the series. With the community being rather vocal about this matter, it will be interesting to see if the developer will take this feedback into account for future maps, as they have been doing for some other aspects of the game, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://mp1st.com/news/after-community-backlash-devs-remove-battlefield-6s-neon-blue-skin">including the removal of a skin that the community felt didn't fit the setting at all.</a></p>



<p>Battlefield 6 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. Learn more about the latest entry in the series by checking out <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/battlefield-6-battlefield-is-mostly-back/">David Carcasole's review.</a></p>

            <p><strong>Warning</strong>: Spoilers for Cyberpunk 2077 lie ahead.</p>
<p>Tabletop wizard and cool glasses-wearer <a href="https://www.vg247.com/cyberpunk-2077-cd-projekt-red-mike-pondsmith">Mike Pondsmith</a> has teased having "ways" to bring Johnny Silverhand back in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>'s sequel. Actor and serial whoa merchant Keanu Reeves hasn't been shy about being open to reprising the role were the opportunity to crash through his door waving some mantis blades about, but reconciling such a thing with the events of the first game could prove a bit complex.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time Pondsmith's let loose potential details about Cyberpunk 2, which developers CD Projekt have otherwise remained pretty tight-lipped about while they work away at it. <a href="https://www.vg247.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-new-city-like-chicago-gone-wrong-michael-jordans-legacy">Back in May</a>, he alluded to having chatted to a dev at the studio about a city which "feels more like Chicago gone wrong" that's visited during the course of the game.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Pondsmith said more words during a recent interview on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/1_HsIlaqMkc">CD Projekt livestream</a>. "You know, not that long ago, I saw that Keanu would like to find a way to come back from the dead and play Johnny again," he mentioned, alluding to Reeves' <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/johnny-silverhand-actor-keanu-reeves-says-he-absolutely-wants-to-be-in-cyberpunk-2">declariation of being down to return</a> to the role. "I have ways to do that, Keanu. Contact me."</p><p>The tabletop man refused to elaborate any further, as people who mention having mysterious ways to accomplish things often do. I assume the obvious way would be to have a Punch and Judy-style Silverhand puppet narrate the main menu, as the moon man of fellow RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a> does. Think about it, every time there's a plot twist, he can have a sarcastic moan about you, a gonk, having gonkishly erred in trusting certain chooms, gonkishly. He'd have seen it coming years before you did, gonkchoom.</p>
<p>In all seriousness, the only answers that'd make much sense would be if the sequel turns out to be a prequel to the events of the first game, or leans into flashback at certain points as that first Cyberpunk does. Either that, or some nonsense about there being extra hard drives knocking about somewhere in the real or net bits of the Cyberpunk universe with even more copies of the Silversonality on them.</p>
<p>Personally, I think I'd prefer it if Silverhand's story concluded in the first game, and the sequel moves on to fresh ground with minimal retreading. A brief cameo via flashback might be cool, but isn't worth doing just for the sake of it. In this interview, Pondsmith mentioned how blown away he was by CD Projekt getting Idris Elba for Phantom Liberty, and half jokes that he'd like to see Scarlett Johansson next. Sure, why not, but I reckon Cyberpunk's better off not being totally stuffed to the gills with every celeb possible, like a cyberware-heavy Christmas pantomime. That's what keeps the odd cameo in a role which fits the actor being cast feeling special.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Surely by now you’ve heard it all: <a href="https://kotaku.com/doom-alarmo-nintendo-alarm-clock-hack-modder-usb-id-pc-1851690005"><i>Doom</i> running on an alarm clock</a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/doom-running-inside-fortnite-uefn-how-epic-twitter-fps-1851585177">inside <i>Fortnite</i></a>, on <a href="https://kotaku.com/doom-running-on-pdf-weird-port-id-software-fps-pc-mod-1851739634">a simple PDF</a>, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/it-runs-doom-cells-bacteria-1851212417">even on human bacteria</a>. It seems like <a href="https://kotaku.com/doom-weirdest-ports-keyboard-atm-calculator-tractor-pc-1850726374"><i>Doom</i> can run on anything</a>. But what about running <i>Doom</i> on a satellite orbiting the planet while also using images of the Earth taken by the very satellite running the game for the game’s backdrops? Well, some very clever folks managed to pull off that very thing.</p> <p>Ubuntu Summit is a yearly gathering of Linux professionals and enthusiasts where folks show off cool stuff they’re doing with one of the most popular Linux desktop distributions out there. This year, programmer Ólafur Waage dove into how a bunch of clever folks not only got <i>Doom</i> running on an orbital satellite last year, but also how they were able to replace the game’s background image of the terrain and skies of Hell with photos of Earth taken by the satellite (<a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/doom-can-run-just-about-anywhere-including-space-hacker-recounts-tale-of-running-the-game-on-an-orbiting-satellite">h/t <i>Tom’s Hardware</i></a>). It was no easy feat, but it resulted in a new frontier for <i>Doom</i> ports. Check out Waage’s presentation of <i>Doom</i> in space during the summit <a href="https://youtu.be/bEEamxJ60aI?t=2746">here (starting at 46:00 or so)</a>.</p>

  <p>While he was working on a project to get <i>Doom</i> running in C++ as opposed to its original programming language, C, Waage was contacted by Georges Labrèche, a spacecraft operations engineer at the European Space Agency, about the prospect of running <i>Doom</i> on the ESA’s OP-SAT satellite.</p>

 <p>OP-SAT presented an excellent opportunity for the ESA, as an experimental platform for unique tests on a device orbiting the Earth made out of (mostly) off-the-shelf computer parts and housed in a device not much larger than a suitcase.</p> <p>After getting <i>Doom</i> to run without graphical output, as proof it could be done, the team was not only able to get actual graphics running with the game in software rendering mode, but it was also able to swap out <i>Doom</i>’s fictional skybox with real images of the Earth, processed by a machine learning algorithm to adapt to <i>Doom</i>’s strict palette limit of 256 colors. The team had to tweak the color palette a bit to allow for more than <i>Doom</i> usually does, but the results worked. Not only did <i>Doom</i> run in space, but it ran in space while using a skybox featuring images taken by the very satellite it was running on.</p> <p>So yes, <i>Doom</i> has run on everything and everywhere, including a satellite in space.</p>

                <p>With The Simpsons taking over <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> battle royale, we've been duking it out on a new, cel-shaded island based on Springfield, the home of the long-running sitcom's titular family. Naturally, the island is full of references to the show, both big and small, and you can earn a healthy chunk of XP toward the new Simpsons-themed battle pass by finding some of them. On top of that, we've got a set of story quests to start us off, as well as some found quests that literally pop out of treasure chests occasionally.</p><p dir="ltr">There's a little less hand-holding than usual with these quests, since Fortnite doesn't even tell you what a lot of them are--sometimes you find out a quest exists only after you finish it. But we got you covered.

If you're there when this happens, you'll see an icon directing you to the plant's control room, where you'll need to enter a sequence using the three buttons--Eenie, Meenie, and Minie--to avert disaster and receive some sick loot.</p><p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, the sequence is random each match, but you can find out what the code is by looking for these posters around the plant. Using the sequence from the poster should complete the event.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4594997-vlcsnap-2025-11-02-16h18m26s769.png" data-ref-id="1300-4594997" data-ratio="0.56227239621267" data-width="1373" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4594997-vlcsnap-2025-11-02-16h18m26s769.png" data-ref-id="1300-4594997"></a><figcaption>These randomized posters will tell you the code sequence for each match.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4594997-vlcsnap-2025-11-02-16h18m26s769.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">A new type of milestone this season simply tells you to find 12 "hidden gags" around the island, with no further details. All 12 tasks are listed below, with instructions for how to complete them. Each of these is worth 5k XP the first time you do them, and completing all 12 is another 20k. Some of these quests also grant stashes of loot and/or gold.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Knock_the_Jebediah_Springfield_statue_s_head_off">Knock the Jebediah Springfield statue's head off</h3><p dir="ltr">In the Springfield Town Square is a statue of the town's founder, Jebediah Springfield. You can knock the head off this statue by shooting it or hitting it with your pickaxe to complete the quest. And then you can wear the head, which will protect you from all damage the next time an enemy shoots you in the head.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Spray_Springfield_with_El_Barto_tags">Spray Springfield with El Barto tags</h3><p dir="ltr">In every named location, you'll find walls with a little spraycan icon on them. Opening the emote wheel while next to one of these will let you tag the wall with the El Barto spray to complete the quest.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Step_on_a_rake">Step on a rake</h3><p dir="ltr">Leaf rakes are lying on the ground in grassy areas all over the map. Stepping on one will make the handle fly up and hit you in the face.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Release_the_hounds">Release the hounds</h3><p dir="ltr">In Mayor Burns' office in Burns Manor, you'll find a big red button on the large wooden desk at the center of the room. Pressing this button will release a bunch of Dober Man NPCs who will fight any hostile players who enter the area.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Dislodge_the_Lard_Lad_donut">Dislodge the Lard Lad donut</h3><p dir="ltr">In the Donut District, you can damage the Lard Lad statue to knock the giant donut off of it--turning the donut into a large physics object that can destroy buildings and cause other havoc.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Prank_call_Moe">Prank call Moe</h3><p dir="ltr">Most of the major locations have several ringing payphones you can interact with. Doing so will have Bart prank call Moe, which will grant you some gold.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Bring_the_Haw_Haw_humiliation">Bring the Haw Haw humiliation</h3><p dir="ltr">Defeating a boss NPC--Witch Marge, Evil Homer, or Krusty the Clown--prompts Nelson to pop up and laugh at the dead baddie. Meaning defeating any boss completes this quest. Unfortunately, the bosses don't have consistent spawn locations, so it's tough to predict where to find them. But they always begin in or near one of the named locations.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Find_Mr__Sparkle">Find Mr. Sparkle</h3><p dir="ltr">You can find this cleaning solution under some dirt in the corner of the Tire Fire, just south of Evergreen Terrace.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Jump_the_Springfield_Gorge">Jump the Springfield Gorge</h3><p dir="ltr">Just east of Evergreen Terrace is a large gorge with a dirt ramp next to it. Simply jump the gorge while hitting the hoop hovering above it to complete the quest. Using a car is the most obvious way to do this, but using Shockwave Grenades, Super Squishees, or Blinky fish to jump through the hoop on foot is also valid.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4594995-19a470d1177100-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594995" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4594995-19a470d1177100-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594995"></a><figcaption>You can your squad can watch TV on the Simpsons' couch.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4594995-19a470d1177100-screenshoturl.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Sit_on_the_Simpsons__couch">Sit on the Simpsons' couch</h3><p dir="ltr">The iconic Simpsons home is located in the center of Evergreen Terrace--you'll know you're in the right place because the Marge NPC will be hanging out there. Interact with the couch in the living room to complete the quest.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Eat_a_Steamed_Ham">Eat a Steamed Ham</h3><p dir="ltr">While you're at the Simpsons' house for the previous quest, pop into the dining room where you should find a platter of steamed ham sandwiches. Platters like this also pop up in restaurants and other homes. So if the Simpsons' house doesn't have any, try Ned Flanders' house next door.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Catch_Blinky">Catch Blinky</h3><p dir="ltr">This quest is telling you to catch a fish with a fishing rod. While there are rivers flowing all over the island, none of them is suitable for fishing. Instead, you'll need to look for swirling fishing spots in the lake next to Kamp Krusty, and in the ocean surrounding the island. Catching one Blinky fish will complete the quest.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_X_Simpsons_story_quests___Apocalypse_D_oh">Fortnite X Simpsons story quests - Apocalypse D'oh</h2><p dir="ltr">The first stage of the season's story quests, Apocalypse D'oh, is live now. These quests don't give any XP on their own, but you'll receive 30k XP for every three story or found quests you complete, until you've completed 30 of them. You'll have to do these quests in order, and you can find step-by-step instructions below.</p><p dir="ltr">This set of story quests will only be available until November 10, at which time they'll be replaced with the next set of story quests.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Visit_three_named_locations">Visit three named locations</h3><p dir="ltr">This one is as simple as it sounds. Simply visit any three different named locations, over the course of however many matches you want.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Destroy_five_of_Homer_s_signs">Destroy five of Homer's signs</h3><p dir="ltr">Many of the named locations around the map are filled with goofy signs that Homer has put up--like "go" signs instead of "stop" signs, or the sign that indicates it's illegal to be Ned Flanders. Destroy five of these signs, which will be marked on your UI with an exclamation point, to move on to the next quest.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Emote_near_a_boss_NPC">Emote near a boss NPC</h3><p dir="ltr">You'll need to find one of the boss NPCs--Witch Marge, Evil Homer, and Krusty the Clown--that spawn randomly in any of the named locations, and then emote when you're close to them. Just don't emote for too long, since they'll probably start shooting at you.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Do_250_damage_to_bosses">Do 250 damage to bosses</h3><p dir="ltr">Once you've danced with the boss, shoot it. Once you've caused 250 damage, you'll move on to the next stage.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Convince_Homer_to_give_up_the_power">Convince Homer to give up the power</h3><p dir="ltr">The Homer NPC lives at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. Just interact with Homer and choose the marked quest dialogue about the Zero Point shard he found.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Visit_Town_Hall_to_voice_your_concerns">Visit Town Hall to voice your concerns</h3><p dir="ltr">Homer wants you to do some lobbying on his behalf before he'll give up on whatever he's trying to do with the shard. So head to Springfield Town Hall in Corruption Corners, where you'll be prompted to destroy 25 objects before the cops show up and arrest you--you'll have 90 seconds, which is plenty of time.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Find_a_Squishee">Find a Squishee</h3><p dir="ltr">Homer also wants a Super Squishee drink, so you'll need to find one from any source, like treasure chests and Squishee machines that are found in every Qwik-E-Mart around the island--you can buy three Squishees for 300 gold from these machines.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Deliver_it_to_Homer">Deliver it to Homer</h3><p dir="ltr">You'll need to bring Homer the Super Squishee, but you'll need to take a specific route marked by checkpoint hoops--going directly to him by any other path won't count. You'll have four minutes from the moment you enter a Kwik-E-Mart or pick up a Squishee to complete the quest, or else you'll have to start this stage again.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Enter_the_Simpsons_house_and_inspect_different_remotes">Enter the Simpsons house and inspect different remotes</h3><p dir="ltr">Homer is being stubborn, so you'll need to visit the Simpsons' home in Evergreen Terrace to investigate what he's planning. Once you're there, you'll need to inspect five remote controls, which are scattered around the house and marked with exclamation points.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Confront_Homer">Confront Homer</h3><p dir="ltr">All that's left from here is talking. Return once again to Homer at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, and click through the quest dialogue to complete this stage.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Return_to_Hope">Return to Hope</h3><p dir="ltr">Then, visit the NPC Hope at the donut shop in Donut District, and click through her quest dialogue to complete the first wave of story quests for Fortnite's Simpsons season.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_x_Simpsons_Lost_and_Found_quests">Fortnite x Simpsons Lost and Found quests</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4594996-19a470ce2cc58-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594996" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4594996-19a470ce2cc58-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594996"></a><figcaption>Lost and Found quests come from these objects that sometimes pop out of chests.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4594996-19a470ce2cc58-screenshoturl.jpg"></figure><p>You won't find these quests in your menu, because they drop from treasure chests and ammo boxes, and you can also pick one up from the NPCs who offer them, which are Homer, Marge, Lisa, and Bart. These repeatable quests award high-quality loot for each one that you complete, as well as 1k XP. Plus, there's the 30k XP you receive for every three found or story quests you do, until you've done 30 of them.</p><p dir="ltr">There are four types of these quests right now, one for each member of the Simpson clan.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Marge_s_Lost_and_Found_quests">Marge's Lost and Found quests</h3><p dir="ltr">Marge wants you to collect some items, either several of the same thing, or different items of a certain rarity--like three uncommon items, which are green rarity.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Homer_s_Lost_and_Found_quests">Homer's Lost and Found quests</h3><p dir="ltr">Homer's quests involve driving a distance in a vehicle. Just find a car, and do some driving.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Lisa_s_Lost_and_Found_quests">Lisa's Lost and Found quests</h3><p dir="ltr">Lisa will task you with finding her lost textbooks, which are scattered around whichever named location is nearest. You'll need to look for exclamation points on your mini-map to see where the books are, since they spawn randomly around each location.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Bart_s_Lost_and_Found_quests">Bart's Lost and Found quests</h3><p dir="ltr">Bart's quests require you to be destructive, either by damaging enemies or breaking stuff.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4594994-screenshot1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594994" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4594994-screenshot1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594994"></a><figcaption>The home of the Simpsons.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4594994-screenshot1.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="Kickstart_quests">Kickstart quests</h2><p dir="ltr">Finally, we have the season-long Kickstart quests that exist to encourage you to get acquainted with the new mechanics in Fortnite's Simpsons season. These are fairly simple and uncomplicated, and we'll explain them all below. Each of these quests is worth 30k XP.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Visit_the_Simpsons_house">Visit the Simpsons house</h3><p dir="ltr">In the center of Evergreen Terrace, on the east side of the central square, is the iconic Simpsons house, pictured above for reference. Entering it will complete this quest.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Defeat_two_bosses_or_elite_guards">Defeat two bosses or elite guards</h3><p dir="ltr">The three boss NPCs--Evil Homer, Witch Marge, and Krusty the Clown--spawn randomly in named locations each match, but you can also find Dober Man guards near the KBBL Radio Towers. You can also spawn Dober Man guards by pressing the big red button on the desk in Burns Manor. Defeat two of them to complete the quest.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Raise_the_flag_at_Kamp_Krusty">Raise the flag at Kamp Krusty</h3><p dir="ltr">There's a control point at Kamp Krusty that's been graced with a Camp Bart flag. Capture it to complete the quest.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Secure_KBBL_Radio_Towers_two_times">Secure KBBL Radio Towers two times</h3><p dir="ltr">These radio towers are serving at the storm forecast towers this season. Defeat the Dober Man guards and deliver the keycard they dropped to the radio tower for a weather forecast. Do this twice to complete the quest.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Damage_opponents_with_Mr__Blasty__1_000_points_of_damage_">Damage opponents with Mr. Blasty (1,000 points of damage)</h3><p dir="ltr">Mr. Blasty is a new revolver in the loot pool this season, which drops from all normal sources of loot. You just need to shoot your enemies with it--bosses and other NPC enemies count for this.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Damage_Dober_Men__300_points_of_damage_">Damage Dober Men (300 points of damage)</h3><p dir="ltr">The Dober Man guards can be found at KBBL Radio Towers, and in Burns Manor if you press the red button on the desk in Burns' office.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Search_Mr__Burns_Mystery_Boxes">Search Mr. Burns Mystery Boxes</h3><p dir="ltr">Instead of normal blue chests, Simpsons season has added these question mark-covered boxes with enhanced loot. Search two of them to complete the quest.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Travel_distance_while_sprinting_under_the_effects_of_Super_Squishee">Travel distance while sprinting under the effects of Super Squishee</h3><p dir="ltr">Drinking a Super Squishee drink, which can be purchased from any Qwik-E-Mart, gives you unlimited sprint, low gravity, and fast sprint for a limited time. Sprint for 250 meters while under that effect to complete the quest. You'll need to stay on the ground for this one, though, as distance traveled in the air doesn't count.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Use_the_Zero_Point_dash_four_times_after_consuming_a_Blinky_Fish">Use the Zero Point dash four times after consuming a Blinky Fish</h3><p dir="ltr">Eating a Blinky fish will give you a dash ability for a short time. Just hit the jump button while you're in the air to dash in any direction--the quest will complete after you've dashed four times.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Complete_a_Lost_and_Found_quest">Complete a Lost and Found quest</h3><p dir="ltr">Complete any of the quests in the Lost and Found section above for this one.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">A weird invincibility exploit has apparently led to Epic Games disabling The Simpsons couch in Fortnite. That means players can't take a seat on the iconic piece of animated furniture currently. The timing is also unfortunate, since last night's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-simpsons-just-had-a-bananas-fortnite-couch-gag-and-poor-peely-didnt-fare-well/1100-6535878/">Simpsons episode featured an opening couch gag with Fortnite characters</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1985151319716376789" rel="nofollow ">official Fortnite Status account on X</a> posted about the couch issue at 8:05 PM ET on November 2, which is literally five minutes after The Simpsons started last night. The couch gag saw poor Peely meet an unfortunate fate and brought an unsettling new meaning to Fortnite skin. Meanwhile, an account named <a href="https://x.com/Relishh_/status/1985160615044767790" rel="nofollow ">Relishh on X</a> believes the couch was disabled in-game because the interaction could lead to invincibility for players.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1985151319716376789" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">🛋️ We’ve temporarily disabled the Simpsons Couch in Fortnite to fix an issue. <br>We’ll fix this and get you and the squad back on the couch to clip your own Simpsons intros as soon as we can.</p>  — Fortnite Status (@FortniteStatus) <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteStatus/status/1985151319716376789?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 3, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">The odd glitch reportedly required bringing Homer's car to the furniture, pickaxing the vehicle to zero health, then sitting on the couch. This would lead to an explosion and player's health being set to zero permanently. A squadmate then could revive the Fortnite player, making them invincible for the rest of the match.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-fortnite-simpsons-season/2900-7202/#1">The Simpsons season just went live in Fortnite</a> over the weekend. The collaboration has seen the entire island transformed into a Springfield map, featuring show locations like the nuclear power plant where Homer works, Moe's Tavern, and of course the home of the Simpsons with their couch. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-battle-pass-for-simpsons-season-all-skins-and-other-rewards/2900-7205/">The battle-royale game's Battle Pass</a> is all about the long-running animated show, too, and players can even unlock a <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Stupid_Sexy_Flanders" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Stupid Sexy Flanders</a> skin.</p><p>Of course, this won't be the last Fortnite collaboration. In fact, dataminers are suggesting that upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-dataminers-suggest-harry-potter-and-spongebob-collabs-could-be-next/1100-6535870/">crossovers could include SpongeBob SquarePants and Harry Potter</a>.</p>

            <p>A collection of Japanese publishers including Bandai Namco, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>, and others have come together as part of CODA (Content Overseas Distribution Association) to request Open AI cease training AI video generation tool Sora 2 on their collective creative works.</p>
<p>The statement to Open AI, <a href="https://coda-cj.jp/en/news/817/">made public via a statement published on the CODA website</a>, state that CODA, requests that CODA members works are not used for machine learning without prior permission, and that Open AI responds sincerely to claims and inquires from CODA members regarding copyright infringement related to Sora 2's output.</p>
<p>The statement also mentions Sora 2's opt out policy, that being that copyrighted works will be used by Sora 2 unless copyright owners specifically opt out themselves. Coda emphasises that this goes against Japanese copyright infringement laws in which permission is required beforehand. Coda also noted that: "there is no system allowing one to avoid liability for infringement through subsequent objections."</p>

            <p>It's been a long-running mystery why Rockstar's PlayStation-exclusive spy game Agent never materialised. It was announced with much fanfare in 2007, then proceeded to never show up again. But Rockstar co-founder Dan Houser has finally provided an adequate answer. Simply put, he and Rockstar couldn't find a way to make an open-world spy game work.</p>
<p>"We worked a lot on multiple iterations of an open-world spy game and it never came together," <a href="https://youtu.be/o3gbXDjNWyI?si=Sd4dXzJqaE1DVzWD">Houser told Lex Fridman in a rare and revealing podcast</a> interview. Houser said there were roughly five different iterations of Agent, including one set in the 1970s Cold War era and another set in the modern day.</p>
<p>But wherever and whenever Rockstar tried setting Agent, it couldn't make the idea of an open-world spy game work. "I don't think it works," Houser said. "I concluded - and I keep thinking about it; sometimes I lie in bed thinking about it - that what makes them really good as film stories makes them not work as video games.</p>

"You've got to go here to save the world, you've got to go there and stop that person being killed <em>and then </em>save the world... And an open-world game does have moments like that when the story comes together, but for large portions it's a lot looser and you're just hanging out and doing what you want."</p><p>What makes the Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption games work so well as open worlds is their in-between time - the time you have to cruise around, either on a horseback or in a car, listening to the radio or watching the world go by. In those games, you do your own thing. "That's why it works well being a criminal: because you fundamentally don't have anyone telling you what to do," Houser said.</p>
<p>The minute you put that into a spy game, however, you slacken the line of tension you need running through the spy framework to give missions jeopardy. "As a spy that doesn't really work because you have to be against the clock," Houser said. It's a fundamental issue - one Rockstar couldn't overcome. "For me, I question whether you can make a good open-world spy game," he said.</p>
<p>It's a question I'm sure Hitman developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> has had to reckon with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/007-first-light-james-bond-preview-hitman-uncharted-comparisons">while plotting blockbuster James Bond game 007: First Light</a>, though IOI's expertise is not in open worlds but sandbox mission approaches. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ex-rockstar-north-dev-talks-agent-abandoned-zombie-game-in-fascinating-new-blog">Agent apparently began life as a demo for the Grand Theft Auto 4 engine</a>, a Rockstar developer revealed a couple of years ago, and it showcased a hang glider and a car that turned into a submarine. A fuller, more linear game was then apparently green-lit, which would take us to classic spy movie locations such as the French Riviera, a Swiss ski resort, and Cairo. And the story would culminate with a big shootout with lasers in space. That idea was apparently in development for a year and a downhill skiing section was developed, but the game didn't get much further. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-has-abandoned-its-agent-trademark">Rockstar eventually abandoned its trademark for Agent in 2018</a>.</p>

			<p>Four years after the last Hyrule Warriors release, Omega Force, the studio behind Age of Calamity within Koei Tecmo, is set to release Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2 later this week on November 6, 2025.</p>



<p>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment sets players in the Imprisoning War, the events of which would lead to the story that unfolds in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>. Princess Zelda fights alongside King Rauru and the legendary Sages, each with unique fighting styles that players can utilize in this musou-style game.</p>



<p>The latest trailer showcases a bit more gameplay ahead of launch, like the kinds of combination attacks you can perform with other characters to decimate waves of enemies. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment – Unite Against the Demon King – Nintendo Switch 2" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WYpLBmy7xMw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>When Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity came out in 2020 on the Nintendo Switch, Wccftech's reviewer noted that one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hyrule-warriors-age-of-calamity-not-exactly-next-gen/">key drawbacks to the game was its poor framerate and performance</a>, writing, "<em>I genuinely had a minute where I was positive that the game's framerate had dropped into the single digits for a lengthy period of time. Playing co-op with two characters which both have heavy effects on their attacks is a recipe for a low framerate, and a low number of enemies being drawn on screen. It's a shame as co-op is still the best way to play any Warriors game, but the framerate sacrifice and loss of screen real-estate can make it feel more like a hassle than a fun way to play with friends.</em>"</p>



<p>Even though the game was able to <a href="https://wccftech.com/hyrule-warriors-age-of-calamity-3-million-copies/">sell over 3 million copies before the end of the year</a>, setting a new record for the Warriors series, its performance issues continued to be a refrain that harmed players' perception of the game.</p>



<p>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment, as a Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive, has the chance to shirk the bad performance narrative if it's able to launch mostly issue-free thanks to the power of the Switch 2 hardware. Of course, it's naive to think any major game will launch completely without bugs, but hopefully we won't see the kinds of major performance issues that held back Age of Calamity.</p>

Originally, plans seemed to call for it to debut in theaters before Zootopia 2, which launches on November 26.</p>



<p>In addition to its theatrical showing, the outlet adds that it should appear online beforehand.</p>



<p>“The trailer will drop online before November 21st, and then make its theatrical debut with Wicked For Good,” they said. “That releases a week before Zootopia 2. It could still play before Zootopia 2, but that won’t be its official cinema debut.”</p>



<p>Confirmed during <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/super-mario-galaxy-movie-announced-nintendo/">September’s Nintendo </a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/super-mario-galaxy-movie-announced-nintendo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">D</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/super-mario-galaxy-movie-announced-nintendo/">irect</a>, the Super Mario Galaxy Movie is the sequel to the highly successful The Super Mario Bros. Movie from 2023. The sequel will see Chris Pratt return as Mario, along with Anya Taylor-Joy as Princess Peach, Charlie Day as Luigi, Keegan-Michael Key as Toad, Jack Black as Bowser, and Kevin Michael Richardson as Kamek.</p>



<p>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie is scheduled to release in theaters on April 3, 2026. Its release will mark exactly three years to the day of the original’s launch.</p>

Nothing is confirmed right now, but GTA 5 actor Jay Klaitz--who played Lester--has now said he believes GTA 6 warrants a $100 price tag due to the content it's expected to offer.</p><p>"These games take so long to make. Years and years and years. It's not like they’ve just been hanging out, chilling and then just started doing the work last year. They finished GTA V and then started on GTA VI more or less immediately thereafter," <a href="https://www.escapistmagazine.com/jay-klaitz-exclusive-interview/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">he told The Escapist</a>. "This sh** takes forever and as we saw with GTA V the game will come out and there will be other versions, there will be downloadable content, it will be online. You're almost buying multiple games when you buy the one."</p>

<p>Klaitz said there is also a case to be made for making GTA 6 priced at a level where it can be "more accessible," but if it is $100, that would make sense to him.</p><p>"I would also like to see it made more accessible to more fans so I get that side of the argument too to make it affordable for folks. That's cool too. Maybe there's like a way to split the difference, but I share the sentiment that this game warrants that price tag. Yeah, I get that," he said.</p><p>Sales data for video games shows that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/people-are-ready-and-willing-to-pay-80-or-more-for-games-analyst-says/1100-6531571/" data-ref-id="1100-6531571">people are ready and willing to pay $80 or more for new games</a>, but it's still anyone's guess as to the price for GTA 6. Other experts believe <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/no-one-wants-a-100-gta-6-analysts-say/1100-6535494/" data-ref-id="1100-6535494">$70 is the right price. </a>At least one developer maintains that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/at-least-one-dev-hopes-gta-6-is-100/1100-6535457/" data-ref-id="1100-6535457">GTA 6 "deserves" to be $100</a> due to the size and scope of the project. Some have said the game does not need to be $100 because <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-doesnt-need-to-cost-100-because-gta-online-is-the-real-cash-cow-analyst-says/1100-6533731/" data-ref-id="1100-6533731">the game's expected online mode could be the real money-maker</a>.</p><p>The discussion around a possible $100 price for GTA 6 stems back to researcher Matthew Ball, who said in a memo in January 2025 that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-costing-as-much-as-100-could-help-video-game-industry-rebound-in-2025-analyst-says/1100-6528832/" data-ref-id="1100-6528832">"there is hope"</a> from people in gaming that GTA 6 could be priced between $80 and $100. He pointed out that, adjusted for inflation, GTA 4 was priced at $90 and GTA 5 was $83. Things like movie tickets, rent, subscription services like Spotify and Netflix, gas, groceries, and numerous other items have gone up in price while video games have remained at "record lows," Ball said. His own personal prediction is that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-costing-as-much-as-100-could-help-video-game-industry-rebound-in-2025-analyst-says/1100-6528832/" data-ref-id="1100-6528832">GTA 6 will be priced at $70.</a></p><p>Also in the interview, Klaitz said he would like to see a future GTA game take place outside America and possibly go somewhere like Dubai. "You could be in like a big city with huge skyscrapers but then you’re out in the desert one minute later. GTA: Dubai would give you a lot of fun environments and scenarios to play with and build a game on," he said, adding that other options could be the North Pole or Greenland.</p><p>Klaitz also talked about the possibility of a GTA TV series, saying it would be "really cool to try to pull off," adding that he would personally like to see it be a live-action show as opposed to animation.</p><p>"It would be tough to translate because it's that sandbox-type game and people can do whatever they want, wherever they want, whenever they want. It's hard to sort of refocus that into a straight narrative. But it would be fun to try," he said.</p><p>GTA 6 launches in May 2026 for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Following the reveal of <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-remake-halo-campaign-evolved-coming-to-pc-xbox-ps5-2026/">Halo: Campaign Evolved,</a> which confirmed that the longtime Xbox-exclusive series would be coming to PlayStation, GameStop posted a lengthy statement about it being the end of the console wars. The White House, of all entities, responded with an <a href="https://wccftech.com/gamestop-console-wars-over-halo-on-ps-white-house-trump-ai-spartan-armor/">AI-generated photo of Donald Trump in Spartan armor,</a> as if to depict him as the protagonist in Halo, Master Chief. Shortly after that, the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) used more Halo imagery <a href="https://x.com/DHSgov/status/1982819431894901043">to promote its own political agenda</a>, and has even followed it up with a <a href="https://x.com/DHSgov/status/1983604918239031569">similar post co-opting Lord of the Rings</a>. </p>



<p>And the DHS has made it clear that it will not stop there, which we know thanks to a report from <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/exclusive-white-142217261">independent journalist Alyssa Mercante</a>, who obtained a statement from the DHS after inquiring about its use of Halo imagery. At the time of her inquiry, the Lord of the Rings post had not been made, though it would go out shortly after this statement was delivered: </p>



<p>"<em>We will reach people where they are with content they can relate to and understand, whether that be Halo, Pokémon, Lord of The Rings, or any other medium. DHS remains laser focused on bringing awareness to the flood of crime that criminal illegal aliens have inflicted on our country. We aren’t slowing down. - DHS SPOX</em>"</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Microsoft has yet to make an official comment on the DHS using Halo to promote its own political agenda, nor has Amazon, which currently holds the rights to The Lord of the Rings, made a statement regarding whether the use of these images was approved. </p>



<p>Both Amazon and Microsoft, if they were so inclined, could have the images taken down, and while the lack of any statement doesn't explicitly confirm they agree with the posts in question and how they are being used, not saying anything at the very least admits that neither party will stop the DHS from continuing to use franchises like Halo and The Lord of the Rings in the future.</p>



<p>Individual Halo creators have made statements, however, with Marcus Lehto, a co-creator of Halo and the lead designer of the character Master Chief, told <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/halo-ice-developers-react">Game File</a> that "<em>It really makes me sick seeing Halo co-opted like this</em>."</p>



<p>Jaime Griesemer, a lead designer of the original Halo games at Bungie, added, "<em>Halo is a cultural icon and like anything with cultural capital, it is going to be used by politicians and brands and anyone else looking for relevancy</em>. <em>Usually, I take it as a compliment to Halo’s continuing legacy</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Using Halo imagery in a call to ‘destroy’ people because of their immigration status goes way too far, and ought to offend every Halo fan, regardless of political orientation</em>. <em>I personally find it despicable. The Flood are evil space zombie parasites and are not an allegory to any group of people.</em>"</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-game-awards-needs-a-puzzle-category.1342156/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Why is the old<em> Path of Exile</em> more popular than the sequel right now? How does co-op horror game Mimesis copy teammates’ voices? And what’s the real difference between a remake and remaster these days? It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. Digital Foundry has a new retro gaming podcast. It’s very good and you should <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqtLH0MOkgI">go check it out</a>.</p> <h2>Where are all the puzzle award categories for games?</h2> <p>It’s a question bubbled up across my feed <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/edmondtran.bsky.social/post/3m4pq7uz5yk2m">over the weekend</a>. The Game Awards has genre shout-outs for role-playing games, action games, and even family games, whatever that means (it’s usually shorthand for whatever Nintendo put out that year). But other popular genres like horror and even shooters don’t get any special consideration. With puzzle games, that short shrift feels especially acute, however.</p>

 <p>That’s because there are lots of great puzzle games lately that just don’t usually have a shot of winning Best Game or the indie categories they’re otherwise most often represented in, like “Games for Impact.” A puzzle category in 2025 would be full of strong contenders, including Blue Prince, <em>The Roottress are Dead</em>, and the recently launched <a href="https://kotaku.com/super-fantasy-kingdom-seance-blake-manor-dispatch-2000640533"><em>The Séance of Blake Manor</em></a>.</p>

 <p>Even Double Fine’s excellent <em>Keeper</em> might be more likely to get an honorary mention with a best puzzle category than awkwardly shoving it into best indie game (that happens to be published by the largest game publisher in the world).</p> <h2>Fans discuss whether to boycott <em>Hyper Light Drifter</em> dev’s next game after layoffs</h2> <p>“Hard to support devs when they can no longer see a cent from a game,” wrote one user on the Steam discussion page for Possessor(s), <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/as-players-debate-whether-to-purchase-possessor-s-after-heart-machine-lays-off-staff-a-week-before-launch-its-creators-and-publisher-respond-as-a-developer-who-is-slated-for-lay-off-please-buy-this-game/"><em>PC Gamer</em> reports</a>. Heart Machine has undergone multiple rounds of layoffs over the last year and put its Early Access action-RPG <em>Hyper Light Breaker</em> on ice. But publisher Devolver Digital said laid off staff are still eligible for revenue sharing from the game’s sales, and “As a developer who is slated for lay off—PLEASE BUY THIS GAME,” former narrative director Tyler Hutchinson told Steam players.</p>

 <p>This same issue has come up recently with news of <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-rockstar-games-union-busting-delay-2000640525">alleged union busting at Rockstar Games</a>. Some fans have immediately called for a boycott of <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>, despite no indication from any of the fired developers that that’s what they want to happen in response. Consumers can choose to spend their money however they want, but it’s usually good to check with the people you’re trying to support before launching a boycott in their name.</p>

 <h2>Remasters sell, but remakes sell better</h2> <p>That’s according to new research from Ampere Analysis as reported <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/consumers-spend-twice-as-much-on-video-game-remakes-than-remasters-according-to-research/">by<em> VGC</em></a>. The data firm counted 15 remakes and 27 remasters released between January 2024 and September 2025. It found that remakes generated 2.2 times the revenue of remasters, despite only being released half as often. Of course, the Ampere also counted games like <em>Oblivion Remastered</em> as, well, a remaster, even though it certainly veers more into the territory of a remake.</p>

 <h2><em>Peak</em> is getting a new Kashyyyk biome</h2>  <p>It’s called Roots. It’s full oe redwood trees. And it seems like there will be lots of spiders.</p> <h2><em>Mimesis</em> is a new co-op horror game that copies your voice</h2> <p>That’s one of the ways its enemies try to trick players into thinking they’re on the same team. It’s the latest crew-like to quietly have a big week on Steam after arriving in Early Access on October 27.</p>

 <p>“It’s pretty much a <em>Lethal Company</em> clone but with an LLM mimic feature that actually tries to make sense out of the voice clips it gets per session,” is how one user described it. There’s no generative-AI disclosure on Steam page so it’s unclear how the whole thing works.</p> <h2>The original <em>Path of Exile</em> has exploded on Steam again thanks to a new update</h2> <p>Patch 3.27 is called Keepers of the Flame and arrived on November 1. The action-RPG hit over 180,000 concurrents on Steam over the weekend after it went live. <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3869068">The massive update</a> focuses on an invasion of Breach Monster and includes tons of changes to skills, characters, and everything else in the game for what is essentially it’s next big season.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/stellar-blade-shift-up-crab-hand-small-penis-hateful-expression-apology-nikke-2000640487">The small penis pinching controversy, explained</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-goty-race-polymarket-clair-obscur-2000640468">Nobody thinks<em> Silksong</em> has a chance at GOTY&nbsp;</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-piracy-lawsuit-streamer-2000640438">Switch streamer owes Nintendo $17,500 after trying to troll them</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

              <p><span>Ever since choice-based games moved away from dialogue options in which you see exactly what your character will say before they say it in favor of little blurbs that try to sum up the general vibe of what you’re going to say or do before you watch it unfold on-screen, there’s been a loss of clarity between what we think we’re about to say and what we actually end up doing in video games. Part of me thinks this is just the consequence of a more cinematic approach to choice-based games, but poorly communicating what a player will do when they make a decision is a game design issue, and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dispatch-episode-1-2-review-aaron-paul-critical-role-2000639678"><i><span>Dispatch</span></i></a><span>, the first project from AdHoc Studio, made up of several ex-Telltale developers, is one of the latest games to fall victim to this incongruity between what the screen says your characters will do and what actually ends up happening after you choose it.</span></p> <p><span>Studios have found different ways to circumvent this danger. BioWare uses emotive icons to communicate an emotional intent with different options, or has even started adding small pop-up windows to lay out exactly what you’re going to do alongside your dialogue option. However, games like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-4-review-dreadwolf-rook-action-rpg-1851681954"><i><span>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</span></i></a> <span>have the advantage of pausing dialogue to let players consider their actions before moving forward. </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>, like many of the old Telltale games, including </span><i><span>The Walking Dead </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Tales from the Borderlands, </span></i><span>has timed dialogue choices to create a sense of urgency and keep a scene flowing. That has its advantages, but it also means you can’t include a bunch of clarifying pop-ups like other games might because players won’t have time to read them all thoroughly. That said, you can also just write dialogue options that are straightforward, rather than obfuscating what you’re actually going to do. Minor spoilers for </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>’s third</span> <span>episode follow:</span></p>

  <p><span>In episode three, protagonist Robert Robertson III is gathering his crew of ex-villain dispatchees to let them know that, by the end of their shift, at least one of them will be off the team and in the unemployment line. Exactly who that ends up being is the final decision of the episode, but before you make any such call, the group gathers in a meeting room, and Golem, a sentient pile of mud and dirt, knocks Robert to the floor as he enters the room. The player is given two options here: kick him out, or “give him the chair.” That could be interpreted as you offering him a chair to sit down on, but if you choose that option, that’s not what happens. Instead, Robert throws the chair at Golem, which lodges in his shoulder. Robert gives him a very apt talking-to about being aware of his surroundings, but the violence to get there is not clearly communicated in the options you’re given. It makes for a funny streaming moment, at least, but given Telltale’s history with these kinds of ambiguous dialogue options, folks aren’t thrilled to see these interactions return in </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>.</span></p>         <p><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>is halfway through its eight-episode run, and while I’m enjoying parts of it, I have been feeling a bit railroaded by its decisions thus far. I’m curious to see just how much impact those choices can make by the time the game ends later this month, but for now, it’s mostly just felt like I’ve been on the ride.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega and Monolith's classic survival horror game&nbsp;<em>Condemned: Criminal Origins&nbsp;</em>has been delisted from digital storefronts, and no reason has been given by the publisher as to why this has happened.</p>

<p>As spotted by Wario64 <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:knj5sw5al3sukl6vhkpi7637/post/3m4iwmggyjz2s" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">over on Bluesky</a>,&nbsp;<em>Condemned&nbsp;</em>was taken down from Steam and the Xbox storefront on Halloween. In case you're wondering, it's not available via GOG either, having not been added to that platform's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gog-preservation-program" rel="nofollow">excellent Preservation Program</a> yet.</p>

<p>Sega hasn't given any kind of official statement regarding the reason for the game's delisting, and since Monolith was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monolith-productions-and-more-reportedly-closed-by-wb-games" rel="nofollow">shuttered by parent company Warner Bros</a> back in February this year, the developer isn't available to comment on the situation either.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/condemned-criminal-origins-delisted-subway.jpg?itok=6ysfC0Qa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/condemned-criminal-origins-delisted-subway.jpg?itok=rRyYlHcW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Condemned: Criminal Origins&nbsp;</em>is no longer available on Steam or Xbox.</figcaption></figure><p>Released back in 2005,&nbsp;<em>Condemned: Criminal Origins&nbsp;</em>is a first-person survival horror game in which you play as Ethan Thomas, an FBI agent who's looking into a spate of serial killings, as well as the homeless population of his city suddenly becoming aggressive and violent.</p>

<p>The game features a mix of tense action-horror combat and exploration, detective mechanics, and mild survival elements. It's a real classic, although I suppose we now have to describe it as a "lost" classic, since it's not available for purchase anymore.</p>

<p>It's possible, of course, that Sega is gearing up to announce a remaster of the game, perhaps alongside <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nightdive-the-thing-remaster-tease" rel="nofollow">remaster</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nightdive-shares-update-on-system-shock-remake-release" rel="nofollow">remake</a> connoisseurs Nightdive. That could just be wishful thinking on my part, though; it's equally possible that the game has disappeared for some arcane rights-related reason.</p>

<p><em>Condemned: Criminal Origins&nbsp;</em>was followed up by a sequel,&nbsp;<em>Condemned 2: Bloodshot</em>, which, unlike its predecessor, was ported to the PlayStation 3 as well as releasing for the Xbox 360. This one, however, never appeared on PC.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/butchers-creek-condemned-delisting.jpg?itok=dLiKytsC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/butchers-creek-condemned-delisting.jpg?itok=m7wJQi3y 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Games like&nbsp;<em>Butcher's Creek&nbsp;</em>are carrying the&nbsp;<em>Condemned&nbsp;</em>torch.</figcaption></figure><p>Luckily, developers like&nbsp;<em>Dusk</em>'s David Szymanski are here to carry the torch, with titles like January's&nbsp;<em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2512560/Butchers_Creek/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Butcher's Creek</a>&nbsp;</em>attempting to pay homage to&nbsp;<em>Condemned&nbsp;</em>through similar tense first-person survival horror gameplay.</p>

<p>For the time being, sadly, it looks like you'll have to fall back on your physical copy of&nbsp;<em>Condemned: Criminal Origins&nbsp;</em>on Xbox 360 if you want to play it. Hopefully, a remaster or remake is announced soon.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/mac-mini-rival-running-windows-hits-40-off-christmas-showed-up-early-on-amazon-2000640785</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mac-mini-rival-running-windows-hits-40-off-christmas-showed-up-early-on-amazon.1342126/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple’s Mac Mini gets all the attention for compact computing but plenty of people need powerful Windows machines that don’t take up half a desk. Developers running Windows-only software, small business owners managing Microsoft ecosystems, content creators working with Adobe suites, and anyone tired of bulky tower PCs all face the same challenge: <strong>serious processing power in a tiny package that runs Windows natively</strong>.</p>
<p>The GMKtec M2 Pro S delivers exactly that: an Intel Core i7-1185G7 processor, 32GB RAM, and triple 4K display support, in a case smaller than most hardcover books. Amazon<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5306/"> has slashed this mini PC from $639 to $409, placing legitimate desktop-class performance within reach at a price</a> that makes sense.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5306/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Tiger Lake Performance in a Desktop Form Factor</h2>
<p>Intel’s Tiger Lake is its 11th generation of Core i7 mobile chips but GMKtec adapted <strong>the Core i7-1185G7 chip for use in desktop mini PCs with great results</strong>. This quad-core chip runs at a base frequency of 3.0 GHz and turbos up to 4.8 GHz on single-core workloads with all four cores sustaining 4.3 GHz under full load. Those frequencies matter: They’re a determinant of how snappy your applications respond, how well your video-editing software scrubs through timelines, and how many browser tabs you can have open before things start crawling. Eight threads through Hyper-Threading technology allow the processor to juggle multiple tasks simultaneously.</p>



<p>It’s handled by the Intel Iris Xe Graphics with 96 execution units that deliver performance well above older integrated graphics and give even some entry-level dedicated GPUs a run for their money. That matters from smooth <strong>desktop animations to hardware-accelerated video encoding, plus casual gaming</strong> and the ability to run design software without throwing hundreds of dollars at a separate graphics card</p>
<p>The 32GB of dual-channel DDR4 RAM comes properly configured from the factory, and gives both the CPU and GPU maximum memory bandwidth for the best performance. Dual-channel operation essentially doubles the speed at which data flows between RAM and processor compared to single-channel configurations, eliminating a common bottleneck that cripples many budget systems. The 1TB NVMe SSD connects via PCIe 3.0, delivering read speeds around 3,500 MB/s that make your entire system feel instantaneous compared to old SATA drives or mechanical hard drives.</p>



<p>The triple display capability transforms this mini PC into a serious multitasking powerhouse: <strong>Two HDMI 2.0 ports</strong> each output 4K resolution at 60Hz, while the <strong>USB-C port with DisplayPort</strong> alt mode handles the third 4K display at 60Hz. <strong>Running three 4K monitors simultaneously</strong> gives you over 24 million pixels of workspace, letting traders monitor multiple markets, developers keep code on one screen with documentation and testing on the others, or video editors spread their timeline across displays. The <strong>60Hz refresh rate</strong> ensures smooth motion and responsive cursor movement.</p>
<p>The GMKtec mini PC now costs $409, instead of $639, which makes it far cheaper than many standalone processors.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-dual-14-laptop-screen-extender-goes-for-peanuts-amazon-clears-out-stock-before-black-friday-2000640775</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Working on a single laptop screen is like trying to prepare a five-course meal in a studio apartment kitchen: constant minimizing of windows, lost tracking of tabs, and clicking back and forth between applications until your wrist hurts from all the mouse movement. There’s a great laptop screen extender on sale at Amazon that solves this by adding two full 14-inch displays that clip right onto your laptop, instantly creating a triple-screen setup: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5305/">Amazon has dropped it from $239 to $189 which makes this the cheapest route into serious screen real estate</a> without buying separate monitors and dealing with all that cabling.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5305/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Professional Display Quality in a Portable Package</h2>
<p>Each <strong>14-inch screen delivers full HD 1080P resolution through IPS panel technology</strong>&nbsp;which means you get consistent colors and clear text from almost any viewing angle. That’s where IPS panels make all the difference; they avoid that annoying color shift and brightness drop you get from cheaper TN screens just from tilting your head a little. The 1920×1080 resolution gives you enough pixel density to keep text sharp and images detailed without having that fuzzy look budget monitors often suffer from. <strong>Both displays boast blue light filtering technology</strong> that reduces eye strain during long work sessions. That means it cuts the harsh blue wavelengths that mess with your sleep cycle and tire your eyes. The <strong>anti-glare coating scatters ambient light</strong> instead of reflecting it straight back at you so you can actually see what’s on screen even when sitting near windows or under office lighting.</p>
<p>Built-in speakers mean you get audio from the extended displays without needing separate speakers or relying on your laptop’s often mediocre sound system. At just <strong>0.24 inches thick, these screens fold flat for transport</strong> and barely add bulk to your laptop bag.</p>



<p>The connectivity covers all the bases <strong>with two USB Type-C ports and one HDMI to USB-C port</strong>, which gives you flexibility in how you connect depending on what your laptop offers. Plug and play means exactly that-no driver downloads, no software installations, just connect the cables and your operating system immediately recognizes the extra displays. You can run both screens in extended mode to genuinely expand your workspace or switch into mirror mode for presentations where you want everyone seeing the same content. <strong>The triple-screen configuration legitimately increases your visible workspace by 200%</strong>, and lets you keep email open on one screen, your primary work on the laptop display and reference materials or chat windows on the third screen.</p>
<p>This extender <strong>works with Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems</strong> and supports game consoles like PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch to extend your game into multiple displays.</p>



<p>Studies regularly demonstrate that using a <strong>dual monitor setup increases productivity 20-42% over using a single screen</strong> and the gains are even higher when adding a third screen. This gain in productivity is realized by reduced window switching, better visibility for information, and the ability to retain tools, references, and communications visible all at once.</p>
<p>At $189, this extender is less than the cost of buying even one decent standalone portable monitor, yet you get two screens plus mounting hardware and all the necessary cables.</p>

            <p>The Simpsons has a long running couch gag bit, which plays out during the show's title sequence. Sometimes this sees America's yellow cartoon family taking part in a group dance or being abducted by aliens.  There are also times when the fivesome are surprised by some unexpected visitors already plopped down in front of the TV, leaving Homer and co with nowhere to park their own rears. </p>
<p>And, that is exactly what has happened in the latest episode of The Simpsons, this time with familiar faces from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> taking a seat at 742 Evergreen Terrace.</p>

<p>During the opening sequence of The Simpsons' season 37 episode 5 - known as Bad Boys... For Life? - Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie all arrive at home to find the likes of Fishstick there. Not a family to take this intrusion lightly, the Simpsons proceed to draw some weapons on the Fortnite lot and, errrr… let Peely know who is boss.</p>
<p>You can check out this Fortnite-flavoured The Simpsons couch gag below.</p>

<p>This isn't the first time The Simpsons has given a nod to video games. Last year, during season 35 (I still can't quite believe how long this show has been going for), we got a Mario Kart parody, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-simpsons-mario-kart-parody-is-the-closest-weve-got-to-a-hit-run-sequel">complete with a moustachiod Lisa and a Bowser-esque Nelson</a>.</p>
<p>As for the here and now, this opening is a timely addition to the show's lineup, with Fortnite itself hosting a The Simpsons season.</p>

              <p>Is it fair to call this the Big One? Of all the very many nerd conventions around the world, New York Comic Con certainly has claim to be one of the most defining events in the calendar. So of course&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em>&nbsp;ensured Minerablu’s excellent team of photographers were at the event, capturing the best cosplay that appeared on the show floor.</p> <p>As you might imagine, New York Comic Con attracts a host of big-name actors and creators, with 2025 seeing the likes of Hollywood stars like James McAvoy, Elliot Page, Martin Sheen and Ming-Na Wen, alongside writers George R.R. Martin and Joe Hill, voice actors Laura Bailey and Ashley Johnson, and all-time heroes like Ernie Hudson, Seth Green and Peter Weller. But we’re not here for autographs; we’re after the most impressive cosplay to walk through the exhibition hall doors. And as ever, we have a mighty-fine selection.</p>

 <p>More unusual costumes include a spot-on Bad Bunny, a Supergirl/Sabrina Carpenter crossover, and—er—quite the Jeff Goldblum. There’s also the finest Predator I’ve ever seen, and what I hope will become a permanent fixture of these galleries:&nbsp;<em>Demon Hunters</em>‘ Derpy.</p> <p>We’ll have a video of the event soon, but meanwhile click on to enjoy the pics.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lenovo-ideapad-with-office-365-and-1tb-selling-cheaper-than-no-name-laptops-amazon-clears-stock.1342096/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Most people just want a laptop that works without drama or over-engineering. Lenovo’s <em>IdeaPad</em> line is specifically designed with all the everyday scenarios in mind and peel away the extraneous gaming trim to focus on practical computing that normal people actually need. Right now, Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5304/">has dropped the Lenovo IdeaPad 1i down to $279 from its regular $399 price</a>, bundling in a full <strong>year of Microsoft 365</strong> alongside an impressive combination of 12GB RAM, 256GB SSD storage plus 1TB of cloud storage.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5304/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Real Computing Power for Everyday Tasks</h2>
<p>The 12GB of RAM in this configuration changes everything about how budget laptops traditionally perform. Most entry-level machines ship with 4GB that starts choking the moment you open more than a few browser tabs but 12GB gives you real breathing room for multitasking across applications. You can run Word documents (you can <a href="https://gizmodo.com/download/word">download Word for free here</a>) while researching in Chrome with YouTube playing in the background, all without that frustrating slowdown that makes budget laptops feel ancient. The <strong>Intel Celeron processor handles everyday computing tasks</strong> like email, web browsing, document editing and video streaming without breaking a sweat.</p>
<p>Storage comes in two forms that work together beautifully: <strong>fast local storage and massive cloud storage</strong>. The 256GB SSD provides fast local storage for your operating system, applications, and files you access regularly, delivering quick boot times and snappy performance that makes modern computers feel responsive. That is complemented by the massive 1TB of cloud storage through Microsoft 365 for backing up photos and everything else you want to keep safe but don’t need instant access to.</p>



<p>The<strong> 14-inch HD anti-glare display</strong> hits that sweet spot for portability and usability-large enough to handle comfortable work sessions without the bulk of a 15.6-inch model that barely fits into backpacks: That anti-glare coating does wonders when you work near a window or under strong overhead lighting and cuts down on the reflections that otherwise drive you to push brightness to uncomfortable levels. The <strong>screen manages to achieve an 87% active area ratio</strong>&nbsp;which means Lenovo has been able to keep the surrounding bezels quite minimal to provide more screen area in a compact form factor. <strong>Two Dolby Audio speakers</strong> flank the keyboard and stream robust sound surprisingly well for video calls, streaming shows, or background music while working.</p>
<p><strong>Battery life stretches to 11 hours on a full charge</strong> which is enough to get through a full workday or school day without hunting for outlets. WiFi-6 connectivity brings faster speeds and better performance in crowded wireless environments like apartments or dorm buildings where dozens of devices compete for bandwidth. The Flip to Start feature powers on the laptop the instant you open the lid and shaves off those annoying seconds of waiting while Smart Noise Cancelling automatically filters out background sounds during video calls.</p>
<p>Windows 11 is preinstalled and it performs all the modern computing tasks you’d want, from productivity software to entertainment apps. The bundled Microsoft 365 subscription includes all the Office applications you’d want, <strong>including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook, along with that 1TB of OneDrive cloud storage</strong> we mentioned earlier. This software package alone usually costs about $70 per year so getting a full year included with the laptop counts as genuine added value rather than marketing fluff.</p>
<p>At $279, this Lenovo undercuts generic no-name laptops that often cost $400 or more while delivering inferior build quality and zero brand support.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Forget AirPods, Beats Solo 4 Are Now Going for Cheaper Than No-Name Mid-Range Headphones]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/forget-airpods-beats-solo-4-are-now-going-for-cheaper-than-no-name-mid-range-headphones-2000640643</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/forget-airpods-beats-solo-4-are-now-going-for-cheaper-than-no-name-mid-range-headphones.1342093/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Beats, a brand by Apple, makes some of the best audio gear out there. It offers bold sound, and the headphones play nicely with a range of devices. If you’re after a solid pair of over-ear headphones that do not blow your budget, we’ve got good news.</p>
<p>Amazon is being generous with a <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5054/">35% discount on the Beats Solo 4 wireless headphones, which brings the price down to $129 from $199</a>. The discount applies to all color options, so you can pick one that matches your aesthetic the best.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5054/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Updated Drivers for Rich, Deep Sound</h2>
<p>The build is sleek yet sturdy, and the headphones are quite comfortable to wear. These feature an UltraPlush cushion that provides a snug fit without putting too much pressure on your ears, so it’s going to be easy to have them on for longer periods. The headband itself is foldable, meaning you can easily tuck the pair into a bag or backpack when not in use.</p>
<p>For powerful sound, there’s custom acoustic architecture with updated drivers. All the highs and lows are delivered well, across all genres. Listening to the Chester Bennington scream in Given Up or just winding down after a long day with a podcast, these headphones hold up well. Best of all, there’s Personalized Spatial Audio support with dynamic head tracking for a more immersive sound that follows you.</p>



<p>A built-in microphone makes calls clearer, and Class 1 Bluetooth makes sure you enjoy an extended range with fewer dropouts. If you want to enjoy audio just the way the creator intended, you can plug in using either the USB-C or 3.5mm audio cable. Battery-wise, you’re looking at up to 50 hours of listening time on a full charge, so you can go at least a couple of days without worrying about recharging them. And if you’re running low, Fast Fuel lets you top up with 5 hours of playback in just 10 minutes.</p>



<p><strong>These headphones work well with both Android and Apple devices</strong>, so compatibility won’t really be an issue. Pairing literally takes a few minutes, so you’ll be jamming to your favorite beats in no time.</p>
<p>All things considered, Beats Solo 4 headphones are a great option to consider if you’re after solid audio, reliable battery life, and a comfortable fit. These would normally run you around $200, but this deal lets you snag them for just $129. It might be wrapping up soon, though, so it’s better to get your orders in fast.</p>
